16-07-2020||News||The interplay between the pandemic and pollution | Analysis||Air quality was gradually gaining political salience in India over the last few years, but the coronavirus pandemic and the deepening economic recession may now change the speed, and possibly direction, of progress. As the country battles a public health crisis of staggering proportions, we must remind ourselves that we do not have the luxury of tackling air pollution at a later point. Air pollution is a risk factor that, based on current information, has a long-term mortality and morbidity burden greater than Covid-19, given the severity of pollution levels. It also increases the risk of infections such as Covid-19. Although restrictions during the lockdown mechanically led to temporary improvements in air quality, as economic activities resume, air pollution too will return to plague us.In the context of air quality management, our analysis reveals that the disruptions caused by the pandemic, and actions taken in response to these are likely to result in three sets of outcomes, each offering a different call to action: New opportunities to accelerate transitions, dilution of safeguards in the guise of incentivising economic recovery that need to be contested, and avenues for sustaining recent progress.The first set of outcomes present opportunities to set a new agenda, or provide an impetus to existing policy measures. These opportunities, when harnessed, will allow us to lock-in infrastructure or accelerate behavioural changes that are well-aligned with improved environmental and health outcomes, particularly air quality. We identified five such opportunities.One, providing increased, better-targeted subsidies as part of a social protection package to allow poor households to use LPG as their primary cooking fuel. This would be consistent with the three LPG cylinders included in the Garib Kalyan Yojana package. Two, sustaining the increased rate of shifting away from paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana due to labour constraints, and ensuring that the alternatives (for example, maize, cotton) are viable for farmers. Three, focusing the demand for vehicle scrappage policies towards the replacement of old, heavily polluting vehicles, especially trucks. Four, retiring old coal power plants so that newer or less polluting plants can meet a larger fraction of power demand, while likely easing the financial crisis in the sector. Finally, increased acceptability and experience with work-from-home and online meetings need to be sustained to reduce commute by private vehicles and taxis.In the second set lie potentially regressive outcomes, which need to be firmly contested. Some of these outcomes arise from the government’s efforts to dilute environmental safeguards, formally or informally, while citing the need for urgent economic recovery and improving the “ease of doing business”. For instance, the Draft Environmental Impact Assessment Notification 2020 that is currently under consideration will have massive implications for the country’s air quality. It dilutes the process to obtain environmental clearance, reduces the categories of projects and activities that will have to undergo impact-assessment scrutiny, curtails public consultation processes significantly, and proposes procedures to deal with violations that are legally untenable, and will effectively allow environmental offences to be condoned at very little or no cost to the violator. Another example is the government’s tacit support to power plants that have failed to comply with the 2015 emission standards by extending the deadlines. The health costs of their non-compliance can no longer be ignored, and the pandemic cannot become yet another basis for delaying compliance. Finally, the call for greater transparency in monitoring, inspection and enforcement data from the pollution control boards becomes more urgent to ensure dilutions in day-to-day regulation do not go unnoticed.In the third set are areas that we believe will not be directly impacted by the pandemic, but where we need to actively sustain the discourse, develop ideas and make progress on longer-term systemic improvements. The framework of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) needs continued strengthening, in particular on developing uniform processes for identifying non-attainment cities and to track inter-year air quality improvements.The first year of NCAP (2019-20) was hobbled by its modest budget. However, this year, the newly-allocated performance-based grants linked to air quality from the 15th Finance Commission (FC) substantially increases the resources available to the large cities — totalling Rs 4,400 crore to 42 urban agglomerations with million-plus populations. Effective utilisation of these funds needs significantly greater efforts by state and municipal governments to engage with civil society in prioritising actions. Further, the grants need to be sustained over the 2021-26 period of the 15th FC, and need to shift — together with NCAP — towards managing air quality at the regional, “airshed” level. At the same time, investments in sustainable infrastructure, and improvements in public services that will lead to cleaner air will need to be undertaken in parallel with developing the knowledge base on sources and air quality monitoring.The pandemic has appropriately brought about an urgent response, given the scale of its effects. As we set in motion recovery plans, we must remember that air pollution-linked deaths and disease must also be tackled with the urgency they deserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-interplay-between-the-pandemic-and-pollution/story-dk5zkame5pnMXskSLM6MQJ.html
16-07-2020||News||Is China waking up to the costs of its US policy? | Analysis||China is getting increasingly concerned at the “alarming” deterioration in relations between China and the United States (US). Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-owned Global Times, who has a huge following on social media, wrote on his Weibo account in May: “Honestly, America today won’t back off before crippling China!”Many Chinese academics, intellectuals and strategists have been cautioning the leadership, since 2017, that the assertive foreign policy it has adopted will lose China friends and add tension to the already severely strained Sino-US relationship, thereby adversely impacting China’s rise. They have been advocating a return to Deng Xiaoping’s policy of “lie low, bide your time”. This was also among the demands listed in the criticisms levelled against Chinese President Xi Jinping in the wake of the pandemic, and in letters to members of China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) — the country’s version of a Parliament — posted on the Internet in May.Either as a response to these voices, but probably to make overtures to Washington as the political establishment in the US gets busy with the presidential elections, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi made an important 3,144-character speech to a forum on China-US relations on July 9. Moderate in tone, the speech was an obvious plea to get relations back on track. Wang Yi said, “Alarmingly, China-US relations, one of the most consequential bilateral relationships in the world, is faced with the most severe challenge since the establishment of diplomatic ties”. In an apparent bid to dispel notions of China using force to achieve its goals, Wang Yi emphasised that “…aggression and expansion are never in the genes of the Chinese nation throughout its 5,000 years of history”. He explained: “Some friends in the US might have become suspicious or even wary of a growing China. I’d like to stress here again that China never intends to challenge or replace the US, or have full confrontation with the US”. Wang Yi was emphatic, though that “China and the US should not seek to remodel each other. Instead, they must work together to find ways of peaceful coexistence of different systems and civilisations”.China’s ministry of foreign affairs (MoFA) quoted Wang Yi as stating that “China just wants the relationship back on track and is willing to sit down and talk to make that happen”. He proposed creating three lists to frame a discussion to mend relations: One, to outline bilateral and global issues the two countries could work on together; two, to list issues on which they have disputes, but which can be resolved through dialogue; and three, for “tough” issues that are unlikely to be resolved “in the near future”. It quoted Wang Yi as saying that “the US must not seek to change China’s political system”.In late April 2020, retired major general Qiao Liang, co-author of the book, Unrestricted Warfare, and a hawk who is very popular in China and Wu Shicun, a high-level provincial cadre and president of China’s National Institute for South China Sea Studies, commented on China’s most sensitive issues through media outlets in Hong Kong. Qiao Liang hinted that the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland need not have a deadline, adding that Beijing should clarify this. Similarly, asserting that the South China Sea (SCS) is vitally important for China, Wu Shicun acknowledged that it is indispensable for US hegemony in the Western Pacific and hinted that China would not precipitate matters in the SCS. Taiwan and the SCS are both areas where Beijing has either resorted to, or hinted at the imminence, of military action.Separately, just days prior to Wang Yi’s speech, a government-managed web portal published an article by three Chinese researchers calling on Beijing to “actively manage” differences with Washington. It candidly stated that China is “the weaker side of the strategic competition of major powers” and “needs to carefully assess the risk of these confrontations dragging the two countries into conflict”. The article said maritime strategic competition in the West Pacific Ocean and SCS should be properly managed and a long-term strategic stalemate envisaged. Similarly, “China and the US should refrain from the urge to gather third-party forces to block and counterbalance each other”.Wang Yi’s speech excluded no subjects from discussion except China’s political system. It would have particularly addressed persons favouring continued ties with China. Whether it indicates the potential for a foreign policy course correction or attempts to reduce tensions while Beijing continues pursuing policies as before, is uncertain. Washington has interpreted it as the latter as indicated by its reaction to developments in Hong Kong and its naval exercises in the SCS. It nevertheless confirms that China is under immense strain and that pressure on President Xi Jinping, who also chairs the Central Leading Small Group on Foreign Affairs which oversees China’s foreign policy, is growing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/is-china-waking-up-to-the-costs-of-its-us-policy-analysis/story-31DBx6bykVpfXX091GVB3O.html
16-07-2020||City||Respite from heat likely soon, says IMD as National Capital Region suffers rainfall deficit||Noida: As the National Capital Region, including Noida and Ghaziabad, experiences a rainfall deficit, accompanied by hot and humid weather, the met department has predicted respite as the region is likely to see rainy days and drop in temperatures for the next four days.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), moderate to light rains are expected over NCR till July 20, during which the maximum temperature too would drop by three to four degrees Celsius.“The current monsoon line of trough, or the low-pressure line, is currently passing over North Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and is now moving back towards Delhi-NCR. This weather phenomenon will lead to rainfall over Delhi-NCR and western UP, including Noida and Ghaziabad. Some areas of Noida already saw light rains on Thursday. The region is expected to see light to moderate rains on Friday evening, followed by moderate rains towards Sunday and Monday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. He added that with the monsoon trough line -- that keeps oscillating around Delhi-NCR – now reverting, the wind directions changed from dry westerly to moist and cooler easterly. This is supposed to increase the humidity levels further, however, due to rains and drop in temperature, from the current range of 37 to 39 degrees to 35-46 degrees, is expected to bring much-needed respite from the heat.“The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to drop by three to four degrees over the next four days,” Srivastava added.According to the IMD’s records, Noida has seen about 94% and Ghaziabad has seen 72% deficit in rainfall since June 1. The records state that while Noida (in Gautam Budh Nagar district) should have seen 140.2 mm rainfall, it only received 9mm so far and while Ghaziabad should have received 140.2mm seasonal rains, it received 38.9mm, as of July 16. Meanwhile, Delhi, too, was deprived of rainfall this season so far, with only 80.1mm received so far against the expectation of 167.7mm, which is a 46% deficit. “The entire state of UP has however seen surplus rainfall of 263.6mm against expected 228.9mm, which is 15% surplus. It is western Uttar Pradesh which is suffering a low turnout,” said Srivastava.On Thursday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 37.8 degrees Celsius, same as a day earlier. The humidity has however increased, oscillating between 66 and 84% on Thursday against 55 and 84% on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/respite-from-heat-likely-soon-says-imd-as-national-capital-region-suffers-rainfall-deficit/story-hxETV11OSUPEOQrjr1ptsL.html
16-07-2020||City||Two held for selling illegal plots in Shahberi||The Bisrakh police on Thursday arrested two men wanted in connection with selling illegal plots to people in the Shahberi area where exactly two years ago, nine persons were killed when poorly constructed twin buildings collapsed.Ever since the tragedy, the Greater Noida authority and police department had cracked down on people selling farm land illegally and dealers who were selling illegal plots and houses. Several such cases had been registered in 2018 and 2019 and suspects were booked under the gangster act as well. The suspects arrested on Thursday were wanted in two such cases.“They had been absconding and had non-bailable warrants against them. They were finally arrested on Thursday from Ghaziabad,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.The suspects were identified as Hirendra Kant Sharma, a resident of Vijay Nagar, and Ashok Goswami, a resident of Muradnagar. Police officials said that they were tipped by informants on the wanted men’s whereabouts. The two, along with several associates, had sold many plots in the Shahberi area to unsuspecting people and then fled with the money before the victims realised they had been sold illegal land.Police said that hundreds of buyers had been duped and charge sheet has already been filed in the case.Sharma and Goswami were booked under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 288 (Negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings), 420 (cheating) , 467 (Forgery of valuable security, will, etc) , 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (Using as genuine a forged document etc) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the criminal law act. They were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-held-for-selling-illegal-plots-in-shahberi/story-lJj7Q3Hv8y1D5uVKlQRejM.html
16-07-2020||City||UP government relaxes norms for regularisation of extra construction||The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday rolled out a scheme that will allow for residents and commercial property owners to regularise any additional construction on the payment of certain fee, a process known as “compounding”. The scheme allows for several relaxations vis-à-vis building bye-laws.The scheme, if taken up by residents will provide much-needed revenue for the cash-strapped Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) that has seen its expenses increase during the time of the pandemic. Officials expect that it would be a major relief even if they are able to receive about ₹100 crore under the scheme against the pending ₹500 crore on account of compounding.Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) officials said that they scheme -- ‘self assessment compounding scheme – 2020’ -- will be adopted by July 21, as per the state government orders, and applications will be invited for six months up to January 21, 2021. Applications will be disposed of by April 21, 2021.“The scheme was last floated in 2002 when the authority received about ₹15 crore. At present, we have about ₹500 crore pending on account of compounding charges. At present, for group housing (2,000 square metre [sq m] and above) constructing more than 10% of the sanctioned floor area ratio (FAR) is compoundable. Now, it has been relaxed and doubled to 20% under the scheme,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, authority’s chief architect and town planner.Setbacks -- the minimum open space required around the structure of a building to allow for emergency services -- have been relaxed too. “For plotted development equal to or less than 300 sqm area, the side and rear setbacks are now 100% compoundable from existing 25% for side and 50% for rear setback. For plots over 300 sq m but less than 2,000 sq m, the front setback was 10% compoundable but under the scheme it is now 25%. Likewise, rear setback was 50% compoundable, which is now 75%. The side setback remains unchanged at 25%,” Shivpuri said.Officials said that the rates of compounding have also been reduced by almost half under the new scheme.“For residential plots, the rate presently charged for compounding of setbacks was 100% of circle rates. Now it has been reduced to 50% for setbacks. For group housing, the rate is still 100% of circle rates, but they have been provided with additional relaxations in terms of FAR. For commercial plots, the rates were 200% of the land cost and it has now been reduced to 100%. Likewise, for offices, it was earlier 150% and now reduced to 75% under the new scheme,” he added.The rates of compounding for economically weaker section and lower income groups was earlier 50% and now stands reduced to 37.5% under the new scheme, said officials.If, however, the developers do not apply for the scheme and continue with the construction, the vice chairperson of the authority shall constitute teams and initiate sealing, legal action and even demolition under the provisions of the UP Urban Planning & Development Act,1973.The directions further states that after the receipt of the application under the scheme, any other extra constructions, if not removed by the owner under a specific time period, shall be demolished by the authority under the provisions of law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-government-relaxes-norms-for-regularisation-of-extra-construction/story-8Mgcz3tW6d3QczvVOJUlpK.html
16-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad ramps up testing, targets 5,000 samples a day||The Ghaziabad health department is looking to focus its energies in carrying forward the momentum generated by the first round of special surveillance drive and has plans to double the testing rate in high incidence areas that have reported a majority of the Covid-19 cases of the district.According to the latest mapping summary of July 14, the district has 16 residential segments that have more than 100 cases. Together, these 16 segments account for 80.27% of all cases reported from the district so far.“We are aiming to double the testing with the help of antigen test kits and ultimately aim to test 5,000 people per day. We have considerably improved our different systems and also focussing on enhancing testing capabilities. With more teams added, we are sure that we will be able to achieve 5000 tests per day. I have directed the health department to gear up for enhancing testing. When small districts like Baghpat can achieve 1500 tests, we will surely achieve 5000 tests per day,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.Health department officials said that their focus is primarily on increasing rapid antigen testing as the city has received 24,000 more antigen test kits. They added that they have roped in 10 more lab technicians and formed four more teams for testing, which will take the total number of teams deployed now to 16.“Each of the 16 teams will be able to conduct 200 tests per day. But there are areas — like Indirapuram and Vaishali — where people are not coming out in large numbers and our teams sit idle. We conduct about 70 tests on an average daily in Indirapuram and around 20-30 tests per day in Vaishali. The turnout of residents here is low despite both the areas featuring in the lst of high incidence localities. At booths in IMS, Dasna and MMG Hospital, we conduct about 100 and 350 tests daily, respectively, on average,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of teh district.At other places — like Loni, Dasna, Muradnagar, Modinagar and Bhojpur — around 100 tests each are being conducted daily, said officials.Overall, the present average rate of sampling/testing is about 1,850-2,000 per day, which will soon be enhanced to about 3,200 per day. According to officials, the total sampling/testing (till July 15) has reached the mark of 55,538, which includes 22,785 antigen tests..“Apart from 16 teams, we have also received three new mobile vans which will be dispatched to containment zones for antigen testing. Our prime focus is on antigen testing as it provides quick results. With more resources available, we are aiming to double the testing to about 3500-3600 tests per day, a majority of which will be antigen tests. Our focus will be in high incidence residential segments and we will also enhance testing in rural areas as well,” Dr Gupta added.According to health department’s latest mapping figure of July 14 — when the district had 3,458 overall cases — ‘Karhera-2’ segment (comprising Indirapuram, Makanpur and Kanawani) had the highest number of 403 cases, followed by ‘Sahibabad-2’ (comprising Lajpat Nagar, Rajendra Nagar and Shalimar Garden ) with 261 cases and ‘Carte’ segment (comprising Kavi Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Nehru Nagar) with 238 cases.Out of the 16 high incident residential segments, 13 have reported more than 100 but below 200 cases. Two others have more than 200 but below 300 cases. Only one segment has reported over 400 cases.Ghaziabad has in total 25 residential segments that have 362 total containment zones.Residents said that low turnout of residents in areas like Indirapuram, Vishali etc is due to fear that they will have to get admitted to Covid facilities in case they test positive.“Unlike Delhi, the state of UP has not allowed home isolation for asymptomtic patients so far. In case it is done, more people will come out for getting tested. At present ,they fear that they will be confined in government facilities for at least 10 days or may foot huge bills in paid private Covid hospitals. We had written to the district officials as well as to the UP government [to allow home isolation] but no decision has been taken so far,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners.As per the new discharge guidelines issued by the state government on June 19, if a patient shows no symptoms, he/she can be discharged without undergoing any test on the tenth day from their date of admission. But, such patients will have to remain in home quarantine for seven days after discharge from hospital.On July 15, 179 new Covid-19 cases were added to Ghaziabad’s tally, which stood at 3765 overall cases. The district has so far seen 63 deaths, and has 1497 active cases. At least 2,205 patients have been discharged after treatment so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-ramps-up-testing-targets-5-000-samples-a-day/story-IaCx4AUO40ZbGDgo8JXprL.html
16-07-2020||Gurugram||Health department gets 10,000 antigen kits for new Large Outbreak Areas||The Gurugram administration has received 10,000 antigen detection kits that it will use to ramp up testing in the new Large Outbreak Areas(LoR)s, where Covid-19 clusters are gradually emerging.More than 27,000 antigen tests have been conducted in the city since June 24, out of which more than 750 have tested positive.Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, said, “At least 27,077 tests have been done in the city, out of which 761 have tested positive for Covid-19. The total positivity rate with antigen kits has been 2.81%. On Thursday, 1,444 antigen detection kits were used, out of which 47 cases tested positive. Around 10,000 additional kits have been received to conduct tests in the new LoRs where cases are increasing.”The district administration on Wednesday had identified nine Large Outbreak Regions (LORs) of the city, which will be put under a 13-day lockdown starting Wednesday till July 28. Intensive contact tracing and rapid antigen testing camps will be conducted in these LoRs to curb the SARS-CoV-2 virus from spreading.As per the government order, a LOR has a localized increase in Covid-19 cases within a defined geographical area in a village, a town or a city. The cases may or may not be epidemiologically linked. For operational purposes, a LOR is deemed to be present when there are 15 or more cases.The new identified LoRs are Rajiv Nagar, Om Nagar (Shivaji Nagar, Shanti Nagar), Nathupur (Ravinder Nath slum, Shamshan Ghat slum), Laxman Vihar (Dayanand Colony), H block Palam Vihar, Firoj Gandhi Colony (Madanpuri, Baldev Nagar), and Patel Nagar (Nai Basti and Arjun Nagar). It also includes Manesar (Harijan Basti and Lal Building Chowk), as well as Sohna (Thakurwada, Gujjar Ghati, Shiv Kund, Lohiyawada, Mangal Colony, Kayasthwada, Pathanwada, Tilpat Colony, Kohliwada, New Anaj Mandi and Baniyawada). Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram, said that better management would lead to better coverage in testing. “On an average, 1500 antigen tests are being conducted every day. At least 40 camps will be organised in the affected areas in the coming days. Besides LoRs, a testing camp will be organised in Pataudi which is a containment zone. More kits will be ordered in case we need them.”Antigen tests look for specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. The state health department has already placed an order of 100,000 kits with a South Korean company that has a manufacturing plant in Manesar. The new test highly specific (99.3% to 100%) — meaning a positive result on the test is a “true positive” and does not need any confirmatory test. The sensitivity is between 50.6% to 84% depending on the viral load, meaning those who test negative might still have the infection and are advised to go for a test through the more reliable RT-PCR method if they show symptoms of the disease.Meanwhile, Gurugram on Thursday saw 142 new Covid-19 cases being reported taking the total count of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus to 7,350. Out of the 7,350, at least 1,043 are active cases and 6,197 have recovered. On Thursday, 120 people recovered from the infectious disease. The Covid-19 death toll as on Thursday stood at 110 .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-gets-10-000-antigen-kits-for-new-large-outbreak-areas/story-B3dEYcRhHbJ4nPBGNeq77J.html
16-07-2020||Gurugram||100 register for Covaxin clinical trails in PGIMS Rohtak; 3 to receive doses by end of week||In ten days since PGIMS Rohtak began enrolling subjects for clinical trials of Covaxin — the country’s foremost vaccine candidate for Covid-19 — close to 100 individuals from Haryana have registered to be a part of the study. Officials at PGIMS Rohtak — one of the 12 locations in the country selected to execute clinical trials of the indigenous vaccine — said that 22 of these volunteers have already been screened for their medical history, and that at least three of them will receive a dose of the experimental vaccine by the weekend or early next week.Covaxin is an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, which is being developed by Bharat Biotech and the ICMR’s National Institute of Virology, Pune. It is one of the two Indian vaccine candidates that have received the Drug Controller General of India’s nod to proceed with the Phase 1 and Phase 2 human clinical trials. In Rohtak, the sample size for Phase 1 trials is expected to around 8 to 10 people, officials said. Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, who is a part of a three-member team leading the clinical trials at PGIMS, Rohtak, said, “The first batch of volunteers have been screened. Eight individuals have undergone rigorous medical scrutiny to check whether or not they have been previously infected with the virus, whether they suffer from any ailments of the liver, lungs, or kidneys, and to check if they have any history of other infectious diseases. Three of these volunteers, who were found eligible, will receive a dose of the vaccine, possibly by the weekend. Another 14 people were screened on Thursday and their biochemical reports are awaited.”Chaudhary explained that Phase 1 of human trials will involve a very small sample size, about 50 people from across four sites in the country, namely Delhi, Patna, Hyderabad and Rohtak. These sites have received the nod from the institutional ethics committees to carrying out the trials. “The subjects will be closely monitored for two hours after receiving the first vaccine, and will receive a second dose in two weeks if they do not show any adverse reactions, such as headaches, fever or vomiting,” he said.Dr Savita Verma, professor at the department of pharmacology at Rohtak PGIMS, and a principal investigator of the study, said, “We are taking all precautions as per the Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019. We will take two blood samples from the initial subjects, one at the end of 28 days and one at the end of 42 days. If we see a fourfold increase in antibodies after giving the vaccine, only then can we say that the vaccine has immunogenic properties. We will first establish safety of the current and future subjects before progressing to Phase 2 of the trials,” she added.In the first phase, subjects will be between the ages of 18 to 55, while in Phase 2, they will be between 12 and 60 years of age. For every four people that receives the vaccine, one subject will be given a placebo — in the form of a Japanese encephalitis vaccine. A total of 1,125 subjects are expected to participate in the trials nationally.Verma also explained that Covaxin is an “inactivated” vaccine, which relies on using samples of the SARS-Cov-2 virus that have been isolated at the National Institute of Virology, Pune. “The vaccines consist of virus particles which have been rendered inactive or are unable to replicate. However, the antigens will give a signal to the immune system to produce immunoglobulins or antibodies. This is different from the other Indian vaccine candidate, which does not contain any attenuated virus particles, and instead only relies on messenger RNA, or genetic code of the spike proteins of the virus, to signal our immune system.” Verma, Chaudhury, and a third co-investigator, who refused to be identified, declined to comment on whether these clinical trials will be completed by August 15. On July 2, ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargava had instructed the 12 trial sites (including PGIMS Rohtak) to complete all clinical trials by August 15. “These things typically take time. We may be able to provide only some preliminary data by then, as some of the subjects should have produced antibodies by August 15,” Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/100-register-for-covaxin-clinical-trails-in-pgims-rohtak-3-to-receive-doses-by-end-of-week/story-x3HtHaaZww6TaYwLrqlazI.html
16-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram Police deploys 600 personnel in nine new LORs||The police have deployed 600 personnel in the nine new large outbreak regions (LORs) of the city, starting Thursday. Necessary precautions are being taken to ensure that police personnel do not get infected, while tents have been put up in these areas so that officers on duty can get adequate amount of rest during the afternoon, said officials on Thursday. With cases of coronavirus disease crossing the 7,000-mark, the district administration on Wednesday announced nine new LORs across the city and put them under lockdown till July 28. As per the order issued by the administration, the newly identified LORs include Rajiv Nagar, Om Nagar (Shivaji Nagar and Shanti Nagar), Nathupur (Ravinder Nath slum, Shamshan Ghat slum), Laxman Vihar ( Dayanand Colony), Block-H Palam Vihar, Feroz Gandhi Colony (Madanpuri, Baldev Nagar) and Patel Nagar (Nai Basti and Arjun Nagar).The list also includes Manesar (Harijan Basti and Lal Building Chowk) and Sohna (Thakurwada, Gujjar Ghati, Shiv Kund, Lohiyawada, Mangal Colony, Kayasthwada, Pathanwada, Tilpat Colony, Kohliwada, New Anaj Mandi and Baniyawada).Police officials said that 600 officials would posted across these nine new LORs, in addition to the 350 officers who are already posted in the existing ones. As per the district administration, a large outbreak region is defined as a geographical area which sees a localised surge in the number of infections, which may not be epidemiologically linked. For operational purposes while an LOR must have at least 15 cases of Covid-19, a containment zone should have at least five such cases. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that teams from the Covid cell of the city police are carrying out an intensive contact tracing exercise. Meanwhile, health department officials said rapid antigen detection tests will be carried out in these nine areas to stop the spread of the infection. “The police teams deployed in these areas have been instructed to check the movement of the residents and not to allow anyone to move without an emergency. They will maintain social distancing while dealing with public and will enforce the wearing of face masks among the residents,” Rao said.He added that for the purpose of surveillance, the police will breakdown the existing Covid-19 hot spots in the city into smaller clusters. Rao also said the police department is coordinating with the health department to fight against the spread of the virus. For this purpose, they have remapped the worst-affected areas in the city for improved scrutiny and a new strategy, which involves restricting people’s movement and intensification of health screening, has been prepared. “The affected areas will have strict monitoring and action will be taken against people who are found to be loitering and moving around without wearing masks. The situation in these large outbreak areas will be similar to one existing during the first phase of the lockdown. We are requesting public to support the teams deployed for their safety and security and directions have been issued to ensure that proper checking is carried before the entry and exit of vehicles and residents,” said Rao.Police officials also said contact tracing is being carried out in full swing and more than 150 contacts are being traced out on a daily basis. The police have also increased the number of officials at the Covid cell responsible for contact tracing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-deploys-600-personnel-in-nine-new-lors/story-psc0mvQdnBqtqHFtik4B4K.html

To streamline the process, the department has also issued directions that all developers should share construction updates after every 15 days, said officials. The review meeting comes after home buyers in several projects raised the issue of delay in construction of these housing projects.According to government rules, an affordable housing project has to be completed within four years after approval is granted.Currently, Gurugram has 80 affordable housing projects out of which eight have already obtained occupation certificates while the rest are in various stages of construction. Notices were issued to 72 license holders, who were asked to share details and also update accordingly, said Ravi Sihag, senior town planner. “The meeting was attended by 45 developers and we will issue notices to the rest of them within a day or two. We have asked all developers to focus on completion within the stipulated time. They have also been asked to share updates regarding construction and we have also asked them to explain the reasons for delays,” said Sihag.The developers who were in the meeting with DTCP officials agreed to abide by the timelines but informed the department that migration of construction workers at a large scale had brought work to a standstill. “We are trying to get the labour force back but the lockdown has led to delays in construction. Also, the work was affected in the winter months last year when construction was banned due to pollution,” said a developer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Sihag said that the issue of labour migration did come up in the meeting but he has asked builders to take all measures for completing construction as most of the buyers in affordable projects were end users, who had bought the properties for personal use. In a related development, the enforcement wing of the DTCP carried out a demolition drive on the Golf Course extension road in which encroachment on green belts was removed extensively. On Wednesday, the team led by RS Bhath, the district town planner, cleared 15 acres of land which was being developed as unauthorised colonies. Bhath said unauthorised constructions were coming up in sector 34 and sector 72 and these were removed amid a lot of resistance by owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-developers-of-affordable-housings-to-share-work-updates-complete-project-in-time/story-h4mlA6RLjwNyj8S580kKvJ.html

The Congress is currently on a ventilator, unlikely to survive,” Chadha said in a press statement in reaction to the ongoing politics crisis in Rajasthan—a state ruled by the grand old party.Chadha, who is also a Delhi MLA, further said, “The AAP, on the other hand, is a party with fresh blood and invigorating force... It is unfortunate to see parties trying to trade MLAs in Rajasthan amid the pandemic.”Jitender Kochhar, the spokesperson of the Delhi unit of Congress, said, “The Congress has seen numerous ups and downs since Independence. The AAP is not a party which should try teaching politics and government to the Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/raghav-chadha-criticises-cong-s-power-tussle-says-party-has-no-future/story-XG3QinnzbOEUD26hnQsHMP.html

The foundation of the Delhi model is collectivity and teamwork,” he said.The video conference was attended by BJP MPs Ramesh Bidhuri, Meenakshi Lekhi, Manoj Tiwari, Gautam Gambhir and Hans Raj Hans and AAP’s Rajya Sabha MPs Sanjay Singh, ND Gupta and SK Gupta.BJP MPs raised the demand of waiving the fixed charges in electricity bills of commercial establishments and also sought at least ₹1 crore per parliamentary constituency for development work, especially for repair of roads after the monsoon, as the MP fund is being used by the Centre for managing Covid-19.South Delhi MP Bidhuri said, “We told the CM that there should be a proper check on the ration distribution as the Centre has decided that it should be given free of cost. The business community is facing a financial crisis. The government should waive the fixed electricity charges for commercial establishments. The municipal corporations don’t have funds. We have asked the government to give ₹1 crore per parliamentary constituency for repair work of roads after the monsoon.”East Delhi MP and former cricketer Gautam Gambhir tweeted, “Raised critical issues in VC with CM @ArvindKejriwal : 1) Inflated bills without taking meter readings 2) Waiver of electric charges for MSMEs 3) Any plan to bring back labour force 4) Encourage plasma donation by call & not ads 5) Approval for Kanti Nagar Isolation Centre.”The CM has been holding regular meetings with all elected representatives. “All the MPs unanimously said they are with the Delhi government and will take all possible steps to save the people of Delhi from this pandemic,” a statement issued by the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-holds-video-meet-with-delhi-mps-says-covid-19-fight-headed-for-success/story-9jwiK9uvoE3NV4Sf0Xc7QL.html

The education department in April had released term-end results for classes 9 and 11 digitally, after which students were supposed to appear in compartment examinations in May.The education department in its communication with the school heads said that reappear exams will be conducted as soon as the schools are allowed to open and if the students fail in the examination, they will not be entitled to further attend the higher class (Class 10 or Class 12).Out of 14,000 Class 11 students who appeared in the term-end exams, 560 students got compartments. Meanwhile 4,100 students of Class 9 have to reappear in the exams.Director school education, Chandigarh, Rubinderjeet Singh Brar, said, “We couldn’t conduct the reappear exams due to the lockdown. Now, conducting them will be our first priority when the schools reopen.”“It has been decided at the highest level that compartment students be given the option either to attend earlier classes or they can attend the next class till the time exams are not held,” said Brar.In the results declared in April this year, the students were also awarded 30 grace marks. In 2019, 55% students passed the Class 9 examinations, but this year the figure has jumped to 72.2%. For Class 11, 70.5% passed last year, while this year, 95.15% did.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/class-9-11-compartment-students-can-join-next-class-ut-education-dept/story-1JBejC6vU4PY9nNQT6chBP.html
16-07-2020||City||Minor Malaysian’s case transferred to another juvenile board||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Thursday transferred the case of a minor Malaysian, who was booked for attending the Tablighi Jamaat congregation allegedly in violation of visa norms, from one Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) to another due to lack of quorum.Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani directed the case against the 17-year-old Malaysian national be “forthwith” transferred from JJB-1 in Kingsway Camp to JJB-4 in Vishwas Nagar here to be dealt with expeditiously in accordance with the law.Appearing for the juvenile, his counsel S Hari Haran told the court that like other 121 Malaysian nationals, the juvenile was willing to got for plea bargaining but due to vacancy and lack of a quorum in JJB-1, he could not proceed. Quorum means the number of judges required to be present to make it a sufficient bench.He said the High Commission of Malaysia had made arrangements for 121 Malaysians to return to their country on Friday and only the juvenile will be left behind in India.Appearing for the Delhi government, its standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain said there might be a delay in the disposal of the case as there is only one Principal Magistrate in JJB-1 and there are two vacancies.He said the state had no objection if the minor is treated in the same way the other Malaysians were treated and that his application be decided expeditiously since only one juvenile appears to be left behind while 121 compatriots are on their way back to Malaysia.The counsel for the juvenile said while all others were freed after they pleaded guilty, the trial court had directed the charge sheet pertaining to his client (minor) should be filed in the JJB after he was found to be 17 years old. The teenager is currently in a hotel housed by the Malaysian High Commission. After appearing before the JJB through video conferencing, the parties came to know no order could be passed due to lack of quorum as there were vacancies in the board and the matter was adjourned for July 30, he said.He prayed either proceedings be dropped against the minor by the high court or it should order transfer of case from JJB-1 to JJB-4, where there is quorum.The Malaysian nationals were booked for attending Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin here allegedly in violation of visa norms, indulging in missionary activities illegally and violating government guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak.The trial court had earlier granted bail to the Malaysians. It had also allowed them to walk free on payment of a fine of Rs 7,000 each, after they accepted mild charges, under the plea bargain process, related to various violations, including visa norms while attending the congregation.The police had filed charge sheets against 956 foreigners from 36 countries, including 122 Mayalsians, for violating visa rules, violating government guidelines issued in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and regulations regarding Epidemic diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and prohibitory orders under section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/minor-malaysian-s-case-transferred-to-another-juvenile-board/story-vgARYadHHwcVOZRHM3ud5I.html

Officials have initiated proceedings to get the land vacated.“Only 12 acre of cultivable land was being leased annually by the Lakha gram panchayat and thus as per official records the land owned by the panchayat was also recorded as 12 acre. However, while checking the revenue records, it came to the fore that a huge chunk of land measuring 162.5 acres had been recorded as shamlat land.The said land belongs to the gram panchayat as per provisions of the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961.The land is meant to be used for the common benefit of the villagers. However, it had been illegally possessed by private parties for several years. PROCEEDINGS INITIATED AGAINST ENCROACHERS In order to free the land, around 350 people and the sarpanch Jasvir Singh were directed to initiate proceedings to remove the encroachers. To protect the interests of the gram panchayat, the sarpanch filed petitions under sections of the Punjab Village Common Lands and Regulation Act on July 9 before the court of Peeyush Chander Sharma, district development and panchayat officer- cum-collector, Ludhiana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jagraon-bdpo-unearths-162-5-acre-cultivable-land-in-lakha-gram-panchayat/story-nJx1Fxcilace4qGSOFEmnJ.html

Around 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage is generated in the city on a daily basis and is dumped in the open at 50 odd secondary dumping points across the city before being shifted to the main dumping site on Tajpur Road.Many of the secondary dump sites are situated near residential areas, including posh areas of Sarabha Nagar and Civil Lines. Residents say open dumping of garbage raises a stink and also encourages stray cattle and dogs to throng the areas. Satinder Singh, a shopkeeper at the scooter market in Model Town, says, “We have been flagging open dumping of garbage under the bus stand flyover for long time. The dump is situated near our market and it is difficult to work with foul stench emanating from the dump.”COMPACTORS AWAITED AT 22 SITESAn official, requesting anonymity, said the project was mooted in 2018 but the MC is yet to install compactors at 22 sites at different parts of the city in the first phase.“A financial bid has been initiated for finalising a contractor. But there are legal aspects to be kept in mind regarding finalising contractors for operating and maintaining the compactor sites. The MC is already in agreement with A2Z firm for lifting garbage,” the official said. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “I had also taken up the matter during the meeting of board of directors at Ludhiana Smart City Limited (LSCL) at Chandigarh on Wednesday as officials have been delaying the project. They have been told to expedite the project.”LIT AWAITS BS-VI VEHICLESEven after completing civil work at six of eight sites in west constituency, the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) has failed to make static compactors operational in absence of BS-VI vehicles which are required to lift garbage out of compactors and shift the same to the main dump site.LIT had commenced the project in May last year. LIT executive engineer Buta Ram said, “Civil work has been completed at six out of eight sites and compactors have also been installed at a few sites. The BS-VI vehicles have to be purchased from the GeM Portal. The vehicles are not available yet. It is expected that they will arrive in a week or so, following which the compactor sites will be handed over to the MC in around a month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/open-dumping-of-garbage-two-years-on-wrinkle-nosed-ludhiana-s-residents-await-static-compactors/story-J0WRz8GSh3pmnIPRawd9zH.html

Following the dispute, the councillor’s husband Rakesh Sharma and the residents of the ward staged a protest due to which the movement of traffic was obstructed for 15 minutes.Sharma is opposing the installation of water lines as it would carry water from the tube well installed in their ward to areas falling under Ward 4. Sharma said, “The residents of our ward are already facing problems due to lack of proper water supply. If the MC attaches the water lines of Ward 4 with the tubewell installed in our ward, then the residents of our ward will also face shortage of water.” Bawa said,”There was a missing link and a new line of around 300m had to be installed so that residents of my ward can get proper water supply. Tubewells installed across the city are inter-connected and the lines are being installed legally. The MC officials are installing the pipes.”Police personnel from Jodhewal police station and MC officials also reached the spot and tried to pacify the protesters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/councillors-face-off-over-installation-of-water-supply-lines-at-kakowal-road/story-VFFhVSA82dO0nWsD6AmgwM.html
16-07-2020||City||Illegal mining continues unabated in Kharar’s Majri Block||Illegal mining activity continues with impunity in Kharar’s Majri Block. The mining department on Thursday conducted a raid at Gocher village and found that 5000 cubic feet gravel was extracted from private lands in the area.A stone crusher was seized during the raid. On July 6, Majri Police had booked former director general of police (DGP) Paramdeep Singh Gill along with other 44 farmers of Saini Majra for allowing illegal mining on their land. They were booked under Section 21 of the Mine and Minerals (Regulations and Development) Act. The mining department had imposed a fine of Rs 11 crore on them.District mining officer Gurpreet Pal Singh Sandhu said that they had received a complaint about illegal mining being carried out at Gocher village and when he visited that area, he found that mining was also being carried out in adjoining areas. “We have prepared a report which will be sent to the tehsildar to find details of the miners, following which notices will be sent to them,” he said. He added that fines will be imposed i.e. ₹60 per tonne for sand and gravel and ₹10 per tonne for ordinary earth.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said that he has directed the officials to take strict action against illegal miners. Action will also be taken against those landowners whose land is being illegally mined, he said.In July last year, the mining department had imposed a penalty of Rs 52 crore on 193 land owners in three villages of Mohali—Mianpur Changar, Kubaheri and Abhipur— for allowing illegal mining on their land.INCREASING CASES Mohali has witnessed a sharp rise in illegal mining cases in the past four years. The district police had registered 24 cases of illegal mining in 2016, 67 in 2017 and 79 in 2018, 25 cases in 2019, and around 2 cases this year.The police department and administration claim that no illegal mining activity is being carried, but the illegal plundering of natural resources and the increasing number of cases along the rivulets is proving to be a major challenge for the authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-mining-continues-unabated-in-kharar-s-majri-block/story-eVc85corJpjDUFdMRjjkYP.html

Ten on each side are dedicated for vehicles using FASTag and only one lane on each side facilitates commuters making cash payments. A commuter, Saurabh Gupta, observed that there was a huge traffic jam at a time when people were avoiding commuting amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“I was stuck for nearly half-an-hour, despite having a FASTag. So claims that FASTag will ease traffic were bogus,” said Gupta.Sanjit Kumar, who is a professor at DAV College, Hoshiarpur, said many FASTag lanes were closed, which resulted in traffic jam. “Such snags have become routine,” Kumar said. Despite repeated attempts, Chanchal Rathore, manager of Ladhowal Toll Plaza did not respond.Ladhowal station house officer Balwinder Singh said the police were aware of the technical snag at the toll plaza and effort are on to streamline traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/commuters-stuck-for-half-an-hour-at-ladhowal-toll-plaza-jam/story-rNsIYXtYhN70nmc4BCLicJ.html

Rajveer Singh Bhatia, a student of DAV Public School, BRS Nagar, attained 79.8% marks despite suffering from vision impairment due to cone-rod dystrophy while Bhavarth Aggarwal, a student of Ryan International School, secured 91% marks despite suffering from a rare skin disease that has caused the fingers of his right hand to become conjoined. Bhatia has been suffering from the cone-rod dystrophy, which affects his vision, since birth. However, he has not let the disability get the better of him. Rajveer credits his parents and teachers for his stellar score and says he wants to become a chartered accountant. He completed his examination in four hours. He is also interested in politics and is fond of reading the news. “I am fond of reading the news, especially articles related to politics, and use my video-magnifier to read them easily.”Ask him how he studied for the boards, he says, “My school teachers provided me with notes and I used to take printouts on A-3 sheet to easily read the notes. I would study for four to five hours daily and study at night too. The sample papers on the CBSE website helped me practice. “ Bhatia scored 95 marks in social studies, 88 marks in English, 85 marks in Punjabi, 66 marks in science and 58 marks in mathematics.He also makes it a point to exercise everyday. “Due to poor vision, I am unable to participate in any sports at school, but at home, I do aerobics daily to keep myself physically fit,” said the resident of Shakti Nagar on Pakhowal Road.His father Jaspal Singh in a businessman and mother Harveen Kaur is a housewife.‘BHAVARTH IS A FIGHTER’Bhavarth was born with a rare skin disease epidermolysis bullosa simplex that causes the skin to be fragile and blister easily. However, Bhavarth had remained undeterred in the face of multiple challenges. He wants to one day become the CEO of Google. His short-term goal is to get admission at IIT Mumbai. He has started preparing for the entrance examination. Technology greatly interests him and he likes to keep a tab on the latest technology.The 15-year-old says, “I faced many challenges due to this disease but due to my parents’ support I was able to achieve this score. They have always supported me.”Not being able to use his right hand, he used his left hand to write the exams and completed them in the allotted three-hours. His father Mukesh Gupta is senior vice-president at Vardhman Special Steel and mother Nidhi Gupta is a homemaker. His parents say that though Bhavarth faced many challenges he is a fighter and they have tried to instill in him the confidence to stand strong and face the world. His mother, Nidhi, said, “A lot can be attributed to the efforts to the teachers and staff of Ryan international School who made special provisions so that he could do his best.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cbse-class-10-results-defying-odds-two-disabled-ludhiana-students-shine-in-board-exams/story-dsBd0G7tS2nXww42OThZdL.html

16-07-2020||Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt why it cannot continue its lockdown foodgrain distribution scheme||The Delhi High Court on Thursday sought the response of the Delhi government on a plea seeking resumption of the scheme under which foodgrains was provided during Covid-19 lockdown to those not covered under the Public Distribution System (PDS).A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad issued notice to the city government seeking its stand on the plea, which also seeks resumption of the hunger relief centres for providing cooked meals to those in need. It also sought to know why it cannot extend the Mukhya Mantri Corona Sahayta Yojna (MMCSY) till the pandemic persists.In April 2020, the Delhi government under the Mukhya Mantri Corona Sahayta Yojna (MMCSY) set up the e-coupon system for giving rations to 10 lakh people, which was later extended to cover 30 lakh people not covered under the Public Distribution System (PDS covers 71.3 lakh people or 37% population of Delhi). On April 27, the Delhi high court had directed that ration must be given to all needy persons. Pursuant to these directions, the e-coupon scheme was extended for another month, till May 2020. Further based on orders of the high court, the government went beyond the quota of 30 lakhs for the MMCSY and kept the application system open. It then received 54 lakhs applications for e-coupons from people not covered under the PDS.”However, the government has not extended the scheme for a second time and therefore, people without ration cards are not being provided any foodgrains by the government,” the fresh plea says. Appearing for the Delhi government, additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain and additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal, told the court that the scheme was for the period when due to lockdown there was cessation of economic activity. They said that it was a “one-time” relief package and was discontinued after the lockdown was lifted.The court was hearing a plea filed by Delhi Rozi Roti Abhiyan Adhikaar seeking direction to the Delhi government to continue accepting e-coupon applications under the MMCSY scheme and to continue operating kiosks and help desks facilitating them.The application has contended that the government’s discontinuance of the scheme of distribution of foodgrain to non-ration card holders (non-PDS), despite the national disaster declaration still being in force and despite no measure of normalcy having returned in the country or the state, was a violation of the right to food and right to life of lakhs of people of Delhi.The NGO has also said in its application that the Centre has extended till November its Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY) under which existing ration card holders will be provided additional 5 kgs of grains per person and 1 kg of pulse per household free of cost on account of the continuing economic distress among people. The matter would be now heard on August 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-asks-delhi-govt-why-it-cannot-continue-its-lockdown-foodgrain-distribution-scheme/story-P4UXDW3IqSaSei0D5WtBKK.html

From 630 cases on June 15, the number had risen 85% to 1,170 till July 16 (Thursday) or 540 cases in a month. State government says that the source of infection of nearly 15% of these cases is unclear. Since relaxation was announced in the nationwide lockdown on May 19, 840 covid-19 cases have been reported in Amritsar and most of them do not have any recent foreign travel history. “These community transmission patients were tested in flu corners after they showed symptoms of the disease. The source of infection of most of the cases could not be traced yet, but the health department and district administration are working hard to contain the further spread of the infection,” said assistant civil surgeon Dr Amarjit Singh. “People of the district are mainly responsible for the increase in community transmission cases as most are roaming in markets without precautionary measures and are not following social distancing norms,” he said, adding, “We are testing over 800 people from the district, daily, at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Amritsar. However, there is reluctance to be tested, as people fear hospitalisation.”State covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “As per the data analysed by the state government, the source of infection of nearly 15% of covid-19 cases in Amritsar, from June 23 to date, is still unclear. We cannot say that the community transmission stage has started in Punjab and we are working to trace their contacts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-cases-up-85-over-past-month-in-amritsar-to-1-170/story-tXSAC07k12ihbkWDCBMVBN.html

16-07-2020||Chandigarh||No 7-day quarantine now in special rooms for PGIMER staff on Covid-19 duty||Healthcare workers at high-risk Covid-19 treatment zones at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) can now go home after duty instead of mandatorily quarantining for seven days in specially allotted accommodation. They will have to report back for duty when required, hospital authorities have said.Duty hours were also changed with nurses expected to work for longer periods than perviously scheduled.Dr Jagat Ram, director PGIMER, said the decision was taken after consultations with other institutes following similar rules.Employees and some nurses are not too happy, saying home quarantining was not feasible as people were living in rented houses. Accommodation available on case basisDr Jagat Ram, however, clarified that the “service of private accommodation will be available to workers on demand and case per case basis as well. We are not denying accommodation for the employees who live in congested areas and have high-risk people back at home. Still, we have advised that those who will choose a home facility should follow all the safety norms,” Dr Ram clarified.The nursing association has shot off a letter to the institute’s administration, it has been learnt.“Home quarantine is not practicable in the current situation as most of the people are staying in rented houses with their families. The floor plan of most of the residential houses in and around Chandigarh is not in compliance with home quarantine policies. Also, there is a threat to the security of the staff because of social stigma and there is a chance to get isolated by the society and face stress to evacuate rented accommodations,” the letter reads.Change in Covid-19 dutiesIt was also learnt that PGIMER staffers on Covid-19 duty were expected to work longer hours and for more days. Nurses will work for 10 days at a stretch in Covid-19 zones with duties rotating between three shifts: Morning, evening and night. Earlier only seven days of Covid-19 duty was allowed.Those completing duty can take five days off, which will be deducted from their monthly quota of nine days off. After 15 days (including workdays and five-day leave) nurses will be posted in non Covid-19 areas for a period of 15 days, including four days of leave. So, all in all, they will be working for 21 days with nine days off, similar to their previous working schedule.Doctors will be given just two days of leave after seven days of Covid-19 duty, which means they have to report back at work on the 10th day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-7-day-quarantine-now-in-special-rooms-for-pgimer-staff-on-covid-19-duty/story-F2wXSleHGuxtooxF9dO36M.html
16-07-2020||Kolkata||Landmark movement of goods between Bengal to north-east India via Bangladesh flagged off||Marking a new landmark in maritime relations between India and Bangladesh, union shipping minister Mansukh Mandaviya virtually flagged off the first trial movement of container ships from Kolkata Port to Agartala in Tripura via Chittagong port in Bangladesh on Thursday.“Historical day in maritime relations of India and Bangladesh. North Eastern Region of India is now connected by sea-ports of Bangladesh! Digitally flagged off the first trial movement of container ship from Kolkata Port to Agartala & Assam via Chattogram Port of Bangladesh,” Mandaviya tweeted on Thursday.This will greatly benefit India’s north eastern states by cutting transportation time and cost through land routes to the north east. It takes over 1,200 km for goods to reach from Bengal to reach to reach the north east. Access to the Chittagong port will cut down the distance by almost half, Bipab Deb, chief minister of Tripura had earlier stated.The two neighbouring countries signed an MOU on June 6, 2015 and an agreement on October 25, 2018. The standard operating procedure (SOP) on use of Chittagong and Mongla ports of Bangladesh was finalized in 2019.“The vessel carrying four transit containers loaded with TMT steel bars will be offloaded at the Chittagong Port. They goods would then be loaded on trailers. From the Chittagong Port the containers will travel through road and cover 200 km to reach Agartala,” said a spokesman of the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port in Kolkata, formerly known as Kolkata Port.Sarbananda Sonowal, Chief Minister of Assam and Biplab Deb, Chief Minister of Tripura have welcomed this.“A historic moment for Assam & #NE. Shorter cargo route through B’desh’s Chattogram & Mongla ports will boost trade & growth,” tweeted Sonowal.“It’s really a big achievement for the entire NE including Tripura,” tweeted Deb.A statement issued by the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port said that in future rice, wheat, pulses, steel and project cargo is expected to be transported to north east region using this multimodal route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/landmark-movement-of-goods-between-bengal-and-to-north-east-india-via-bangladesh-flagged-off/story-Cz6IhOW1d8GOzY7WxMTS6L.html
16-07-2020||Lucknow||UP cricket: From the days of Vizzy to the Raina, Bhuvi years||In the 86 years since the foundation of the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association in 1934, only about a dozen cricketers, including Pusapati Gajapathi Raju (Maharajkumar of Vizianagaram), from Uttar Pradesh have represented Team India. These cricketers include seven bowlers, three batsmen and three all-rounders.Maharajkumar of Vizianagaram played in the pre-Independence era in 1936. Thereafter, it took 49 years for another Uttar Pradesh cricketer to play for India in the post-Independence era. Gopal Sharma (5 Tests, 11 ODIs) was selected to play for India in 1985. Thereafter, Rudra Pratap Singh Sr (1986) played just two ODIs.In 1999, backed by his consistent showing in domestic cricket, Gyanendra Pandey got a chance to play in two ODIs against Pakistan. But the scenario changed in 2000 when Allahabad’s Mohd Kaif was chosen for Team India and played for six years. Kaif, who had a decent domestic career, played 13 Tests and 125 ODIs.Rudra Pratap Singh (2005) and Piyush Chawla (2006) were the next from Uttar Pradesh to knock on the doors of Team India. A left-arm medium pacer, Singh (14 Tests, 58 ODIs and 10 T20Is) played a key role in India’s title triumph in the inaugural edition of the ICC World Twenty20 in 2007, picking 12 wickets, including 4/11 against South Africa and 3/26 against Pakistan in the final.Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla (3 Tests, 25 ODIs and 7 T20Is) had a 10-year career with Team India, punctuated by periods of being in and out, after making his international debut at the age of just 17. In the 50-over format, he bagged 32 wickets in 25 matches with 4/25 being his best. Chawla was part of Team India when they won the World Cup in 2011.A tall and lively pacer from Ghaziabad, Sudeep Tyagi (4 ODIs, 1 T20I) came into the picture for a short period of three months from December 2009 to February 2010. He had a 10-wicket haul on debut in the Ranji Trophy against Odisha. His roaring success appeared to be a sign of things to come as he finished the Ranji Trophy season with 41 wickets, but he soon lost his accuracy.Suresh Raina, who will turn 34 in November, has been the most successful cricketer from Uttar Pradesh to play for Team India. He made his ODI debut in 2005 and scored a century in his first Test in 2010 in Sri Lanka. His last international match was in July 2018 when India lost to England by eight wickets at Leeds. Raina scored one run off four balls in that game.A left-handed batsman, Raina (18 Tests, 226 ODIs and 78 T20Is) emerged as a clean hitter of the ball during the 2004 Under-19 World Cup. Although he made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in 2005, Raina could cement his place in Team India only in 2008 and then went on to establish himself as one of India’s best limited-overs batsmen.An inmate of the government-run cricket hostel in Lucknow, Raina was the first Indian to score a T20I century and also reach the 1000-run mark in the format. His Test career also got off to a spectacular start with him scoring a debut hundred but he never became a permanent fixture in the longest format. He was also part of India’s ODI World Cup-winning team in 2011, but has been off the selectors’ radar in limited-overs cricket, too, off late.After Raina, Uttar Pradesh could not produce a batsman for Team India. Medium-pace bowler Praveen Kumar was one of the top Indian cricketers to have emerged from Uttar Pradesh and had a five-year international career till March 2012 when he played his last ODI against Pakistan at Dhaka. He was known for his great ability to swing the ball.He represented India in 6 Tests, 68 ODIs and 10 T20Is. Meerut’s Kumar was India’s highest wicket-taker with 15 scalps in the 4-0 whitewash inflicted by the hosts England in a Test series in 2011. He took 77 wickets in one-day internationals and his best came at the CB Series in Australia in 2007-08 when he bowled a match-winning spell against the hosts Australia.The emergence of Bhuvneshwar Kumar (21 Tests, 114 ODIs and 43 T20Is so far) in 2013 confirmed that there is something special for the swing bowlers in the soil of Meerut. Now, 30 plus, Kumar has managed to perform quite decently in his brief career so far.Kumar, the first bowler to get Sachin Tendulkar out for a first ball duck in a Ranji Trophy game at Hyderabad, started his international career with a bang, bowling out Pakistan’s Nasir Jamshed with his first ODI delivery. A master of swing bowling, Kumar’s cricketing commonsense stand out.UP’s first-ever chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav (2017) has been the latest face from the state in Team India. Yadav (6 Tests, 60 ODIs and 21 T20Is so far) drew everyone’s attention with a successful outing, including a hat-trick in the Under-19 World Cup. He formed a potent spin attack with leggie Yuzvendra Chahal in limited overs cricket.“Winning is very important in the domestic circuit. That’s the only way to make it to Team India. Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association has provided top class infrastructure and facilities for our cricketers. It’s the responsibility of the cricketers to make full use of those facilities to come good at the top level,” said former UP captain Gyanendra Pandey, one of the most successful coaches in the history of the state.“Junior cricketers from the state have been doing well and getting good opportunities to play for India and winning trophies for the state. I feel our senior cricketers should take some inspiration from the juniors to win in the domestic circuit,” added Pandey, who guided Central Zone to the runners-up position in the Deodhar Trophy as coach in 2005.He, however, said that UP’s maiden Ranji Trophy win in 2005-06 season brought a drastic change in the perception among national selectors about the state’s cricketers. “This change was possible only because we won the trophy. Performance in the IPL has been a big factor and our younger generation should look for those with ability like Suresh Raina, one of the best T20 players in the world.”Pandey, who recently finished his stint as junior national selector, said the performances of Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Kuldeep Yadav at the international level, as well as in the IPL, were great. “Our present lot of senior cricketers should take inspiration from them. Dil laga kar khelna padega aur jitna padega (We need to play with passion and win),” he said.He, however, said that UP had no dearth of talent, but the team need consistency. “We have talented young cricketers like Priyam Garg, Rinku Singh, Mohsin, Akshdeep, Yash Dayal and many more, and they have the opportunity to make it to Team India in near future, if they are really consistent with their performances,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-cricket-from-the-days-of-vizzy-to-the-raina-bhuvi-years/story-hlIG4bzBg88I4eqZRoTjKP.html

16-07-2020||Education||Student lives matter: DU students say no to exams amid Covid-19||The University Grants Commission (UGC) recently laid down new guidelines recommending universities to conduct the final year examinations for higher education, latest by this September. But since the commission has left the decision of the mode of conduct of examination – offline (pen and paper) or online (open book exam; OBE) or a blend of both – on the decision of the respective varsities, the students at Delhi University are agitated due to DU’s visible preference for OBE exams. Earlier, UGC had recommended all universities to call-off the exams, but soon after the revised guidelines came in, students have been taking to social media to express their angst. “DU has decided to postpone the exam yet again, and planning to conduct them in August now, but the recently conducted mock online exams was a flop show. The mock test was to give us a chance to get acquainted with the process of online, OBE exams. And it’s obvious that this is how DU plans to conduct exams later as well. But, the mock tests preceding the online exams were a failure. I joined the twitter trend against boycotting the final exams, #Studentslivesmatter and authorities must understand that,” says Shubham KR Jaiswal, a final year student of B Com (Prog) at Ramanujan College.DU’s decision to conduct online exams saw overnight vandalism on the campus with roadside signages, bus stops, etc getting spray painted with protest slogans. An anonymous rap video has is also being circulated on social media by student political parties. Utkarsh Singh, a final year student of Hindi (Hons) at Satyawati College, who is in Uttar Pradesh at present, says, “Though we are at home, we know about the vandalism on campus and feel it’s done with the right intention to ensure that our plea doesn’t fall on deaf ears. We didn’t get any online class throughout the lockdown, and were not even provided any study material! Many of us don’t have laptops, and now that monsoon has begun, many are facing power cuts as well... How do you expect us to give an online test then? I wasn’t able to even log in to the DU website to appear for the mock test. And if you talk about offline exams, then that’s more unbelievable! With Covid-19 cases increasing rapidly, how can I risk my health to travel from my village Amgaliyan and go back to Delhi to write an exam!” Students have complaint of experiencing anxiety and depression due to the constant changes in the status of examination mode and dates. Singh adds, “For students who choose to give offline exams in September, it’ll be so difficult to compete with students who would have given online OBE. Online exams are discriminatory in nature. In such circumstances, when the authorities aren’t helping us, what must we do to express our angst?” Calling the rap video that’s being widely circulated as relatable, students are registering their defiance to online exams and are questioning the validity of attempting delayed offline exams. “The rap video that’s circulating on social media is actually what we all our feeling at this point of time. Mock tests were a failure. Even if I choose to not to give online exams for now, I’ll have to give exams in pen and paper by September. What guarantee is there that things will become better by then? And that it will lead to delay in admissions to higher courses, since we won’t get our degree until then, is another issues. I can’t give online exams or wait till September to give offline exams, what do I do?” rues Aaditya Singh, a final year student of B Com (Prog) at School of Open Learning.Many students have started petitions on social media against online exams. “Twitter trends, petitions, rap videos, and long social media posts express our state of mind. Mock exams were a trailer of what a film the online exams are going to be — We were supposed to upload documents of 5 MB but the site wasn’t even accepting two pages of a few KB,” says Himanshi Pandey, a final year students of Hindi (Hons) at Miranda House, adding, “Many of my classmates got the access to the question paper too late to even get enough time to write. And sabse zyada problem thi documents scan karne me because saare documents ek saath upload krne ka option nahi tha. Toh humko individually saari photos click kar ke ek ek kar ke upload karni padi. How can these problems be resolved in a span of few days for final online exams? And offline exams are out of question as our parents won’t allow us to travel amid the pandemic. Our future is at stake!” Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/student-lives-matter-du-students-say-no-to-exams-amid-covid-19/story-YKeYzQrfuSYoaziFYxTrvM.html
16-07-2020||City||SKIMS under fire after dead Covid-19 patient’s family alleges ill treatment||The management of Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS-Soura) has come under sharp criticism over the way the body of a Covid-19 positive patient and her family were treated on Wednesday evening.A 65-year-old woman of Srinagar, who was admitted at SKIMS-Soura on July 8 after her Covid-19 test results came positive, succumbed to the disease on Wednesday evening.Her family alleged that they were made to wait for hours to take the body and were not provided any casket or help in the burial process. A video of the incident has gone viral on social media in which the family members are seen questioning the hospital authorities as to how they will be able to transport the body on an infirm and dirty stretcher.“After following SoPs and protocol and waiting for three hours, we were provided a half-broken dirty stretcher and no coffin. We were also told that no one will aid or guide the burial process and we should do it on our own,” said the deceased’s son Rameez Makhdoomi, a journalist.“Officials at the control room were insensitive, busy in their own chit chats and at this moment our patience broke all barriers and we lashed out at them,” he said.Finally, after the ordeal was witnessed by many on social media, the family was able to bury the body with help from relatives, friends and volunteers.The hospital administration said their mandate is to treat the patients and after any death the body is handed over to the district administration or health authorities so that the protocol is followed.Hospital officials said it was a delay on the part of the district administration and the health authorities. “When the patient in question expired, the same was conveyed to the district administration and health authorities by control room SKIMS, nodal officer as well as medical superintendent. Delay in receiving a team from concerned officials created anxiety among the patient’s attendants,” said medical superintendent of SKIMS Dr Farooq Jan in a statement.He said to tide over the crisis, SKIMS provided an ambulance in violation of established norms. “It was then when attendants started demanding a coffin and four personnel for carrying out the burial which is nowhere in the protocol for handling Covid-19 bodies as laid down by the ICMR. Instead the body has to be put in a designated bag and outer surface has to be decontaminated by sodium hypochlorite… Providing people for burial is not a mandate of SKIMS,” he said.Calls to Kashmir’s director health Sameer Mattoo yielded no response.People have castigated the way SKIMS handled the situation.“If two sons have to wait for hours with the body of their mother outside the hospital while officials are busy blaming each other on who gets the coffin, what can be more inhumane than that? Sheer mismanagement displayed at SKIMS at the cost of traumatised families,” said Shuja ul Haq, president of the Kashmir Press Club.“SKIMS is the leading health institute of Kashmir… If the administration takes proper care, such things will not happen. It is not the first such case…SKIMS is the backbone of Kashmir in the medical field but they need to look into its management,” said Basharat Hussaini, an engineering student of Srinagar.“SKIMS is in pathetic shape from top to bottom. I would have not been able to empathise to all fellow Kashmiris be it a patient or an attendant, if I would have not faced it myself. Just a few days in SKIMS made me realise how bad our health infrastructure is and we can do nothing about it other than just share our thoughts on social platforms,” said Seema Nazir, a local.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/skims-under-fire-after-dead-covid-19-patient-s-family-alleges-ill-treatment/story-0MYxAbruAv0pjA0phHh5MN.html

Bindal’s known persons were recruited on the posts of law officer, deputy reporter and four Class-4 jobs.”He said that daughter of a close relative of Bindal was appointed as law officer, a post which was created against the rules of the legislative assembly.

Of the two persons recruited as junior translators, one is from Bindal’s constituency and the other is a relative of a BJP leader.Singha has demanded judicial investigation into the matter.

16-07-2020||Delhi||Delivery boys urge: Don’t be harsh with us amid the pandemic||As delivery boys run pillar to post delivering goods including clothes, groceries, etc they share their experiences of at times having to compromise on their dignity. Even before the pandemic struck, it wasn’t an easy life for these delivery boys. But now, since there is an increased stigma attached to those who turn Covid-19 positive, attitudes of people have changed drastically, and more so towards the delivery boys who are mostly outdoors, working amid the Covid-19 crisis, to ensure that we all get whatever essentials and luxury items we order from the comfort of our homes. ‘Some ask us to stay away’A delivery boy, Jagpal, from Delhi, says, “Log kehte hain Yahan phaikh do, Door raho, Sanitise kar do... bura toh lagta hai, but bimaari hi aisi hai ki kuch keh nahin sakte. Despite the couriers being sanitised all the time, we do get a lot of flak most of the times for nothing. We follow all the rules laid down by our company, but logon mein darr bahut hai.” ‘Dhoop mein khada kar dete hai’Santosh, a Gurugram-based delivery boy shares, “Kai baar log wait karate hain, phone hi nahin uthate hai. Sometimes people ask me to come upstairs at their door, but I ring the bell and say ‘Aap neeche aa jaiye, packet main tabhi deliver kar doonga’. And then they make us wait unnecessarily... itni der dhoop mein khada kar dete hai aur samah barbad hota hai vo alag. People should realise that we have to think about our safety, too. Don’t talk to us if you want to follow social distancing but don’t be harsh to us like this.” ‘Some bring sanitizers and make us use them in front of their eyes’Vinod Sahani, another Delhi-based delivery boy, says, “All these things worsened when a delivery boy was infected some time back. Kuch customers hote hain jo kehte hain koi dikkat nahin hain,balance paise side mein rakh dijiye hum utha lenge. Some say packet side bahar rakh dijiye aur amount pooch ke side mein ho jaate hain. Hum aa jate hain tab respect se ‘Thank you sir ya madam’ kehke. Par bura to tab lagta hai jab hume dekhte hi customers sanitiser leke aa jate hain, we tell them that we have sanitised our hands and our packets par unki satisfaction ke liye dobara unke saamne haath sanitize kar lete hain.”‘Bahane karte hain paani na dene ke liye’“It’s so hot so we mostly fill our water bottle when we leave, but at times we run out of water. But nowadays you ask anyone for water and koi na koi bahana bana dete hain. Sanitiser mango to fatafat laa denge,” rues Rajan, a Delhi-based delivery boy. He adds, “Every company today is sending out packets only after they get sanitised, phir bhi customer baar baar poochte hain ki sanitise kiya ya nahi, bolte hai ‘Distance rakho’ ya ‘Andar mat aao, bahar chod do baad me le lenge’.” ‘Achcha lagta hai jab izzat mile’Anupam, a Delhiite, who delivers apparels and groceries around the city, says, “We leave the order outside the gated colonies, and customers come to get it. We don’t go inside the gates as some RWAs have strict rules. Still some people are good and do offer me water, but I politely refuse saying mere paas bottle hai. Achcha lagta hai jab izzat mile... jo log jaanne lage hain unka vyavhar acha hai. Par har type ke log milte hai. Jahan roz jaane lage hain wahan jaan pehchaan ho gayi hai to log izzat karte hain ki hum roz unka saaman laate hai.

16-07-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka crosses 50,000 coronavirus cases as death toll in state mounts to 1,000||With 4,169 new Covid-19 cases being reported on Thursday, Karnataka crossed the 50,000 cases mark with its capital Bangalore continuing to witness an alarming spike in fresh cases inspite of an ongoing week long lockdown. The state now has recorded cumulatively 51,422 Covid-19 cases including 19,729 discharges and 1,032 have succumbed to the virus.Bangalore with 18,828 active cases now accounts for more than 60 percent of all active cases present in the state. A senior official of the government, who did not want to be identified, as he is not authorized to speak to media, said “We are surprised too at the continued growth trajectory (of cases) in Bangalore. After the imposition of lockdown we had expected it to decline.” Asked whether this was an indication of community spread, he said “It is too early to say that but I wouldn’t deny that there are some worrying signs.”Meanwhile the statement of B Sriramulu, the Health and Family Welfare minister on Wednesday that only ‘Only God can save us’ attracted criticism from the opposition parties. KPCC President D K Shivakumar hit out at the minister saying that ‘People are aghast at the statement made by him. If only God has to help the people of Karnataka why should BJP be in power? Let them resign immediately and president’s rule be imposed.’Sriramulu however claimed that his statement had been misinterpreted and it was not meant as an expression of helplessness but only as seeking divine help. Medical Education minister Dr K Sudhakar said that in the next 7-10 days testing capacity will be enhanced to conduct 40,000 to 50,000 tests per day. This is nearly double of the current testing rate of around 20,000 samples per day. Experts have said that enhanced testing, early identification, isolation and treatment are key to limiting the spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-crosses-50-000-coronavirus-cases-as-death-toll-in-state-mounts-to-1-000/story-IqavL8EoZ88TItsbMyXh3J.html

16-07-2020||City||HP govt monitors fresh landslides near Parechu river in Chinese territory||Fresh landslides on the course of Parechu river, a tributary of Spiti, across the international border in China occupied Tibetan Autonomous region has put the Himachal Pradesh government on alert.The breach in the glacial lake formed across the course of Parechu river in China had caused devastation along the banks of Sutlej in 2005. The lakes in the catchment of Parechu river are regularly being monitored by the Himachal government also keeping in mind the rainy season. The monitoring is done by the State Centre on Climate Change (SCCC) of Himachal Pradesh Council for Science Technology & Environment (HIMCOSTE) by using satellite data from April to October every year during the ablation season.Scientists have detected two fresh landslides in the periphery of Parechu Lake, however, there is no threat of lake breach. The Parechu lake, a depression along the Parechu river in the Tibetan Himalayas, was formed after a massive landslide in 2004. Spiti river further confluences with turbulent Sutlej river at Khab in Kinnaur district. A breach in the lake had caused flash floods in the Sutlej basin in 2005. SCCC joint member secretary Nishant Thakur said based on the satellite data for June, it has been observed that the accumulated water in the lake depression is flowing through the peripheral sides and with some on the upstream side. “The central part is comparatively free from any accumulation except a small portion on the downstream side. The inflow and the outflow seems to be normal,” he said.From the satellite imagery, the scientist found two landslides along the river course—one on the upstream side of the depression on the left bank and the second on the downstream side of the depression on the right bank of the Parechu river. The satellite imageries also detected water accumulation along the river course on the downstream side.“Landslide on the left bank on the upstream side also seems to be encroaching the river course, but no significant change in the river flow could be seen,” Thakur said.“Based on the satellite data interpretation, there seems to be no threat from the Parechu Lake. However, it needs to be regularly monitored till it freezes,” he added.The 2005 flashfloods caused by the breach in Parechu Lake had washed away bridges, 11 ropeways, and parts of the old Hindustan Tibet road, and several link roads. The damage was assessed to be worth ₹610 crore. However, no loss of life was reported. The lake again posed a threat in 2013 when the inflow into the lake increased suddenly. However, no breach occurred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hp-govt-monitors-fresh-landslides-near-parechu-river-in-chinese-territory/story-CPc6R4EgIor18kH9trOrBM.html

On an average, a thalassemia patient spends around Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 on medicines and treatment per month. The availability of the life-saving drug at government hospitals goes a long way in relieving the patients’ financial burden.As many as 300 thalassemia patients are enrolled with the health department. Due to the unavailability of the medicines, families are losing out on their savings, even as patients steadily lose hope of survival.Patients said essential drugs such as Asunra, Desferal and Rocaltrol have been unavailable since the coronavirus outbreak.‘CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO TAKE THE COMPLETE COURSE’One of the patients wrote, “I have been a thalassemia patient for around 25 years. I am undergoing treatment for the same at a charitable hospital. I need five vials of Desferal daily. As the medicines are very costly, I have not been able to afford to complete the daily course due to which my health is being compromised. I am dependent on my father, a shop keeper. It is difficult for him to spend approximately Rs 50,000 a month on my treatment and medicines. I hope some measure will be taken to provide these medicines as soon as possible.”The parent of a thalassemia patient, who did not wish to be named, said, “A minimum Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 is spent each month on treatment. Amid the pandemic, it is not possible to arrange so much money each month. To top it all these lifesaving drugs are not available at government hospitals.”A 30-year-old patient wrote, “I would like to draw your attention towards the non-availability of medicines such as Desferal, Rocaltrol and Defrijet. As I am a thalassemia patient, I need four vials of Desferal daily. My father has passed away and mother is a pensioner. It is very difficult for her to spend approximately Rs 55,000 each month on my treatment and medicines. I hope that some measure will be taken to provide these medicines as soon as possible.”Dr Bagga said blood transfusion officer at the civil hospital Dr Gurinderdeep Singh Grewa was dealing with the issue.Dr Grewal admitted that there was an initial hiccup in the availability of medicines. “But for the last one week medicines have been available,” he said.‘HEALTH DEPT TAKING US FOR A RIDE’However, the patients’ kin say patients registered with the department have not been informed of the availability of medicines.“The health department is taking us for a ride. If the medicine had been available instead of sitting in the civil surgeon’s office, we would be visiting the dispensary at ESI hospital to collect the medicine,” said an exasperated parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unavailability-of-medication-at-govt-hospital-leaves-thalassemia-patients-struggling-for-survival-in-ludhiana/story-D7zVjkQn65zNAMkPHV1ncM.html

Ramesh Iyer, Pune City Congress committee general secretary said, “I was in contact with the family in their trying times.

We tried at multiple places, but could not get a ventilator so finally took him to Sassoon where he was declared dead on Wednesday at 2 am. There was a queue even at Sassoon for ICU beds and three patients were in the queue. I even went on the website provided by the divisional commissioner’s office to check availability of ICU beds.

Till date, the state has recorded 34,427 Covid-19 cases and 1,000 deaths.“To control the spread of the disease, it is very important that the government identifies high-infection clusters and makes them local containment zones. For this to be possible, ramped up testing – using all available methods – is needed,” said the advisory.While on one hand the state government has enforced rigorous lockdown in containment zones after increasing their ambits, testing has also been increased from less than 200 per day in the first week of April to more than 11,000 per day at present.“We would be further increasing the number of tests. Lockdown have been imposed in five towns in north Bengal apart from more than containment areas,” said a senior official in the health department.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Wednesday that cases could spike further over the next two months as testing would be ramped. The positivity rate has also shot up over the past one month from 3.4% on June 17 to 5.3% on July 15.“The youth, local clubs and the community needs to be involved to maintain quality in community health care centres such as the ‘safe homes’. Local youth, NGOs and networking groups comprising former Covid-19 patients need to step in prevent ostracism,” said one of the members of the body.The government has set up around 106 safe houses with more than 6,000 beds where Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms, who do not have enough space in their own house, could be kept in quarantine without going to the hospitals. The GAB was formed by the Mamata Banerjee to advise her government on how to fight the crisis triggered by the viral outbreak. Swarup Sarkar, former regional director of WHO (World Health Organisation); Tom Frieden, ex-CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the US); Jishnu Das, economist, World Bank; and JVR Prasad Rao, a former union health secretary, are among the other experts. Members have met at elast 13 times through video conferencing.“The chief minister has already asked the local clubs to supervise that everybody wears masks, there is no gathering and no crowding in markets,” said a minister.The advisory body has also asked the government to periodically augment its policies on Covid-19 based on evolving needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/ramp-up-testing-and-identify-high-infection-clusters-advisory-body-tells-bengal-government/story-Iuc39fGYr0P7uK6uc0NCEL.html

Only one vice chancellor had attended the virtual conference with the governor who is also the chancellor of state universities.Dhankhar told reporters he will also ask the VCs, who were absent, about the academic problems being faced by students because of the outbreak of the disease.“I find there is tightening of this political cage in the education scenario in West Bengal,” he said, apparently referring to most VCs staying away from the meeting.“I wanted to fathom the problems the universities and colleges are facing by calling a virtual meeting of VCs which they opposed tooth and nail for the reasons known to all,” he said.Amid frequent run-ins with the governor, the West Bengal government recently amended the relevant rules relating to the powers of the governor as the chancellor of universities.he new rules have vastly reduced the governor’s role in the functioning of universities.Under the fresh set of rules, all communications between the governor and the universities have to be routed through the higher education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/wb-guv-says-education-system-in-state-politically-caged/story-GhKveMhgNM99OVNtaFwaGJ.html

Earlier in the day, Gehlot talked tough, accusing former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot of being directly involved in the alleged horse-trading with the opposition BJP to bring down his government.Ramesh Meena, who was among those Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) legislators who made the switch to Congress, said: “The chief minister should honestly tell how much money was paid to us when we joined Congress and left the the BSP in the last Congress government.” “He should reveal this if he is claiming that deals worth crores of rupees are happening. We were deceived and promised that our work will be done but that did not happen. But, we worked honestly after joining the Congress and played our role in the Opposition,” he said in a video released by Pilot’s spokesperson.He further alleged that Gehlot did not pay attention to their demands and maintained a dictatorial attitude.Another Congress rebel Murari Lal Meena in a video said, “Today, the way we were accused of corruption, it has shocked us. We are very sad. I would like to ask him (Gehlot) how much money we had taken when we came to the Congress from the BSP during the tenure of his previous government.

Amid the widespread transmission of coronavirus, students from various universities had been demanding that exams be cancelled. In a tweet, deputy chief minister of Delhi, Manish Sisodia announced: “In light of the major disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Delhi govt has decided to cancel all Delhi state university exams including final exams.”  In light of the major disruptions caused by the Coronavirus pandemic, Delhi govt has decided to cancel all Delhi state university exams including final exams https://t.co/g4SFLqaBQKFinal year is the time when students start applying for jobs or give exams for further studies, and were caught in the doldrums as there was no disclosure till now. We speak to some students from GGSIPU on how they think this decision will help them.Joshua Porter, a final year student of BJ(MC) at VIPS (Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies), feels that this decision has helped quash the uncertainty. “We were stuck in the middle since May, when the exams usually take place. We can now plan to apply for jobs or further studies with ease. There is no pressure,” he says. Aditya Kaushal, final year B.Tech student at MAIT (Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology) feels that the whole point of exams needs to be revised. “Companies and employers conduct their own interviews, so I don’t think that exams are a good metric to judge anyone’s capabilities. There is no point in conducting exams just for the sake of it,” he asserts.Md Shahbaz Alam, final year B.Tech student at BVCOE (Bharati Vidyapeeth’s College of Engineering) is of the opinion that either way, there would be some problems and some benefits. “Agar paper hota toh bhi kuch nuksaan hota, agar nahi hai tab bhi thoda nuksaan toh hoga. Offline exams would have posed the threat of contamination, whereas evaluation on past performance and internal exams robs students of a chance at scoring better. If a student scored less in internals due to any reason, then he/she has this chance of improving their overall percentage. But it is for the good that this decision was taken,” he says.As for the option of sitting for online exams, students unanimously agree that those come with their own set of problems. “DU conducted mock tests which turned out to be a failure,” says Projukta Chatterjee, a final year student of BJ(MC) at VIPS, adding, “I welcome this decision, but I would request the authorities to grade us on the basis of our past performance. I studied the whole year as no one knew it would come to this. But then there are students who have backlogs and weren’t quite as meritorious. So there should be fair grading taking these aspects in consideration.”Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/students-rejoice-as-delhi-government-cancels-all-state-university-exams/story-1LmV8gHSrA2hkJba4iGRPK.html

Those testing positive included at least six reputed medical practitioners.The terror of the coronavirus was witnessed in the town where the district is headquartered when a middle-aged town visited a medical store to purchase a medicine for his evident breathlessness and collapsed face-down. Onlookers stood frozen for a while and, upon regaining a semblance of composure, tried to resuscitate him by sprinkling water from a distance, fearing that he might be infected.Upon realising that it was too late they informed the police and health officials who reached the spot and kept a watch till the body was taken away in an ambulance. The identity of the man was not known. Health department officials said his sample will be collected before his last rites and sent for testing since shortness of breath is one of several Covid-19 symptoms.Meanwhile, the state was bracing for a 16-day complete lockdown, announced on Tuesday and to be effective from Thursday, which has been clamped in view of the unprecedented spurt in coronavirus cases over the last few weeks.Although 13,533 people have recovered so far across the state, 514 of them in the last 24 hours, the rate of recovery has of late not been able to keep pace with the rising cases.This has caused the state’s recovery rate to plunge to 67.08 per cent, a drop of more than 10 per cent in a fortnight.The number of samples tested after Tuesday was 10,052.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/covid-19-claims-14-more-lives-in-bihar-infection-tally-crosses-20-000/story-wSwfgw8cliJiFeSlK7U92K.html

The period also saw 21 deaths that took the toll to 36.July’s second week, however, has felt the maximum turmoil as the number of cases detected was double the cases discovered in the first week. While 566 cases were detected between July 1-7, 1,190 cases were reported between July 8-14.Besides, the positivity rate of the disease, which is the number of samples found positive out of the total samples tested, also increased in the period to 3.7%, thereby meaning that of the 100 samples tested during this period, an average of 3.7 people were found infected.The period also saw pandemic hitting almost every section of the society and even reached the corridors of power, infecting lawmakers, government officials, doctors, police personnel, journalists and others.The maximum spread of infection in this phase was felt in city and town areas as districts with a sizeable urban population remained the worst-affected.The top five worst hit districts are East Singhbhum (with its headquarters in Jamshedpur), Ranchi, Dhanbad, Koderma and Hazaribag, which reported 309, 272, 139, 130 and 108 new cases respectively in the last two weeks. Ranchi registered the maximum 122% growth as cases jumped to 494 on July 14 from 222 on June 30.The steep surge in number of cases in urban pockets, however, has created a panic, especially after chief minister Hemant Soren and his entire staff went into home quarantine following his contact with an infected minister.Another alarming development came on July 12, when the state reported nine deaths due to the pandemic.According to health experts, the situation can worsen if people don’t start following all preventive protocols and guidelines. “Many people are still violating the norms. Some even don’t use masks. A majority of population has not downloaded the Aarogya Setu App,” said Dr Rakesh Dayal, state nodal officer of the integrated disease surveillance programm (IDSP).Former head of medicine department of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Ranchi, Dr RK Jha said, “Prevention is the only key to keep a check on the spread of pandemic. We have to prepare ourselves mentally as we are in it for a long haul. We have to understand the importance of using masks, maintaining social distancing, using sanitizer and washing hands frequently.”In order to put a break on spread of the disease, several district administrations have been taking stricter measures and passed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Some districts have also clamped complete lockdown for a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/41-of-state-s-total-covid-cases-reported-in-first-two-weeks-of-july/story-wn3NRr7Waoh2i27f4P3U9I.html

16-07-2020||City||Rohtak’s Ajay beats all odds to score 98.6% marks in CBSE Class 10 exams||Scoring 98.6% marks in CBSE Class 10 exams was more than tough for Rohtak’s Ajay Kumar amid bereavement and financial hardships, which he faced at a tender age of 15. Nevertheless, the student of Meham’s Maharaja Agrasen Public School secured a centum in math and social science, bagged 95 marks in science but missed out on a perfect hundred in English and Hindi by one mark each. Ajay’s mother lost a long battle with a heart disease in April. His father Surender Kumar runs a retail shop in their native Behlba village to feed a family of five. “This is a tribute to my mother,” Ajay said, while recalling how during her final days, she encouraged him to study harder and score above 95%. “These results have given my family a reason to smile after so long. I want to opt for non-medical in Class 11 in order to become an engineer,” he added. Talking about how his father and grandparents motivated him, Ajay said, “My success would be meaningless without my 72-year-old grandmother, who took extra care of me after my mother’s demise.” His father said Ajay showed an extraordinary strength while coping with grief. “I am hardly earning Rs 400 to Rs 500 per day and facing a financial crunch. But my son has made me proud and given us a chance to cheer. He was very stressed during his exams as his mother was hospitalised,” he added. About his success mantra, the 15-year-old said, “A dialogue from movie 3 Idiots became a part of my life. I believed ‘all is well’ and worked so hard that hurdles couldn’t stop me from achieving my goal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rohtak-s-ajay-beats-all-odds-to-score-98-6-marks-in-cbse-class-10-exams/story-ewQbaU1OCqRrBfB8iHpXJO.html
16-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The masks of Chawri||You probably won’t spot such a wide range of quirky and cheap masks in online shopping sites. Neither in the upscale Khan Market, where a front lane store has put up a poster proclaiming “fashion masks available here.” At least you won’t see the masks strung together so casually in such great many numbers along a dusty footpath. Every second piece here is claiming for attention with its playful eccentricity. There’s one mask printed with a male model’s face. It looks disconcerting—as if a poor man’s lips were violently torn off from his mouth and pasted onto the fabric. While the one with a very animated Mickey Mouse seems so alive that you expect it to jump at you any moment now. Another is printed with a cartoon of one of those red double deckers that ply through London roads. A few masks are, of course, more predictable, dotted with conventional flower prints. Some are totally plain in shades of blue and grey.In short, you will be spoilt for choices if it is masks you’re after. This morning, the stall in Old Delhi’s Chawri Bazaar is so over-crowded with them that it is natural to feel that these masks might have been here for a long time, long before the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic that made this face wear a necessity.“Our stall is older than 50 years,” informs Brijendra Jain. In his 20s, the masked hawker informs that it was founded by his father, Ugar Sen Jain, who is now retired and stays at home. The unnamed establishment began keeping masks only recently though. Until the disruption caused by the pandemic, it would mostly sell gamcha, the classic all-purpose scarves especially popular, he says, among the area’s labourers and rickshaw pullers to wipe their sweaty faces and arms.Indeed, a good number of colourful cotton gamchas are arranged at one end of the stall. They are looking quite pretty and on their own, would have been easily noticeable. For the moment, however, the masks are hogging all the limelight.“Our masks are bought by all kinds of people... from working class men who sleep on the Chawri Bazaar streets, to rich men driving on their scooters and bikes,” says Mr Jain, who commutes daily from Lakshmi Nagar on his bicycle.The family originally lived in nearby Chandni Chowk “but some years back we moved out from the Walled City to Lakshmi Nagar... so much peace there.”It’s morning and Mr Jain is still awaiting his first customer. “I get the masks from a wholesale supplier in Sadar Bazaar.” He reveals that the masks were selling briskly until a few days ago “but now their popularity seems to be coming down.”As a matter of fact, a few of the many labourers milling about in the area are bare faced.Mr Jain isn’t sure how long he will continue to stock masks, “but as of now they still are the best-sellers.... the gamchas have fallen behind in the race.”It is true that Delhi started taking to masks a few years ago, prompted by an alarming increase in pollution in the foggy winter seasons, but they were not such a common sight until this March. That the mask has percolated down to the street level proves that it is now truly part of our everyday.Mr Jain’s masks range from ₹5 to ₹50. The stall opens daily from 9am to 6pm. Trials aren’t allowed for obvious reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-masks-of-chawri/story-RFiKzzw0ra8foGUX49h6fP.html

16-07-2020||Mumbai||Maha success in CBSE Class 10 exams||While the number of top scorers has dipped considerably across the country, city schools got several high scorers in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams for Class 10, results of which were declared on Wednesday morning.The Pune region, which consists of schools in Maharashtra, Goa, Daman-Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli, stood fourth, with a success rate of 98.05%. Maharashtra recorded a success rate of 98.16% this year. The overall success rate of all schools across the country was 91.46%, a rise of 0.36% points compared to 2019. Across the country, more than 1.84 lakh students scored 90% and above, while more than 41,000 students scored 95% and above. This is a dip of 18% and 27%, respectively, compared to 2019. All exams were held in the state this year, as they got over before the Covid-19 outbreak. While the ICSE board cancelled six papers, SSC cancelled the last Geography paper. Students from the ICSE and SSC were marked on their average of other subjects and their internal scores in the cancelled papers.J Mohanty, principal, DPS Nerul, said the class average of the school went up to 93.3% from 91.5% in 2019. “We are happy that 83% of the students who took exams from our school scored 90% and above in their exams. We have four students scoring 99% and above. It is really a good result,” he said. “Students of most schools have done very well. CBSE has managed to work on the results well and students don’t have much to complain about,” said Jose Kurian, regional director (western zone II), DAV Public Schools.Suman Samarth, school head at RN Podar School in Santacruz, said the school saw a large number of top scorers. “Of the 297 students who took the exam, 206 students scored 90% and above and 130 students scored 95% and above,” she said. Schools said the overall scores of students dropped in science paper. Seema Maindiratta, principal, DAV Kharghar, said, “Many students who have otherwise scored very well have got low scores in science exam. We do not know the reason.” In the school, 56 of the 169 students scored 90% and above. Kala Gangadharan, principal of Rajhans Vidyalaya in Andheri, said, “We too had similar cases of students scoring lower than expectations in science.” Like in case of CBSE’s Class 12 results, students had trouble accessing the results, as the website remained down. This year, the board has also decided to replace the term ‘fail’ by ‘essential repeat’. Father dies on day of exam, teenager scores 81.2%Atharva Joshi’s mother is proud that the 16-year-old scored 81.2%. For, his father passed away suddenly on the day of his social sciences exam. After the test, he performed the last rites of his father.“On the morning of the exam, my husband’s pulse had gone down. He had suffered a heart attack. My first thought was Atharva’s exams. He was brave to understand the situation. I am proud of my son’s achievement,” said Sunila Joshi. Atharva is a student of Lokpuram Public School, Thane. “I will pursue arts as I want to take up animation.” 3 cheers for this familyThe excitement at the Kumar household in Andheri was three times the usual. The 15-year-old triplets, Sparsh, Yash and Harsh Kumar, scored 97.2%, 96.2% and 92.4%, respectively in the Class 10 board. “We’ve always studied together and most of our interests also match. We love sports and regularly play football,” said Sparsh. He added that in their free time, while he loves to watch cricket, his brother Yash loves gadgets. While their next step is to excel in Class 12 boards, the brothers want to pursue a degree in engineering. “We’ll decide on the branch of engineering based on our studies over the next two years,” said Sparsh. Despite mother’s illness, teenager scores 91.2%Fifteen-year-old Stuti Wadhwa was running between her school, classes and a hospital since the end of January until her exams began in February this year. Her mother was diagnosed with cancer and within a month, succumbed to the disease. A student of Delhi Public School, Nerul, Stuti scored 91.2% in her board exams. “The situation was very stressful and what hit us hard was that we lost her mother, while Stuti’s exams were on. I’m amazed that she still went ahead and appeared for all remaining exams and managed to score so well,” said Dheeraj Wadhwa, her father. While she had appeared for two exams before her mother passed away, she managed to appear for four other papers later.Visually challenged girl from kharghar scores 95.8%Born visually impaired, Mahek Shaikh, 15, didn’t let it stop her from excelling. A student of DAV International School, Kharghar, Mahek scored 95.8% in her board exams.“I studied regularly and ensured I spent three to four hours studying everyday. All my textbooks were converted into e-books and I used various softwares to listen to the textbook material and study,” said Mahek, who plans to pursue a degree in music .While the English books were converted to eBooks by computer softwares, her mother used to record Hindi book chapters on the phone for Mahek to study. “The support we received from the school helped a lot ,” said her mother, Nazima.(With inputs from Ankita G Menon)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-success-in-cbse-class-10-exams/story-LaUzKvkxyy6hNcyGhQqZLP.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||Plans on for FYJC admissions||With the entire application process for First Year Junior Colleges (FYJC) moving online, city colleges are now planning the way ahead to conduct the admission process, following safety norms. “A lot of our staff members stay in the suburbs and in places far from the college. Coming to the college will be tough for them. While we can arrange pick-up and drop facility for them, there is definitely a lot of risk involved,” said Ashok Wadia, principal, Jai Hind college, Churchgate. The college has also started looping in its student council to ensure a smooth admission process. Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal, VG Vaze College, Mulund, said verification of documents can be a major challenge. “On the first day, 800 parents come to us to confirm their admissions and this is not possible this year. We have to find a way to provisionally admit students and check their documents later,” he said. This year, the education department has announced that the entire admission process for FYJC would be online. Students in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region can begin filling Part 1 of their application forms, which consist of basic details, from July 26 on the official website of the deputy directorate- https://mumbai.11thadmission.org.in . From July 16 to 24, the website would allow students to fill mock registration forms to get them acquainted with the system. The process of filling Part 2 of the form would begin after results of SSC exams are declared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/plans-on-for-fyjc-admissions/story-nwiSxWxqZE2cOC2CI4qZdI.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||Tough task ahead for state board students||With CBSE and ICSE schools in the city seeing a large number of high scorers, getting a spot in some of the most coveted colleges may be tough for state board students. This year, 20% of all Class 10 ICSE students who took their exams from the country scored 90.2% and above. Principals said the government needs to consider some equivalence formula to ensure that state board students do not lose out. “Every year, there is a trend which shows that students from other boards take some of the top spots in prominent colleges across the city. This year, the situation can get worse because scores of students, especially from ICSE and IGCSE, are more than expected,” said the principal of a suburban college. Ashok Wadia, principal, Jai Hind College, said, “The equivalence formula would benefit all students, making the process fair for all.”Some principals also said college preferences of students are likely to change due to the current situation. “Some top scorers might still prefer colleges close to their homes so we cannot anticipate the cut-offs so early,” said Satram Verhani, vice-principal, CHM College, Ulhasnagar. In 2019, the Mumbai divisional board had received nearly 1.85 lakh applications from students for the general admission round. While nearly 1.68 lakh were from the state board, the second highest number of applicants came from ICSE (7,881). The Maharashtra State Youth Congress wrote to state education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Wednesday requesting the government to reserve certain seats in junior colleges for state board students this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tough-task-ahead-for-state-board-students/story-5JcPzeUzie7GLGeo89rbOP.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||Fadnavis asks CM to withdraw order to appoint administrators to gram panchayats||Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday asked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to withdraw a recent order issued by the rural development department to nominate administrators for 14,000 gram panchayats by chief executive officers of the concerned district council in consultation with the district’s guardian minister.Fadnavis in a letter to Thackeray said, “This is a completely motivated decision aimed at gaining political upper hand during a pandemic. Nearly 50% gram panchayats will complete their tenure and will go for elections in November this year. The nomination of political administrators is a bid to squash the democratic tradition of local self-government in villages.”He also said that most sarpanchs were against this decision and that the Akhil Bharatiya Sarpanch Parishad, an organisation of village chiefs, had even said they would move court against the July 13 government resolution.In view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, the state election commission (SEC) had postponed elections to gram panchayats, whose terms ended or will end between March and November, to end of the year. Of the 28,000 gram panchayats, around 14,000 panchayats are slated for polls. However, the SEC had recommended appointment of administrators on these bodies till the polls. While these elections are not contested on a party symbol, elected gram panchayats are linked to political parties. In the last round of gram panchayat polls in 2017, when 3,131-odd bodies went to polls, BJP had claimed an upper hand though Congress had challenged those claims. In the upcoming polls, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) parties will try to corner BJP to take control of these bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fadnavis-asks-cm-to-withdraw-order-to-appoint-administrators-to-gram-panchayats/story-IjRafdTJa5nJfAX6J6N6fN.html

Investigations revealed that the consignment was being smuggled from Odisha and was set to be delivered either in Pune or Mumbai.Acting on inputs, DRI officials intercepted the tempo which was escorted by another vehicle in which the accused were seated.The three accused — Ishwar Jalinder Disale, Kiran Balu Sathe and Maruti Rajendra Jare — were moving ahead of the tempo to look for nakabandi so that they could timely divert the route.The three arrested accused claimed they were involved in the racket for monetary gains. However, they did not reveal much information about the kingpin. They have been booked under relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and were remanded in judicial custody till July 29 by a Nagpur court.“We are shocked how a group involved in drug smuggling was moving freely from one state to another during lockdown. This is not possible without influence. We are probing how they managed to pass through various police checks,” said an official part of the investigation.Another official said they have recently seen an unusual trend of rise in instances of cannabis smuggling. Pune customs, too, seized huge quantity of cannabis recently. Anti-narcotics agencies are looking into this trend and checking if the rise in demands of cannabis is due to unavailability of other drugs due to lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dri-seizes-635kg-cannabis-worth-1-crore/story-kt7ctHMX4h7V5nFr4OAvNM.html

In one such tweet Thakkar called Uddhav ‘Aurangzeb’ and Aaditya (his) ‘Penguin beta’, states the complaint.The objectionable posts shared by Thakkar, who has over 42,700 followers on the microblogging site, were viewed, liked and shared by thousands of Twitterati. Many prominent political figures, including @narendramodi, follow him on the site.However, Mumbai-based advocate Dharmendra Mishra, who is also legal consultant for Shiv Sena, saw the posts and registered a complaint against Thakkar with the VP Road police station on July 13.Another 21-year-old city-based woman also approached the police with a similar complaint saying she found Thakkar’s posts vulgar and obscene. The police recorded her statement and incorporated it in the first information report (FIR) filed against Thakkar.Mishra said, “There has to be some limit while you use your democratic rights to criticise someone. You cannot simply abuse anyone publicly, using foul and vulgar language. I had informed Thakkar to stop posting such derogatory content about respected political figures. But he didn’t stop and continued doing so. Hence, I lodged a complaint against him.”When contacted, Thakkar said, “I have just used strong language which is not unconstitutional in any manner. If my posts were abusive why has Twitter not taken them down? I just used my democratic rights to criticise the government. When VP Road police officers contacted me I told them that I would be able to visit the police station later as the lockdown is in effect and I sent my statement to the commissioner of police and DCP through email.”The police have booked Thakkar under sections 292 (obscene acts or words in public), 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code and 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act.

16-07-2020||Mumbai||Home minister seeks ban on release of Muhammad: The Messenger of God||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh has written a letter to Union minister of electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad demanding ban on digital release of the film Muhammad: The Messenger of God. Deshmukh said the movie, which is scheduled to be released on July 21, may hurt sentiments of a particular community.“The movie, if released on scheduled date, will be considered an attempt to blasphemy by a particular community and can potentially disturb religious sentiments. The film is likely to create religious tension leading to law and order problems in the country. Using the powers under section 69A of the Information Technology Act, we request you to block/suspend those digital platforms on which the movie is being released. You are also requested to issue instructions/directions to all digital platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, WhatsApp to ban the release of the film,” the letter stated.The move comes after the home minister received a complaint from Raza Academy.Saeed Noori, president of Raza Academy, said, “The film was scheduled to be released in 2015 in theatres, but after we raised the objection, the release was stopped. Now it is set to be released on OTT (over-the-top media service), to which we have strongly objected. It is an Iranian film and is against the teachings of our religion. Projection of Prophet is not allowed in Muslim religion. It could lead to the religious tension.”Maharashtra Cyber department, too, has written a separate letter to the senior director of the ministry to halt the release of the movie.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/home-minister-seeks-ban-on-release-of-muhammad-the-messenger-of-god/story-6kL3eAVgZ3I5yCJaai2yWL.html

16-07-2020||Mumbai||AAP starts campaign against high power bills||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Maharashtra, on Wednesday launched a campaign against consumers receiving high electricity bills. The party launched a website - hisaabdo.com - which will enable consumers to file complaints. It also has a ‘bill calculator’ for consumers to compare their bills with the tariff in Delhi.Ranga Rachure, AAP Maharashtra convenor, said, “We will hold the discoms accountable. We demand that the consumption of up to 200 units of electricity be made free for residential consumers.” Earlier, the Maharashtra Navirman Sena demanded 50% discount in bills, while the Janata Dal (Secular), Maharashtra, has also demanded that residential consumers with 300 units usage should be exempted from paying their bills.Power consumers across Maharashtra have received high bills in June. Discoms have, however, maintained that the bills are high as actual meter reading was suspended in March-end, and consumers were being charged based on the average in December, January and February. When meter-reading was initiated in June, consumers were sent bills as per their actual usage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aap-starts-campaign-against-high-power-bills/story-P6p0r6Vttq1ZzFRlAS4zUP.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||SC: No interim stay on Maratha quota in PG medical admissions||In a relief for the Maratha community as well as the Maharashtra government, the Supreme Court on Wednesday did not grant interim stay on reservation benefits while taking admission to postgraduate medical courses for this academic year.The Apex court also decided to hold hearing on day-to-day basis from July 27 on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the law granting reservation to the community.The three-judge bench led by Justice L Nageswara Rao heard a batch of petitions, including one challenging reservation benefits to postgraduate medical students from the Maratha community in admission for this academic year.The court said hearings of the matter through physical appearance is not possible considering the pandemic outbreak and asked all parties to start virtual hearings. It added that the hearings will take place on July 27, 28 and 29 and both the parties will get equal time to make arguments. The court also asked them not to repeat their arguments.This came after senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for one of the petitioners, said that such matters need to be heard in a physical court arguing that around 12% to 13% seats have already been reserved for the quota. Another advocate, Shivaji Jadhav, told the court that virtual hearing is not possible considering the compilation of thousands of pages of matter in the case.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing an intervener supporting the reservation, said the hearings can be completed in four weeks. Public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan, who is heading a cabinet sub-committee to review progress of legal matters for Maratha reservation and take decisions, said it is a relief for the students as the Apex court again refused to grant a stay on the law for reservation.“The petitioners have been insisting for interim stay on reservation benefits to postgraduate medical students from the Maratha community which the apex court has refused to grant. It is a satisfactory development for the state as the students who got admissions under reservation will not have to face trouble,” Chavan said.During regular hearings, senior counsels Mukul Rohatgi and Paramjit Singh Patwalia will appear on behalf of the state while senior counsels such as Kapil Sibbal and Rafiq Dada will argue in favour of intervener supporting the reservation The erstwhile BJP-led state government, in November 2018, granted 16% reservation to Maratha community, by enacting the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, in government jobs and education. In June 2019, the Bombay high court upheld he move but said the quantum of 16% reservation was not justifiable, and suggested that it be reduced to 12%-13% as recommended by the State Backward Classes Commission.Later, the decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. On February 5, the SC, while hearing a bunch of petitions against Maratha reservation, refused to stay the high court order.Recently, the state government reduced the quota to 12% for students from the Maratha community for junior college admissions from this academic year. The decision was taken following the order issued by the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sc-no-interim-stay-on-maratha-quota-in-pg-medical-admissions/story-oBoGv8telApnZQc09bDSbN.html

It also measures the pulse rate.As the novel coronavirus attacks the respiratory system, a drop in the body’s oxygen level can help diagnose infection in lungs, even if the patient is not facing breathlessness. This can enable prompt anti-viral medication and minimise spread of infection.The police department has also been randomly testing its force, and has so far distributed prophylactic medicine worth nearly Rs 5 lakh among cops.On the other hand, healthcare workers have held at least two protests, claiming poor quality of masks and mistreatment towards infected workers admitted at the Ludhiana civil hospital.“The pulse oximeters have been given to the cops, who tested positive previously and particularly those who are in home quarantine with mild symptoms,” said commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal.“If the oximeter detects their oxygen level lower than 95%, they have been directed to call authorities concerned for hospitalisation,” the commissioner added.“So far, 55 cops have been infected. While 27 have recovered, 28 are still under treatment,” he said.Besides providing them free kits, the police officials are conducting interaction and counselling sessions with the infected policemen to boost their morale.On his part, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga, “Even with limited resources, we are trying to provide the best of facilities to our employees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-cops-get-pulse-oximeters-while-healthcare-workers-decry-lack-of-proper-face-masks/story-lbm11TBRRyUbBIHTSH4ObO.html

Rumour mongering led to the murders of the three people — two monks and their driver — and it had no religious angle, said CID sources.The two charge sheets, around 12,000 pages in total, name 252 accused arrested including 11 juveniles who are lodged at Bhiwandi children’s remand home.Earlier, five police personnel, including Kasa police in-charge assistant inspector Anandrao Kale, sub-inspector Sudhir Katare and three others, were suspended while 35 police personnel (the entire Kasa police staff) were transferred to other police stations in Palghar police district. On May 7, home minister Anil Deshmukh had sent Gaurav Singh, the then SP of Palghar, on compulsory leave.Meanwhile, additional sessions judge of Dahanu DH Keluskar on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of 25 accused arrested in connection with the case.Satish Maneshinde, special public prosecutor, said, the 25 accused had applied for bail on technical grounds, which was rejected by the Dahanu court. He added that he had opposed the plea saying the prosecution has ‘multiple evidences’ against the 25 accused. Maneshinde said the accused were present at the spot during the incident as per the call data records (CDRs) and other technical evidence. So far more than 150 accused have been arrested by Kasa police in the case, which is now being investigated by the state CID.On April 16, two monks Kalpavrishka Giri Maharaj, 70 and Sushil Giri Maharaj, 35; and driver Nilesh Telgade, 30, were going from Kandivli to Surat.

This is not acceptable. as my husband also deals with complaints received at my office and he is a senior Congress leader. We are being asked to restrict ourselves to our ward, will the mayor do so too?” she questioned.She has also alleged that she is not allowed to speak in General House meetings of the MC even when the state government has allotted 50% seats to women.A copy of the complaint was forwarded to local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra and Punjab food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.The mayor, while refuting the allegations levelled against him, said, “I have already approved the file for which Jarnail called me up.

16-07-2020||Mumbai||HC denies bail to cop held for kidnapping||An Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court last week rejected a temporary bail application filed by former state service police officer Manoj Prabhakar Lohar who has been convicted for kidnapping for ransom and sentenced to life imprisonment.Lohar had sought temporary bail on health grounds, contending that he is a cancer survivor and that recently he has undergone a heart surgery and the ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) implantation required follow-up treatment at Mumbai.It was also argued on his behalf that since several persons lodged at Arthur Road jail in Mumbai were found infected with Covid-19, being a heart patient, the former police officer apprehended that he may also be exposed to the deadly virus.The argument, however, failed to impress upon the bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice Shrikant Kulkarni. The judges found the period of follow-up after the heart surgery was already over and a fresh report by jail authorities stated that the petitioner was in sound health condition and leading a normal life.Besides the bench also noted that just three months back, on April 3, 2019, another bench also headed by justice TV Nalawade, has rejected applications filed by Lohar, who was working as additional superintendent of police at Chalisgaon in Jalgaon district, and his purported agent, Dhiraj Yeole, a local resident, for suspension of a substantive sentence handed down to them and grant of bail.Both of them have been convicted last year by Jalgaon sessions court for kidnapping a local politician, Uttamrao Mahajan, the principal of an Ayurvedic medical college at Chalisgaon in June 2009, and demanding a ransom of about ₹60 lakh for his release. Mahajan, according to the prosecution, was detained illegally and let off only after the superintendent of police, Jalgaon intervened in the matter.HC noted that there was no change in circumstances after the order dated April 3, 2019, when the bench headed by justice Nalawade rejected his bail plea saying that releasing them on bail will send a wrong signal to the public at large and such persons need to be kept behind bars so as to send a strong message to others indulging in similar offences.“These days police officers like the accused (Lohar) are virtually acting as leaders of gangs of dacoit,” HC had said in April 3, 2019 order. “It can be said that people fear police like accused more than the dacoits who commit road robberies or housebreakings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-denies-bail-to-cop-held-for-kidnapping/story-nEMK90eLRIvfraAx6U3v3K.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||CM opposes Akola-Khandwa railway project as it requires 160ha forest land||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has opposed a project proposed by the railways ministry to upgrade the 176-km-long Akola-Khandwa railway line, on grounds that it passes through Melghat tiger reserve and requires over 160 hectares (ha) of forest land. Thackeray in a letter to Union railway minister Piyush Goyal and Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar requested them to consider alternative alignment of the railway line outside the tiger reserve as the proposed one would result in long-term detrimental impact on the habitat of tigers and wildlife.The project involves conversion of the metre-gauge line to a broad-gauge line along the stretch.Melghat is among the first nine tiger reserves declared in 1973-74. Home to 35 tigers, it is spread across an area of 2,768.52 square km (sqkm) and is a part of Satpura-Maikal landscape which has the distinction of being one of the global priority tiger conservation landscapes. Thackeray, in his letter, said the proposed project passes through the core critical tiger habitat of the tiger reserve. The proposal includes open cutting of tunnels, which involves cutting and blasting of rocks using heavy machinery and explosives. It also involves realignment away from the existing track to ease sharp curves on 23.48-km of the total 38-km stretch passing through the core area of the reserve. “This amounts to realignment and not just gauge conversion on the existing railway track,” he said.Considering the long-term irreversible impacts of gauge conversion on endangered species like tiger and their habitat, it would be appropriate to focus on alternative alignments which would not only ensure much more space for the wildlife but bring railway connectivity and greater economic developments to hitherto unconnected villages located in Jalgaon-Jamod and Sangrampur talukas (Buldhana district), benefitting almost 100 villages in the vicinity, said the chief minister.The chief minister further pointed out said 13 villages were rehabilitated away from the core area, following which wildlife has substantially increased. “The project would reverse the benefits accrued from rehabilitation and habitat development,” he wrote.The project, which received approval from the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) in January 2017, was challenged before a Central Empowered Committee (CEC) constituted by the Supreme Court. NBWL was then directed to review its decision, given the impact of diverting 160.94 hectares of forest land for the project within the Wan Sanctuary of Melghat tiger reserve.Following this, NBWL revoked permission for the project in February 2019, citing the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s (NTCA) view that the railway line would run through a tiger reserve, thus impacting sensitive ecology.NBWL is the highest decision-making body of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) on projects involving national parks, sanctuaries and tiger reserves.The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has also recommended that the best mitigation for the railway line is avoiding upgradation through the tiger reserve and opting for alternative alignments, the CM said. The railway ministry, however, is of the view that the land was owned by the railways before 1980, the year the Forest (Conservation) Act, was passed, and hence the act did not apply to the land as it was under non-forest use prior to 1980. It will not be applicable on doubling of track and gauge conversion projects, the officials said. Prasad Khale, an environmentalist associated with Conservation Action Trust (CAT), who had moved CEC against the project, welcomed the CM’s move and said they would also challenge the project if the railway and environment ministries go ahead with it.“We welcome CM’s decision. I don’t understand why the railway and environment ministries are again pushing it when it was already rejected by CEC, NTCA and NBWL. Even WII has said that changing the alignment is the best possible option. We will definitely challenge if the ministries go ahead with the project,” Khale said.He said that providing corridor to tigers for free movement is more important because if the number of tiger increases only in protected areas and they are not able to move outside then it will lead to more conflicts.Recently, state environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray opposed the Central government’s proposal to conduct coal mining at a site near Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) in Chandrapur district. He has urged the Union environment minister to withdraw the proposal while flagging concerns that allowing mining activities at the proposed site would harm TATR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-opposes-akola-khandwa-railway-project-as-it-requires-160ha-forest-land/story-aQrAM32zenkRCZq2TDkvgI.html

Officials claim that KU will be the first varsity in the state to implement such a learning outcome-based curriculum framework in consonance with the requirements of National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and other national and international accreditation agencies. The decision will bring major changes in the teaching and learning process from the session beginning August-September 2020. OBE is a student-centric teaching and learning methodology in which the course delivery and assessment are planned to achieve stated objectives and outcomes. University’s vice-chancellor (V-C) Nita Khanna said, “It will be a massive exercise to change the syllabus of all 49 on-campus departments and institutes in one go.”“We have taken advantage of the Covid-19 lockdown period to consult various stakeholders such as students, teachers, alumni, and employers. Our faculty has braced itself and we are now ready to launch the new system from the forthcoming session,” she added.The V-C said that OBE generates transparent expectations of the results as students can understand what they expect from their courses while teachers can understand what they need to demonstrate throughout the course. “Even the teachers can structure their classes according to the students’ wishes by reading transparently what needs to be done,” she added.The V-C said that instructors will analyse the results a student has accomplished and in which area they are upgraded to analyse the talent and provide individual assistance and direction to meet their demands. Brajesh Sawhney, director public relations, Kurukshetra University, said this model will help in improving the professional skills of students.He said the main motive behind the move is to improve students’ teamwork capabilities besides communication, leadership and time-management skills.He said the methodology will later be extended to colleges affiliated with the university. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kurukshetra-varsity-to-implement-outcome-based-education-model-from-coming-session/story-WWvGVgX3XCY80kR8uogrvK.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||Malad builder told to pay back ₹20 lakh to two homebuyers||The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) recently ordered a builder to refund ₹20 lakh paid by two homebuyers as a booking amount for a flat, four years ago.The complainants, Sumit and Ashutosh Mukherjee, had on July 1, 2016 booked a residential flat in Malad for ₹2.23 crore and made a payment of a token amount of ₹20 lakh to Rajsanket Realty Limited. However, despite cancelling the deal within 40 days — August 10, 2016 — the builder kept on delaying the refund claiming he would do so only after the said flat got sold.The Mukherjees then approached MahaRera, which ruled that the builder must refund the entire amount to them.According to Advocate Shilpa Nagori, who represented the complainants, the order is significant as “the order is very clear that builders can no longer keep the buyers’ amount after cancellation of the order and must refund it”.The complaints contended that after cancelling the booking, they resorted to various means like emails, letters and even a legal notice asking the builder to refund their amount, all of which were neglected by the firm. The firm, Rajsanket Realty, during the hearing expressed willingness to refund the amount but only when finding a new buyer for the said flat, and said that this would take time. The further added that they would refund the amount after 5% deduction. This was mentioned earlier on September 2, 2017 when the Mukherjees had given them a legal notice.MahaRera, in its order, said that based on its September 2, 2017 submission, “There was sufficient time for the respondent to sell out the said flat to new buyer and refund the amount to the complainants as promised. However, due to such act of omission on the part of the respondent, the complainants were compelled to wait for refund for such an unreasonable period and they had to approach MahaRera.” “In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of this case, MahaRera directs the respondent to refund the full amount paid by the complainants without any interest.”Builders often exploit homebuyers by forfeiting or deducting a huge amount in cases of cancellation of bookings. The buyer, in order to avoid legal hassles, used to accept whatever amount was refunded to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/malad-builder-told-to-pay-back-20-lakh-to-two-homebuyers/story-W6DfTJ1KyVoJep5YKaS1sM.html

It is disappointing to see such lapses and failures,” the bench said.The tribunal said that if there is any constraint of funds, the same can be recovered from the people contributing the waste but waste management has to be promptly ensured.“The authorities are trustees of the people for this management and their incompetence should not result in damage to public health as is happening in the present case. Their accountability has to be fixed.,” it said. The tribunal had earlier sought time-bound action plan with regard to scientific disposal of existing waste lying at the site.The NGT was hearing a plea filed by Palwal-based SND Public School against illegal dumping of municipal waste by the municipal council on common land in Meghpur village in the district which is marked for grazing.The plea has sought an immediate stay on dumping of waste and removal of dumped garbage from the common land in order to prevent pollution to the adjacent pond and groundwater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ngt-raps-haryana-over-unscientific-dumping-of-municipal-waste-in-palwal/story-uq3ItWYndAKrxiDlV6KofL.html

She has been evading arrest since then.In October 2017, a trap was laid by CBI on the complaint of financier Prem Singh Bisht, who had alleged that sub-inspector (SI) Mohan Singh of Sector 31 police station had demanded ₹9 lakh from him to withdraw names of his employees from an attempt to murder FIR.Bisht had alleged that the SI had told him that the ₹8 lakh were for SHO Jaswinder Kaur and ₹1 lakh for him. The CBI had arrested the SI while accepting ₹2 lakh bribe, and the case was closed against Kaur as the agency could not find any evidence to implicate her.However, in the CBI court, the complainant had said that he was taken to SHO Kaur by SI Mohan Singh at Old Car Bazaar in Hallo Majra, where a meeting had taken place and SHO had demanded money.In 2019, Bisht had moved an application to declare SHO Jaswinder Kaur an accused in the case. In February 2020, he had moved another application in the court stating that he was being pressured by the SHO.Taking cognizance of the applications, the court had directed CBI to place before the sanctioning authority (SSP, Chandigarh) all evidence so that the authority could apply its own mind whether to give sanction for prosecution or not.Five months on, Bisht on Wednesday moved another application in CBI court “for taking consideration with regard to deemed sanction against accused Jaswinder Kaur” as laid down in Supreme Court judgement. He said that the case was awaiting sanction and that a decision had not been taken yet.Sushil Kumar Garg, special judge of the CBI court, has issued a notice to the investigation agency and sought its reply on the same application and has also sought a reply from DIG, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sanction-to-prosecute-cbi-court-directs-chandigarh-dig-to-submit-reply-in-2017-graft-case-involving-ex-sho-kaur/story-SInBD2sxPXOHI1kHn9Qo6L.html

But the department is wary of using the rice mills as storage points fearing misappropriation of the stock and mixing of recycled rice with freshly shelled grain. “Paddy poses a bigger challenge because the volume of the kharif crop is at least one-third more than wheat. Also, paddy arrives faster in the mandis (grain markets). An average 120 lakh tonnes of wheat arrives in mandis against 180 lakh tonne paddy,” an additional director-rank official said. During the rabi season that ended on June 30, premises of 1,550 rice mills along with 1,870 mandis and procurement centres managed by mandi board were used for wheat procurement. “Even if the entire paddy stock from the previous season is shelled by the beginning of the new season starting October 1, and handed over to the Food Corporation of India (FCI), we have to see if we can use rice mills as storage points. We don’t want to take any chance,” the official said. State food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said procurement of paddy in rice mills is a tricky issue. “We are working out a solution and may use other places for staggering procurement,” he added.STATE ORDERS 5 LAKH GUNNY BALES The department has placed orders for 5 lakh gunny bales (each bale contains 1,000 bags) with the Jute Corporation of India and has paid a sizeable amount in advance. The tentative cost of the gunny bags for the forthcoming season has been pegged at Rs 1,350 crore. “If we do not place orders now, we would not get supply of gunny bags in the middle of procurement. The department raises funds from the banks and later adjusts the same when cash credit limit (CCL) for procurement is received,” Ashu said. Secretary (agriculture) KS Pannu said sowing of the ‘parmal’ variety of paddy in the current kharif season is almost over. “Right now, the transplantation of aromatic premium basmati variety is going on. The ‘parmal’ variety is likely to be sown over 60 lakh acres. The Central Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) has fixed the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy at Rs 1,888 per quintal in the upcoming harvesting season,” Pannu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-plans-staggered-procurement-of-paddy-may-not-use-rice-mills-for-storage/story-FbQ8iUdvvMoKGdfcox8QTI.html

He also urged the court to strike down the fine imposed on the petitioner by traffic police.HC, however, expressed its inability to entertain the petition and issue directions saying, “It is within the exclusive domain of the state legislature to legislate as to which services to be included in essential services, keeping in view paramount interest of the community.”The bench has, however, allowed the petitioner to file a comprehensive representation to the state government raising the issues contained in the petition. It has clarified that the dismissal of the petition shall not be construed by the government as an impediment in deciding the representation filed by the petitioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-dismisses-petition-to-include-lawyers-in-essential-service-providers/story-Fxvwroee8X0buQhpA4RDDO.html

He complained to me that he wasn’t getting timely food. For a diabetic, timely food is very important. Even we are not allowed to send food for him at the centre too,” said Hanif Patel, a resident of Vishwakarma Nagar, Vasai.Jeevdani Trust, Virar, who is responsible for preparing all three meals, have denied the allegations. “Covid patients require timely meals. Hence, we ensure that the food packets are ready on time. The breakfast is ready by 8am, lunch by 11:30am and dinner by 5:30pm. However, the civic body is responsible for delivering the food packets to the centres,” said Pankaj Thakur, vice president of the Jeevdani Trust, Vasai.Avinash Jadhav, Palghar district chief of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), on Tuesday staged a protest against the poor quality of food and unhygienic conditions of the Covid centres in Vasai. They pasted photos of the Covid care centres at the door of the VVMC commissioner, Gangatharan D.“The patients are not served food on time; they are denied of clean warm water and there are many other issues. The commissioner refused to meet the MNS workers, hence we pasted the photos on the door of his office,” Jadhav said.Gangatharan D, the VVMC Commissioner has denied the allegations. “If people have a problem, they can physically see how the VVMC is providing all the facilities at the Covid care centres,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patients-at-vasai-covid-centre-complain-of-irregular-meals/story-fsiEG4rajWfSdNWXQIexhL.html
16-07-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown lag: Haryana speeds up immunisation drive||Haryana was able to fully vaccinate about 50% of the eligible infants under the universal immunisation programme during the Covid-19 lockdown period in April.The state, however, improved on its vaccination percentage in May and June by covering infants who could not be immunised earlier. The universal immunisation programme is a key intervention for protection of children from life-threatening conditions. National Health Mission (NHM) director Prabhjot Singh said about 40,000 to 45,000 infants are fully immunised every month. Full immunisation for infants under the national programme means administering a dose of BCG vaccine, three doses of pentavalent vaccine, three doses of oral polio vaccine and one dose of measles-rubella vaccine before completion of one year of birth. “In April, about 21,956 infants were fully immunised as outreach immunisation sessions in community settings were suspended due to Covid-19 lockdown. About 70% beneficiaries get vaccinated during outreach sessions. However, we were able to continue facility based sessions,” Prabhjot said. He said 41,245 infants were immunised in May despite zero immunisation sessions in containment and buffer zones. Since vaccine administration was more in May as compared to June, data analysis shows that many infants who could not get vaccinated during April sought immunisation services in May, the NHM director said. He said since many beneficiaries migrated to their hometowns, there was a decline in the routine immunisation coverage. Also, people tried to avoid visiting health facilities due to fear of infection and due to the lockdown, many were unable to reach health facilities, he added. Officials said the state has also achieved more than 92% immunisation against the target of 5.75 lakh beneficiaries set by the Centre for 2019-20. We have improved our dropout rate significantly and there has also been a remarkable improvement in availability of vaccines at session sites, they said. The NHM director said during the lockdown, efforts were made to ensure that delivery services are provided without any interruption at both public and private institutions. In non-Covid-19 health facilities, provisions have been made for separate labour, delivery and recovery rooms and isolation ward for delivery and admission of infected mothers, he said. “We are doing entry-point screening of pregnant women presenting in the obstetric unit. Triaging is being done to minimise contact with suspected Covid-19 cases,” he added. Analysis of data of deliveries during Covid-19 lockdown period (March to May 2020) has shown that 95.4% childbirths during the period were institutional deliveries. The percentage of public institutional deliveries during lockdown was 59.4%, while the percentage of private institutional deliveries was 40.6%, the NHM director said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-lag-haryana-speeds-up-immunisation-drive/story-oBujm1Fvj87mfNkfUntDfN.html

16-07-2020||City||KDMC did not respond to our plaints, offers for help: Activists||Activists in Kalyan and Dombivli have complained about the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation’s (KDMC) lack of response to their complaints and offers of help.Dr Rupinder Murjani, 37, said, “During initial months of the pandemic, we had complained to the civic body about several things, but there was response. There is no rapid response team in the city. Also there is poor communication from the civic body’s side.”Murjani and Alert Citizens Forum (Jagruk Nagrik) have also complained that the civic body’s decision to allow volunteers to carry out ward-level surveys may have come too late.“The idea of doing ward-wise survey was suggested by us long back. The corporators are being involved now. They should have worked earlier and traced all the patients in a ward and curbed the spread,” said Sreeniwas Ghanekar, founder of Alert Citizens Forum.Responding to the criticism, KDMC chief Vijay Suryavanshi said, “Initially, there was need to improve infrastructure and manpower. When we has just 100 cases in the city, we had 3,500 beds at the quarantine centre and also had three Covid hospitals ready to treat patients. We focused on that and managed to form a doctors’ army and also had enough beds to quarantine people. Many of the work took time due to less manpower.” He said that with the help of volunteers, KDMC plans to “aggressively trace” the spread of the infection in Kalyan and Dombivli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmc-did-not-respond-to-our-plaints-offers-for-help-activists/story-DaKV8GAzhZpy52jchHUEMJ.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||UGC decision on final exams not binding on Maharashtra universities: State||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday took a stand before the Bombay high court (HC), stating that the guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) on July 6, instructing universities to hold final-semester examinations by September-end, were not binding on the state or universities in Maharashtra.Under section 12 of the UGC Act, 1956, the commission is bound to consult “universities or other bodies concerned” before taking any steps or decisions for promotion of university education and maintenance of standards of teaching, examination, and research in universities, said the affidavit filed by Dr Dhanaraj Mane, director of higher education, Maharashtra.The term “other bodies concerned” is not defined under the UGC Act but under the current Covid-19 situation, the term will definitely include the disaster management authority or the state government, Mane pointed out, adding that UGC has not consulted either of them or the universities before issuing exam guidelines. “ UGC has not at all consulted the state government while deciding to hold the examinations, and therefore, the decision is ‘void ab-initio’ and not binding on the universities or the state government,” the affidavit adds.The affidavit was filed in reply to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Dhananjay Kulkarni, challenging a government resolution (GR) issued by the higher education department on June 19 to not permit holding of final-semester examinations of professional as well as non-professional courses in Maharashtra.The affidavit states that it was a conscious decision taken in a meeting before the disaster management authority, in the backdrop of the unprecedented situation created by Covid-19 pandemic.Adding that holding final-semester examinations in the current scenario will be highly dangerous for all stakeholders, the affidavit states that after the introduction of the semester pattern, the importance of final examinations has been reduced, as compared to the annual examinations which used to be held earlier.“The semester system has brought about a sea change, in not only the manner in which educational courses are conducted, but also the manner in which the performance of every student is evaluated and assessed,” states the affidavit, adding, “Now, the final-semester examination is like any other semester examination, and does not carry the decisive value which a final-year examination used to carry in the erstwhile education system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ugc-decision-on-final-exams-not-binding-on-maharashtra-universities-state/story-j8Z8y4Kb41ukBA4tC44Q5O.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||75% drop in sales, claim shopkeepers||Shopkeepers in the city, who have opened their establishments after the easing of lockdown last month, have reported at least 60%-75% decline of sales in daily business as compared to pre-lockdown days. A reason behind this fall is that consumers are buying less as they were hit by the long spell of lockdown. According to the Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), the apex body of traders, there was a significant decrease in the sales. “Our daily business has declined by approximately 60%-75% and it is becoming very difficult to run the show,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, CAMIT.Hindmata market at Dadar, a famous cloth market, which is generally filled with the hustle bustle of shops, shopkeepers and customers, wore a deserted look with barely any footfall. “We hardly get one customer a day,” said Sachin Gala, owner of a well-known cloth store.Consumers say both fear of contagion and monetary issue are impacting their purchase patterns. “There is no work since the past three months. Hence, I am buying only what is essential. In addition, it is not safe to go outside in these trying times, so I prefer buying things online,” said Suzen Nehal who runs a production house at Andheri.As a result of low-sales, shopkeepers are not being able to pay June salaries to their staff. “I paid my staff April and May salary despite zero income. However, I hardly have any income to pay them now,” said Gala.Mitesh Modi, convenor of Lamington Road Traders Association Action Committee (LRTCCA), said travel restrictions have also impacted the business significantly. “People cannot come to various markets like Lamington Road (electronics market) or Lohar Chawl (electrical market) due to restrictions on travel, and hence they are ordering online. This has affected our business,” said Modi. Currently, only around 50% of the shops have opened despite the state government easing restrictions under Mission Begin Again. They cite shortage of staff, permission to open shops only on alternate days as well as restrictions on timings as the reasons behind many not opening shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/75-drop-in-sales-claim-shopkeepers/story-ZdSBX4S43pGQGq9jPLeRfI.html
16-07-2020||City||Kalyan-Dombivli tops in Covid-19 cases in MMR||The twin cities of Kalyan and Dombivli have seen Covid-19 spread rapidly since June when the lockdown was eased. According to the state health department, Kalyan and Dombivli have a total of 16,071cases of Covid-19 and 239 deaths from the infection. These are among the highest numbers of cases in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).According to the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), there were 870 cases of Covid-19 reported in the twin cities in May and 5,543 cases in June. In the first two weeks of July, KDMC says there have been 7,001 new cases of Covid-19 and on Wednesday, 498 cases were recorded. According to the state health department, 561 new cases of Covid-19 and 15 deaths were recorded in the area. As of now, no data has been released to show which parts are most affected by Covid-19. “The data analysis work is pending as deputy commissioners who handle the administration works are also infected. Around 72 staff members of the civic body are infected,” said Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.However, commissioner of KDMC Dr Vijay Suryavanshi said the spike is not worrying. “The projection made by the state government states the number of cases will increase. The cases will increase when we do more testing. The only point is we need to increase tracing and also address patients on time. For this, we have started to set up war rooms at each of our 10 wards. Also, we have started ward-wise survey through corporators,” he said. At present, KDMC collects around 900 swabs daily for testing, which have to be sent to Mumbai. There is no testing facility in Kalyan. The plan is to increase this number to 1,500 and have tests processed at its own lab at Gauripada in Kalyan (West), which would enable KDMC to carry out 3,000 tests a day. Recently, KDMC started antigen testing at the ward level, having acquired 10,000 kits. In the coming days, 25,000 more kits will be acquired.Activists say KDMC’s response to the outbreak is marked by poor infrastructure and shortage of manpower. Sajitha Nair, a member of Alert Citizens’ Forum (Jagruk Nagrik), said, “The civic body has now taken corporators and volunteers to carry out surveys of all its wards. This should have been done at an early stage. Also, the civic body should have increased beds and testing capacity by May.” Nair said KDMC had also failed to track those quarantined at home, which has led to a rapid spread of infection.Many have complained about lack of beds for Covid-19 patients, delays in receiving test results, difficulty in accessing ambulances and dismal facilities at civic-run hospitals like Bai Rukminibai Hospital in Kalyan and Shastri Nagar General Hospital in Dombivli.“My daughter in-law tested positive, after which she was taken to the Tata Amantra quarantine centre. My son, grandchildren, wife and I were also taken to the centre. They collected our swab on June 28 and the report came on July 6,” said KL Vasankar, who lives in Karpewadi, in Kalyan (East).Sameer Kamble, a resident of Kalyan (East), said, “I lost both my in-laws to Covid-19 in June. We struggled to get my father in-law admitted – I approached four private hospitals when his oxygen levels were dropping. No one admitted him as we did not have a Covid test report. Finally, he was admitted to Shastri Nagar General Hospital. He got tested but we got his report a day after he died on June 9.” Kamble’s mother in-law would later contract the infection and the family struggled to get an ambulance for her. “I called up all the numbers but no ambulance was sent till the last moment. I drove to a Thane hospital and got her admitted there,” said Kamble. His mother in-law eventually succumbed to Covid-19 on June 14 while being treated at a hospital in Dombivli.Suryavanshi admitted to a shortage of beds for Covid-19 patients, but said KDMC plans to tie up with 24 hospitals to increase the number of available beds. “We have managed to get around 4,000 quarantine beds and 780 beds at Covid hospitals in total. The beds will be increased by 1,000, with oxygen support for critical patients. Also, in every ward we plan to have at least 250 beds to treat patients locally and also another 5,000 beds for those with mild symptoms,” said Suryavanshi, adding that medical staff have not responded to calls to join frontline workers. “Making doctors and other staff available to run hospitals was a task as many kept avoiding the job. We are asking people to join, but the response is low. We are outsourcing staff now as we need to improve on manpower,” said Suryavanshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-dombivli-tops-in-covid-19-cases-in-mmr/story-1Tqn3hplte13boVssO0ePN.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||612 ICU beds in Covid facilities to be handed over to private groups||To decongest and take the load off civic hospitals, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will soon outsource the functioning of 612 intensive care unit (ICU) beds at jumbo Covid facilities to private firms or groups of private doctors, to manage. The civic body will invite firms to run the ICU facilities, by providing full support staff such as ward staff, nurses, supervisors, senior and resident doctors, and specialists. Currently, there is 86% occupancy of ICU beds in the city.There are eight jumbo facilities temporarily set up across Mumbai to handle Covid-19 cases. These centres have 612 ICU beds adding to Mumbai’s total capacity of 1,737. Jumbo facilities were earlier conceptualised and built by BMC as Covid care centres (CCC-1 and CCC-2) to quarantine high-risk contacts and asymptomatic patients. They were then converted into dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC) with oxygen beds, and dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH) with ICU beds.The civic body said that giving control to private firms will help reduce the pressure on hospital staff and decongest ICUs at Sion, Nair, and KEM hospitals. Till July 13, of its total capacity of 1, 737 ICU beds, 1, 510 were occupied and 227 were vacant.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal said, “The pressure on our medical staff has decreased from what it was initially. We are expecting that in another 15 days, we will bring down the vacancy of ICU beds in Sion, KEM, and Nair hospitals by 25%. I have already issued an order that 612 ICU beds in our jumbo facilities will be outsourced to a group of private doctors.”Chahal said that decongesting civic hospitals will help avoid a shortage of medical staff. “If we are able to bring down the bed occupancy in civic-run hospitals to 50%, then there will be no shortage of medical staff in our hospitals,” he added. As of July 13, the total hospital-bed capacity for Covid patients in the city was 22,819, of which 10,200 beds are vacant. BMC has additional 23,945 beds in CCC-2 facilities and 50,077 beds in CCC-1 facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/612-icu-beds-in-covid-facilities-to-be-handed-over-to-private-groups/story-F7oCD8HskbsfURQluu8P2I.html

16-07-2020||Mumbai||With no income during lockdown, people in slums forced to borrow money for water: Survey||A recent survey conducted in one of the city’s slum areas has revealed a grim effect of the nationwide lockdown imposed in March to curb the spread of Covid-19. The lockdown, which drew most industry to a standstill, has left many jobless, with no income to sustain themselves. In some instances, residents have been forced to take loans even to buy essentials.The survey of 619 people in the slums of Shivaji Nagar in M-East ward, conducted by NGO Apnalaya, reveals that 46.7% of the respondents had no income during the lockdown period. Of this, 70% had to take loans from family and friends to buy basic items like water and rations. Owing to the lockdown, the employment rate among the group has gone down by 33.3%. “Around 12% of the respondents said that they had to borrow money to buy water, and 42% said that they needed a loan to buy rations,” said Raghunandan Hegde, director-impact, Apnalaya. Shivaji Nagar is a patch of slums near the 132-hectare Deonar dumping yard in central Mumbai. It has a population of approximately six lakh people who live in poor hygienic conditions, with no access to healthcare, clean water, and toilets.The report, which was released on Tuesday, reveals that though 51.4% of the respondents were engaged in some kind of paid work before the lockdown, only 34.5% continue to do the work. In June, the NGO undertook surveys of people engaged as casual labourers, domestic help, conservancy workers, or owners of small businesses. Around 29% of the respondents said they are not sure of their future income, and many do not know if they will be able to resume work. “Though Covid-19 is a health crisis, the lockdown and the lack of response have made it into a humanitarian crisis. The informal nature of jobs keeps people in slums not only poor but also away from welfare schemes. Lack of resources has made slum-dwellers vulnerable during the crisis,” said Arun Kumar, CEO, Apnayala. He added that the data could be extrapolated to represent the situation of all slums, which constitute 42% of Mumbai’s population.The survey results reveal that the average income of Shivaji Nagar residents is also very low. While 17% earned less than Rs4,000 before lockdown, the number has now declined to 23%.Though 27.5% earned anywhere between Rs8,000 and Rs10,000 before the lockdown period, the job losses have reduced the number to a mere 4.8% earning the same amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-no-income-during-lockdown-people-in-slums-forced-to-borrow-money-for-water-survey/story-px8fdUIWQQTXbjBCJPBhlK.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||Sheena Bora murder case: CBI court denies bail to Indrani Mukerjea||The special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Wednesday rejected Indrani Mukerjea’s 45-day interim bail plea sought on grounds of spread of Covid-19 in prison. The prime accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, Mukerjea had written to the special judge in the last week of June, seeking interim bail, claiming she was at “high risk of getting infected with Covid-19 due to her weak health”. The special court has noted that Mukerjea is a foreign national and thus belongs to the category of prisoners which are exempted for grant of interim bail. The court also observed that only due to the spread of Covid-19, Mukerjea should not be granted bail.Mukerjea, however, had contended that she is a permanent resident of Worli and if she is released on bail, she will have better access to the medical facility.The court negated her contention and observed that every day there is a rise in a number of Covid-19 cases. Besides, the court noted that medical officers are available in the jail and prisoners are well taken care of.The prison authority of Byculla jail had in their report submitted that prisoners are regularly given handwash, soap and sodium hydrochloride in jail and other medicines. The special court considered the said report while rejecting Mukerjea’s plea.Mukerjea had claimed she is suffering from “chronic ischemic changes in her brain arteries/vessels” and needs to be under constant care and monitoring. “Given the increasing numbers of Covid-positive cases in the state, there is no certainty as to when there could be a hearing for bail [merits] and/or trial,” read her plea. The CBI however, stated that Mukerjea does not have major health issues that can put her at risk of Covid-19.Further, Mukerjea referred to the minutes of the high-power committee of the Bombay high court (HC), which states that undertrials booked for murder can be granted interim bail owing to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sheena-bora-murder-case-cbi-court-denies-bail-to-indrani-mukerjea/story-9l3cUJoKIYuaFyvyq5x8SP.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||State council to provide data on plasma donations on SBTC website||After the state government encountered cases of illegal sale of blood plasma, the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC), will now provide the information on blood banks that store plasma on their website. So far, King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel, has submitted data of ten plasma donors to the council.On Monday, state cyber cell in a statement revealed that owing to the paucity of plasma donors, some potential donors reportedly contacted relatives of patients and offered plasma in exchange for lakhs of rupees. To address such issues, SBTC has decided to make a centralised data of donors from all the blood banks.“We have received directives from the National Blood Transfusion Council to compile data of plasma donations, to keep a check on any illegal business during the pandemic. Once we receive data from all blood banks, we will publish it online so that patients in need of convalescent plasma therapy and hospitals can procure the plasma without the involvement of any middleman,” said Dr Arun Thorat, director of SBTC.Individuals infected with Sars-Cov-2— the virus that causes Covid-19 develops antibodies as part of the body’s natural immune response to the foreign pathogen. This antibody invades pathogens and works to eliminate the novel coronavirus in patients. During convalescent plasma therapy, these antibodies are infused into the blood of the Covid-19 patients to help to fight against the virus.Owing to lockdown, several blood banks are faced with acute shortage of staff which is obstructing compilation of data. At KEM Hospital’s blood bank, only 11 of the 19 employees are working currently.“Many of our employees reside in far-off areas like Nallasopara or Vasai who aren’t regularly coming to the hospital. Also, some staffers are quarantined at home after getting exposed to infected patients in their localities. We are struggling with a manpower crunch,” said a blood bank officer from the hospital.At KEM Hospital, ten recovered patients have donated blood for plasma therapy of critically-ill Covid-19 patients. At BYL Nair Hospital and Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, which is also known as Sion Hospital, 70 and 15 cured patients have donated blood.To collect data, SBTC issued a notice on Monday to all the blood banks across the state seeking data of the donors. “So far, we have received data from KEM Hospital, while other blood banks are in the process of compiling data,” said Dr Thorat.Every day, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) receives around 25 calls on their helpline number seeking blood from recovered Covid-19 patients for plasma therapy. “Plasma therapy is given only to patients who are critically ill. But often relatives of Covid-19 patients get concerned and start hunting for blood of cured patients. The scammers take advantage of their fear and try to siphon off money from them,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.On Monday, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) wrote to the state government to make blood donation from cured patients mandatory under the provisions of the Epidemic Act 1897.“To facilitate this procedure, a mandatory undertaking can be secured from all patients to report on the 15th day after the discharge or recovery. Thereafter, they will be tested for fitness to donate blood. A separate plasma bank may be formed for the procedure at every place with the help of blood banks operating in the public and private sectors,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of the IMA of the Maharashtra wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-council-to-provide-data-on-plasma-donations-on-sbtc-website/story-hLPD6eEPfDuKyVJ9g8aH1O.html

The three victims were on their way to Nasik from Mumbai when the driver lost control of the car.The deceased, identified as Vishal Bhoye, 28, was driving the Nashik-registered car along with Amol Wable, 28 in the passenger seat, and Shama Deshmukh, 30, in the rear. According to Bhiwandi police, the three Nashik residents had come to Mumbai for some personal work and were returning home around 1.50am.“Bhoye was driving fast and as it was raining, he lost control of the car, rammed into the divider and turned turtle in the opposite lane. A bus then collided with the vehicle. Bhoye died on the spot and the other two were taken to a nearby hospital, where Wable succumbed to his injuries. We have registered a case against Bhoye under IPC 304 A, for rash driving and causing death. We informed their families on Wednesday morning,” said an officer from Narpoli police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-killed-1-injured-after-car-rams-into-divider/story-zsH9ehQ1nOGzLT1AkbkR0L.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||Every Covid case is alarming for us: Aaditya Thackeray||Aaditya Thackeray, state environment minister and guardian minister of Mumbai suburbs, elaborates on the city’s preparedness in tackling the Covid-19 situation. Edited excerpts: Mumbai’s Covid numbers show improvement, but is the city doing better? When will it open up?In terms of the pandemic and when it will get over, the World Health Organization (WHO) knows, or ‘who knows?’ It [the virus] is something we are adjusting to. What is important is to have medical buffer beds as we have embarked on Mission Begin Again. Mission Begin Again started four weeks ago. In Mumbai, testing was liberalised one week ago. We have still not seen what we would call a surge in cases. But can we be sure that it will not rise anymore? That is something we cannot predict. It totally depends on how we, as citizens, respond to this virus and take precautions. There have been countries around the world that have opened up and shut down. We don’t want to do that back and forth. Mumbai will open up in a staggered manner. Every step towards opening up will be supported with buffer beds. For example, last week when we increased shop timings to 9am to 7pm, and we allowed hostels to partially open up, we added 3,500 beds and 220 ICU beds to the city’s capacity.What is your assessment of Mumbai’s performance?We have to always be on alert. As the BMC, state, fire brigade and police, response from the administration has been great in terms of identifying the cases, tracing high-risk groups and isolating index patients. On the medical response side, the line of treatment has evolved every week. Like for example, in March, a couple of doctors told me about oxygen intervention that helped us identify susceptible people, so medical practitioners have been working very hard to give it the best shot and save as many lives as is possible. In terms of response from citizens, today we have over one crore people on the road, even as Mumbai is coming out of lockdown in a staggered way. But everyone is wearing masks, everyone is disciplined. People are now settling into the mode of “there will be cases, how do we take precautions?” The response has been very good. If you compare Mumbai to cities around the world which are equally populous, such as New York, Moscow, Sao Paulo, then Mumbai has done better than expected. Today, Mumbai’s doubling rate is 51 days. Our recovery rate is 70%. We have 7,000 empty beds. Last Monday, we liberalised testing, so testing is no longer on the basis of a doctor’s prescription. No one can say Mumbai is not testing enough. Tests have increased from 4,500 to almost 7,000, yet the number of cases in the past three weeks has steadily dropped from 1,400 to 1,200 to 950 on Monday. Ambulances are plenty. Currently, the death rate in hospitals has reduced. Since BMC has begun to inform people they are positive, instead of the earlier practice where labs communicated this to the patient, the panic among people has come down, as they know where to go and what to do if they are positive. We have evolved every week and we have come to understand the virus more in terms of tackling it. You have to understand the enemy when you are fighting it. What will be done to revive the city’s economy once it is completely out of lockdown?It is generally the human spirit that will push the economy to revive. There is one country that did not choose to lockdown at all – I was reading in New York Times the other day – this country has a death rate higher than that of the United States. Their economy contracted by 4%, and their unemployment is at 9%. When you have a high mortality and infection rate, even if you open up, the economy is not going to run. The first thing we have to safeguard is lives.We have to sustain this period. This is not a usual calamity. It is not like a flood or an earthquake, which has come and gone. We are in the middle of a pandemic. Once this is over, we will be supportive of each other as people and as governments to get back on our feet.Now the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) is seeing a high number of Covid cases. Did the government delay in ramping facilities in MMR?Initially, no one knew what the outbreak will be, but now we are able to understand it better. The virus has moved in two ways, from Mumbai’s slums to its high-rises, and from Mumbai to MMR. So in big cities, we are now ramping up capacity. Earlier, everyone thought that whatever capacity these cities had was enough. Nonetheless, the chief minister took a meeting with all new municipal commissioners appointed three weeks ago. Everyone is working in full swing in Navi Mumbai, Thane, Mira-Bhayander, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath and Badlapur. All guardian ministers have been taking updates every day. I have been speaking to all municipal commissioners every day. What is being done to contain the outbreak in MMR?First of all, we are looking at a bed capacity of 40,000 to 50,000 for all of MMR. In Mumbai today, jumbo facilities have around 20,000 beds. Institutional beds in hospitals are around 8000. Similarly, municipal commissioners in MMR are working. I visited Kalyan and Thane, and I plan to visit Bhiwandi. We have set models in terms of chasing the virus, testing people, and also quarantine facilities. I took [assistant commissioner of the G/North ward] Kiran Dighavkar with me to tell them what the Dharavi model is. So it is these simple things that will help us get ahead of the virus in MMR. All municipal commissioners have been told that first they need to have standard operating procedures in place. I want to ensure there is strict division of work and coordination among all teams. Will the Dharavi or Worli model be relevant in MMR?Yes. Essentially the Dharavi or Worli model, or the Bandra-East or Govandi, or E-ward model, is that BMC has aggressively chased the virus. We have an entire team working on creation of jumbo facilities. Similarly, different teams are working on ramping up hospital beds and procurement of medical equipment. One is a medical response team working on putting together private hospitals, doctors, smaller clinics, and preparing medical response to the virus. And finally, we have a team that is leading the data analytics. That is what is really helping Mumbai. Likewise in MMR also, a lot of cities are now in lockdown, but when we start opening up aspects of life such as shops in Mumbai and offices working at 10% capacity, and manufacturing industries across Maharashtra, it is important to create buffers, control mortality, and analyse data to predict what could happen, where the virus could move, how it could move, what is the most targeted age group. These are questions the whole world is targeting. Population living in MMR or in Mumbai is equal to population of some of the smaller countries in the world.Mumbai’s suburbs have not been doing well. Are interventions working?The first outbreak was in G South ward, which my constituency is part of. Then it moved to Dharavi, then the E ward in Byculla and Mumbadevi, then it moved to Govandi. We have noticed the virus takes about two weeks to grow and move. BMC is going in and taking out high-risk contacts [in suburbs]. We have observed that the higher the number of people we take in as high-risk contacts, the faster we can control the epidemic in any area. That is what all ward officers have been doing. I make it a point to speak to every ward officer every alternate day. I have been telling them, “Don’t be afraid of the numbers. A lower number does not mean a lesser rate of infection, and a higher number does not mean a higher rate of infection. A higher number means you have been successful in identifying so many people. It is a pandemic. About 25% of the population is going to be affected by it.” The success of a ward officer lies in how many cases he can identify, quarantine, isolate and treat. Isn’t Mumbai’s fatality rate at 5.6% alarming for the state?Every case is alarming for us, not just the deaths because our primary job in an epidemic or a pandemic is to safeguard all citizens. In terms of mortality, the first thing we have been doing is chasing the virus. Most deaths are among patients who have come after a week of fever or symptoms, or after ignoring symptoms or self-medicating. I would say, please go to a doctor.On our part, we are chasing the virus. Instead of the patient coming to us, we are going to the patient, we are going to homes, checking oxygen saturation, temperature, for early detection of cases. For line of treatment to keep mortality in check, we have oxygen concentrators of 5 litres and 10 litres, high rising oxygen cannulas, ventilators. Each week, there is a new line of treatment coming out. But we are at the forefront of trying different medicines and being successful at it. Maharashtra has world’s largest blood plasma trial. All of these medicines [remdesivir, tocilizumab, tamiflu and favipiravir] are being used and procured as soon as companies get licence. As we go ahead in time, these will be commonly available. In BMC hospitals, it will be available for free. Last week, companies got permission to manufacture.Is there a shortage of medicines?In BMC hospitals, they are easily available. Maharashtra is getting remdesivir and tocilizumab on a large scale. The only issue has been licensing from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). The chief minister requested the Prime Minister in a video-conference to expedite the licensing process. After that request, the PM expedited it in 24 hours and all companies got licences for them.Will the government focus more on using jumbo Covid facilities as prime centres of Covid care?The CM asked the MMRDA in March to create a jumbo facility because he foresaw that we would fall short of beds because of the number of international passengers we were getting. Jumbo facilities are places where Covid care is most professional. They are facilities designed to handle Covid care at a single site, with contact-less clinics, PPE donning and dropping areas, negative pressure ICUs. These make jumbo facilities better equipped to manage Covid cases. We are creating enough beds in jumbo facilities and hospitals. Going forward, there will be a balance in Covid and non-Covid care at hospitals. Elective surgeries will happen. However, I have requested all non-Covid hospitals to have triage areas. To refuse a patient is not fair. So they should take in a Covid patient if he comes in, give primary care, and send him to a Covid hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/every-covid-case-is-alarming-for-us-aaditya-thackeray/story-Nv0g7DdvWQtT4izAzxEb1K.html
16-07-2020||Mumbai||In 15 days, city surpasses July average; heavy rain likely today||Mumbai surpassed its July average for rainfall on Wednesday with 15 days left till the end of the month.

By afternoon, this wind direction changed to easterly for a brief period. This anti-clockwise shift in wind direction will lead to further dense cloud formation, allowing intense showers again. Moderate to heavy showers are expected till Friday.”Independent meteorologists concurred with IMD’s forecast. “Models also indicate a vortex formation near Mumbai late Wednesday night. Rains are likely to pick up going into Thursday morning,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.Akshay Deoras, meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom, said, “The cut-off from westerly winds (conducive to rainfall) happens whenever a low pressure system comes close to Mumbai. While the wind transition is expected overnight with disruptive spells making a comeback on Thursday, rain may continue with brief breaks through Thursday afternoon and evening as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-15-days-city-surpasses-july-average-heavy-rain-likely-today/story-fUsdzv9szbwjPP1jQj9OxO.html

16-07-2020||Mumbai||Part of 80-year-old bldg collapses in Grant Road, two injured; 20 families evacuated||Two people were reported injured and around 20 families were evacuated, as a portion of a three-storey 80-year-old dilapidated building collapsed on Wednesday afternoon in Grant Road. According to the Maharashtra Housing and Development Authority (Mhada), the building was a cess dilapidated building, and the residents were already issued a notice for vacating it in 2018.According to the disaster management cell of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the portion of the house wall on the first floor collapsed at around 1pm on Wednesday afternoon in which two residents sustained minor injuries. Mhada officials said they have inspected the site. A call will be taken on whether the building should be completely demolished or be repaired after the experts submit their opinion on Thursday.Anil Rathod, an engineer from Mhada said, “We have inspected the site, and on Thursday architects will inspect the site, post which we will decide whether the complete building should be demolished or the damaged part be repaired. It will depend on the stability of the entire structure which is around 80-year-old. We had issued notice to the society in 2018 for vacating the same, but residents did not.”Rathod added, “There are 16 residential units in the three-storey building and four commercial units in the building having their tenancy. On Wednesday, after the collapse, around 50 residents were probably evacuated. We are offering the residents space in transit camps immediately until the future course on their building is decided. Prima-facie there are no Covid-19 cases in the building, and we are allotting apartments in transit camps to the residents on Thursday morning itself.”The tenants will be given apartments in Magathane and Gorai area, in Borivli transit camps of Mhada. The two injured in the incident are the landlords of the structure and were rushed to HN Reliance Hospital from where they were discharged by Wednesday evening, BMC said in a statement.In south Mumbai, Mhada’s repair and reconstruction board has over 14,000 buildings that are a century-old. Every year Mhada undertakes a structural audit of these structures before monsoon and releases a list of the most dangerous buildings. Last month, the Mhada had announced 18 buildings, including the Esplanade Mansion marking it as ‘most dangerous’ for residing.Meanwhile, a level two fire was reported at Maker Bhavan near Churchgate station on Wednesday at around 4.13am.

16-07-2020||Chandigarh||No weekend curfew for now, Chandigarh admn to go for random Covid-19 testing||Even as the UT administration on Wednesday decided against imposing weekend curfew in the city, it will initiate random testing for checking spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) here. It also ordered complete ban on physical press conferences.Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, in the war room review meeting held here on Wednesday, asked the director of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) to collect samples of OPD and emergency patients and conduct random testing.Random testing was suggested by some PGIMER doctors, who were advocating that the move will help in gauging the actual spread of the disease in the city.Justifying the decision, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “Patients from all parts of the city visit PGIMER. It was considered prudent to collect samples from this set of residents rather than from other areas. This would better indicate the spread of the disease without causing inconvenience to city residents.”PGIMER has started tele-OPD. On an average, 1,200-1,500 patients are registered every day in the OPD. Between 600 and 900 patients are examined physically.WEEKEND CURBS STILL ON TABLEEven though the administration has decided against imposing weekend curfew, it is still under consideration. “After taking expert views on the issue, it was unanimously decided that weekend curfew is not warranted as of now, and it may not be the best strategy to contain the spread of the disease,” Parida said.Unlike some other states, including Punjab, the UT administration is favouring micro-containment zones over lockdown of the entire city for restricting the spread of Covid-19.“Instead of city lockdown for shorter periods, we can go for stricter perimeter control in pockets which are reporting higher incidence of cases. But, we have not totally ruled out the weekend curfew or short period lockdown for the entire city. We will again assess the situation next week and take a call on it,” the adviser said.All PHYSICAL PRESS CONFERENCES BANNEDBadnore, in the meeting, ordered for a complete ban on physical press conferences, where there is a risk of infection due to large gatherings. He also appealed to all political parties not to hold any gatherings or functions as these violate the Union home ministry guidelines, which permit only events like weddings and cremations as exceptional cases.Significantly, all social, religious, cultural and other functions are banned, except for marriage and cremation. Gathering of people for any other event is not allowed. Despite this, political parties have been calling press conferences where the head count has been reported to go beyond 50.The senior superintendent of police has been directed to lodge FIRs in case of illegal gathering of any kind in the city.Badnore decided that there should be more vigorous screening, testing and stricter implementation of orders regarding social distancing and wearing of masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-weekend-curfew-for-now-chandigarh-admn-to-go-for-random-covid-19-testing/story-P2fQDOBh9lavY0hXNjhmyN.html
16-07-2020||City||Thane death rate dropped during lockdown, claims civic chief Dr Vipin Sharma||The lockdown imposed in Thane city since July 2 has had a positive impact, claimed Thane municipal commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma, while talking to media persons on Wednesday. The city’s doubling rate has now increased to 23, and the death rate, as per the civic chief, has decreased to 1.5% in July, compared to 3.7% since March.Sharma claimed that the number of cases in some of the hot spots like Mumbra, Lokmanyanagar, and Wagale Estate was also decreasing.He, however, said that there is still no decision on extending the lockdown, and it will depend on the pattern of cases reported in the coming days.“We have managed to reduce the death rate to 1.5% by screening senior citizens and patients with comorbidities. A watch is kept on critical patients to ensure proper medical treatment is provided. We have also increased contract tracing and testing capacity in the city. Till June-end, we conducted 850 tests per day; today 1,700 tests are conducted, which will increase to 3,000 next week with the rapid antigen tests,” said Sharma.Of the total persons tested daily, 30% are positive for Covid, of which merely 5% show any symptoms and need hospitalisation.Sharma added that the survey of people in containment zones has also increased during the two-week lockdown. “We have seen positive results during the two-week lockdown, as cases have decreased in some of the areas; the doubling rate too has increased.”The civic chief added that the decision to extend the lockdown will be taken only after looking at the growth in cases.Payback time for hospitalsWith mounting complaints of private hospitals overcharging patients, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has now formed flying squads to keep a check on private hospitals that are now functioning as Covid hospitals. Dr Sharma informed that the hospitals will have to return the money to patients whom they had overcharged.“We have appointed flying squads to check on each hospital if patients who do not need ICU are admitted there. I have also issued directives to the hospitals to return the money to those patients whom they have overcharged, or action will be taken,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-death-rate-dropped-during-lockdown-claims-civic-chief-dr-vipin-sharma/story-h1KsNAnO6A14IKmUnujnXL.html
16-07-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Community spread cases in Amritsar go up by 174% in a month||The Amritsar district witnessed an increase of 174% in community transmission cases of Covid-19 in the last one month. Also, nearly two-thirds (67%) of the total cases reported in the district during the same period were that of community spread, wherein the patients had no travel history or were those with untraceable sources of infection. One of the worst-affected districts with the coronavirus in Punjab, Amritsar had reported 630 cases till June 15. But in the next 30 days (till July 15), the district added 517 cases, taking the total tally to 1,147.Of the 517 fresh cases in a month, 348 are of community transmission while the remaining are their close contacts. The district also reported 37 deaths due to Covid-19 during the same period.After relaxations in the nationwide lockdown were announced on May 19, it took 17 days (till June 5) for the district to record 100 cases of community transmission and another 10 days (till June 15) to reach 200-mark in the same category of infection. Of the total 840 Covid-19 cases reported in Amritsar since May 19, as many as 548 (around 65%) are of community spread, say health officials.“These community transmission patients were tested in flu corners after they showed symptoms of the disease. Their source of infection could not be traced but the health department and district administration are working hard to contain the further spread of the infection. People are moving in the markets without taking precautionary measures besides disobeying social-distancing norms ,” said Amritsar assistant civil surgeon Dr Amarjit Singh.He added, “We are testing over 800 people in the district daily. People are reluctant to get themselves tested and they are still hiding their symptoms from the health department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-community-spread-cases-in-amritsar-go-up-by-174-in-a-month/story-hVSIR8kHz7MKQJjftPaSnM.html

16-07-2020||Chandigarh||Remove encroachment from village ponds within 6 months: HC to Punjab||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday asked Punjab government to remove all the encroachments and unauthorised constructions raised on village ponds within six months. The high court bench of justice Rajiv Sharma and justice HS Sidhu also asked the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to monitor quality of water of village ponds. DCs across the state have been directed to ensure that no untreated sewerage/sewage is discharged in the village ponds. The mining activity of any nature whatsoever in the village ponds throughout the state is banned, the court said adding that stringent action be taken against the defaulters. The high court was hearing a plea of one, Tejinder Kumar and others from Jalandhar who had levelled allegations of illegal sand mining from a pond in Kang Araya village, Phillaur, Jalandhar.The government had told court that the district development and panchayat officer, Jalandhar, is seized of the matter and had sent mining officials to visit the spot to verify the facts. Appropriate action will be taken in this case, the government had told court.The high court bench took suo motu note of the petition and has issued directions which are to be implemented across the state. “The village ponds are essential for re-charging of ground water. The village ponds are part of eco-system and also support aquatic life,” the bench said, adding that maximum number of village ponds have been encroached upon and unauthorised construction has been raised with impunity.“The encroachment has also been made on catchment areas as well. The untreated sewerage/sewage is permitted to be let off in the village ponds affecting the fragile ecology of the area. There is urgent need to revive, conserve, preserve, repair, rejuvenate and restore village ponds,” the bench said adding that the village ponds support the regional eco-system and it is the constitutional/statutory duty of the gram panchayat to safeguard the water bodies/water sheds in their territorial jurisdiction.The bench has also directed that government would ensure that all village ponds are revived, repaired, renovated, rejuvenated after restoration within a period of six months and further that revenue record of these be upgraded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/remove-encroachment-from-village-ponds-within-6-months-hc-to-punjab/story-zgRNkc1BspTa2CEwChzJpN.html

On a positive note, the tally of recovered patients also crossed the 1.5 lakh mark with 3,606 more recoveries, taking the total to 152,613. The state’s recovery rate is 55.39%, less than the national rate of 63.24%. The state has 111,801 active cases, as of Wednesday. Also, health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has requested the Centre to include masks and sanitisers in the list of essential commodities, so as to cap their prices.Mumbai retained its stable rate of rise in cases by reporting 1,374 new infections, which pushed Maharashtra’s worst-hit city’s tally towards the 1 lakh mark at 96,474, with 22,888 active cases. The past 24 hours also saw 233 new deaths across the state, taking the toll to 10,928. Of the latest fatalities reported, 62 are in Mumbai, 31 in Pune city, 15 in Kalyan-Dombivli, 11 in Pimpri-Chinchwad and nine each in Navi Mumbai, Jalgaon city and Nashik city. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state fell to 3.94% from 4.8% reported on June 16, 3.25% on May 25 and 3.37% on May 31. The national CFR is 2.60%. The CFR, too, has been on a decline as it dropped to 2.85% in the week’s average of July 9-15, from 3.21% during July 2-8, 3.51% in the week before that and 4.16% during June 17-24. The state saw 51, 916 cases and 1,480 fatalities in the past seven days with a daily average of 7,417 cases and 211 fatalities. 35,962 tests were conducted in more than 110 laboratories across the state in the last 24 hours, making the positivity rate 22.17%. The progressive positivity rate of the state is 19.56%, after the tally of tests stood at 14, 08,901. Of them 2,75640 people tested positive. Although the daily number of new cases is rising in the state, the state share of cases in the country has dropped to 28.6% from over 30% last month. State authorities felt that compared to other states, Maharashtra has fared well in containing the spread. “With the concentrated efforts in the most affected cities, we can do better over the next few weeks. If the smaller towns and rural areas could control the spread effectively, the flattening of the curve could be achieved by the end of August,” said a state official.Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and member of the expert committee appointed by the state to recommend steps to curb the spread, said that the virus infection is expected to stabilise in August. “We have seen a major drop in cases in Mumbai as the weekly average of cases has dropped to 8,400 from more than 10,000 in May. There is inflow of the patients from other adjoining cities, which has also added to the number of cases in Mumbai. We can expect stabilisation of cases even in other cities in next few weeks and then a downward trend in August.”Dr Supe said that the state government’s steps of making antiviral drugs like remdesivir, tocilizumab in the public hospitals are going to play a significant role in treatment and will help in bringing down the CFR.Meanwhile, state health minister Rajesh Tope announced steps will be taken to cap the prices of the masks and sanitisers. Tope said that besides requesting the Centre to enlist masks and sanitisers as essential commodities to control prices, the state government has also constituted a committee to restrict their prices. “Central government has delisted these commodities from bringing them out of government control. In such a case, there will be no control on hoarding and selling prices of the masks and sanitisers. We are requesting the Centre to put them again in the list so that action can be taken by police or food and drugs administration. Without waiting for the Central government decision, we have constituted a committee and a cap on the prices will be imposed in a week’s time,” said Rajendra Shingne, minister, food and drugs administration.Tope said masks and sanitisers are being sold at inflated prices. “When we are making them mandatory, the commodities should be affordable to the poor class too. Against their cost of production of ₹15-20, masks are being sold at prices ranging between ₹100 and ₹300. Once we receive the legal opinion and the report by the committee, the decision over capping of prices will be taken in next five to six days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-19-tally-crosses-2-75l-recoveries-exceed-1-5l/story-W2V9B3dPBWFPEIw1BJyAJI.html

The supply of green forage throughout the year is important for farmers to maintain production from ruminant stock.Most of the cultivated fodder is grown in the state and only about 7% area is under fodder crops.Another source of fodder is from grasses and shrubs that grow abundantly on the rangeland and roadsides during the monsoons.Most of these reach their flowering stage during August-September. Grass that grows during monsoons have large water and fibre content. The water fills up the stomach and therefore is of no use. This causes animals to pass watery dung. Livestock farmers must chop some of the young grass and dry it in sunlight before feeding. It will absorb water from the grass and will turn it into a good feed.Rain during harvests can affect quality due to leaching, which leads to movement of water-soluble components out of the forage.Many of the compounds are highly digestible carbohydrates. Almost one-third of the dry matter leached by rain is soluble carbohydrates. Generally, lactic acid bacteria produce sufficient acid and reduce pH quickly enough to inhibit clostridia from growing. However, a quick pH drop is more difficult to achieve when forage is wet and/or low in sugars, due to overcast conditions or even rain-leaching.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/store-animal-feed-safely-during-monsoons-ludhiana-vet-varsity-expert/story-dTcph7pNG6cvweG473ZExL.html
16-07-2020||Delhi||To ramp up coronavirus testing, Delhi clinics put TB machines to use||In a bid to expand coronavirus disease (Covid-19) testing in the national capital, the Delhi government has started using two machines usually used to detect tuberculosis, to diagnose for the Sars-Cov-2 virus.The CBNAAT (Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test) and TrueNat machines have been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) as confirmatory tests for Covid-19, which means an additional reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is not needed to confirm the result, as required in the case of rapid antigen testing, for instance.RT-PCR is the most reliable test for Covid-19.Also read: Beaten projections but can’t be complacent, says Delhi CM on Covid-19 situation“Delhi has started using the CBNAAT and TrueNat machines over the last two to three days. These are just different mechanisms of doing the same molecular testing,” an official from the Delhi government said, asking not to be named.The city scaled up its testing considerably in the third week of June by deploying the antigen-based method, first within containment zones and then in other areas as well. Antigen tests are highly sensitive, meaning those who test positive are considered to be “true positives”. However, as the specificity is low those who test negative have to undergo an RT-PCR test if they are symptomatic, or the doctor suspects the infection.As of Wednesday evening, Delhi has tested a total of 736,436 samples, which translates to a testing per million rate of 37,167. The national capital has 116,993 cases of Covid-19. While CBNAAT and TrueNat machines test fewer samples in a cycle, the tests are faster than a traditional RT-PCR test and can be used by hospitals’ emergency departments.Also read: Rapid antigen tests high on accuracy, but protocols crucial“With different kits, the machines used for TB diagnosis can be used to test for Covid-19 too. The main advantage is that test results can be provided in an hour, in comparison to around six hours it takes for the RT-PCR test, so it can be used in cases of emergencies to check for Covid-19 before performing a surgery or procedure,” said Dr KK Chopra, director, New Delhi TB Centre, one of the centres using the method.According to him, there are at least 32 such centres in Delhi with CB-NAAT machines and several more with TrueNat machines that were deployed this year. The machines are also available with most of the major hospitals in the city.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had approved these methods for preliminary Covid-19 testing in April, with many states already using it in remote areas that do not have RT-PCR machines. In May, with newer kits, the machines were approved for confirmatory testing. The machines are being used to diagnose Covid-19 in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh, among others.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “Earlier, the kits available for these machines could detect only the ‘E’ gene that is common to all coronaviruses. Hence, a confirmatory RT-PCR test had to be done for those that tested positive. Now, there is a two-step process in place which is as accurate as the RT-PCR test. The second step can detect the RdRp enzyme specific to Sars-Cov-2 that causes Covid-19, so there is no need for a confirmatory test anymore,” said Dr Chopra.CBNAAT or GeneXpert has single-use cartridge that contains the reagents needed for RNA amplification. A biosafety level 2 (BSL2) lab is needed to conduct the tests. The TrueNat is a smaller, battery operated machine that needs minimal laboratory infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-ramp-up-testing-capital-s-clinics-put-tb-machines-to-use/story-DquBTuOx7Nw5LcGUiYT0fI.html

Grocery, vegetable and ration store owners across the city insisted that the pattern of purchase was also different, with a large number of visitors buying goods in bulk, with bills even running into five digits in some cases.“Usually, my stock of potatoes and onions last for 3-4 days. However, today morning there was a major demand for both the items. The overall rush too was marginally higher than usual. The stock of potatoes and onions, which can last for more than a month before going bad, disappeared within a few hours. Few of my customers said they were buying in bulk as they wanted to stock up in case the city went into another lockdown or curfew,” said Anil Yadav, a vegetable vendor in Sector 50.Ankit Mehta, a distributor of grocery, ready-to-cook meals and spices for a private company said that there was a 5-8% surge in sales on Wednesday.“Normally, we see a spike in sales during the first week of every month, when people just get their salaries. Hence, seeing a spike in the middle of the month is very unusual for us. Our customers informed us that there was a rumour circulating that the city may see a curfew over the weekend like some of the other states and hence, they wanted to stock up adequately,” said Mehta.Shiv Kumar Sharma, deputy manager of a Kendriya Bhandar outlet in sector 56, said that people were purchasing in bulk on Wednesday, with bills running between Rs 4,000-5,000 and into five figures in some cases.“A block in this locality, which has more than 400 flats, became a containment zone on Monday. Hence, the total number of visitors I had today was low. Despite this, the total business on Wednesday was almost the same. Most customers, purchased ration in large quantities that could easily last them for nearly two months. In some cases, the bills crossed Rs 10,000,” said Sharma.At a supermarket, in a mall on Golf Course Road, such was the rush at the counter during the afternoon that people had to stand in queues for at least 10-15 minutes.“The supermarket at South Point Mall is usually crowded. However, today, the rush was much higher than usual. People were purchasing different types of goods that have a long-shelf life and filling their trolleys to the brim. It took the cashier at the counter nearly 3-5 minutes to finish one billing,” said Shivam Bansal, a resident of DLF 5.On Tuesday, while speaking to the media in Ambala, Vij indicated that the government was contemplating enforcing some form of restrictions, such as a curfew, in Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat, and Jhajjar— all adjoining Delhi.Delhi is one of the worst affected states in the country having witnessed 11,69,93 cases so far, with 3,487 deaths. Vij said that the government is also considering sealing the borders with the national capital.He said that together the four districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat, and Jhajjar account for nearly 80% of the total cases in Haryana and to curb the spread of the infection “stricter curbs” may be needed. He said that a final decision on the matter will be only taken after discussions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/curfew-fears-trigger-panic-buying-customers-empty-out-shelves-at-grocery-stores/story-ptkSytVhGxAxmPxN1d2bzO.html
16-07-2020||Noida||Noida doctor tests Covid-19 positive again, 45 days after recovering from first bout of infection||A doctor at the Gautam Budh Nagar district hospital has tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for a second time, 45 days after being cured of the infection, said his colleagues. Experts and biologists, however, said a reinfection was unlikely and it could be that the person never fully recovered from the first infection.The doctor first tested positive on May 15 when he was working in the isolation ward of Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute (Child PGI), following which he was admitted to that ward itself. He was discharged from the hospital on May 30 after testing negative for the virus. After the mandatory quarantine period (of about 10-15 days), he resumed work at the emergency ward of the district hospital in Sector 30.About two weeks ago, he complained of dizziness, said one of his colleagues . “He had no symptoms such as fever or cough, but we didn’t want to take any chances. He was made to take a rapid antigen test, where came positive. For reconfirmation, he was tested again on June 27 through the lab-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, the definitive test for Covid-19, and that too was positive,” the doctor’s colleague said, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. When contacted, Dr VB Dhaka, the chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the district hospital, declined comment. “I’ve recently taken this charge and don’t know about this case, so I am unable to comment on it,” he said.Acting chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Nepal Singh did not answer his phone or reply to text messages, despite several attempts to reach him.Microbiologists, however, said it cannot be assumed that the man was reinfected. “There are many possibilities. Many who are doing the RT-PCR test are not well acquainted with the process, and so we need to check if the reporting was done correctly. The virus can also persist in the body for a very long time -- even up to 45 days in rare cases. Also, there are issues like tests giving out false positives and false negatives,” Dr Shobha Broor, former head, microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, said.Dr Saurabh Srivastava, the head of Covid-19 ward at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, said to his knowledge, the body’s immune system is designed to fight infections by producing antibodies. “It’s believed that people who have had the virus would have developed Covid-19 antibodies and, hence, would have some level of protection from a recurrent infection. So, there is a possibility that this particular patient may not have fully recovered the first time. Also, the fading away of protective antibodies from the body in some cases cannot be ruled out,” he said.Experts say there is no evidence of a reinfection globally. “There is experimental evidence from monkeys that once infected, there is a resistance to a reinfection. In humans, reinfection has not been observed in recovered patients, despite the fact that several months have passed since the first wave of the pandemic. We do not know whether this could be necessarily attributable to antibodies, but the rise of antibodies is correlated to the disappearance of the virus. So, in a nutshell, there is a reason to believe that recovery from infection is associated with the gaining of at least a short-term immunity, courtesy the antibodies,” Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research), Delhi, had told HT on July 5.Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said he is looking into the matter. “If there is a chance of reinfection, then we will have to take additional precautions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-doctor-tests-covid-19-positive-again-45-days-after-recovering-from-first-bout-of-infection/story-LYZiGABP4oDE8602reUeUJ.html
16-07-2020||Noida||Biomedical waste trebles in Noida since onset of Covid-19||With the number of Covid-19 cases being reported from the city on the rise, the biomedical waste being generated by the city, too, has increased threefold over the last four months, even as agencies managing bio waste assert that the volume of non-Covid waste generated by hospitals has dropped. According to the Noida authority and the agency managing bio waste, earlier the city hospitals, dispensaries and pathologies generated 800 to 900kg of biomedical waste every day (before March), but it has now increased to at least 3,000kg daily (in July). Of the 3,000kg, 2,100 to 2,200kg has been labelled Covid-19 waste, and is collected in yellow bags and incinerated, officials said. The rest of the waste -- about 750 to 800kg -- is non-Covid and even that includes a large number of PPE kits generated from hospitals, dental clinics and dispensaries not dealing with Covid-19. “We ensure that all Covid-19 waste is collected and managed properly. The volume of waste generated is also increasing, particularly since Mid-May. Most of the new waste includes PPE kits, gloves, masks etc. Private agencies hired by us collect the bio waste from the Covid-19 hospitals and isolation centres, and a separate agency collects it from those who are home quarantined,” SC Mishra, project engineer, health, Noida authority, said. While the waste has doubled, none of the workers handling the bio waste has been so far contracted Covid-19 or shown any symptoms, the agencies manager said.According to experts, the biomedical waste is segregated through four coloured categories – yellow, red, white/transparent and blue.Of this, yellow includes organic waste such as human tissues, body parts, blood bags, bandages, expired medicines, chemicals, plasters and is treated through incineration. The Covid-19 waste that includes PPE kits etc. also comes under the same category. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines, revised in June, the general waste contaminated by blood/body fluids of persons infected with Covid-19 shall be segregated in the yellow bag along with gloves and masks used by them.The red bag includes plastic wares and is treated though sterilisation followed by recycling. The while bag collects metals and plastics such as syringes and scalpels which are either encapsulated in lime or the metal is recovered after sterilisation. The blue bag is for glassware and is recycled“The load has increased a lot, and the waste is being collected as per the latest pollution control board’s guidelines. The waste being generated includes a large number of PPE kits, masks and gloves, syringes, a lot of waste food, food packing materials, and human waste, in some cases. This is an entirely new genre of waste that we are collecting in yellow bags, and they are handled with extreme precautions. The waste is more than double of what we had been managing earlier. So we had to increase the staff strength and press into service 10 extra vehicles to transport all the waste to our incinerator facility in Meerut,” said Sanjay Kaushik, CEO Synergy, the agency that handles biomedical waste across 33 districts of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Bihar. “The non-Covid biomedical waste, which used to be about 900kg a day, before the pandemic, has dropped to around 600 to 800kg now, and even a lot of that is PPE kits generated from non-Covid hospitals and pathologies,” Kaushik said. While the hospital and quarantine facilities are generating a substantial amount of waste, about 40 kilos are also being collected through door-to-door pickup from those in home quarantine.“We had been collecting Covid-19 waste such as masks and gloves from over 200 home quarantine spots since mid-May. We had to train our staff to handle such waste which is now equivalent to biomedical waste and is collected in yellow bags. The volume is increasing, from just five to 10kg earlier to 40-45kg at present,” said Nagarjuna Reddy, project head, AG Enviro Infra Projects pvt ltd, the agency hired by the Noida authority to do the door-to-door collection of waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/biomedical-waste-trebles-in-noida-since-onset-of-covid-19/story-pLJlUyADoNItbmmBDKiymI.html
16-07-2020||Education||CBSE Class 10: At 82.61%, Delhi govt schools close in on private counterparts||The performance of government schools in Delhi improved by around 11 percentage points, from 71.6% in 2019 to 82.61% this year, in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 exams results announced on Wednesday. In contrast, the overall pass percentage of private schools dropped to 90.19% from 93.18% in 2019.The overall pass percentage of Delhi region also increased to 85.86% this year from last year’s 80.97%. But despite the improvement, government schools could not get past private schools in overall results unlike in the CBSE class 12 exams, where government schools fared better.The pass percentage of Delhi government schools has risen to 82.61% this year-- highest since CBSE reintroduced the compulsory board exams in class 10 in 2018. The government schools had recorded a pass percentage of 68.9% in 2017-18 and 71.6% in 2018-19. Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia congratulated the students. “Our children have made us proud again! After record breaking results of Class 12, the upward graph of Delhi Education continues in Class 10. Overjoyed that this year, the result improved to 82.61% from 71.58% last year Congratulations to #TeamEducation. You have really raised the bar!” he tweeted.In gender-wise performance in government schools, 78.64% boys passed as compared to 86.76% girls. The gap is marginally less in private schools where 86.20% boys passed this year as compared to 92.49% girls.According to the data provided by the Delhi government, out of 1,005 schools from which students took the class 10 exams, 147 achieved 100% results. The number of 100% achiever schools was 60 last year. Similarly, the number of schools achieving 90% and above increased to 474 this year from 226 in 2019. Around 786 government school students scored 90% and above in aggregate. Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas (RPVV)-- the model schools of the Delhi government --- recorded a pass percentage of 99.33%. The average Quality Index (QI), which reflects the performance of each student, has also increased to 265.31 this year from 259.60 in 2019 in government schools. Government school principals said they had focussed on improving class 10 results since the beginning of the academic session. Mohammad Shariq, principal of a School of Excellence (SoE) in Kalkaji, said, “The school had extended extra help to students. We held special counselling sessions for parents of students who were slow learners and helped their children study at home. We gave extra classes to board students in winter vacations as well,” he said. The school recorded 100% results with the highest percentage being 95.6%. The principals said though they were yet to catch up with private schools in class 10, they were happy with the improvement. AK Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed school in Rohini, said, “The Delhi government had hired resource teachers and experts for board students this year. It helped a lot in preparing students for the board exams,” he said. Private schools principals cited reasons such as change in exam and the evaluation pattern as a possible reason behind the drop in their pass percentage. Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said the possible reason behind the improvement in pass percentage of government schools is the change in evaluation policy adopted by the CBSE in northeast Delhi, where the number of government schools are more than private schools. “The number of government schools in northeast Delhi is more than private schools. Many students in northeast Delhi appeared in only one or two subjects. They managed to get more marks under the new evaluation policy,” Arora said. The CBSE had cancelled exams of four subjects in northeast Delhi due to the communal riots in February. Though the board had announced in April that it would conduct exams in the region again in July, it could not be done due to the Covid-19 outbreak.These students were evaluated on the basis of a revised assessment scheme formulated by the board wherein average marks secured in best performing subjects are awarded in subjects that could not take place.Manju Sethi, principal of Bluebells School International in Kailash Colony, said the change in exam pattern might have led to the slight drop in pass percentage of private schools. The CBSE has 25% objective-type questions in all the subjects. “It is difficult to come up with a concrete reason for the drop in pass percentage of private schools. Students might have lost marks in objective-type questions. There is a possibility of a complete deduction of marks in multiple-choice questions. Also, we are really disappointed with fewer students getting full marks in scoring subjects like Mathematics,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cbse-class-10-at-82-61-delhi-govt-schools-close-in-on-private-counterparts/story-9BzTgZhdODVSpoMe3QPf7L.html
16-07-2020||Noida||Noida girl gets 497 out of 500 marks in CBSE class 10 exams||Sixteen-year-old Navya Rastogi is a big fan of science fiction. She likes logic and is a firm believer of the fact that co-ordination between thoughts and actions can always lead to good results.A student of Amity International School, Noida, Navya scored 497 (99.4%) marks out of an aggregate of 500 in her Class 10 CBSE exams, the results of which was declared on Wednesday. Navya now wants to pursue Commerce in Class 11 and Class 12.. “I never believe in keeping anything pending for tomorrow.

Navya wants to become a lawyer and said her aim was to join a good law university after she finished her Class 12.“I believe that it will be the best for my logical bent of mind,” she says.Navya scored 100 out of 100 marks in both Hindi and social science. In the remaining three subjects – mathematics, science and English – she scored 99.The other highest scorers from the district included Aniket Das (99.2%, Amity International School), Arpit Sinha (99%, Apeejay School), Chandrashekhar Dharmrajan (98.6%, Amity International School), Shirsho Sinha and Vanshika Singh (98.6%, both from Apeejay School), Udita Raj (98.4%, Delhi Public School, Noida), Arnav Modi (98.2%, Shiv Nadar School) and Shavalini Vashishtha (98.2%, Delhi Public School, Noida).Contacted, both Aniket and Arpit said they will be choosing science with mathematics in Class 11.In Delhi Public School, Noida, the highest school aggregate is 98.4% with 100% students securing a First Division. As many as 80 students have secured a perfect score in various subjects, out of which 22 students got 100 in Mathematics,19 in Hindi and 13 in French.In Apeejay School, Noida, out of 330 students who appeared for this examination, 136 (41.2%) students have secured 90% or above, in aggregate, with the school average aggregate being 84.95%.Elsewhere, at Amity International School, out of 521 students, 518 secured first division while three got second division.

16-07-2020||Delhi||Dip in scores above 90%, 95% in CBSE class 10 results||In contrast with this year’s class 12 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) results, which saw a huge spike in the number of high-scorers, the class 10 results declared on Wednesday showed a dip in the percentage of students who scored above 90% overall and 95% marks. While the former fell by 18%, the latter number dipped by 26.98%.This year, 184,358 and 41,804 students from across the country scored above 90% and 95% respectively, fewer than last year when 225,143 and 57,256 students scored in the same range. CBSE officials attributed this dip to the Covid-19 situation, saying it may have caused stress among students at the beginning of March while they were still appearing for their papers.Principals of private schools said that while the marking pattern has been similar to previous years, students have reported scoring less than expected marks in mathematics. This year, the board had introduced the option of choosing a basic mathematics paper, which would be simpler than the standard math paper.Madhulika Sen, principal, Tagore International School, said, “While teachers that the marking pattern wasn’t much different, one recent could be moderation. We will have to discuss and find out the exact reason. While mathematics and Hindi results weren’t as good as previous years, social sciences scores have seen a huge spike, where of 133 students, 107 students have scored above 90%. Generally, 40-45% of our students score above 90%. But this year, the number stands at 30%.”Ashruti Singhal, a math teacher at Amity International School in Mayur Vihar, said, “While we had to convince parents to let students opt for the basic mathematics paper, there wasn’t much difference between that and the standard math paper. Students had expected it to be simpler. In our school, however, 48 students scored between 95 and 99% in math, and 13 got 100.”“The students have scored around what we expected based on the marking pattern of previous years. However, some students said they expected to score higher in the basic mathematics paper,” said Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School. Of 174 students, 13 scored more than 95% overall, and 49 scored above 90%.Not everybody is, however, disappointed with the results. Sarita Batra, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) in Shalimar Bagh, said, “Our school has performed better than last year. While speaking to other schools, we found out that students have scored better in standard mathematics across multiple RPVV schools. Besides, class 10 students appeared for almost all exams. The average marking scheme implemented in class 12, where multiple papers weren’t conducted, might have increased the number of top scorers in those classes.”“To assess students during a challenging situation like the pandemic cannot be easy. Students were stressed due to the Covid-19 situation and yet our school has done better than in previous years. Of 236 students who appeared for the exams this year, 119 scored above 90%,” said Dharmendra Goyal, principal, Ahlcon Public School.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dip-in-scores-above-90-95-in-cbse-class-10-results/story-D0hsJsmC1yZy5Ye65MpdbI.html
16-07-2020||City||Mohali’s Ivy Hospital, doctor fined ₹50 lakh for medical negligence||The Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has fined a Mohali-based private hospital and its doctor ₹50 lakh in an alleged case of medical negligence filed by a Yamunanagar resident. Petitioner Anuj Gupta moved the commission on May 31, 2017, three years after his mother Kamlesh Rani died at Ivy Hospital in Sector 71, Mohali.His advocate Kavita Arora said the elderly woman was referred to the hospital from Yamunanagar on March 10.“After the first operation on March 11, the hospital asked the family to pay ₹ 2 lakh and prepared the discharge formalities on March 18 even as the family insisted that the patient is not well. Later, the hospital agreed to readmit her the same day. The hospital doctors did some re-exploration for a week and raised the second bill for ₹20-25 lakh,” she said. The patient was operated upon again on March 24, but she died on May 6 due to alleged complications in surgery.The hospital, in its defence, told commission that the complainant failed to show how it was negligent in any manner whatsoever. “The complainant has not produced any documentary evidence to prove that the death of the patient had any connection with the surgeries conducted or as a result of medical negligence on its part,” it was stated. Doctor Vijay Bansal, under whose supervision the surgery was conducted, stated in his reply: “The case was handled diligently. However, due to multiple factors, such as age, recurrent high grade cancer for two years, hypertension and weakness, she developed complications.”However, commission president Justice Paramjeet Singh Dhaliwal, in the judgment on June 30, 2020, observed: “Human life is most precious... It is true that medical negligence cases do sometimes involve questions of factual complexity... In the present case, complainant has been able to discharge the onus of proving on a balance of probabilities, the medical negligence averred against the hospital and the doctor.”The commission directed the hospital and Dr Bansal to pay ₹50 lakh “in lump sum, as compensation, for the death of the patient, including the expenses incurred on her treatment... along with interest at the rate of 7% per annum from the date of filing of this complaint till payment, along with ₹50,000 towards the litigation costs.” The hospital has not reacted to the judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-s-ivy-hospital-fined-50-lakh-for-medical-negligence/story-fguDPnttgIAnYWODSTZsxK.html
16-07-2020||Pune||Pune residents decry shortage of beds, ICU and no contact tracing||Pune Even as the city is seeing an increased number of Covid-19 cases, residents are also facing shortage of beds. In some cases it was found that while patients and their relatives are searching for an isolation bed for over 24 hours, no one from the administration has contacted them for testing the family members. While the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) estimated about 46k cases by July-end and accordingly a shortage of over 330 ICU beds. However, cases of shortage of beds have already started rising and citizens are finding it difficult to get isolation beds, ICU beds or even proper guidance at some places.Many councillors and representatives have come across people from their wards or assemblies complaining about bed shortage. BJP MLA Siddharth Shirole has been critical of the state government through his social media handles. The Shivajinagar MLA has launched a helpline number to coordinate between government agencies and direct people to the required facility. Shirole said, “It has been only close to two weeks since we started the helpline number and on an average we are receiving 30 to 40 calls with regards to non-availability of beds, ambulance, swab testing, and billing related issues. The utmost concern is unavailability of beds.” He said, “We use the dashboard to facilitate beds to patients, but often the dashboard is not updated on a real-time basis and so when the patient arrives at the hospital, they are sent back stating no beds. The situation is worse in private hospitals. As people from all socio-economic strata are getting affected, most prefer private hospitals which is leading to this imbalance of civic-run facilities being vacant whereas private hospital are overflowing with patients.”District collector Naval Kishore Ram on Wednesday instructed officials to increase contract tracing to contain the spread of the virus. The meeting was conducted for health officials from the three cantonment boards located in the district namely Pune, Khadki and Dehu road cantonment boards. “Covid care centres and institutional quarantines must be increased. Those quarantined must be stamped with the quarantined symbol,” he said.Patient kept with non-Covid patientsA 76-year-old male, tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday morning. He was feeling breathlessness and weak. The patient and his grandson, who was accompanying him in an ambulance, had come from Paud road to Koregoan Park to another hospital which has earlier claimed of having beds, but by the time the family reached the hospital they said that there were no more beds available. With limited oxygen supply, the patient was taken to Sassoon hospital where he was admitted to the emergency ward. The man said, “My grandfather also suffers from hypertension, diabetes and needs continuous oxygen supply. He has now been kept in an emergency ward with non-Covid patients. He keeps coming out of the ward taking off the oxygen mask. I had to get him from the ambulance, put him on stretcher and take him to the ward. We have demanded for an oxygen isolation bed in Covid-19 ward, but are yet to get it.”Sassoon General Hospital dean Dr Murlidhar Tambe was unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts. High-risk patient gets no bed for three days after testing positiveA 58-year-old woman suffering from hypertension, diabetes and kidney ailments and requiring dialysis could not find an isolation bed for three days even after testing positive. The woman, a resident of PCMC’s Thergaon, living with two sons who also tested positive for Covid, had to live in her house for three days till they got a bed. One of her sons who requested anonymity said, “My mother tested positive on Thursday and finally on Saturday we got a bed in civic-run YCM hospital. During this period we tried to get beds, but did not get any positive response. Mother requires dialysis and she used to visit the hospital for the same so it could be that she got infected from there. We did get calls from the state helpline numbers and we also used the dashboard but no help. She is still in the hospital and is stable. I and my brother have isolated ourselves at home while our mom is at the hospital. She requires ICU but there is a waiting list and she get oxygen facility now.”Dr Rajendra Wable, dean of YCM hospital, said that the hospital has over 50 ventilators which are yet to be installed due to shortage of manpower and experts. “We did try to get paramedical staff including nurses from Kerala who offered to help but they wanted a non-Covid ward to work at. We have created a dedicated ward for patients who require ventilation wherein ICU ward like treatment in terms of medication and non-invasive ventilation is provided. We have about 3-4 patients who are currently awaiting a ventilator bed,” he said.No contact tracing A woman who lives in Shivajinagar tested positive and needed an isolation bed. However, despite contacting four hospitals including civic body’s Naidu hospital, they were refused any bed. The test result came on Tuesday at around 9 pm from a private laboratory and after finding no bed, they decided to take their sister to their two-room home shared by five people. The patient’s sister said, “My sister works at a private eye clinic and started complaining about fever and itchiness in the throat a few days ago and we decided to test her. We searched for beds for hours and finally reached COEP college which is an isolation centre, but did not get any cooperation. In fact, they behaved rudely with us. After contacting local politicians and friends, we got a bed at Sinhgad isolation centre at Wadgaon where I also got tested since I was with her all along. During all this period we did not receive any call from PMC to test the rest of the family members which also includes our parents who are senior citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shortage-of-beds-icu-and-no-contact-tracing/story-Elfu0WSZObuR058cKwosNL.html

In its Budget 2020-21, the Delhi government had announced plans for curriculum reforms and creating a new board of education for the national capital.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday convened a joint meeting of these committees. “Our government schools have showcased exemplary performance in class 12 board exam results. This is a reflection of the work that has been done in the last five years. But 98% result is not enough, we have to work together to take education to the next level,” he said.The committee for creation of the framework for Delhi State Education Board will study global best practices in learning assessment, re-imagine current assessment practices and provide a roadmap for an innovative, student-friendly scheme of assessment to be followed by the new board. “The committee for the creation of a new curriculum for children up to the age of 14 years will study globally renowned best practices in curriculum and reforms and recommend what is best suited for Delhi,” the government said in a statement.The committee is mandated to re-imagine current curriculum, pedagogical practices and provide a roadmap for an innovative, student-friendly curriculum for the pre-primary, primary and upper primary stages in the schools of Delhi.“Our past results have been reflective of what can be done within the existing education system in the past five years, by bringing about massive transformation in the quality of education. But now, the team should think about redesigning the education system in a way that will suit the demand and challenges of the 21st century world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-begins-process-to-set-up-its-own-education-board/story-XWdeUDuaW4p5P8s17jSArM.html

For six days the family of the deceased contacted private hospitals with ICU beds as per the bed availability status displayed on Pune district online dashboard only to be denied the facility citing shortage of beds. The patient died on July 11.The deceased of Kalewadi area was working as a contract security guard at a private firm in Pimpri-Chinchwad. His wife is a waste picker with Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat (KKPKP) organisation. They have three married sons. Wife and one of the daughters-in-law have tested positive and are hospitalised.“My father was admitted to a nearby private hospital with fever and breathing problem on July 4. He was tested positive for Covid-19 with tuberculosis. Being an asthmatic for last 20 years, he also developed pneumonia symptoms. He underwent treatment at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital in Chinchwad for two days before he was shifted with other positive patients to one of the quarantine centres in Akurdi on July 7. His health condition worsened at the centre as he was forced to climb the stairs till fourth floor. He was immediately brought back to YCM hospital and doctors asked us to look for a ICU bed hospital citing shortage. So, all family members visited many private hospitals for ICU bed in vain,” said the patient’s elder son. The patient’s son said that many multi-speciality hospitals across Pimpri-Chinchwad denied admission citing shortage of ICU beds and his father was left to undergo treatment at the YCM general ward without ventilator and ICU facilities. “On July 10, we sought KKPKP’s assistance when my father’s medical conditioned worsened,” he said.According to the family, a private hospital agreed to provide ICU bed, but demanded Rs 2 lakh deposit. The family managed to pay Rs 20,000 and shifted patient from YCM hospital to the private hospital. “My father stopped breathing when we were taking him to the private hospital in an ambulance on July 11. Later, the doctors tried to revive him, but he died within half an hour,” said the patient’s son. Shrenik Mutha, a KKPKP member, said, “We contacted PCMC municipal commissioner and Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY) officials as the patient was eligible for medical assistance. It is sad that Pimpri-Chinchwad that prides itself as a medical tourism destination could not provide ICU bed facility for six days. The case also exposed the reality of bed availability dashboard. We can safely estimate that his total insurance cover was more than 5 lakhs. He did not die because of insufficient insurance cover, but lack of coordination between government agencies. He was betrayed by the system that is supposed to protect him.”Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal commissioner Sharvan Hardikar said, “I will look into the case and take action. We will soon set up PCMC dashboard on real-time bed availability and are increasing ICU bed capacity to provide medical facility to as many residents as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-patient-dies-as-family-fails-to-find-icu-bed-in-pvt-hospitals-for-six-days-in-pune/story-lhZHWzq5mcA7H7xwB93JEN.html

Following the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, lawyers approached the court seeking a way to contact their clients in jail. The court ordered the jail authorities to facilitate a lawyer-relative –inmate interface through the video calling facility. Following the directions, the jail authorities have been purchasing smartphones and till now at least 39 of 60 jails in the state have bought smartphones. The Yerawada jail administration has bought two smartphones while Kolhapur jail has obtained five smartphones, Nashik has four, Mumbai has two, Thane has three while Taloja has three smartphones.“Visiting jails was prohibited during the lockdown period and this smartphone-based video calling facility has been extended to the lawyers and relatives. The facility assists for lawyer-inmate interaction which is strictly monitored as per the jail norms. The video calling facility has already been started,” said Yerawada jail superintendent UT Pawar.To avail the facility, heir family members or lawyers need to send an email seeking appointment for the inmate and get themselves registered for the monitored video calling. Once the registration is complete, the authorities will inform them about the date and timings of the video conference.Once all the formalities are completed, video calling can take place in presence of jail authorities. The practice of communication between lawyers, relatives and inmates had been stopped due the coronavirus outbreak. Earlier, a meeting used to be organised at the jail campus as per the established procedure.Pawar said that dedicated email ids had been shared with the lawyers and relatives wherein they send in their appointments which is verified by the jail authorities. Yerawada jail has a capacity to house 2,449 inmates, but currently has at least 6,000 inmates. Advocate Milind Pawar, said, “This is a good step by the jail authorities as it prevents in-person meets which is not advisable during Covid-19. Meeting the accused lodged in the jail is mandatory for the lawyer and this was not taking place due the lockdown. This video calling facility is safe and meets the guidelines of the state government and is helpful to both the lawyer and the inmate,” he said. Coin box-based video callingThe jail authorities have also received directions to start a coin box-based voice calling facility for the inmates. With the implementation of the said facility, the inmates will be able to speak directly to their relatives through the coin box facility.The state jail authorities have purchased 60 such coin boxes and are in the process of procuring more to cater to the needs of all the jails in the state.What is the process?- A dedicated email id has been generated for each state prison- The lawyers and relatives must log on the website www.mahaprisons.gov.in to put in their request- yerwadacp1871@gmail.com is the dedicated email id for the Pune Prison- Lawyers/ relatives should include the name, barrack number and case details and send it to the email id mentioned above- The jail department informs them about the date and timing for the interaction- Current interaction is limited to 10 minutes only||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/yerawada-cental-jail-inmates-can-now-video-call-their-relatives-and-lawyers/story-v0yQscOdudt1SS6S97OT8N.html

Reuters previously reported that J&J is also in talks with the European Union.“Nothing has been finalized yet. We continue to have those discussions,” Wolk told Reuters. “People from the countries and the organizations we mentioned want to lock in a certain minimum level of capacity that they would get.”Wolk said that the “general construct” of the discussions is likely to take a form similar to AstraZeneca Plc’s deal with the U.S. government, which provided $1.2 billion in drug development aid to the U.K. drugmaker in exchange for locking in a delivery of around 300 million doses for fall 2020.AstraZeneca has also signed a contract with France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands for up to 400 million doses of its potential vaccine. It has also partnered with non-profits to ensure distribution to developing countries.Wolk added that these discussions will help Johnson & Johnson determine pricing for its vaccine, which the U.S. drugmaker intends to sell on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic.“The more demand we have the better and lower that cost would potentially be,” Wolk said.The company aims to begin manufacturing the vaccine later this year, depending on its success in clinical trials, he added.In its Thursday earnings call, J&J said it plans to start its first human trials of its Covid-19 vaccine on July 22 and could kick off late-stage studies as soon as September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/j-j-in-talks-with-japan-gates-foundation-to-lock-in-deals-on-covid-19-vaccine/story-0qvrVAZoOH7KveKZfxGJaN.html
16-07-2020||World||PM Boris Johnson appoints Indian-origin experts on new race commission||A new commission announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June in the wake of the Black Lives Matter campaign to look into race and ethnic disparities includes two Indian-origin commissioners: Samir Shah and Ajay Kakkar, officials said on Thursday.Chaired by education consultant Tony Sewell, the independent commission has 10 members. Shah is a former BBC journalist and former chair of the race relations think-tank Runnymede Trust, while Kakkar is professor of surgery at University College London.Other members include experts across fields such as science, economics, medicine, policing and community organising. The commission is expected to report findings on the priority areas of health, education, criminal justice and employment by the end of this year.The June announcement was flayed by the opposition Labour, which called on the Johnson government to implement recommendations of several previous studies into race and racism in the UK, instead of setting up another commission.Johnson said: “This cross-government Commission will examine inequality in the UK, across the whole population. I am thrilled we have assembled a group of ten talented and diverse commissioners, who each bring a wealth of experience from across a range of important sectors”.“The commission will be inclusive, undertaking research and inviting submissions where necessary. It will set a positive agenda for change”, he added on Thursday.The commission said it will review inequality in the UK, focusing on areas including poverty, education, employment, health and the criminal justice system, while looking at outcomes for the whole population.Shadow justice secretary David Lammy had dismissed Johnson’s announcement, stating that if the prime minister were serious about addressing racial inequalities, he should implement the recommendations of the many reviews already conducted.He said: “I made 35 specific recommendations in the Lammy review. Implement them. There are 110 recommendations in the Anjiolini review into deaths into police custody. Implement them. There are 30 recommendations in the Home Office review into the Windrush scandal”.“Implement them. Twenty six into Baroness McGregor’s review into workplace discrimination. Implement them. That’s what Boris has to do. And the Black Lives protests can stop and we can get on with dealing with the coronavirus”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-boris-johnson-appoints-indian-origin-experts-on-new-race-commission/story-Io7mqSI5JwHyeBrLSQJQcN.html
16-07-2020||World||Buffeted by bad polls, rally fiasco, Donald Trump names new campaign head||President Donald Trump has replaced the head of his re-election campaign with his deputy after weeks of bad poll numbers showing him trailing Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, by a widening margin, and continued hammering he has gotten for his handling of the Covid-19 epidemic.Bill Stepien, the deputy, is the new campaign manager, replacing Brad Parscale, who will stay on as a senior advisor for data and digital operations. Both men are veterans of Trump’s 2016 campaign. And more members of that team have been brought back such as Jason Miller, to head strategy, and other changes are expected.Trump trails Biden by more than 8 points in the RealClearPolitics average of all polls and by more than 9 points in FiveThirtyEight’s weighted average of polls. In some of the polls released this week, the president is behind the Democrat by double digits — 10 points in CNBC’s, 15 points in Quinnipiac University’s and 11 points in NBC/Wall Street Journal’s.A polls released Wednesday, just hours before Trump announced the campaign reshuffle, showed 62% of Americans believe the president is hurting efforts to combat the Covid-19 epidemic, and 67% said they don’t trust the information he is providing.Trump is trailing Biden also in the swing states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And, in possibly the most worrying sign for him was his shrinking lead over Biden in Texas, a deeply conservative state. Trump’s lead is down to 0.3 points.“I am pleased to announce that Bill Stepien has been promoted to the role of Trump Campaign Manager,” Trump announced in a tweet Wednesday evening. “Brad Parscale, who has been with me for a very long time and has led our tremendous digital and data strategies, will remain in that role, while being a Senior Advisor.”Trump did not cite reasons for the switch, but did go on to reveal in another tweet what seemed to be bothering him, with his own spin. He said his win in November will be a “lot easier” than in 2016 as “our poll numbers are rising fast (they are not), the economy is getting better (not yet, though there are signs), vaccines and therapeutics will soon be on the way (that’s a moving target)”.Parscale had headed the campaign from January 2018. But reports that the president had soured on him began appearing in recent weeks. There were some suggestions he had made a lot of money and that he sought to inject himself into campaign ads and had basically got himself into the president’s bad books.Parscale was widely blamed for the fiasco in Tulsa, Trump first post-Covid-19 rally, which was expected to signal his return to the campaign trail. The president, who likes to cite audience numbers and size, addressed a venue that was less than half full, and an overflow stage outside had to be pulled down because of poor attendance. Parscale had boasted of an expected turnout of a million people.A leadership change at the campaign just four months to voting may look ominous, but Trump pulled off a far more consequential overhaul in 2016, and further down the road. He had named Steve Bannon campaign CEO chair and Kellyanne Conway the campaign manager mid-August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/buffeted-by-bad-polls-rally-fiasco-donald-trump-names-new-campaign-head/story-axp1eQgBr2lHQ24NQkmMTK.html
16-07-2020||World||Russian hackers targeting vaccine trials, say UK, US, Canada||The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre on Thursday announced along with its counterparts in the United States and Canada that hackers based in Russia have been targetting research teams and organisations involved in developing a vaccine for coronavirus.The coordinated charge by the three countries identifies a group called APT29 (also known as ‘the Dukes’ or ‘Cozy Bear’) and concludes that the cyber group is “almost certainly part of the Russian intelligence services”.The UK centre released a report, revealing IP addresses and other details, adding that similar conclusion has also been reached by Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) and United States’ National Security Agency (NSA).Two major vaccine trials are underway at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.The Foreign Office called for an end to what it called “irresponsible cyber attacks by the Russian intelligence services, who have been collecting information on vaccine development and research into the Covid-19 virus”.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said: “It is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic. While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour, the UK and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health”.“The UK will continue to counter those conducting such cyber attacks, and work with our allies to hold perpetrators to account,” he added.The UK cyber security centre said the Russian group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets for intelligence gain.“Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in Covid-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of Covid-19 vaccines”, it said.In a separate statement, Raab alleged that Russian actors “sought to interfere” in the December 2019 UK general election. It is the first time a minister has claimed that Russia tried to interfere with the workings of British democracy.“On the basis of extensive analysis, the government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked government documents,” Raab said in a written statement to parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-hackers-targeting-vaccine-trials-say-uk-us-canada/story-cit5r39gDc1EwZguRcotiJ.html
16-07-2020||World||US Supreme Court clears way for 2nd federal execution this week||The US Supreme Court early Thursday cleared the way for a second federal execution this week. The vote to allow the execution of Wesley Ira Purkey to go forward was 5-4, with the court’s four liberal members dissenting.Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that “proceeding with Purkey’s execution now, despite the grave questions and factual findings regarding his mental competency, casts a shroud of constitutional doubt over the most irrevocable of injuries.” She was joined by fellow liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan.But a lower court put an emergency hold on the execution for one hour as it weighed issues in the case, further delaying what initially had been slated for Wednesday evening at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana.Purkey was convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing a 16-year-old girl before dismembering, burning and then dumping her body in a septic pond. He also was convicted in a state court in Kansas after using a claw hammer to kill an 80-year-old woman who suffered from polio.On Tuesday, Daniel Lewis Lee was put to death at the facility after his eleventh hour legal bids failed. It was the first federal execution after a 17-year hiatus.Lawyers for the 68-year-old Purkey, of Kansas, argued that he has dementia and is unfit to be executed. They said his condition has deteriorated so severely that he didn’t understand why he was being executed. They also said that if Purkey’s execution did not take place Wednesday, the government would need to set a new date. But government lawyers said there was no obstacle to going through with the execution Thursday if the Supreme Court lifted the injunctions.The issue of Purkey’s mental health arose in the run-up to his 2003 trial and when, after the verdict, jurors had to decide whether he should be put to death in the killing of 16-year-old Jennifer Long in Kansas City, Missouri. Prosecutors said he raped and stabbed her, dismembered her with a chainsaw, burned her and dumped her ashes 200 miles (320 kilometers) away in a septic pond in Kansas. Purkey was separately convicted and sentenced to life in the beating death of 80-year-old Mary Ruth Bales, of Kansas City, Kansas, who suffered from polio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-clears-way-for-2nd-federal-execution-this-week/story-Zs21JdJD4KPazugX9b3wyN.html

Businesses are closing at staggering rates and people losing their jobs equally fast.It is against this backdrop that an international coalition of cities has come forward with a novel plan to not only deal with the Covid-19 crisis but also recover from it.C40 Cities, an international coalition of urban leaders, has floated the idea that all residents will live in ‘15-minute city’. The concept talks about developing the infrastructure in such a way that all residents of a city are able to meet most of their needs within a short walk or bicycle ride from their homes.“This way, we will be giving streets back to people, by permanently reallocating more road space to walking and cycling, investing in city-wide walking and cycling networks and green infrastructure,” C40 said on its website.This will make the lives of the people more convenient, less stressful and more sustainable, it said.This is a part of C40 Mayors Agenda for Green and Just Recovery in the wake of Covid-19. The agenda was led by C40 mayors around the globe and released on Wednesday.C40 is a coalition of mayors of 96 cities across the world which represent 700 million people of the globe. Some of the cities part of this group are Freetown, Hong Kong, Lisbon, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Medellin, Milan, Montreal, New Orleans, Rotterdam, Seattle and Seoul.Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata and Jaipur are part of this initiative from India.The C40 group said that the proposed green recovery plan is expected to yield US $24 trillion in economic benefits by 2050, and climate investments could support more than 80 million jobs by 2030.It also said that many cities are already moving faster than national governments.Some of the examples cited by C40 are: Bogota which has rolled out 35 km of cycle lanes and system of streets closed to cars; London which is expanding its cyclist infrastructure; Milan which has announced an ambitious scheme to increase walking and cycling; Freetown which has increased water provisions in the most vulnerable areas; Los Angeles which has installed solar panels at no cost on the homes of almost 2,000 low-income families; and Seoul which will kick off a building retrofitting scheme that is expected to create 20,000 jobs by 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shorter-walks-bicycle-rides-all-you-need-to-know-about-15-minute-city-covid-19-recovery-plan/story-8syBRLEStX3esR8PhZfyVK.html

Mark Lowcock, the UN’s head of humanitarian aid, said a team could be sent within weeks.The Yemeni government, which has been battling the Houthis in a civil war since 2015, said Tuesday the oil needed to be offloaded to prevent an environmental crisis and said the rebel group was using the tanker for “political blackmail.”“The international community has to put an end to this looming disaster,” Naser Al-Sharif, Yemen’s vice minister of transport, said in an interview. “This is a time-bomb.”Repairing the decaying tanker, called Safer and moored off Hodiedah province, would cost tens of millions of dollars, according to Abdulwahed Al-Obaly, an independent Yemeni economic researcher. There’s been no maintenance work for five years and it’s been out of service for 10 years, he said.The Houthis suggested this week that the UN could assess the ship’s condition. Lowcock said they’ve given similar assurances before, only to backtrack.In the past, the Houthis have also demanded that the stored oil is sold and the money placed in a central-bank account under their control. The rebels would struggle to sell the crude without UN approval because international buyers are wary of dealing with them, partly because they’re backed by Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-wants-to-inspect-yemen-s-decaying-million-barrel-oil-tanker/story-aBV7mxzHZ7130p1hLFEYeJ.html
16-07-2020||World||Life after lockdown||Many European countries, starting May, have eased their lockdown restrictions in phases. People find that after months of confinement, they can now go to shops and restaurants. Children can return to school.“It’s been very emotional and I’m so happy I can get to see my friends and loved ones in person,” says Madrid-resident Cristina Dorda.She recently returned to work. “I’m supposed to work from office for a week and then work from home for two weeks. I work for a French company and there are strict protocols to enter the office: every time we go inside we must switch face masks and disinfect our hands. We have to keep one seat empty between each other and we even disinfect the toilets,” she says.“Life has changed very much,” says Rosalia Acampora from Rome in Italy, which was once the epicentre of Europe. “The good part is that we appreciate the simplest things like going out to a bar for cappuccino, but of course the fear of getting the virus is still there.”“I have asthma, so I spent 51 days in the flat in Barcelona without being able to leave,” says British translator Nicole Fenwick who recently moved to Spain. “The first day I went outside was on the May 2, when they allowed us to go exercise.” Initially, it was highly regulated, with certain hours allotted solely to children and senior citizens. Now, things are returning to normal and on Saturday, Fenwick was able to fly back home to the UK.A few days before she left Spain, the government made it obligatory to wear masks everywhere outside home, so for her, the change was palpable when she landed in the UK. “It was clear to me that the UK doesn’t have clue what its doing and there are no strict regulations.” While masks were compulsory on the plane, many passengers pulled them down over their chins once they landed in the UK. Authorities did not ensure that masks were worn correctly or at all.The pandemic is still affecting some regions of Europe. “There is strategy called Hammer and Dance,” says Dr Leticia Kawano Dourado, a respiratory physician at the Hospital do Coração in Sao Paulo, Brazil. “You alternate between closing down and reopening with a focus on testing and tracing until we get a vaccine.”The strategy, outlined by writer Tomás Pueyo, has drawn a lot attention from experts. “During the Hammer, the goal is to get R as close to zero, as fast as possible, to quench the epidemic. But once you move into the Dance, you don’t need to do that anymore. You just need your R to stay below 1.” He explains, where R means the average number of people each person with a disease goes on to infect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/life-after-lockdown/story-CTg5skpxxuKFZBrxVnC3nJ.html
16-07-2020||World||European Union’s top court invalidates data-sharing pact with United States||The European Union’s top court ruled Thursday that an agreement that allows big tech companies to transfer data to the United States is invalid, and that national regulators need to take tougher action to protect the privacy of users’ data.The ruling does not mean an immediate halt to all data transfers outside the EU, as there is another legal mechanism that some companies can use. But it means that the scrutiny over data transfers will be ramped up and that the EU and US may have to find a new system that guarantees that Europeans’ data is afforded the same privacy protection in the US as it is in the EU.The case began after former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 that the American government was snooping on people’s online data and communications. The revelations included detail on how Facebook gave US security agencies access to the personal data of Europeans.Austrian activist and law student Max Schrems that year filed a complaint against Facebook, which has its EU base in Ireland, arguing that personal data should not be sent to the US, as many companies do, because the data protection is not as strong as in Europe. The EU has some of the toughest data privacy rules under a system known as GDPR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-s-top-court-invalidates-data-sharing-pact-with-united-states/story-KFjhRyZRu0FkBzdk9uTnaJ.html

The economy in the latter half of the second quarter moved from post-virus recovery to periodic climbing up to a certain extent,” Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told state media.Earlier, the IMF had projected that only a few economies including China’s would grow by 1 percent in 2020.“We are projecting that only a very small number of economies in Asia and the Pacific will actually grow this year, including China by 1.0 percent. Most economies in the region are expected to contract in 2020, and some quite sharply—Korea by around 2 percent, India by 4.5 percent, Japan by 5.8 percent, and some other economies by even more, given their dependence on remittances, tourism, and/or commodities,” Tao Zhang, IMF’s deputy managing director said on July 10.In May, Premier Li Keqiang had pledged a package of 4 trillion yuan (US$559 billion) in 2020, the largest economic rescue plan in its history, in an effort to save jobs put at risk by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-economy-bounces-to-3-2-growth-in-second-quarter-after-shrinking-in-first/story-6xzCy9WTEC4v82fGLSUpJL.html

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, were subject to a breathtaking hack on Wednesday involving a Bitcoin-related scam. Twitter Inc. temporarily blocked all verified accounts from posting or even changing their passwords while it investigated and sought to resolve the issue.The scale of the hack was unprecedented, but Twitter has had significant security problems before. Here are a few of the most prominent recent attacks.January 2020: NFL teams hackedEarlier this year, more than a dozen Twitter accounts for teams in the National Football League were hijacked just a week before the Super Bowl. The Green Bay Packers official account tweeted, “We are here to Show people that everything is hackable.” The posts were later claimed by the group OurMine. Twitter said the accounts were hacked through a third-party platform.August 2019: CEO sends offensive tweetsTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey‘s account, followed by more than 4 million people, fired off a slew of vulgar and racist tweets that were taken down about 20 minutes later. The cause, according to a Twitter spokesman: “The phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider.” A group calling itself Chuckling Squad took responsibility.November 2018: Twitter support forms exploitedTwitter said it identified an issue with one of its support forms that could expose the country code of a user’s associated phone number. It received a large number of inquiries via the affected form from individual IP addresses in China and Saudi Arabia, saying they could have had ties to state-sponsored actors.July 2016: Dorsey hacked by OurMineIt was clear something was wrong when Dorsey’s account tweeted out: “testing your security,” a hack that apparently came from OurMine. Within an hour, Twitter deleted the tweets, according to reports at the time.June 2016: 32 million passwords for saleHackers appeared to have used malware to collect more than 32 million Twitter passwords, and put them up for sale on the dark web, according to TechCrunch. Twitter said that its own systems had not been breached.January 2015: U.S. military account tweets ISIS messagesThe US military’s Central Command tweeted out threatening messages and changed its header message to include the text “i love you isis.” The Washington Post said the military was treating it as an act of “cybervandalism” and responded by immediately taking its social media accounts offline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crypto-hack-latest-in-a-history-of-high-profile-twitter-breaches/story-5z9Q0hh4S3yjSmv5fgAiZK.html

16-07-2020||World||US claims “assists” role in Indian, UK crackdown on Chinese firms||While India decided independently to ban more than 50 Chinese apps recently as part of its campaign to punish Beijing for the Galwan clashes, the United States on Wednesday indicated it played an enabling role with its ongoing effort to “assist” New Delhi with information it needed to make the right choices.No details were forthcoming . But the United States has been considering a ban on some of these same apps such as TikTok, a video sharing app, as has been said by both President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as they ratchet up their attacks on China over a growing list of disagreements.“We’ve been working closely with the Indians across a broad spectrum of the – the full range of international partnership with them to assist them in making sure they had all the information they needed to make good decisions,” Secretary of State Michael R Pompeo said in an interaction hosted by the Economic Club of New York, a non-profit.Pompeo was responding to a question if America was alone in confronting China over its trade “thievery”, using his own words, “lies” in the South China Sea, and its attempt to leverage its outsized clout in the WHO to escape accountability for the Covid-19 pandemic that started in Wuhan last December.“They made the decision that they were going to pull 50 or so Chinese applications off the systems that were operating inside of India,” the secretary of state said of the Indian decision on the Chinese apps, and added, “They didn’t do that because the United States told them to. They did it because they could see the threat to the Indian people from the Chinese Communist Party.”Pompeo, who is spearheading the Trump administration’s growing hawkishness on China, went on to indicate the United States may have played a similar enabling role in United Kingdom’s ban on Huawei from its 5G network Tuesday, reversing its long-held position that had caused frustration in the United States which has declared the telecommunications giant with links to Beijing a national security risk.The United Kingdom changed its policy with respect to its 5G technology, Pompeo said “not because America browbeat them” but because “it conducted a thorough analysis based on a set of information, some of which we certainly were helpful as part of the Five Eyes coalition to collect and disseminate”.“Five Eyes” is an intelligence sharing alliance of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Defense ministers of the member countries called last month for “a stable, rules-based, global order”, using a phrase that is deployed by foreign ministries around the world as a rallying cry against the Chinese.A response was awaited from the state department to a request for more details about the “assist” from the United States, as indicated by Secretary Pompeo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-claims-assists-role-in-indian-uk-crackdown-on-chinese-firms/story-lVz84IRdm6fbv3JUZLMX9K.html
16-07-2020||World||Tokyo set to report highest single day spike of over 280 Covid-19 cases||Tokyo is set to report a daily record of over 280 coronavirus cases Thursday, heightening concerns that the latest infection is spreading in the broader community and set to spill beyond the capital.The number is the most for a single day, Governor Yuriko Koike told reporters, and comes after the city conducted a record number of tests on a single day, with more than 4,000 conducted.While the initial flare-up in Tokyo came from nightclubs, with increased daily numbers coming from more aggressive testing of bar workers, authorities have expressed concern that more cases are now coming from more everyday locales such as restaurants, bars and workplaces. Only 13 of 165 cases reported in Tokyo on Wednesday were traced to the clubs. Meanwhile, a cluster of 15 infections was reported at a construction site of Taisei Corp. in the city.The virus is not only spreading more widely across sectors, but across the country. In Osaka, the country’s second-largest economic area, officials reported 61 infections Wednesday, the most since mid-April when the country was under a state of emergency. In the northern island of Hokkaido, a cluster was reported tied to a nightclub in Sapporo that involved more than 10 people. Meanwhile, some of the neighbouring prefectures of Tokyo have urged residents not to travel to the capital after seeing cases spike in recent weeks.Japan as a whole reported about 450 virus cases on Wednesday, the largest since the height of the pandemic in April, before the state of emergency was lifted. A campaign designed to spur domestic tourism has been decried as liable to spread the virus around Japan, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the government will address the program after asking experts for their views.Although officials have called for increased caution, they have so far maintained that there is no need for a broad request to close businesses because the medical system isn’t strained and a majority of new cases are young people in their 20s and 30s. The government has struck a harsher tone in recent days though, with Koike saying she may issue business closure requests to a narrow target of shops if needed, and urging residents to avoid businesses that aren’t following virus prevention guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-set-to-report-highest-single-day-spike-of-over-280-covid-19-cases/story-237CZjTou3UPGizQeZPUFJ.html
16-07-2020||World||Mike Pompeo downplays possibility of summit between US and North Korea||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo downplayed the possibility of another summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un before the US presidential election, saying Trump would only want to engage if there were real prospects of progress.Pompeo’s comments during a forum in Washington on Wednesday followed repeated North Korean statements insisting it would no longer gift Trump high-profile meetings he could boast as foreign policy achievements when it’s not being substantially rewarded in return.“The North Koreans have given mixed signals, but the truth is President Trump only wants to engage in a summit if we believe there’s a sufficient likelihood that we can make real progress in achieving the outcomes that were set forth in Singapore,” Pompeo said during the event hosted by The Hill, referring to the first Trump-Kim summit in June 2018.“You need to have a willing partner, and the North Koreans have chosen at this point in time not to engage in a way that can lead to a potential solution. We hope they’ll change their mind.”Trump and Kim have met three times since embarking on high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018, beginning with their meeting in Singapore where they issued vague vows for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.But negotiations have faltered since their second summit in February 2019, where the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capability.Some analysts believe North Korea will avoid serious talks with the Americans for now before attempting an eventual return to negotiations after the US election in November. They say North Korea likely doesn’t want to make any major commitments or concessions when there is a chance US leadership could change.But others say another Trump-Kim meeting wouldn’t be impossible. Trump could opt for something dramatic to improve his sliding poll numbers while Kim could see a window of opportunity closing with a Trump presidency and attempt a quick exchange between reversible denuclearization steps and hard-to-reverse sanctions relief.In a statement last week, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of the North Korean leader, said she doesn’t expect another summit with the United States this year, insisting that such a meeting would be “unpractical” for the North.But she also said “you never know,” saying that a meeting would depend on the determination of the two leaders, and called for major concessions from Washington to keep alive the nuclear diplomacy.The prolonged stalemate in nuclear talks have raised doubts on whether Kim Jong Un would ever agree to fully relinquish the nukes he likely sees as his strongest guarantee of survival. Some experts see him as trying to shape the diplomacy as an arms reduction negotiation between nuclear states rather than talks that would culminate in a surrender of his nuclear program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-downplays-possibility-of-summit-between-us-and-north-korea/story-kwMWrRAzFjso1VZsvEE2bJ.html
16-07-2020||World||Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg released from hospital||The Supreme Court said Wednesday that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was discharged from a hospital after being treated for a possible infection.A court spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that the 87-year-old Ginsburg was “home and doing well.”Ginsburg, the court’s oldest justice, had gone to a hospital in Washington on Monday evening after experiencing fever and chills. She had a procedure at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore on Tuesday afternoon to clean out a bile duct stent that was placed last August when she was treated for a cancerous tumor on her pancreas. The court said in a statement Tuesday that she would “stay in the hospital for a few days to receive intravenous antibiotic treatment.”While Ginsburg was said to be doing well, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, asked Wednesday by reporters about the possibility of a vacancy on the court before the election, said President Donald Trump would act quickly if any opening were to arise.“I can’t imagine if he had a vacancy on the Supreme Court that he would not very quickly make the appointment and look for the Senate to take quick action. That being said, we’re glad Ruth Bader Ginsburg is out of hospital,” he said, adding he didn’t want any comment to be seen “as we wish her anything but the very best.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said that if there were to be a vacancy on the court during this year’s election cycle, the Republican-controlled Senate would likely confirm a nominee selected by Trump. During President Barack Obama’s final year in office, McConnell blocked Obama’s choice of Merrick Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, saying the 2016 election should determine who would get to nominate the person to fill Scalia’s seat.Ginsburg, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton and joined the court in 1993, has been treated four times for cancer. In addition to the tumor on her pancreas last year, she was previously treated for colorectal cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009. She had lung surgery to remove cancerous growths in December 2018.Ginsburg spent a night in the hospital in May with an infection caused by a gallstone. While in the hospital, she participated in arguments the court heard by telephone because of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-released-from-hospital/story-eViBgfkvROBHsqNbcKLZOP.html

Translating to Hyenas in Petticoats, the page belongs to a feminist collective.The allegations date back to 1999 when Blanchet managed the rocker Eric Lapointe, and were said to have occurred at a bar in the city of Montreal in the Francophone province.A spokesperson for Blanchet issued a statement in French on his behalf saying he “unequivocally denies” the charges, adding, “Yves-Francois Blanchet will continue with his professional activities. No further comments will be made.”According to the Montreal Gazette, the statement in French also invited the accuser to file an official complaint in this regard. The outlet also interviewed the woman, who remains anonymous, and she said she only realised recently that the person who had allegedly sexually harassed her 21 years earlier was now the leader of the Federal party and one of the most powerful men in Ottawa.These allegations come even as there has been a spate of allegations against celebrities in Quebec in recent weeks, many of whom are connected to the music industry as Blanchet once was.There was no comment from the office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the matter. Quebec’s Premier Francois Legault has recently been supportive of those emerging with these allegations of sexual impropriety and has directed the province’s Justice Minister to assist the victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-leader-denies-sexual-misconduct-allegations-dating-back-to-1999/story-sitXzu6I7sS8DPlwoS8l2L.html

A unit of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group plans to initiate a phase I clinical trial of the potential shot, dubbed BNT162b1, developed with BioNTech’s technology, “as soon as possible once it is ready”, Fosun Pharma said in a filing.Prior to the latest approval, Chinese researchers and companies have already moved eight vaccine candidates into different phases of human tests at home and abroad.

16-07-2020||World||NYPD chief, protesters roughed up in Brooklyn Bridge clash||Several New York City police officers were attacked and injured Wednesday as pro-police and anti-police protesters clashed on the Brooklyn Bridge, police said. The confrontation happened hours before Mayor Bill de Blasio signed into law a series of police accountability measures inspired by the killings of George Floyd, Eric Garner and other Black people.At least four officers were hurt, including Chief of Department Terence Monahan, and 37 people were arrested, police said. Information on charges was not immediately available.It was not clear how many protesters were injured. An Associated Press photographer witnessed several people getting roughed up by police, including a woman who ended up on the pavement with an officer pulling on her hair.Surveillance video posted on social media by the police department showed a man on the bridge’s pedestrian walkway rushing toward a group of officers and reaching over a fence to smack one of them in the head with a cane.Police photos of the aftermath showed a lieutenant with a bloodied face, a detective holding a bandage to his head, and a bicycle officer helping a fellow officer dress a head wound.Monahan, who last month knelt in a show of solidarity with protesters, sustained injuries to his hand.He and the other injured officers were marching with a pro-police group led by local clergy when they were met on the bridge by activists, some of whom have been camping outside City Hall in recent weeks to demand severe cuts to police funding.Some people in the pro-police group marched with a banner that said, “We Support the NYPD.” The leader of that group said they were calling for an end to a recent spate of violence, including the shooting death of a 1-year-old boy in Brooklyn.De Blasio helped paint a Black Lives Matter mural on a Bronx street before signing the police reform measures. They include a ban on chokeholds and other restraints that could restrict a person’s breathing. The NYPD has long barred chokeholds, but that hasn’t stopped some officers from using them in recent years — most notably in Garner’s death on Staten Island just shy of six years ago.Other reforms include requirements for officers to have their shield numbers visible — and not obscured by things like black mourning bands; for the NYPD to create and publish to its website a schedule of officer disciplinary violations and penalties, and for the department to disclose information about its secret surveillance technology.Another makes clear that the public has a right to record police activity.Wednesday’s demonstrations and mural painting were the latest in a wave of protest activity across the country since George Floyd was killed May 25 by Minneapolis police.The first few nights of protests in New York City were marred by stealing, unrest and violence inflicted both by and on police officers. Since then, protests have largely been peaceful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nypd-chief-protesters-roughed-up-in-brooklyn-bridge-clash/story-ClD26nf3WelXw1trLSGO3L.html
16-07-2020||World||China summons US ambassador, says US blocks its development||China has accused the US of seeking to obstruct its development with recent steps to sanction officials who undermine local autonomy in Hong Kong, summoning the US ambassador in Beijing to lodge a protest.Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told Ambassador Terry Branstad that threatened sanctions and the withdrawal of special trading privileges for Hong Kong are not about democracy and freedom in the semi-autonomous territory but an attempt to contain China’s development.“I want to warn the US sternly that any bullying and unfairness imposed on China by the US will meet resolute counter attack from China and the US attempt to obstruct China’s development is doomed to failure,” he said, according to an account of Wednesday’s meeting carried by state media.President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act into law on Tuesday, as well as an executive order affirming an earlier decision to eliminate preferential treatment that has been given to Hong Kong, but not mainland China.The U.S and other Western democracies have grown increasingly concerned over developments in Hong Kong, and in particular China’s imposition of a national security law that is seen as a threat to freedom of speech and the right to protest.At the same time, the Trump administration has challenged China on multiple fronts, treating it as a strategic competitor, an approach that seems only likely to expand as Trump faces a tough battle for re-election this fall.Zheng told Branstad that the US has also “interfered with China’s internal affairs and harmed China’s interests on the issues of Xinjiang, Tibet and the South China Sea, further exposing its nature of naked hegemony.”He urged the US not to go “further and further on the wrong path.”The US Embassy did not respond immediately to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-summons-us-ambassador-says-us-blocks-its-development/story-K5fs6ia1Ci0g58bxTgPG9K.html
16-07-2020||World||American Airlines warns 25,000 workers they could lose jobs||American Airlines is notifying about 25,000 workers that their jobs could be eliminated in October because of plunging demand for air travel, adding to the toll that the virus pandemic is taking on the airline industry.American’s top executives said Wednesday that the number of furloughs could be lower if enough workers take buyouts or accept partially paid leave for up to two years.The airline’s two top officials said they thought American might avoid furloughs because they believed demand for air travel would “steadily rebound” by Oct. 1 as the virus outbreak weakened.“That unfortunately has not been the case,” CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in a memo to employees. ”And with infection rates increasing and several states reestablishing quarantine restrictions, demand for air travel is slowing again.”Air travel plunged 95% from early March to mid-April, then grew slowly until leveling off in July as virus cases surged in the South and Southwest.US airlines accepted up to $25 billion in federal aid to help cover payroll costs in exchange for not cutting jobs until October. American received $5.8 billion in cash and loans, Delta got $5.4 billion and United Airlines received $5 billion. The aid likely only delayed massive job cuts throughout the airline industry.Last week, United told 36,000 employees that they could lose their jobs in October. Delta has sent notices to more than 2,000 pilots.American’s cuts would fall most heavily on flight attendants, with nearly 10,000, or 37%, getting notices of potential furloughs — the industry’s preferred term for layoffs of workers who have rehiring rights. About 4,500 ground workers, 3,200 mechanics and 2,500 pilots will get notices.“It’s brutal,” said Dennis Tajer, a pilot and spokesman for the union of American’s pilots. “This puts the number on how serious the virus is for airlines and our economy.”Several airline unions are lobbying for another $25 billion in federal payroll aid through March. American’s pilots want the government to buy billions of dollars worth of seats per month — creating more space between passengers — until the pandemic ends.Separately, Delta Air Lines said Wednesday that it expects to take a charge of $2.7 billion to $3.3 billion to cover the cost of early retirements and buyouts for employees as it shrinks in response to a sharp decline in air travel.The airline said this week that 17,000 employees have agreed to depart.Delta said in a regulatory filing that $500 million to $600 million of the charge would go toward cash payments to pilots, flight attendants, ground workers and other departing employees in the July-September quarter. Employees who agree to leave get payments, health insurance and, in some cases, retiree health care benefits.Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the airline hopes to carry out the “vast majority of the head count changes we need” through voluntary departures, “minimizing, if not eliminating, the need for involuntary furloughs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-airlines-warns-25-000-workers-they-could-lose-jobs/story-XocAFxsqxy9JL5HJHDdwsK.html
16-07-2020||World||China’s economy returns to growth as virus lockdowns lifted||China became the first major economy to report growth following the coronavirus pandemic, recording an unexpectedly strong 3.2% expansion over a year earlier in the latest quarter as anti-virus lockdowns were lifted and factories and stores reopened.Growth reported Thursday was a dramatic improvement over the previous quarter’s 6.8% contraction — China’s worst performance since at least the mid-1960s. But it still was the weakest positive figure since China started reporting quarterly growth in the early 1990s.China, where the pandemic began in December, was the first economy to shut down and the first to start the drawn-out process of recovery after the ruling Communist Party declared the disease under control in March.“The national economy shifted from slowing down to rising in the first half of 2020,” the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement.Manufacturing and some other industries are almost back to normal operating levels. But consumer spending is weak due to public unease about possible job losses. Cinemas and some other businesses still are closed and travel remains restricted.Economists say China is likely to recover faster than some other major economies due to Beijing’s decision to impose the most intensive anti-disease measures in history. That included cutting off most access to cities with a total of 60 million people and suspending trade and travel.In the three months ending in June, factory output rose 4.4%, a sharp rebound from the previous quarter’s 8.4% contraction as factories that make the world’s smartphones, shoes, toys and other goods reopened.Retail sales shrank by 3.9%, but that was a marked improvement over the previous quarter’s 19% contraction while millions of families were confined to their homes and shopping malls were shut down.Exports grew by an unexpectedly strong 0.4% in June but still are off 3% for the first half of the year. June imports rose 3% — including a 10.6% jump in purchases of U.S. goods despite a tariff war — but are down 3.3% so far this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-economy-returns-to-growth-as-virus-lockdowns-lifted/story-aDinXIdrimiXAdf3ox0ZdN.html

The Tibetan Government-in-Exile maintains that Tibet is an independent state under unlawful occupation.In 1950, the newly established Communist regime in China invaded Tibet, which was rich in natural resources and had a strategically important border with India. Tibet today is under China’s occupation, according to Free Tibet.Tibetians have carried out protests against the Chinese regime and repeatedly call for the protection of Tibetan identity, for freedom, for human rights and for the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet. Some call for “Rangzen” (independence from China).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-authorities-forcefully-relocated-nearly-60-tibetans-report/story-8mfb4iIMPdUcQ3YauQvUqM.html
16-07-2020||World||‘We’re fed up with you’: Netanyahu faces backlash over Covid-19 response||They’ve been coming by the thousands, packing Tel Aviv’s main square, chanting outside the prime minister’s residence, and unfurling black flags from bridges spanning Israel’s highways. All with a single message: We’re fed up with you, Bibi.Rarely has public dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu been so high, as a resurgent coronavirus outbreak, mounting unemployment and the corruption allegations against him come together in a flood of discontent. Polls show his Likud party sinking, and only about 30% of Israelis trust his handling of the health crisis.The anger is weakening Netanyahu precisely at a time when the optics of appearing strong and admired would serve him best. Next week, with his political survival and a possible jail sentence at stake, his multi-layered corruption trial shifts into higher gear, with a possible scheduling of future hearings where he’ll take the stand.The shift in public sentiment came swiftly. Netanyahu initially won high marks both at home and abroad for assertive decisions that kept both virus deaths and infections down. But the reopening of the economy -- done not in the gradual, measured way that was promised, but in a burst of celebration (Go out and “have fun,” he said) -- has brought cases shooting up again. New daily infections that had dwindled to single digits in May topped 1,700 this week.The prime minister was forced to concede in a rare public apology last week that he had erred. The new 90 billion shekel ($26.1 billion) economic aid package he announced at the same time did little to mollify protesters who say his fractious coalition government -- formed explicitly to tackle the health emergency -- has managed the crisis ineptly and doesn’t understand the public’s pain.“The government is so disconnected with the economic situation,” said Aviad Ben Sadon, a consultant and leader of an independent contractors group. “They think always about themselves. They think, ‘What is going to be our salary, my position in the politics.’ They’re not thinking about us.”Little more than half of the government’s initial rescue aid, announced in late March, has been disbursed to needy workers and businesses, a government official told parliament on Monday as the crisis deepens and talk of a possible new lockdown abounds.There have been some 43,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including about 375 deaths, in the country of 9 million.The mounting sense that the government is out of touch has only been fueled by the personal conduct of the premier and several key allies. While businesses were collapsing and unemployment stood at a menacing 21%, Netanyahu was busy pressing parliament to give him a tax refund worth hundreds of thousands of shekels. He parried the consequent uproar by saying the “timing” was off.A minister without portfolio in his bloated cabinet dismissed claims that some Israelis are going hungry as “bullsh*t.” It wasn’t lost on critics that the minister doesn’t have a clearly defined job.Netanyahu’s health minister, meanwhile, went to a birthday bash for his wife just after announcing impending new restrictions on gatherings.A poll Sunday night on Channel 13 showed Likud winning just 33 seats in Israel’s 120-seat parliament, down from 40 just weeks ago. Another survey by the Israeli Democracy Institute showed 75% of Israelis are dissatisfied with the government’s functioning during the crisis.Yet while Netanyahu’s on the ropes -- as he’s been before -- the same coronavirus that’s hurting him will also preserve his government, at least for now. Neither he nor his coalition partners have anything to gain from going to early elections at this point because they’d either lose seats or maintain their current strength, polls show.Netanyahu would have no incentive to resign now, either, since he sees an advantage to going to trial as Israel’s leader, and not as an ordinary citizen. Hanan Kristal, political commentator for Israel Radio, predicts the crunch time will come in November 2021, when Netanyahu is scheduled to turn over the premiership to Defense Minister Benny Gantz under the power-sharing pact underpinning their government. Many in Israel have suspected the prime minister would find a ruse to bring the government down and call elections rather than honor the agreement.“In November next year is the rotation, by then we’ll see where this all goes,” Kristal said.In the meantime, Israelis are hitting the streets. Demonstrations have included unusually large turnouts outside the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem and protests on bridges demanding that Netanyahu resign over the multiple graft cases against him. About 50 people were arrested on Tuesday night in clashes with police after a raucous rally where some anti-corruption protesters carrying torches attempted to rush the barricades outside Netanyahu’s home.“For Netanyahu, it’s starting to look like the perfect storm against him because it’s the health care, it’s the economy, it’s the government,” said Mitchell Barak, a pollster and former Netanyahu adviser. “The prime minister is not keyed into what’s going on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-re-fed-up-with-you-netanyahu-faces-backlash-over-covid-19-response/story-GFYDDVR8z9MRkZdqowj3RK.html

That’s why we’re working here at home and with partners around the world to find one. And when we do, we must keep working together to make sure that people everywhere have access to it - because where you live should not determine whether you live.In his second tweet, the Canadian PM tagged world leaders urging cooperation on the issue.“We - @SahleWorkZewde, @MoonRiver365, @JacindaArdern, @CyrilRamaphosa, @SanchezCastejon, @SwedishPM, @ElyesFakhfakh, and myself - are calling on global leaders to commit to an equitable distribution of an eventual COVID-19 vaccine,” Trudeau said in the second tweet. The article (an opinion piece) has been published in the Washington Post.Calling vaccine as the “most powerful public health tool”, the leaders said in the article that they cannot allow its access to increase inequalities between or within countries.They also said that vaccine distribution, if managed successfully, will be a “cornerstone of strengthening multilateralism for the future”.This comes a day after two frontrunners presented positive news on the Covid-19 vaccine front. A report said on Wednesday that University of Oxford’s potential Covid-19 vaccine is in large-scale Phase III human trials to assess whether it can protect against the coronavirus disease. The vaccine could be announced as early as Thursday, the report further said.Also read: First Covid-19 vaccine tested in US poised for final testingBiotech firm Moderna also sparked optimism on Wednesday by saying initial tests for its Covid-19 vaccine were a success.

16-07-2020||World||Trump replaces campaign manager amid sinking poll numbers||President Donald Trump shook up his campaign staff Wednesday amid sinking poll numbers less than four months before the election, replacing campaign manager Brad Parscale with veteran GOP operative Bill Stepien.“I am pleased to announce that Bill Stepien has been promoted to the role of Trump Campaign Manager,” Trump said on Facebook. “Brad Parscale, who has been with me for a very long time and has led our tremendous digital and data strategies, will remain in that role, while being a Senior Advisor to the campaign.” Trump and Parscale’s relationship had been increasingly strained, with the president annoyed by the publicity Parscale had garnered in the role. But the final straw appeared to be a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally last month that drew an unexpectedly low crowd of about 6,200 people after Parscale had bragged that more than a million people had requested tickets. The president was furious.The shakeup injected familiar turmoil to Trump’s 2020 campaign, which had so far largely avoided the regular staff churn that dominated the president’s 2016 campaign and his White House. It comes as Trump has been struggling in his reelection campaign against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as the country faces health and economic crises during a pandemic that has killed more than 135,000 Americans.The staff change was not expected to alter the day-to-day running of the campaign. News of the shuffle was delivered to Parscale on Wednesday afternoon by White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.Parscale, a political novice, ran Trump’s digital advertising in 2016 and was credited with helping bring about his surprise victory that year. Stepien has been in politics for years, working for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and serving as Trump’s national field director in 2016.Parscale had been increasingly sidelined in the weeks since the Tulsa rally and as the president’s public and private poll numbers have taken a hit amid the coronavirus pandemic. Speculation had been rampant about who might be promoted to lead the operation, with names like former Trump strategist Steve Bannon floated.Parscale is a close ally of Kushner, who wields ultimate control over the campaign. A Florida resident, he had not been a regular presence of late in the campaign’s Arlington, Virginia, headquarters, sparking some resentments among staffers.Rather than parting ways completely, Parscale was retained in part because of the difficulty the campaign would have faced in rebuilding its digital advertising operation so close to the Nov. 3 general election. While the Republican National Committee owned most of the campaign’s data, voter modeling and outreach tools, Parscale ran most of the microtargeted online advertising that Trump aides believed were key in 2016.Parscale’s digital advertising firm was among the campaign’s most significant vendors, and some in Trump’s orbit have alleged that the former campaign manager was profiting off the president’s reelection. Parscale has repeatedly denied the claims.Trump has been pressed by allies in recent months to expand his political circle and more forcefully define his run against Biden. Last month, Trump announced a promotion for Stepien and returned former communications chief Jason Miller to his campaign, taking away some of Parscale’s clout and influence.Biden also shuffled his campaign team, albeit much earlier in the cycle, amid a disastrous stretch in his campaign. For Biden, the moves marked genuine shakeups that expanded and changed how his campaign operated.Biden elevated Anita Dunn, effectively displacing his first campaign manager, Greg Schultz, after a fourth-place Iowa finish and after he was already headed for a second embarrassing finish in New Hampshire. Dunn had joined Biden at the outset of his campaign after having served President Barack Obama as a top communications adviser.With Dunn’s urging, Biden hired his current campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, in March after Dunn and others helped resurrect Biden in Nevada and South Carolina and put him on the path to the nomination. Schultz is now at the Democratic National Committee, helping lead the joint battleground strategy among the national party, the Biden campaign and state parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-replaces-campaign-manager-amid-sinking-poll-numbers/story-uFqBnZ8UIEcXKHEC8XD1XO.html
16-07-2020||World||Decision on TikTok, other Chinese apps within weeks, not months: White House||The White House indicated on Wednesday that a decision on Chinese mobile applications, including TikTok, could be taken within weeks and not months.“I do not think there is any self-imposed deadline for action, but I think we are looking at weeks, not months,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters aboard Air Force One, flying with President Donald Trump form Atlanta.“There are a number of administration officials who are looking at the national security risk as it relates to TikTok, WeChat and other apps that have the potential for national security exposure, specifically as it relates to the gathering of information on American citizens by a foreign adversary,” Meadows said.The move to ban TikTok in the US has suddenly gained momentum after India’s decision in this regard last month.“They (Indians) made the decision that they were going to pull 50 or so Chinese applications off the systems that were operating inside India. They did not do that because the United States told them to. They did it because they could see the threat to the Indian people from the Chinese Communist Party,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Economic Club of New York in a virtual exchange.The US, he said, has been working closely with the Indians across a broad spectrum of the full range of international partnership with them to assist them in making sure that they have all the information they need to make good decisions.Early this month, Pompeo had said the US may ban TikTok.“I made a comment about TikTok. But we got to go back to principles first. The mission set is to protect American national security. And in this case, the information of American citizens,” he told The Hill newspaper in an interview.“So, whether it is TikTok or any of the other Chinese communications platforms, apps, infrastructure -- this administration has taken seriously the requirement to protect the American people from having their information end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” Pompeo said.According to Pompeo, the Trump administration is working through a process where all the relevant agencies and the private sector are getting to say their piece. “We hope to have a set of decisions shortly, which will reflect that central understanding,” he said.“We have been working on ZTE, we have been working on Huawei. We are pleased to see the United Kingdom make its announcement that it is going to pull out Huawei technology from its telecom infrastructure. We watched telecom companies all across the world from Orange and others to say no, we understand,” Pompeo said.“We want to make sure that our data flows only across trusted vendors. That is the mission set and that is certainly the mission set when it comes to applications that our kids may be touching,” he added.In a related development, the US House Committee on Appropriations on Wednesday passed a number of provisions, authored by Congressman Tom Graves, to crack down on foreign entities and state-owned enterprises that seek to steal data and personal information from American citizens.“Today’s language was authored amidst ongoing discussions about the potential threats posed to the US from companies like Huawei and TikTok,” Graves said.“While taking steps to protect our networks, we also need to make sure that the apps and platforms we download on our personal devices do not have ties to foreign governments with a history of bad actions,” the Congressman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decision-on-tiktok-within-weeks-not-months-white-house/story-gE3OzbMiNuk7tlMZ6yYcgL.html
16-07-2020||World||US sets record of more than 67,000 Covid-19 cases in 24 hours||The number of new coronavirus cases and fatalities continued to mount across the United States on Wednesday, with Texas and Oklahoma recording new highs.Johns Hopkins University, which tracks the spread of the disease, said late Wednesday that 67,632 new cases of the disease had been reported across the country in the previous 24 hours, a new national record.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Texas Department of State Health Services reported 10,791 new cases and 110 new fatalities, saying in a tweet that both numbers “are new highs” for the state.Oklahoma -- where the governor, Kevin Stitt, announced Wednesday he had tested positive for the virus -- recorded 1,075 new cases, a single-day record.And Alabama also hit a grim milestone, recording 47 deaths, the highest in one day.The disease has also been spreading rapidly in other states, notably Florida, which has recorded nearly 302,000 cases of coronavirus since the pandemic began.California has also seen a surge in recent weeks, prompting officials to reimpose lockdowns. The state reported its second highest single-day increase in coronavirus cases and deaths on Wednesday, with 11,125 new cases and 140 additional deaths.Also Read: India posts first trade surplus in 18 years as coronavirus hits imports“We are in an alarming and dangerous phase in this pandemic here in L.A. County,” said Barbara Ferrer, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health director, as she announced 44 additional deaths from the virus on Wednesday and 2,758 new cases.“These alarming trends reflect behaviors from three weeks ago,” she added, saying that the county was seeing the highest rates of hospitalizations since the beginning of the pandemic.She said there were currently 2,193 people hospitalized in the county due to the virus.“Younger people are being hospitalized at a faster rate than ever before,” Ferrer said.The latest research models show the number of US deaths projected to rise to over 150,000 by next month. The death toll currently stands at more than 136,400 and there have been more than 3.5 million people infected in the US since the outbreak began.Though the number of new cases slowed in late spring, they began to climb again in mid-June as states lifted restrictions and the wearing of a mask became a political dividing line.President Donald Trump finally wore a mask publicly last week for the first time during the pandemic as he visited a military hospital.Facial coverings have been recommended by health officials as a precaution against spreading or becoming infected by coronavirus, but many US states have been slow in imposing the wearing of masks in public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sets-record-of-more-than-67-000-covid-19-cases-in-24-hours/story-KFFCvtPQy9VIyfpX5Q8yHP.html
16-07-2020||World||‘I’m not a bad guy’: Police video captures distraught Floyd||Body-camera footage made public Wednesday from two Minneapolis police officers involved in George Floyd’s arrest captured a panicked and fearful Floyd pleading with the officers in the minutes before his death, saying “I’m not a bad guy!” as they tried to wrestle him into a squad car.“I’m not that kind of guy,” Floyd says as he struggles against the officers. “I just had Covid, man, I don’t want to go back to that.” An onlooker pleads with Floyd to stop struggling, saying, “You can’t win!” Floyd replies, “I don’t want to win!”A few minutes later, with Floyd now facedown on the street, the cameras record his fading voice, still occasionally saying, “I can’t breathe” before he goes still.Though transcripts of the footage were released earlier, the video itself is the fullest public view yet of Floyd’s interaction with the officers who were later charged in his death. It also captures an apparent lack of urgency to render aid to Floyd for long minutes after he stopped moving.The recordings from Officers Thomas Lane and J. Kueng are part of the criminal case against them and two other officers in Floyd’s May 25 death. Derek Chauvin, who held his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes, is charged with second-degree murder. Lane, Kueng and another officer, Tou Thao, are charged with aiding and abetting.All four officers were fired the day after Floyd died. Journalists and members of the public were allowed to view the footage Wednesday by appointment. Judge Peter Cahill, without explanation, has declined to allow publication of the video.The footage shows the officers’ view of a death already widely seen on a bystander’s cellphone video, which set off tumultuous protests in Minneapolis that quickly spread around the world and sparked a national reckoning on race and policing.Floyd appears distraught from the moment officers ask him to step out of his vehicle near a south Minneapolis corner grocery, where he was suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. When Floyd did not immediately display his hands, Lane pulled his gun, leading Floyd to say he had been shot before.Floyd’s hands are soon handcuffed behind his back, and he grows more anxious, telling the officers that he’s claustrophobic and pleading with them not to put him in the back of a squad car.In the struggle, Floyd loses a shoe. What appears to be Chauvin’s chest-mounted body camera winds up underneath the squad car, and Floyd eventually winds up on the pavement with the officers holding him down.Chauvin and Kueng each grip one of Floyd’s handcuffed hands to hold them in position behind his back, with Kueng’s knee appearing to press on Floyd’s bottom or just below. Lane is at Floyd’s feet.The officers sound clinical as the minutes tick by. “I think he’s passing out,” one officer says. “You guys all right, though?” someone asks. “Yeah — good so far,” says one. Another — apparently Lane — says: “My knee might be a little scratched, but I’ll survive.” Kueng reaches out with a free hand to pull a pebble from the police SUV’s tire tread and toss it to the street.Lane did not sound particularly worried the first time he asked Chauvin whether they should roll Floyd on his side and suggested that Floyd might be in delirium. People in the crowd can be heard expressing fear for Floyd’s condition, asking whether he had a pulse and was breathing.A couple of minutes later, Lane sounds a bit more concerned when he asks again about rolling Floyd onto his side. The officers go quiet but show no apparent urgency as Kueng checks for a pulse and says he cannot find one.Lane’s camera shows him following an unresponsive Floyd on a stretcher into an ambulance, where EMTs instructed him to perform CPR. The video shows Lane performing constant chest compressions by hand with no visible results.The ambulance parks a few blocks away from the store for several minutes while Lane and the EMTs work on Floyd, rather than heading straight to the hospital, even though they all know that Floyd is in full cardiac arrest, as indicated by dispatcher audio.Christine Hill, a spokeswoman for Hennepin County Medical Center, the hospital that provided the ambulance, said she could not talk specifically about Floyd’s treatment because of medical privacy restrictions. But she said it is not unusual for paramedics to load a patient into an ambulance and move to a more secure location as they provide life-saving care.A coalition of news organizations and attorneys for Lane and Kueng have said the court should allow the body-camera footage to be copied and published to provide a more complete picture of what happened when Floyd was taken into custody.The viewing of the video took place place on the same day Floyd family attorney Ben Crump was announcing a lawsuit against the city and the police officers involved in his death.The body camera videos and transcripts were filed in court last week by Lane’s attorney, Earl Gray, as part of a request to have Lane’s case dismissed. Gray said at the time that he wanted the videos to be made public, telling the Star Tribune that they would show the “whole picture.” Gray said the bystander video shows just the last piece of what happened and “is not fair.”Gray’s request highlighted portions of the body camera video that show Floyd “actively resisting and acting erratic” with officers. It also noted Floyd’s “request” to be put on the ground. Gray also argued that Lane did not have a clear view of what Chauvin was doing.Kueng’s attorney, Tom Plunkett, has also asked that the video be made public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-m-not-a-bad-guy-police-video-captures-distraught-floyd/story-YeQJmjiHOuyBvQimoPOaMJ.html
16-07-2020||World||Berkeley moves toward removing police from traffic stops||After hours of emotional public testimony and a middle-of-the-night vote by Berkeley leaders, the progressive California city is moving forward with a novel proposal to replace police with unarmed civilians during traffic stops in a bid to curtail racial profiling.The City Council early Wednesday approved a police reform proposal that calls for a public committee to hash out details of a new Berkeley Police Department that would not respond to calls involving people experiencing homelessness or mental illness. The committee also would pursue creating a separate department to handle transportation planning and enforcing parking and traffic laws.The council voted for the committee to find ways to eventually cut the Police Department’s budget by half and approved an analysis of police calls and spending.A tired but excited Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin said he doesn’t expect a new transportation department overnight because conversations will be hard and detailed with complicated logistics to figure out. But he said communities of color in his city feel targeted by police and that needs to change.“There may be situations where police do need to intervene, and so we need to look at all that,” he said. “We need to look at if we do move traffic enforcement out of the Police Department, what does that relationship look like and how will police officers work in coordination with unarmed traffic enforcement personnel?”It’s believed the plan to separate traffic enforcement from police is the first of its kind in the US and comes as many cities seek broad public safety reforms, including reducing law enforcement budgets, following the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Fans of the proposal cheered its passage even as some called for greater cuts to police.It could take months, even years, to create a new department, but police and other law enforcement experts rebuked the idea as dangerous, not only for traffic safety but for the people tasked with pulling over drivers, who they say can be dangerous.“I think what Berkeley is doing is nuts,” said Mark Cronin, a director with the Los Angeles Police Protective League, a union for officers. “I think it’s a big social experiment. I think it’s going to fail and it’s not going to take long for, unfortunately, traffic collisions, fatalities to increase exponentially.”Cronin, a former traffic officer, said cities can’t rely on unattended traffic signals or camera lights to catch bad drivers and that people are needed to educate motorists on safe driving. But those people also need backup and the authority to arrest should they encounter a driver who is intoxicated, armed and fleeing a crime, or wanted on other charges.“Traffic stops are one of the most unpredictable and therefore dangerous duties of law enforcement. There is no such thing as a routine traffic stop and to perform them effectively and safely takes months of police training in and outside of an academy,” said Frank Merenda, a former New York City Police Department captain who is an assistant professor of criminal justice at Marist College.Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University, called the idea an “overly simplistic plan that could have deadly consequences for unarmed traffic enforcement officers.”Nine U.S. police officers were killed during traffic stops so far this year, according to data compiled by the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund. Six were shot, and three were struck by vehicles.Numerous studies have shown Black drivers are much more likely to be stopped by police than whites for minor traffic infractions, and the results sometimes can be deadly for the driver.Philando Castile, for example, was fatally shot after the 32-year-old was stopped for a broken tail light in 2016 in Minnesota. Sandra Bland, 28, died in a jail cell three days after being stopped for failing to signal when changing lanes in Texas in 2015.The largely affluent and progressive San Francisco suburb of 120,000 has led the country on environmental, cultural and equity issues but still has lopsided traffic stop figures.A 2018 report by the Center for Policing Equity, a research and advocacy group based in Los Angeles, found that Black and Latino drivers were stopped by Berkeley police at higher rates than whites.Data analyses by the Stanford Open Policing Project at Stanford University also found that Black and Latino drivers were searched far more often than whites, but the searches turned up fewer drugs, guns and other contraband.Berkeley police issued a statement Wednesday saying the department would work with the community “to determine how we can best evolve to accomplish our mission of safeguarding our community.”Police unions for Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Jose issued a statement opposing the proposal. The Berkeley police union did not respond to requests for comment this week.Arreguin, the mayor, said creating a new department is a phase-two development that’s at least a year away and would likely involve making changes to state law.Traffic stops can be dangerous and require extensive training, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a research organization that promotes best practices in policing. He also recognizes fairness and profiling are issues for law enforcement.“At the end of the day, policymakers would have to ask themselves if this change accomplished their intended goals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/berkeley-moves-toward-removing-police-from-traffic-stops/story-WZybqN9OB4wEnB35oiLq2H.html
16-07-2020||World||Pompeo calls Huawei ‘ human rights abusers’, to hit employees with visa bans||The Trump administration said Wednesday it will impose travel bans on employees of the Chinese technology giant Huawei and other Chinese companies the US determines are assisting authoritarian governments in cracking down on human rights, including in China’s western Xinjiang province.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said the administration is finalizing plans to minimize data theft from the popular Chinese video streaming app TikTok, although he stopped short of saying it would be banned outright.Pompeo made the announcements a day after the British government said it would ban Huawei from its 5G networks over concerns that sensitive data could be compromised by the Chinese Communist Party.Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference that Huawei employees found to be providing “material support to regimes engaging in human rights violations and abuses globally” would be hit with sanctions.“Companies impacted by today’s action include Huawei, an arm of the CCP’s surveillance state that censors political dissidents and enables mass internment camps in Xinjiang and the indentured servitude of its population shipped all over China,” he said. “Certain Huawei employees provide material support to the CCP regime that commits human rights abuses.“Telecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice: If they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers,” Pompeo said.Huawei said it was “disappointed” in the decision, which it called “unfair.”“Huawei operates independent of the Chinese government,” it said in a statement. “We are a private, employee-owned firm. We are disappointed by this unfair and arbitrary action to restrict visas of our employees who work tirelessly to contribute to technological innovation in the US and around the world.”At a later event sponsored by The Hill newspaper, Pompeo said the administration was also looking at how to prevent data theft from TikTok and other Chinese companies.“Whether it’s TikTok or any of the other Chinese communications platforms, apps, infrastructure, this administration has taken seriously the requirement to protect the American people from having their information end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said. “And so we are working through a process where all the relevant agencies and the private sector are getting to say their piece. We hope to have a set of decisions shortly which will reflect this central understanding.”White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters on Air Force One that administration officials are looking at the national security risks associated with TikTok, WeChat and other apps gathering information on American citizens. He said there is no deadline for action, but said it was likely weeks, not months.It is not clear how many Huawei employees would be affected. Huawei says on its website that it has more than 194,000 employees in more than 170 countries and regions.The US has led a worldwide campaign to convince foreign governments, particularly those in allied nations, to bar Huawei from their advanced telecommunications networks, arguing that allowing them into those systems would lead to violations of their citizens’ privacy.The US has also threatened NATO and other allies with curtailments or suspensions in intelligence sharing and cooperation should they allow Huawei components or technology in their high-speed networks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-calls-huawei-human-rights-abusers-to-hit-employees-with-visa-bans/story-SLOSBFMBZ3kgCrbBdvAGYI.html

You send $1,000, I send back $2,000!

16-07-2020||World||Brazil’s Bolsonaro tests positive for coronavirus for a second time||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Wednesday he has tested positive for the new coronavirus for a second time, following his July 7 announcement that he had Covid-19.“I did the test yesterday, and at night the result came back that I am still positive for coronavirus,” Bolsonaro said. “I hope that in the coming days I will do another test and, God willing, everything will be all right to return soon to activity.”The far-right leader said he hasn’t experienced serious symptoms of the disease as he isolates at the presidential residence in capital of Brasilia.According to the World Health Organization, the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately two weeks.Before his diagnosis, Bolsonaro had spent many of his weekends since the beginning of the pandemic mingling in crowds, sometimes without wearing a mask. He is treating his Covid-19 with the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, although it has not been proven effective against the virus.Brazil, the world’s sixth most-populous nation and home to 210 million people, is one of the outbreak’s epicenters. More than 75,000 Brazilians have died from Covid-19, and almost 2 million have been infected, according to government statistics. Both numbers are the world’s second-highest totals, behind those of the U.S.Bolsonaro’s administration on Wednesday completed two months without a health minister. The interim minister, Gen. Eduardo Pazuello, who had no experience in the field before April, is facing pressure to leave the job. He took over after his predecessor, a doctor and health care consultant, quit in protest over Bolsonaro’s support for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, a related drug.“We know that there is no scientific evidence, but it worked with me,” Bolsonaro said Wednesday on Facebook. “The future will say whether that remedy is effective or not.

The fake tweets offered to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to a bitcoin address.Twitter put out a statement noting that it was aware of a “security incident impacting accounts on Twitter.” The company said it is investigating and working to fix it, and promised an update shortly.Bezos, Gates and Musk are among the 10 richest people in the world, with tens of millions of followers on Twitter.The apparently fake tweets were all quickly deleted, although The Associated Press was able to capture screenshots of several before they disappeared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-twitter-accounts-including-barack-obama-joe-biden-and-bill-gates-were-hacked-in-an-apparent-bitcoin-scam/story-hVQzbyM0a0RTsP616GeWkJ.html

16-07-2020||India||US helped India decide on banning Chinese apps: Pompeo||Washington While India decided independently to ban over 50 apps linked to China as part of its campaign to punish Beijing for the Galwan Valley clashes, the United States indicated on Wednesday it played an enabling role with its ongoing effort to “assist” New Delhi with information it needed to make the right choice.No details were forthcoming. But the United States has been considering a ban on some of these apps, such as video-sharing app TikTok, as has been said by both President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as they ratchet up their attacks on China over a growing list of disagreements.“We’ve been working closely with the Indians across a broad spectrum of the – the full range of international partnership with them to assist them in making sure they had all the information they needed to make good decisions,” Pompeo said in an interaction hosted by the Economic Club of New York, a non-profit.Pompeo was responding to a question if America was alone in confronting China over its trade “thievery”, using his own words, “lies” in the South China Sea, and its attempt to leverage its outsized clout in the WHO to escape accountability for the Covid-19 pandemic that started in Wuhan last December.“They made the decision that they were going to pull 50 or so Chinese applications off the systems that were operating inside of India,” the secretary of state said of the Indian decision on the Chinese apps, and added, “They didn’t do that because the United States told them to. They did it because they could see the threat to the Indian people from the Chinese Communist Party.”Pompeo, who is spearheading the Trump administration’s growing hawkishness on China, went on to indicate the US may have played a similar enabling role in United Kingdom’s ban on Huawei from its 5G network Tuesday, reversing its long-held position that had caused frustration in the United States, which has declared the telecommunications giant with links to Beijing a national security risk.Separately, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said TikTok pulling itself out of its Chinese holding company and operating as an independent American company is a much better solution than banning it.When asked whether any American company would like to buy the Chinese firm, he said: “I don’t want to speculate on that...That’s really a market question, but I’m just saying that’s a much better solution than banning.”The US, meanwhile, also indicated that it may take a decision on banning the Chinese mobile applications within weeks after a campaign to bar them gained momentum.“I do not think there is any self-imposed deadline for action, but I think we are looking at weeks, not months,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters on Wednesday aboard Air Force One, flying with President Trump from Atlanta.

16-07-2020||India||There’s an election year, Mamata Banerjee warns BJP over AI’s leave without pay decision||“Do not forget that in these five years there is also an election year,” West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday reacting to national carrier Air India’s decision to send its staff on leave without pay for two to five years to cut cost because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Reacting to hike in goods and services tax GST on sanitization products, Banerjee said, “The BJP party is taking advantage of the pandemic. They have passed so many laws without any consultation. They are doing it to maintain dictatorship. I am so shocked.” Assembly elections in Bengal are due in 2021 and BJP leaders claim that the party will win 200 of the 294 seats. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats, marking its best ever performance. “How can Air India send its employees on leave without pay for five years? Don’t forget that in these five years there is also the election year. Don’t forget, it is very important. I request all state and Central government employees to fight. I also request the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) trade unions not to surrender,” Banerjee said during a press conference at the secretariat on Thursday afternoon.The Trinamool Congress chief spoke for more than one hour on various issues and sharpened her attack on the BJP-led government at the Centre. “Is a democratic government working under democratic rule? If the credential is lost everything is lost. Everybody is scared. Everybody is ashamed. This is the agony of the people. The government should take care of the people,” said Banerjee.Banerjee also attacked the Centre for allowing more private investment in public sector enterprises such as Coal India and Railways.“There are labour laws for workers. How can you bulldoze all the employees. How can you say they will not be paid for five years in this kind of a situation (pandemic). People want money. From hawkers to marginal farmers, people want cash and there is no cash flow. They (BJP) should be ashamed. How can they snatch jobs from people. How can they allow 100% foreign direct investment?“Even senior economists are asking the government to give money to the people,” said Banerjee.Bengal’s Left Front chairman Biman Bose also took a swipe at the BJP over the GST hike on sanitisers.“Many ministers in the BJP government are businessmen. Even the Prime Minister says he used to sell tea. That too is a business. They understand business very well,” said Bose.The BJP’s Bengal unit leaders did not react to Banerjee’s statements till late in the night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-s-an-election-year-mamata-banerjee-warns-bjp-over-ai-s-leave-without-pay-decision/story-bSKfwAxT78R0ZEf5iYfAqN.html

Alok Mohanty, a resident of Kesharpur area of Cuttack, showed his gold mask to reporters on Thursday. “I had recently seen a businessman wearing a golden mask on television. As I have a penchant for gold so I placed the order for the same through a Mumbai based trader. It’s a N95 mask in which 90 to 100 grams of golden threads have been used. The mask has minute holes for breathing and is comfortable to wear,” said Mohanty.Mohanty, who owns a furniture shop in Cuttack, wears lots of gold bracelets, gold rings and gold chains.

The response given by state’s public health engineering (PHE) department’s executive engineer, responsible for resolving the matter, called the complainant mentally unstable and added that ‘the hand pump will be pierced in the complainant’s chest’, as per the viral post. The weird reply was also shown to have made some reference to “a Chinese war, which is a guerrilla policy”.The reply dated July 9, 2020 came to light on Wednesday when the complainant Rahul Dixit, a resident of Rahwali village of Bhind district, checked the status of his complaint, filed at CM Helpline on June 7, about incomplete installation of a hand pump at the village inconveniencing 200 villagers.“When I checked the details, I found PHE executive engineer PR Goyal’s unusual reply, which stated that ‘the complainant is mentally unstable and he and his family are patients of epilepsy. It is not the hand pump, but it’s his brain which is not working. Entire PHE department knows that this insane man tore the clothes of our mechanic. Now, time has come for a Chinese war which is a guerrilla policy. The hand pump will be uprooted and pierced in the complainant’s chest’.” Reply By Madhya Pradesh CM Helpline pic.twitter.com/qctkXNPbGhThe engineer, PR Goyal, however, sought to distance himself from the above response by alleging that the CM helpline account had been hacked by someone to malign his image. He added that he had filed a complaint with the district collector in this regard.Dixit was suspended by Thursday evening for using “undignified and unparliamentary language” while addressing the complaint, said SK Sender, under secretary, PHE.

Lockdown will also be implemented in the Rourkela Municipality area.“Two-thirds of the active cases are in these four districts and Rourkela. Of the total cases of Sundargarh district, 90 per cent are from Rourkela. Therefore the decision has been taken to impose lockdown in Ganjam, Khurda, Cuttack, Jajpur and Rourkela Municipality from 9 pm tomorrow. Though many steps are being taken at the district levels, a decision at the State-level was the need of the hour. July is a very crucial month and to stem the progress of novel Coronavirus infection, the lockdown in these aforementioned places was necessary,” Tripathy said. Out of Odisha’s tally of 15,392 cases, Ganjam alone has one third of the cases.The capital city of Bhubaneswar in Khurda district, where cases have spiked over the last month with 919 cases being reported so far, will also come under the 14-day lockdown as there have been apprehensions of community transmission.All commercial establishments including banks, shops and offices except government ones will remain closed during this period. During the lockdown period only shops selling vegetables, groceries and milk will remain open from 6 am to 1 pm in the four districts and RMC area, Tripathy said.The rising cases of Covid-19 has led to shutdown of outpatient departments of four premier government hospitals of the state including AIIMS Bhubaneswar, MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur, VIMSAR in Burla and Acharya Harihar Regional Cancer Centre in Cuttack. More than 300 cases were found in these hospitals.Considering the issues faced by patients, the state health department has decided to launch telemedicine service at 41 healthcare institutions, said health minister Naba Kishore Das. The telemedicine service will be made available at all 30 District Headquarters Hospitals in the state, seven government medical colleges, Rourkela Government Hospital, Bhubaneswar’s Capital Hospital, Cuttack’s Acharya Harihar Regional Cancer Centre and Sisubhavan.Several states including Bihar, West Bengal, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh have recently clamped lockdowns in different places for different durations to curb rising cases of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-orders-14-day-complete-lockdown-in-4-districts-as-covid-19-cases-spiral/story-7wl9Qh88h0txCDeFMZZYqI.html

The government said the donors will be treated as state guests.The northeastern state is witnessing a sharp rise in positive cases and has recently started plasma therapy to treat serious cases. But due to scarcity of donors and recovered patients, it has decided to seek help of donors from other states.Till Thursday, Assam had recorded 19,754 positive cases with 12888 recoveries and 48 deaths.Six of the state’s recovered patients have donated plasma and three patients have been provided plasma therapy at the Guwahati Medical College Hospital.“We appeal to the recovered patients in Assam to volunteer to donate their plasma so that we can treat other patients. I would also appeal to recovered patients from other states to come to Assam and donate plasma,” said health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at a press conference on Thursday.“Several other states have lots of recovered patients but haven’t started plasma therapy. Since their plasma would be of no use after three months of recovery, we appeal them to donate. We will soon launch an ad campaign in newspapers, TV channels and social media appealing donors to come forward,” he added.A recovered patient, who was symptomatic, can donate 400 gm of plasma (within 3 months of recovery) and it can be used to treat two patients.Sarma added that donors from other states will be treated as state guests with free return airfare and stay. They will be given plasma donor cards and letters of appreciation for their contribution.“For donors from Assam, we are considering giving them preference in government schemes and they may get preferential allocation of houses under PM Awas Yojana. Society should acknowledge their contribution,” he said.“Since we didn’t have many Covid-19 cases initially, we don’t have lots of donors at present. But due to the rise in cases in the past month, we should have enough donors in Assam by August,” added Sarma.In recent weeks, Assam government has started what it calls ‘aggressive treatment’ of Covid-19 patients with moderate symptoms in order to reduce the number of fatalities. This includes oxygen therapy, plasma therapy and use of steroids and medicines like Remdesivir.Sarma also announced a number of new orders including compulsory installation of Covid-19 testing machines in private hospitals and home isolation guidelines for positive patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-assam-to-launch-plasma-donation-campaign-airfare-free-stay-for-donors-from-outside-state/story-ZCnmALQ0RakUSBv2SzvLeM.html

There are fears that the temporary suspension could lead to more lasting changes and restrictions, based on reported plans of the administration. The president is said to be working on an executive order overhauling legal immigration system, to move it towards merit-based from family-based.The June 22 proclamation does not impact H-1B visa holders already in the United States, but those with approved petitions and not in the US and those applying afresh. The lawsuit cited the case of a family, which was on H-1B visa with a pending clearance for immigrant visa. They traveled to India recently and wanted to renew their H-1B or H-4 visas but there had been no progress on their applications.The June 22 proclamation also extended the suspension of immigration, the issuance of Green Cards.The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday. The same day, several lawmakers wrote to the labor secretary Eugene Scalia to end the H-1B restriction. “Throughout this administration, the president has continued to lament the alleged abuses of the immigration system while failing to address the systemic problems that have persisted and allowed businesses and employers to exploit and underpay immigrant workers, guest workers and American workers,” the lawmakers wrote as reported by PTI.“This misguided attempt by the president to scapegoat immigrants for policy failures during the pandemic not only serves to hurt immigrants, but dismisses the true problem of a broken work visa program that is in desperate need of reform,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-nationals-challenge-us-president-trump-s-h-1b-suspension/story-XfIlnddKC8m2TVKM1lEmPO.html

The TDP members brought to the notice of Kovind how the YSRCP government had systematically destroyed democratic and constitutional institutions in the state and infringed upon the fundamental rights of the people in the last 13 months.“The YSRCP has ignored a fundamental dictum in a democracy, that governments may change, but governance is a continuous process. Right from demolishing the Praja Vedika (People’s Forum) in June 2019 to unleashing a reign of terror against the political opponents, the Jagan government has ruined every system,” they said in the representation.The TDP lawmakers alleged that the YSRCP had injected a sense of fear in the government officials, forced university Vice-Chancellors to resign, concocted cases against the Dalits in Guntur district thus making them refugees in their own state, indulged in killing opposition party supporters and slapping cases against the farmers who are peacefully protesting in Amaravati.They pointed out that the Jagan had resorted to threatening his own party member who raised voice against his policies.

In Thiruvananthapuram, at least 310 people contracted disease through local transmission. Those infected include 12 health workers and eight paramilitary personnel.“Despite high density of population the state managed the disease well so far. Death per million is still below one per cent. But this is not the time to lower our guard. In some areas situation is grim. It shows we have to step up our vigilance,” said the CM. He said shops and establishments will be closed indefinitely if found any violations. “Everyone will have to assume that virus spread is everywhere and cut short travel and listen to guidelines and warnings of the health department,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-coronavirus-cases-cross-10-000-mark/story-CLaGddn3ujYxdT0TbZ1I7K.html

16-07-2020||India||Nine firms in race to redevelop 4 railways stations under PPP model||The railways has shortlisted nine companies for redeveloping four of its stations at Nagpur, Gwalior, Amritsar and Sabarmati as part of its plan of redeveloping railway stations under the public-private partnership (PPP) model.Railways’ project implementation arm the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd. (IRSDC) had invited RFQs (Request for Qualification) in December 2019 to redevelop the four railway stations. The redeveloped stations are proposed to be called ‘Railopolis’.It has shortlisted the following firms: G R Infraprojects, Kalpataru Power Transmission, GMR Business and Consultancy, Anchorage Infrastructure Investments Holdings, ISQ Asia Infrastructure Investments, Monte Carlo, JKB Infrastructure and Kalyan Toll Infrastructure, Cube Construction Engineering.“On June 26, 2020 IRSDC opened the RFQ applications of these four railway stations and received overwhelming response from 32 developers and funds despite the current COVID19 scenario,” IRSDC said in a statement.The total estimated cost for the redevelopment of the four stations is about Rs 1,300 crore. The total built-up area allowed for commercial development is 5.4 million square feet.Among 29 shortlisted applicants, six qualified for Nagpur, eight for Gwalior, six qualified for Amritsar and nine for Sabarmati.The stations will also be the first to have provisions for pre-determined user charges on passengers and visitors, as one of the main revenue stream for the concessionaire. The user development fees model will be used by the national transporter for the first time.IRSCD will be leasing the land out for 60 years for commercial purposes and 99 years for residential.This comes in the backdrop of railways’ plan of redeveloping 400 railways stations. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had announced its plan of redeveloping 400 railway stations during its first tenure. As per the plan, the cost of the station redevelopment project was to be met by leveraging commercial development of land and air space in and around the stations. The railway stations were taken up for redevelopment based on financial viability.Apex policy think-tank Niti Aayog had, in October 2019, pulled up the ministry of railways for delayed implementation of the Centre’s plan. Niti Aayog had recommended an empowered group of top bureaucrats to develop 50 stations on priority basis.The railway ministry earlier this month also began the formal process to allow a private company to run trains on 109 routes -- a process that aims to, for the first time, open up one of the government’s most prominent enterprises that has in recent decades been outpaced by the demands of a rapidly growing economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-firms-in-race-to-redevelop-4-railways-stations-under-ppp-model/story-ECtmvhWW9QpPEvlbFOM6II.html

We want the CM’s resignation” said BJP’s Kerala unit president K SurendranConsidered close to Vijayan, he was removed from the powerful principal secretary’s post last week after reports surfaced that he was allegedly close to one of the key accused in gold smuggling case Swapna Suresh. He was grilled by the Customs department for nine hours on Wednesday.Officials found discrepancies in his statement and decided to call him again for questioning, people familiar with the investigation said. They also said his arrest was imminent. The case blew up after Customs seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on June 5. Later the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Many other central agencies are helping the NIA in the investigation.The UAE attaché in Thiruvananthapuram Rashed Khamis Ali Musaiqri Alsheme who enjoys diplomatic immunity, left the country via Delhi on Tuesday. Earlier, the Union government had made a formal request to the UAE embassy for a meeting with him. Meanwhile ,the Ministry of External Affairs has cancelled the passport of Faisal Fareed, one of the accused in the gold smuggling case who is reported to be in the UAE. After a court in Kochi issued an arrest warrant against him the NIA had approached Interpol and issued a blue corner notice against him. People familiar with the investigation said he will be extradited in a couple of days.During investigation the NIA found that he used to procure gold and send it to the country through different channels. Fareed, who is said to run a gym and motor garage in the UAE, is reportedly close to many in the film industry. On Thursday, least 12 people were arrested by Customs and revenue intelligence in connection with the case.Earlier this week, a NIA court had remanded four persons in the agency’s custody - Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the UAE consulate, IT consultant Swapna Suresh, Suresh’s friend Sandeep Nair and K T Rameez, an alleged agent who used to distribute smuggled yellow metal to jewellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-suspends-cm-s-former-secretary-as-heat-rises-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-fubte60XpCxIgVACI4wnAM.html
16-07-2020||India||Goa’s complacency led to Covid-19 spike, says Governor after meeting with CM||Goa governor Satya Pal Malik on Thursday discussed “shortfalls” of the state government in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic in an extensive meeting at the Raj Bhavan with Chief Minister Pramod Sawant.In political circles, the meeting is being seen as a ‘run-in’ between the Governor and the Chief Minister over the handling of the pandemic.Sawant, who is under fire from opposition parties as well as civil society, also came under the scanner with the Governor questioning the ‘error of judgment’ in not locking down Vasco da Gama, Goa’s port town which is now the epicentre of the spread of the virus in the state, and instead having to lock down the whole state after an exponential rise in the number of cases.“I raised several issues during the meeting. Wherever they have done a good job, I commended, and where they have fallen short I have also pointed it out.“Wherever there was a need like food supply, the quality of food, menu, the cleanliness of the Covid centres -- bathrooms are overflowing-- shortage of ambulances, whatever shortfalls were there were discussed. To a great extent, the health secretary has spoken and clarified what steps are being taken,” Malik said in comments to a local TV channel. “The logic (reasoning) of comorbidities that was being offered (to explain the deaths) to say that because they had comorbidities they passed away, I said that they should be treated. Else a person may get treatment for one disease and die of another,” he added. Malik said the government had become complacent that led to a spike in Covid-19 cases.“As far as the tests are concerned, Goa is doing very well, management too is fine. But what happened here is that we became satisfied too early when we shouldn’t have. We relaxed the lockdown, and now when the cases are rising we are locking down again. When people were saying that Vasco should have been locked down, we didn’t do it. It has grown a lot and now we are doing it. There was an error of judgment,” Malik said. The Governor had called the meeting with the Chief Minister, Chief Secretary, Health Secretary and other officials following the rise in number of cases, deaths as well as reports in the media that the condition of the Covid care centres left a lot to be desired. The Governor’s comments were in sharp contrast to what the Chief Minister said after he emerged from the meeting. Sawant claimed the Governor told them that he realized that he was misinformed through what he has seen in the media. “He was getting wrong information from the media and social media and we have given him the right information. In fact he told us that what we are doing is very good. Social media, print media and electronic media is showing the wrong picture. That’s what he said. He said that the good side should be shown,” Sawant claimed. But the Governor refuted the CM’s claims. “It is definitely wrong to say that I have blamed the press. The issue of the press (coverage) didn’t come (during the meeting). I have definitely not criticized the press. The press is our strength, through which we get feedback and only then can we go forward. The CM has said that I have said this, but I haven’t. He shouldn’t have said that. I definitely didn’t say that,” Malik said.This isn’t the first time that the Governor and the CM have differed. In May, Malik was forced to clarify as being “in bad taste” news reports which he said “portrays differences and divergences between him and the Chief Minister in handling the crisis.”Goa which had brought down Covid-19 cases from seven to zero in the first week of May has seen a spike in cases of infections and deaths with a tally of nearly 3,000 cases and 19 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-s-complacency-led-to-covid-19-spike-says-governor-after-meeting-with-cm/story-1HOpxKX8ibcGEI4Quc74YP.html
16-07-2020||India||‘Obstructive and insincere’: India roasts Pak after meeting Kulbhushan Jadhav||A long-awaited meeting of Indian officials with Kulbhushan Jadhav ended inconclusively on Thursday after Pakistan refused to give them unimpeded consular access, the external affairs ministry said on Thursday evening. New Delhi has lodged a formal protest with Islamabad.Indian officials had made nearly a dozen requests to Islamabad over the last one year for “unimpeded, uninterrupted and unconditional” consular access to the former Indian naval officer in line with the verdict of the International Court of Justice. Jadhav, a former naval officer turned businessman, was quietly sentenced to death by a military court in April 2017. He had gone missing the previous year from Iran and turned up in the custody of Pakistani security agencies some time later who accused him of espionage.Thursday’s consular access to Jadhav was the second time that he had been allowed to meet Indian officials. The first was on September 2, 2019.As had happened the first time that Pakistan gave Indian diplomats access to Jadhav, Pakistani officials “with an intimidating demeanour were present in close proximity of Shri Jadhav and consular officers despite the protests of the Indian side”.Officials also spotted a camera that was being used to record their conversation. Officials also reported that Jadhav was “visibly under stress and indicated that clearly to the consular officers.”“The arrangements did not permit a free conversation between them. The consular officers could not engage Shri Jadhav on his legal rights and were prevented from obtaining his written consent for arranging his legal representation,” the government statement said.In the light of these circumstances, the Indian officials concluded that the consular access being offered by Pakistan was “neither meaningful nor credible”. They left the venue after lodging their protest.In May 2020, Pakistan passed an Ordinance, ostensibly to comply with the order of the International Court of Justice. It envisages the consular officer of the Indian High Commission filing a petition before a high court to seek review of Jadhav’s death sentence. In that context, the contacts and conversations between the consular officer and Jadhav assume great importance, the external affairs ministry said.“Any conversation between them must necessarily take place in privacy and without the presence of any Pakistani official or recording by Pakistan. It is only then that Shri Jadhav can speak freely without any concerns of reprisal as he remains in Pakistani custody after the meeting,” the statement said, pointing that it was already evident that Jadhav has been repeatedly intimidated in the past.“It is clear that Pakistan’s approach to this matter continues to be obstructive and insincere. It has not only violated its assurance to the ICJ to fully implement the 2019 judgement, but also failed to act in accordance with its own Ordinance,” New Delhi said.India’s focus on getting Jadhav legal representation comes against the backdrop of claims by Islamabad that Kulbhushan Jadhav had refused to file an appeal in the Islamabad high court against the death sentence ordered by a military court despite an offer to do so.New Delhi had responded angrily, accusing Pakistan of continuing with a farce that it had been playing for the last four years. New Delhi says Jadhav was sentenced to death at a farcical trial by a military court.Over the past year, India has requested Pakistan more than twelve times to provide unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional consular access to Shri Kulbhushan Jadhav, who remains incarcerated in Pakistani custody since 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meeting-with-kulbhushan-jadhav-ends-inconclusively-as-pak-doesn-t-give-unimpeded-consular-access-india/story-ocTx09qlCc5xFPGPpDrReO.html

The state has also recorded 26 deaths, due to landslides caused by heavy rains, since May.Over 49,000 people displaced by flood waters are at present taking shelter in 748 relief camps set up in the affected districts. Rescue workers evacuated 2,737 stranded people by boats on Thursday and took them to safety.According to ASDMA, over 1.31 hectares of crop area has been affected by flood waters. More damage to embankments, roads and bridges were reported from the affected districts during the day.Nearly 90% area of the Kaziranga national park and tiger reserve (KNPTR) spread over 430 sq km continues to remain submerged by flood waters. Till date 76 animals of the park including 5 rhinos have died during this season’s floods, said a bulletin issued by the park authorities.According to a Central Water Commission (CWC) bulletin, most rivers in the state remained in spate on Thursday.

The latest face off between Banerjee and Dhankar relates to a tussle over state universities. The trigger was provided by the absence of most state university Vice Chancellors from a meeting called by Dhankar on Wednesday to assess the academic situation in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.“I find there is tightening of this political cage in the education scenario in West Bengal,” Dhankar was quoted as saying by PTI following the absence of VCs from the virtual meet.Also Read:One held for murder of BJP MLA, Mamata Banerjee writes to President KovindHe added that the VCs opposed the meeting “tooth and nail” for “the reasons known to all”.The chief minister soon launched a counter-attack accusing him of acting like a “political party” representative.“A governor can’t talk like a political party,” she said, while accusing him of not abiding by the constitution.“He is not abiding by the Constitution, not following the PM and home ministry,” the agency quoted Banerjee as saying. She also extended support to the VCs over the issue when asked about Dhankar’s stated intention to seek explanation for their absence. “We respect VCs, they have our 100 per cent support,” Banerjee said.Also Read: Admission to colleges for under-graduate courses via online mode this year: West Bengal education ministerThe West Bengal government had recently amended the rules relating to the governor’s power as the chancellor of universities, significantly reducing Raj Bhawan’s role in their functioning.All communications between the governor and the universities, now, have to be routed through the higher education department of the state as per the revised rules.Another such meeting called by Dhankar had failed to take off in January this year following the state government’s reported objection to its convening without keeping the government in the loop. Dhankhar claimed the “unwholesome situation” was the creation of the state government.Dhankhar accused the government of apathy towards students whose futures were in jeopardy due to the unprecedented crisis. He added that the students were getting increasingly restive with each passing day and that the graduate and postgraduate students needed degrees to pursue further studies and secure suitable jobs through competitions.“The saddest element in the entire gamut is that they completely forgot the students crisis amidst the pandemic,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.The tussle also assumes significance in the backdrop of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s recent letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, opposing HRD ministry and UGC guidelines for holding college and university exams by September 2020. She had cited risks to the students from the coronavirus disease and universities’ decision to evaluate students on the basis of previous semesters and internal assessments.“Denying degrees means denying academic progression and jobs. Degrees cannot be given without evaluation which happens to be in the form of examinations. Exams can be held only when the courses have been completed,” Dhankhar said in an apparent reference to the issue.Dhankhar said he wanted to know during the meeting what steps the universities intended to take in that direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tussle-over-bengal-universities-escalates-with-mamata-banerjee-s-attack-on-governor/story-f2BeERomFWRdm9jw6CHE2J.html

The postal ballot rule would, however, be applicable for voters over the age of 80, disabled or those suffering from coronavirus.“Commission has already limited the number of electors to one thousand for each polling station for ease of voting, especially for elderly and vulnerable sections of electors, in Covid-19 situations,” the EC said in a press statement today. In view of the Covid-19 situation, the poll body said, it has already created additional 34,000 polling stations, which roughly equals to 45% more and will also increase the number of polling stations to 1,06,000.The EC said it has been monitoring the electoral preparedness for Bihar assembly elections, the dates for which are yet to be announced. When the rules were first amended the Congress had alleged that the government had not consulted any political party, other than the ruling one, to amend the poll conduct rules ahead of the Bihar election.Earlier, the ministry of law and justice amended the conduct rules on June 19, on the recommendation of the EC, to allow senior citizens over the age of 65 to vote using postal ballots in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.In several Covid health advisories, people over the age of 65 have been asked not to venture out as they are particularly vulnerable to catching the highly contagious virus.Casting votes through postal ballots was available only to armed forces and officials assigned poll duties till now.In February, Delhi became the first state to experiment with postal ballots, extending the facilities to those with severe disabilities or above the age of 80 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-pauses-postal-ballot-for-65-voters-in-bihar-elections-cites-constraints/story-iN7KB3PdgNrd8z8ZdugVzI.html

It will lead to submergence of large part of land of Indian UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. We condemn attempts by Pak to bring about material changes in Indian territories under its illegal occupation,” Anurag Srivastava, official spokesperson of Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Thursday.“We have also consistently conveyed our protest and shared concerns with both China and Pakistan on all such projects in Indian territories under Pakistan’s illegal occupation where it has no locus standi,” Srivastava said at a briefing. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan inaugurated the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha dam on Wednesday, despite India’s objection to the huge China-backed project.Also Watch l PoK residents protest against China and Pakistan over illegal dams Khan said the Diamer-Bhasha will be Pakistan’s third largest dam and will generate 4,500 MW of electricity and provide at least 16,000 jobs. The dam expected to be completed by 2028.In May, the Pakistan government signed a Rs 442 billion contract with a joint venture of a Chinese state-run firm and a commercial arm of Pakistan’s powerful military for the construction of the dam.India had then said that carrying out of such projects in territories under Pakistan’s illegal occupation was not proper.In 2016, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) had refused to commit funds for the dam project, two years after the World Bank declined to fund the project following Islamabad’s refusal to seek a no objection certificate from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-flays-pakistan-for-dam-on-indus-says-it-will-submerge-parts-of-j-k-and-ladakh/story-hvvHUZFeNKRwMCDtUCvIbP.html
16-07-2020||India||India gets second consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav||Pakistan on Thursday provided Indian officials consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav, a former naval officer sentenced to death for alleged involvement in espionage, for only the second time since he was detained in March 2016.The Indian side took up Pakistan’s offer only after receiving assurances regarding unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional access to Jadhav, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.“India has been requesting for unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional consular access to Kulbushan Jadhav. On the basis of assurances provided, our officials proceeded for the meeting [on Thursday],” Srivastava told a weekly news briefing.The Indian side will assess the situation and comments on the matter after the officials who met Jadhav submit a report, he said.The timing of the meeting was crucial as it was held just four days before the expiry of a deadline for Jadhav, his legal representative or the Indian government to file a review petition in the Islamabad high court under an ordinance promulgated by the Pakistan government.Unlike the past meetings with Jadhav, which were high-profile affairs, Pakistani authorities did not release any photos or video footage of Thursday’s meeting that was kept tightly under wraps.Before the meeting, India had made it clear that the Pakistani side couldn’t impose conditions such as making audio and video recordings of the conversation or insisting that Jadhav and the officials speak only in English, people familiar with developments said.A statement from Pakistan’s foreign ministry said consular access to Jadhav, 50, was provided for the second time following an Indian request. Consular access under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations was first provided in September 2019, while Jadhav’s mother and wife were allowed to meet him in December 2017.“Two consular officers of the Indian high commission in Islamabad were provided unimpeded and uninterrupted consular access to…Jadhav at 1500 hours,” the statement said.The statement repeated Pakistan’s accusations that Jadhav was arrested in Balochistan province on March 3, 2016 and that he had “confessed” to his involvement in terrorist activities. India has already dismissed such charges and said the former naval officer was kidnapped by Pakistani intelligence operatives from Iran’s Chabahar port, where he was running a business.Earlier this month, India had accused Pakistan of coercing Jadhav not to file a petition seeking a review of his case and of not complying with the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) verdict to review his conviction.New Delhi’s response came after senior Pakistani officials contended Jadhav had refused to file an appeal in the Islamabad high court against the death sentence given by a military court. The Pakistani officials had also said Jadhav preferred to follow up his pending mercy petition.ICJ had ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and stayed his execution while calling on Islamabad to take all steps for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence, including “enacting appropriate legislation”.The Pakistan foreign ministry’s statement said the country “remains committed to fully implementing the ICJ’s judgment of July 17, 2019” and “hoped that India will cooperate with the Pakistan court in giving full effect to the said judgement”.India has pushed for the full implementation of ICJ’s judgment and sought unimpeded access to Jadhav to discuss his remedies under the new Pakistani ordinance.Pakistan also rejected numerous requests from India for free and unimpeded access to Jadhav. India has also repeatedly asked for a lawyer from outside Pakistan to be allowed to appear for Jadhav in any review proceedings but Islamabad has denied this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-gets-second-consular-access-to-kulbhushan-jadhav/story-fbwl2MGIYiLngcJ0zEpsVN.html

16-07-2020||India||Sachin Pilot, disqualification and the Tenth Schedule: An explainer||Sachin Pilot and 18 dissident Congress MLAs moved the Rajasthan high court on Wednesday challenging the disqualification notice issued to them by the Speaker of Rajasthan assembly, CP Joshi on July 14.The ruling Congress has sought their disqualification from the assembly for ‘anti-party activities’.The Speaker’s notice asked the 19 MLAs to furnish an explanation by Friday on why they should not be disqualified from the assembly for their conduct which the Congress party alleged was detrimental to the interest of the party and showed their intention to quit the party.What is the basis for Speaker’s notice?The Speaker’s notice was based on the disqualification petition filed by Chief Whip of Congress Party, Mahesh Joshi.Joshi in his plea had cited the absence of the MLAs from two Congress Legislature Party meetings, held on July 13 and 14, despite specific instructions to attend the same as the main reason which showed the intention of the MLAs to leave the Congress party.Joshi also cited statements made by the MLAs to the press, their prolonged absence and their allegedly hostile and prejudicial conduct in open against Congress party as grounds that they intended to leave the party. What are the grounds on which lawmakers can be disqualified for defection?The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India contains provisions relating to disqualification of lawmakers for defection. It provides two grounds to disqualify a lawmaker for defection.First, voluntarily giving up membership of the political party on whose ticket the lawmaker was elected [para 2(1)(a)].Second, voting or abstaining from voting in the house contrary to the directions issued by the party, that is violating the party whip in the house [para 2 (1)(b)].Pilot and other MLAs were served notice for disqualification on the first ground, that is, voluntarily giving up membership of the party.What does “voluntarily give up membership” mean?The Supreme Court had the occasion to deal with the interpretation of these words used in the Tenth Schedule in the 1994 case of Ravi S Naik v. Union of India.In that case, the court held that the words “voluntarily give up membership” are not synonymous with “resignation” and have a wider connotation. A person may voluntarily give up his membership of a political party even though he has not tendered his resignation from the membership of that party. Even in the absence of a formal resignation from membership an inference can be drawn from the conduct of a member that he has voluntarily given up his membership of the political party to which he belongs, the court had held.Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi had also cited the Ravi Naik case in his disqualification petition filed before the Speaker.There have been more such judgments since then on this point including Rajendra Singh Rana v. Swami Prasad Maurya and Dr. Mahachandra Prasad Singh v. Chairman, Bihar Legislative Assembly which held that express resignation is not required to prove that a lawmaker has given up the membership of the party and the same can be inferred from the conduct.Can the Speaker’s powers to decide on disqualification be interfered with?The Speaker of the house enjoys vast powers when it comes to deciding on disqualification of members of the house.The Supreme Court has consistently held that it will not interfere in disqualification matters till the Speaker actually makes a decision. In other words, once the Speaker makes a decision, the court can judicially review the correctness of the same but it cannot interfere before that.One of the first cases in which this was laid down was in the 1992 judgment in Kihoto Hollohan vs Zachillhu.In that case, the top court ruled that having regard to the constitutional scheme in the Tenth Schedule, judicial review should not cover any stage prior to the making of a decision by the Speakers/Chairman. No interference would be permissible at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings, the court said.“Exceptions will, however, have to be made in respect of cases where disqualification of suspension is imposed during the pendency of the proceedings and such disqualification or suspension is likely to have grave, immediate and irreversible repercussions and consequence”, the court had added.Recent case of interference with the Speaker’s exercise of powersOne aspect of the Speaker’s power to decide the disqualification petitions is that no time limit is prescribed for making such a decision. So when a disqualification petition is filed by an opposition MLA, the Speaker often defers his decision for an inexplicably long period so as to enable the government to continue in office.In two such recent instances, courts – Supreme Court and Manipur high court - were forced to interfere due to the Speaker’s delay in deciding the case. One is the famous case of Manipur Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minister Thounaojam Shyamkumar who had contested the 2017 elections to the Manipur Assembly on a Congress ticket and, subsequently, joined hands with the BJP after the election results, and was made a minister in the Biren Singh-led BJP government.Congress leaders filed disqualification petitions before the Speaker Y Khemchand Singh to seek Shyamkumar’s disqualification on the ground of defection but the Speaker did not take a decision for a very long period. The petitioners then moved Manipur high court which declined relief. An appeal was filed before the Supreme Court which was critical of the undue delay by the Speaker in arriving at a decision. The top court, in a judgment rendered on January 21, asked the Speaker to take a decision on the disqualification petitions within a month.When the Speaker again refused to take a decision as per the court’s order, the Supreme Court resorted to an unprecedented step. In a strongly worded order, the top court restrained Shyamkumar from entering the Manipur Legislative Assembly and also ordered that he shall cease to be a cabinet minister in the state with immediate effect. The Speaker later disqualified Shyamkumar in March.Close on the heels of this, the Manipur high court in June ordered that 7 former Congress MLAs, who had defected to the BJP along with Shyamkumar in 2017 elections, cannot enter the state legislative assembly till the disqualification petitions filed against them are decided by the Speaker.But both these were instances of court’s interference when the Speaker failed to decide the disqualification petitions filed by opposition MLAs, on time – a scenario which is unlikely in this case where the ruling party whip has filed the plea.Important grounds raised by Pilot and other MLAs- Pilot and other MLAs had contended that Speaker’s notice is based on assumptions and surmises and there is no factual basis to support the apprehensions raised by him in the notice. - None of the MLAs have either by their express or implied conduct indicated their intention to give up Congress party membership.- In a democratic setup, voicing disagreement with the policies or decisions taken by the party does not amount to acting against the interests of the party.- Not attending two Legislature Party meetings will not fall within the scope of defection contemplated in para 2 of the Tenth Schedule.- Rajasthan Assembly (Disqualification) Rules mandate that the Speaker should give 7 days’ notice to a member to explain his stance in a disqualification case. The notice issued by the Speaker on July 14 has set a deadline of July 17 to show cause and is, therefore, violative of the rules.- If somebody is expelled from a political party, such a person cannot be said to have voluntarily given up membership as required under para 2 of Tenth Schedule to attract disqualification for defection. This issue is not yet completely settled and is pending before the Supreme Court in the case of Amar Singh v. Union of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-disqualification-and-the-tenth-schedule-an-explainer/story-ZrfFVKmYZZnLKPuA1UX1DL.html

But TTD executive officer and joint executive officer refuse to stop darshans”.Deekshitulu, who was forced to retire in 2018 by the then Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government on attaining the superannuation age of 60, was back in the shrine after the YSR Congress party (YSRCP) government came to power in June 2019.Initially, he was made Agama (a code of conduct for temple management) advisor to the Tirumala in November, and later appointed as the honorary chief priest of the shrine.He alleged that the TTD officials were embracing the anti-hereditary archaka and anti-Brahminical policies of TDP, led by former CM N Chandrababu Naidu. “Disaster if this continues. Please take action,” he requested CM Reddy.On Wednesday, the TTD Staff and Workers’ United Front, affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), had submitted a representation to TTD executive officer Anil Kumar Singhal, requesting that darshan at the temple be temporarily suspended because of the viral outbreak in the Tirumala hills.The TTD staff pointed out that over 1,000 Covid-19 positive cases were reported in Tirupati town and around 100 TTD employees had contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the viral disease.“These employees can end up infecting devotees, when they go up the Tirumala hills to perform their religious duties. We are very worried,” they said.They also requested the TTD to allow employees to work in shifts in a bid to comply with social distancing norms, as only 33% of the staff would work on a day.The TTD chairman, however, said there was no possibility of temporarily suspending darshans again. “It is true that 140 TTD employees had tested Covid-19 positive since the temple was opened on June 11 for darshan. They include security persons, priests, and workers of the temple kitchen. More than half of them have already recovered from their viral infection,” he said.Subba Reddy said none of the devotees, who had come for darshan, had tested positive in the random tests being conducted by the TTD authorities. He, however, announced that the restrictions on the number of pilgrims being allowed for darshan would persist. At present, only 12,000 pilgrims are allowed daily because of the pandemic.The TTD chairman said all facilities would be provided to the priests of the shrine in a bid to ensure that they don’t get infected by the pathogen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ttd-head-priest-seeks-temporary-closure-of-tirumala-temple-as-covid-19-casesrise-demand-gets-rejected/story-D35BRP7bKVy9ec5lmTGAjN.html

The video of the two students, without their shirts and crying in pain ‘oh God, oh God’ in the back of the car, has gone viral on social media.Sanjeev Thapliyal, station house officer at Bhagwanpur police station in Haridwar district, said FIR has been registered in the matter of beating up of two Nigerian BTech second year students studying at Roorkee Institute of Technology (RIIT) Bhagwanpur college.Thapliyal said on the complaint of Nigerian student Francis Koyang, an FIR has been registered against the college director Parag Jain, registrar Munendra Chauhan, five security guards and a non-teaching staff member on Thursday.The two Nigerian students on Thursday evening, said police, tried to move outside the college premises for dinner but were denied permission. The students said they were bored of the college canteen food and stepped out to eat.Upon their return, they were confronted by the security guards which led to a verbal duel followed by the students getting beaten up with other security guards also joining in, said police. One of the two students is now recovering in a hospital.Meanwhile local students, villagers and National Student Union of India (NSUI) have come out in support of the Nigerian students demanding stern legal action against the private college management and their security guards.Protests were staged outside the college gate by NSUI and Bhim Army activists condemning the action of the college management and security personnel.Circle officer Mangalore Abhay Singh said that no one will be allowed to take law into their own hands. He said security has been beefed up in the college area with CCTV footage being monitored as well.When contacted, the college management information cell personnel said that they will soon release a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/college-director-7-arrested-after-nigerian-students-thrashed-in-haridwar/story-04kOFlbc7iOsjJopwplCfP.html
16-07-2020||India||‘Presumptuous’: What Sachin Pilot’s petition in court says about Ashok Gehlot||Sachin Pilot and his team of 18 Rajasthan lawmakers on Thursday approached the high court’s Jaipur bench to seek cancellation of assembly speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notice issued to them, insisting that the anti-defection law could not be invoked against them for disagreeing with decisions and policies of some Congress leaders outside the assembly.Pilot’s decision to move the Rajasthan High Court is politically seen by Congress leaders to be a signal that he intends to take his battle with Ashok Gehlot to its logical conclusion. If the Pilot camp is disqualified from the assembly, it would reduce the strength of the assembly and place Gehlot - who is believed to be on thin ice - on a stronger footing till elections are held on these seats.The joint petition was taken up by the high court’s Justice Satish Sharma on Thursday afternoon. But senior lawyer Harish Salve, who is representing the petitioners, sought time to amend the petition to broaden its scope.“They said they will challenge the Rajasthan Assembly Member (Disqualification on the grounds of changing party) Rules, 1989, instead of the notices,” Prateek Kasliwal, who is representing speaker CP Joshi, said. Justice Sharma resumed the hearing a few hours later at 5 pm. But the petition in its new form challenged the Rajasthan assembly’s rules, the judge referred the case to a two-judge bench.“Only a division bench can hear petitions challenging rules, bylaws and amendments,” Prateek Kasliwal explained.Also Read: Ashok Gehlot vs Sachin Pilot becomes Harish Salve vs Abhishek Singhvi in courtSachin Pilot’s primary argument in the early version of the petition on Thursday was that missing two meetings of Congress Legislative Party did not amount to defection. According to the Constitution’s Tenth Schedule, the anti-defection provisions kick in if a member voluntarily gives up membership of the political party or votes contrary to the party’s direction in the assembly.Pilot also stressed that speaker CP Joshi might act under the influence of chief minister Ashok Gehlot.It is evident that the Tenth Schedule of Constitution is merely sought to be used as a guise to impose its majoritarian views upon the members and to stifle their freedom of speech and fair play in democratic setup, the petition said.Elected representatives who voice disagreement with certain policies or decisions by some members of the party cannot be counted as acting against the interests of the party. A healthy discourse of the pros and cons of policies of a political party cannot be inferred to imply voluntarily giving up membership under anti-defection law, the petition said, pointing that they had never spoken about quitting the Congress or trying to pull down the Gehlot government.Also Read: Congress ready for a ‘face saver’ for Pilot, he keeps them on the edgeThe complaint against them was “based on assumptions and surmises” and were without a factual basis to support such apprehensions.A “grave mischief” is sought to be achieved in which the assembly is seeking to impose sanctions upon the petitioners on “sheer presumptuous basis”, the petition said. It contrasted the speaker’s inaction on a disqualification complaint against Bahujan Samaj Party legislators who crossed over to the Congress with Joshi’s 14 July notice that was issued within hours of the complaint from Congress Chief Whip Mahesh Joshi.The petition by 19 lawmakers also pointed to the law that allows an MLA expelled by a political party to continue as the member of the assembly, underlining that there would be “dangerous consequences” if an elected member is deprived of membership “merely on the whims and fancies” of party leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grave-mischief-says-sachin-pilot-s-plea-in-high-court-against-disqualification-move/story-t3UPnp1p1fRcsF5q3fjJNM.html

16-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand govt ambivalent on saints’ demand to revoke controversial order on Ganga||The community of saints in Haridwar has asked the Uttarakhand government to retract an order over declaring a stretch of the Ganga as an escape channel after former chief minister Harish Rawat apologized on Wednesday for the “mistake” of his administration. “I seek an apology from the saint community and Ganga Sabha over the decision taken by the state government under my chief ministership. I urge chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat to take back this decision and announce Har-Ki-Pauri as part of main holy Ganga river,” Rawat said Wednesday during his meeting with saints and Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad office bearers along with representatives of Ganga Sabha, the body that manages the affairs of the ancient sanctum sanctorum of Brahma Kund Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga ghat in Haridwar. “This controversial order was passed to safeguard the interests of local traders and commercial activities but later I realized it was a mistake. It was a decision taken with certain aspects taken into consideration but now this decision should be nullified. A large number of saints, teerth purohits and Ganga activists met me in this regard recently after which I realised my mistake,” said Rawat who is also a former MP from Haridwar.Many priests, pandas, traders, shopkeepers, hoteliers and politicians living in and around Har-Ki-Pauri had then urged Harish Rawat to pass the order saying Har-Ki-Pauri is not the mainstream Ganga but a secondary part of Ganga canal stream.Rawat said that if the state government doesn’t take any decision in this regard, then he will ensure that this order is taken back if the Congress returns to power in 2022,Terming it as a genuine realisation of a major mistake Mahant Durga Das of Shri Panchayati Akhada Bada Udasin said that after Rawat publicly accepted the mistake, the ball is now in the court of the state government.Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha said that sentiments of Ganga devotees continued to be hurt as in official records Har-Ki-Pauri part of the Ganga is deemed as a channel of the main river.“We have already submitted three memorandums in this regard to the state government to nullify the previous Congress government order. Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri has since antiquity been believed to be the sacred place where tug-of-war took place between deities and demons and nectar fell at that place,” said Jha.The Congress-led government had issued an order declaring part of Ganga from Sarvanand Ghat, Bhoopatwala till Shri Daknesheswar Mahadev temple, passing through sanctum sanctorum of Brahama Kund, Har-Ki-Pauri as an escape channel on December 14, 2016. This meant Har-Ki-Pauri ghat is not on the main river Ganga course and thus did not come under NGT directive that prohibits construction activities within 100 metre of the Ganga river.The order of the then Congress government meant construction activities could go on, bringing relief to many ashram owners, hoteliers, dharamshala owners and shopkeepers whose establishments were coming under 100-metre belt.Earlier this week Ganga Sabha had threatened to move to the Supreme Court if the state government didn’t turn down this order.The BJP government in Uttarakhand is ambivalent about the demand of the saints.Madan Kaushik, state cabinet minister and state government spokesperson blamed the previous Congress government for this situation but did not say why the BJP government had not scrapped the order or cleared its stance on the matter in the last three and a half years.“Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had stated during his first visit as CM to Har-Ki-Pauri that mistakes and wrongdoings of previous Congress government will be washed away. It is good that finally Harish Rawat has realised his mistake but it won’t be easy for people of Haridwar to forget his acts,” said Kaushik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-ambivalent-on-saints-demand-to-revoke-controversial-order-on-ganga/story-VxfpiRrl2pvyVcF0603oMM.html

It predicted that some carriers may even struggle to cover their variable costs up until the end of second quarter of financial year 2021 due to market conditions and the “constraints” imposed by possible social distancing requirements.A total of 1,633 flights operated on July 15, carrying about 1,40,000 passengers. Initially, after the resumption of flights, the government had allowed airlines to operate at a maximum of 33 percent of their full capacity, in proportion to the market share and capacity they had in the pre-Covid market. The government had also capped fares for seven domestic sectors. The scenario of international travel returning to its previous levels also remains uncertain as underlined by the minister.

The FIR was lodged under sections 406/409/420/467/468/471/477a/120b of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act. The mission came into force in 2010. The scam continued till 2016.Also read: ‘Now, don’t blame rats’: Bihar opposition’s dig at CM over collapse of newly inaugurated bridgeAccording to the FIR, on October 4,2011, the BMVM had published an advertisement to impart knowledge about 22 trades including MS Office, Tally, spoken English and other courses to mahadalit youths through funds allocated under state government’s Dashrath Manjhi Skill Development Scheme and with special assistance from central government.During an investigation, the VIB found that British Lingua Director Dr Birbal Jha hatched a conspiracy with the connivance of BMVM officials and withdrew Rs 17 crore between 2012 and 2016 financial year on fake paper.In the FIR enclosure, the VIB revealed that the BMVM claimed, he had trained 14,826 students. But in the investigation, the bureau found that most of the students attended separate trade during same session and period.“During investigation, it also surfaced that students whose names were in the list of firms as candidates who were imparted training and certification never really took any such course. Such youths had given a written statement that they had never been into any such training,” reports said.Raju, who was suspended in January 2017, was in the thick of controversy in 2003. The then leader of opposition in Bihar, Sushil Kumar Modi, had sought his dismissal over corruption charges. Modi had advised the government not to accept his following his suspension in Karnataka where he had gone on deputation.In December 2016, the VIB lodged an FIR against the IAS officer, along with 15 other officials for alleged irregularities in the disbursement of post-matric scholarship among SC/ST students pursuing technical education outside Bihar.In April 2019, the VIB submitted charge sheet against IAS officer SM Raju, two retired IAS officers and five others for alleged involvement in scam wherein funds to the tune to more than Rs 5.55 crore were embezzled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-s-vigilance-bureau-lodges-second-fir-against-ias-officer-in-scam-worth-rs-17-crore/story-Hr2J4jSyEbmkdRedWXYooO.html
16-07-2020||India||India gets 2nd consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav||India on Thursday got second consular access to former naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav - sentenced to death by a Pakistan Army court - at the Pakistan foreign office in Islamabad. The last time Pakistan allowed such access to Jadhav was in September 2019. The development follows India’s request for unconditional access to Jadhav ahead of the July 20 deadline to file a review petition in his case.Last week, Pakistan claimed that Jadhav, arrested on charges of espionage and terrorism in 2016, had refused to file an appeal to review his case in the Islamabad High Court. New Delhi denied the claim, and said he had clearly “been coerced” into not appealing against his conviction. In its July 2019 verdict, the International Court of Justice ordered Pakistan to review Jadhav’s death sentence. It also ruled that India’s right to have consular access to its national had been violated.India has also accused Pakistan of violating the ICJ judgment in “letter and spirit”.New Delhi said Pakistan passed an Ordinance in May this year to allow for the High Court to review the sentence awarded by their military court.“They have all along maintained that their laws allowed for effective review and reconsideration while we have protested it all along. Now, after almost a year, they have made a U-turn and issued an Ordinance to ostensibly provide for some sort of review. We have already expressed our serious concerns at the content of the Ordinance and how it violates the ICJ judgment. Pakistan is only seeking to create an illusion of remedy,” it said.Jadhav was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. In April 2017, Pakistan announced he had been given the death sentence by a military court.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. Pakistan has so far granted consular access to Jadhav only once since his arrest in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-officials-at-pak-foreign-office-after-new-delhi-gets-consular-access-to-meet-kulbhushan-jadhav-report/story-KzgCYkAVotCtKXI3AXknuO.html
16-07-2020||India||Chhattisgarh: 25 MLAs given positions in govt in last three days amid Rajasthan crisis||The Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress government in Chhattisgarh has appointed 25 lawmakers for various posts in the state statutory bodies, including parliamentary secretaries, boards, and commissions over the last three days, in what appears to be a pre-emptive measure to fortify itself amid the party’s internal power struggle in Rajasthan.At present, 38 legislators are holding various posts in the state government, including the latest entrants.The others are chief minister Baghel and his 12 Cabinet colleagues.The ruling Congress has 69 lawmakers in the 90-member Chhattisgarh assembly.On Thursday, a list of chairman and vice-chairman of boards and commissions, which include four members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), was released that has been carefully drawn up while keeping the regional sensibilities in mind, as 14 leaders are from Raipur division, followed by four each from Surguja, Bilaspur, and Durg divisions and six from the under-developed Bastar division.On Wednesday night, the state government had appointed six MLAs as chairmen and vice-chairmen of two development authorities.On Tuesday, the state government had appointed 15 MLAs, as parliamentary secretaries, who are touted to work in tandem with 12 ministers.The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed that appointments have been made to pacify the infighting within the Congress-led government, which is further rattled because of the ongoing Rajasthan crisis.Senior BJP MLA and ex-minister Brijmohan Agrawal told media persons on Wednesday that the government “hurriedly’’ appointed the party legislators as parliamentary secretaries out of fear because of the political crisis in Rajasthan.“There is a huge discontentment among Congress legislators in the state. The ruling party decided in a hurry to appoint them as parliamentary secretaries. This is a fallout of what happened in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh (MP) and is likely to happen in Rajasthan. The Chhattisgarh unit of the Congress is afraid of the MP and Rajasthan experience,” Agrawal alleged.However, state Congress leader RP Singh rubbished Agrawal’s allegations.“The BJP has only 14 MLAs in the state assembly, which is less than the parliamentary secretaries appointed by us. The party needs to understand where it stands. Besides, these appointments were made before the Rajasthan crisis. It is a coincidence that it has been announced now,” he said.Another BJP leader Ajay Chandrakar, too, harped on the infighting within Congress’s Chhattisgarh unit. “It is a well-known fact that there is a growing rift between two Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh. These appointments have been made to pacify some leaders and put an end to infighting,” he alleged.Shailesh Nitin Trivedi, who heads the Congress’s communication unit in the state, likened the BJP’s allegations to the pot calling the kettle black.“Ajay Chandrakar and Brijmohan Agarwal are two major factions in the BJP since 2000. Now, they are talking about rift and infighting. They need to first get their own house in order,” said Trivedi.The BJP, which has ruled Chhattisgarh for three consecutive terms since 2003, has 14 MLAs.Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) (J), and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have four and two lawmakers, respectively.The Marwahi assembly seat has been lying vacant since the death of Ajit Jogi, ex-CM, and JCC (J) MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-25-mlas-given-positions-in-govt-in-last-three-days-amid-rajasthan-crisis/story-3AcMsTXKaGYmuJvGxHkB3L.html

We have to navigate a difficult terrain,” Puri said at Thursday’s presser.The minister also lavished praise on Air India for carrying out a massive evacuation to bring back stranded Indians from several countries across the world amid the Covid-19 crisis.“The Vande Bharat Mission is currently in the fourth phase. It involves 619 flights which will bring back more than two lakh Indians. We are evacuating about 20,000 people every day,” Puri said.He said 687,467 people have been brought back so far out of which Air India carried 215,495. Private carriers brought back 12,258 Indians while 135,000 used private charters to return home. Puri said the Vande Bharat mission with an initial evacuation figure of 190,000 people but soon increased to a larger number after people from many parts of the world where Air India does operate also requested evacuation.Air India’s chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal said the airline operated 1,103 flights from 71 cities across 53 countries to evacuate Indians.“Almost 50% of those returned are from West Asia and most of them belonged to Kerala,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-bubbles-only-way-forward-for-international-travel-during-pandemic-hardeep-puri/story-ZhQobJTSeTFqEVGiUbcS6O.html

According to news agency PTI, the Pilot camp has sought time to amend its petition challenging move to disqualify dissident MLAs from Rajasthan Assembly.Appearing for the Pilot camp, counsel Harish Salve said the dissident MLAs want to challenge constitutional validity of disqualification notices issued by Rajasthan Speaker. He said the petitioner will challenge anti-defection law enshrined in Tenth Schedule of Constitution.The high court granted time to the Pilot camps to file fresh petition and the matter will be heard now by Division Bench when the amended petition is filed. Former deputy chief minister and Congress state unit president Sachin Pilot and other Congress rebels had moved the Rajasthan high court earlier in the day against the disqualification notice issued by assembly speaker CP Joshi to disqualify them as MLAs. The ruling Congress has sought their disqualification from the assembly for ‘anti-party activities’. The notice issued stated disqualification of the MLAs from assembly under the Tenth Schedule of the constitution of India. The MLAs were asked to respond to the speaker’s notice by Friday.The MLAs deliberately absented themselves from the Congress legislature party meeting held on July 13 and 14.On Tuesday, the Congress had sacked Pilot - credited with leading the party’s successful campaign in the 2018 assembly elections - both as deputy chief minister and also from the Pradesh Congress Committee chief posts.

The company has under 100 direct employees in India and hundreds of third-party workers, sources said.Another banned app, an e-commerce service called Club Factory (CF), has written to its Indian sellers saying it is invoking a “force majeure” clause - freeing it from contractual obligations.“We hereby wish to inform that all settlements with sellers on the CF app and website are hereby being put on hold until the ban of the CF app and website is lifted,” the firm said in a letter to some 30,000 Indian sellers.The India app ban requires a temporary halt of business activities and the company is working with the government to resolve their queries, Club Factory said in a statement.Operators of the banned apps, which include the TikTok video service, have been asked by India to answer 77 questions, including whether they censored content, worked on behalf of foreign governments or lobbied influencers, Reuters reported previously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alibaba-s-ucweb-lays-off-india-staff-club-factory-halts-payments-after-app-ban/story-mTtMSD6i5cnq3rWdCXOPYO.html

16-07-2020||India||‘Approach road washed away, main structure safe’: Bihar govt on Sattarghat bridge collapse||The Opposition in Bihar on Thursday lashed out at Nitish Kumar-led NDA government after a bridge on the approach road leading to newly-constructed Sattarghat bridge over River Gandak was washed away by flood water, exactly 29 days after it was inaugurated by chief minister himself on June 16.Kumar had laid the foundation stone of the ambitious bridge on April 5, 2012, which was a long-pending demand of the people of the area. The 1.44-km-long bridge, built at a cost of Rs 263.47 crore, reduced the distance between Gopalganj, Saran and East Champaran districts by 45 km.Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav and Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief madan Mohan Jha was quick to lap up the issue and attacked the NDA government.“The Sattarghat bridge of Gopalganj built at a cost of Rs 263.47 crore in 8 years, was inaugurated by Nitish Ji on June 16. Today, 29 days later the bridge collapsed. Beware! If someone terms it corruption by Nitish ji. Rs 263 crore is for just a glimpse. Even their rats consume alcohol worth this amount,” Yadav tweeted.Bihar Congress chief Dr Madan Mohan Jha also tweeted: “The inauguration of the bridge constructed at a cost of Rs 263.47 crore on June 16 and its destruction on July 15. Now do not accuse the poor rat for this.”Facing flak, the road construction department immediately went on a denial mode and said that there was no damage to the bridge as being reported in a section of media. “About two kilometres from the main bridge, on the side of Gopalganj, an approach road of 18 metres long bridge has been eroded by heavy water pressure of Gandak river. This bridge is situated inside the embankment area of Gandak. There is no damage to the bridge. The main bridge is absolutely safe and traffic will be restored on the road once water pressure reduces. There is no question of irregularities in its construction. This is a natural disaster,” said additional chief secretary, road construction department, Amrit Lal Meena.The BJP also came in defence of chief minister as the road construction department is with the saffron party. “The RJD, which itself has specialised in corruption is making a false propaganda. CM Nitish Kumar’s target is to make corruption-free development. The bridge is completely safe only an approach road two kilometres ahead of bridge has been washed away. The minister of road construction department is an efficient minister who has brought revolution in road network. The RJD should publicly apologise for false propaganda,” said BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand.The Bihar government, on earlier occasions had also cut a sorry figure when one of its ministers in 2017 had blamed rats for floods as they made holes in embankments resulting in heavy floods. Last year, the police had blamed rats for gulping seized liquor in police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/approach-road-washed-away-main-structure-safe-bihar-govt-on-sattarghat-bride-collapse/story-kEWypPfqqPWV1Oh2bOxTzL.html
16-07-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot vs Sachin Pilot becomes Harish Salve vs Abhishek Singhvi in court||The Ashok Gehlot versus Sachin Pilot fight will now shift to the courtroom. Hindustan Times has learnt that while Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Congress’ Rajya Sabha member, will appear for the Rajasthan chief minister, former solicitor general Harish Salve will appear for Pilot.Hindustan Times had reported how Pilot first reached out to Singhvi but found out how Ashok Gehlot had already hired him for the job. Salve was NDA government’s top law officer from 1999 to 2002 and is currently based out of London, from where he fought India’s case against Pakistan in the Kulbushan Jadhav matter.“We had to challenge it in court and that’s why we are waiting for the Rajasthan high court to hear us soon,” said a leader from Sachin Pilot’s camp, on condition of anonymity. Over the last 24 hours, there have been mixed signals from both sides - from Pilot’s appointees in local bodies being cancelled to public statements saying that the door for his return was still open. Since his removal as deputy chief minister on Tuesday, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been in touch with Pilot while Rahul Gandhi’s brief to his emissary KC Venugopal was to try to hold Pilot back.“We don’t understand the duplicity of this. On one hand they say the door is open but on the other hand, the chief minister holds a press conference and says such things about his English language and the way he looks,” said the Sachin aide quoted above.For his part, chief minister Gehlot has alleged that Pilot’s supporters were paid Rs 20 crore by the BJP. To this, Pilot’s loyalist and former BSP legislator Murari Lal Meena has responded by saying that the CM should also come clean about the money they were paid to come over to the Congress.But it isn’t just Gehlot. Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who had earlier expressed concern about “horses bolting from the Congress’ stables”, today sounded critical of Pilot. He tweeted: “False rumours spread to malign Pilot: “I am not joining BJP. “I guess then legislators at a hotel in Manesar is merely a vacation in Haryana’s comfort zone under BJP’s watchful eye What about “ghar wapsi”?”“He never detached himself,” said the Pilot loyalist. “Is it wrong to have grievances against the chief minister and point out what he was doing wrong? The legislators are in the Manesar hotel at their own cost because they will be arrested in Jaipur.

Among them are also a sizeable number of professionals and service providers like nutritionists, financial advisors, income tax consultants, sports coaches, gym trainers, yoga teachers and tutors — both men and women.Of the total 37.61 lakh returnee migrants that the Yogi Adityanath government profiled in June to find them jobs according to their skill sets, some 20.37 lakh were found to be skilled and another 15 lakh unskilled workers. No employment details were available for around 2 lakh migrants.Profiling the skilled migrants, the state government has put them into 93 categories as per their skill sets, each category has migrants belonging to one particular skill.A skill-wise employment data, that HT has accessed, prepared by the UP government’s revenue department shows that women account for more than 3.18 lakh of the total workforce and had their share in almost all the skilled works Minors (children between 15 and 18 years) were found to be 1.63 lakh.Also read: Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC to not function on July 16, 17 due to Covid-19The major chunk of over 20 lakh returnee skilled migrants consists of construction labourers (10.8 lakh), which is around 50% of the total skilled workforce, followed by factory workers (1.25 lakh), workers other than construction and factory workers (1.21 lakh) and agriculture labourers (83,344). Next come painters and POP workers (89,681), tailors (66,535), carpenters (65,043) and drivers (46,471).Among the skilled migrants are also professionals and service providers such as yoga teachers (417), tutors (2674), coaches (1,102), photographers (504), financial advisors (407), income tax consultants (129), dieticians (407), barbers/beauticians (10,013), cooks (23,745), e-commerce employees (18,048), aayahs/child caretakers (7,210), call centre employees (3,481), banking/insurance sector staff (2,275), clerks/accountants (2,516), food processing staff (4,238), IT sector employees (1,237), and retail sector workers (1,346).The largest chunk of migrants returned to eastern UP districts in two phases in March end and then in May. Districts like Siddharthnagar, Prayagraj, Gonda Maharajganj, Bahraich, Balrampur, Jaunpur, Hardoi, Azamgarh, Basti, and Gorakhpur witnessed a major influx.The UP government decided to conduct skill mapping of the returnee migrants in a bid to provide jobs to them as per their skill sets if they chose to stay back in the state after the lockdown. “We are trying our best to absorb all the migrants in different sectors, including MGNREGS and construction work, though many of them have gone back,” a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-profiles-returnee-migrants-into-93-categories-as-per-their-skills/story-5qNrsL0kRZCaViCj12YnPN.html
16-07-2020||India||New lockdowns ordered as India’s Covid-19 cases near one million||One of India’s most impoverished states went into lockdown Thursday, but near-normal traffic on Patna’s streets showed the difficulty of corralling over 125 million people.The lockdown in the northern state bordering Nepal started as India reported more than 600 deaths in the previous 24 hours, and the Red Cross warned the virus was spreading at “an alarming rate” across south Asia.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWith India’s caseload on course to hit one million on Friday or Saturday -- and fatalities approaching 25,000 -- authorities across the country are reimposing restrictions that have only recently been lifted.Bihar went into a 15-day lockdown at midnight, a day after IT hub Bangalore -- home to 13 million people -- shut down for a week.All schools, clubs, temples and non-essential businesses were ordered to close in Bihar, but construction and agricultural activity allowed to continue. And while public transport was shut down, private vehicles are still allowed to operate, and an AFP reporter in the state capital Patna said traffic appeared to be as busy as ever on Thursday morning.“We have not faced such a situation in my life before, it is really a horrible experience,” said Radhika Singh, a housewife in her late 40s as she jostled to buy rice and lentils Wednesday before the lockdown started.A lack of coronavirus discipline forced Goa to announced a three-day shutdown from Thursday evening and a night curfew until August 10.Chief minister Pramod Sawant said too many people were “stepping out to meet people at parties” and that there was a low level of “awareness and sensitivity”.“We have more than 40,000 people fined for not wearing masks, plus there are many who are detained for flouting rules, but they continue to loiter,” Sawant told local media.“This only establishes that people only understand the language of the law.”Only God can save us’ Bangalore appeared to be coping far better.Many firms that handle the back-office operations of global corporations were little affected by the re-imposed restrictions having already working from home.Still, the health minister of Karnataka said Wednesday that “only God can save us” as the number of cases in the state approached 50,000.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said that the entire region is fast becoming the next epicentre for the coronavirus.“While the world’s attention has been focused on the unfolding crisis in the United States and South America, a concurrent human tragedy is fast emerging in South Asia,” the organisation said.“Covid-19 is spreading at an alarming rate in South Asia, home to a quarter of humanity.”While India has reported almost 970,000 cases, the pandemic is also still raging in Pakistan and Bangladesh with almost 260,000 and 195,000 cases respectively.In total the three countries have recorded more than 1.4 million cases and almost 33,000 deaths, according to official figures that many experts say in reality are much higher.The IFRC also cited a report from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) scientists -- yet to be peer-reviewed -- that in six months India could be reporting up to 287,000 cases per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-lockdowns-ordered-as-india-s-covid-19-cases-near-one-million/story-WPRzbeOhGZ9sx5cbP10SXJ.html
16-07-2020||India||India’s electricity output recovers further in first half of July||India’s electricity generation during the first half of July fell at a slower pace than in June, provisional government data showed, as industries and commercial establishments opened up after further following gradual easing of lockdowns.Power generation fell 3.1% in the first 15 days of July compared with the same period last year, a Reuters analysis of daily load despatch data from federal grid operator POSOCO showed, compared with a 9.9% fall in June.In the second half of June, electricity generation declined 5.3%. While power use has picked up from previous months when India was under a strict lockdown, electricity demand - which is impacted by seasonal changes - is still lower when compared with the same periods from the previous year.Industries and offices account for over half of India’s annual power use. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been citing electricity consumption to show there are “greenshoots” in the Indian economy.Major industrial states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat in the west and Tamil Nadu in the south continued to witness steep drops in electricity use amid higher incidence of coronavirus cases.However, many states with smaller yet significant industrial profiles saw growth in power demand for the first time since Modi announced a nationwide lockdown in March.The northern state of Uttar Pradesh - India’s most populous and home to the largest number of medium and small scale enterprises (MSMEs) in the country - witnessed a 10.1% growth in electricity use. Other states including Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh - all of which are known for MSMEs - saw an uptick in power demand.Seasonal factors including hot weather could have fuelled higher power demand.The states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have also seen a rise in coronavirus cases in the recent days, which could impact power demand. Bihar has also announced a lockdown beginning Thursday and ending July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-electricity-output-recovers-further-in-first-half-of-july/story-4k1Soh9zZ0etXTrKSnAKDM.html
16-07-2020||India||Rebel leader Sachin Pilot’s camp challenges disqualification notice in court||Sachin Pilot and other Congress rebels moved the Rajasthan high court on Thursday against the disqualification notice issued by assembly speaker CP Joshi to disqualify them as MLAs. The ruling Congress has sought their disqualification from the assembly for ‘anti-party activities’. The notice issued stated disqualification of the MLAs from assembly under the Tenth Schedule of the constitution of India. The MLAs were asked to respond to the speaker’s notice by Friday.The MLAs deliberately absented themselves from the Congress legislature party meeting held on July 13 and 14.If the rebel MLAs are disqualified, the majority mark will drop, making it easier for chief minister Ashok Gehlot to win a floor test. The majority mark in the 200-member assembly is 101. Gehlot has accused his former deputy of hobnobbing with the BJP to bring down his government. The BJP, with just 72 MLAs, has been gingerly watching the developments. Despite Pilot categorically ruling out joining the BJP amid the power tussle within the Rajasthan unit, the Congress has alleged that he was colluding with the opposition party to topple the state government. On Tuesday, the Congress sacked Pilot - credited with leading the party’s successful campaign in the 2018 assembly elections - both as deputy chief minister and also from the Pradesh Congress Committee chief posts. His two loyalists were also sacked as ministers.On another track, the party has been making overtures with Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala calling upon Pilot and his supporters to stop all conversations with the BJP and return to Jaipur to thrash out differences. Rajasthan Congress in-charge Avinash Pande too after Pilot’s remark that he is not joining the BJP tweeted that the party doors are “not shut on him”. He also wished that lord would grant the leader the good sense and comes out of the “elusive trap of the BJP”.Since his removal from the state cabinet, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been in touch with Pilot while Rahul Gandhi’s brief to his emissary KC Venugopal was to try to hold Pilot back.The fight between the two leaders reached a tipping point when Pilot was asked to record his statement with the Special Operations Group team of the Rajasthan police in an alleged case of bribing MLAs for a coup by the BJP.The Pilot camp has maintained that they are fighting for dignity and are not after posts or positions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/breaking-sachin-pilot-moves-hc-against-speaker-s-disqualification-notice/story-1bywkpvfgjekXM6UxRqVpJ.html

16-07-2020||India||‘Disengagement an intricate process, needs constant verification’: Army||India and China remain committed to “complete disengagement” which is an “intricate process” and “requires constant verification”, the Indian Army said in a statement on Thursday, two days after senior military commanders from both sides met at Chushul to discuss the road map for reducing tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).“The senior commanders reviewed the progress on implementation of the first phase of disengagement and discussed further steps to ensure complete disengagement,” army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said.The government’s high-powered China Study Group (CSG) on Wednesday reviewed the latest developments in eastern Ladakh, with focus on the next stage of disengagement between the Indian and Chinese armies following the 14-hour meeting between senior military commanders.“The two sides remain committed to the objective of complete disengagement. This process is intricate and requires constant verification. They are taking it forward through regular meetings at diplomatic and military level,” Anand said in the statement. He said India and China have been engaged in discussions through established military and diplomatic channels to address the prevailing situation along the LAC.On the fourth meeting between the senior commanders on July 14, he said the engagement was consistent with the consensus reached between the Special Representatives of India and China on July 5 to discuss complete disengagement.The CSG, which is the apex policy advisor to the government on China, on Wednesday evaluated the proposals and counter-proposals discussed at the corps commander-level talks before charting out the course for the next round of disengagement that is expected to begin in the Finger Area near Pangong Tso. The focus of the current round of military talks is to hammer out a consensus on easing tensions between the two armies in the Finger Area and Depsang plains as well as pulling back weapons and equipment from friction points in other sectors.“The involvement of the CSG reflects a synergised approach and response. India is minutely evaluating all aspects of disengagement, which will be a lengthy and laborious process,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.A fifth meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region could take place soon to discuss different aspects of disengagement, officials said.Even as disengagement and de-escalation is being discussed and monitored in the highest echelons of the government, defence minister Rajnath Singh will visit Ladakh for a security review on July 17. Singh will also visit forward areas in Jammu and Kashmir on July 18. Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane will accompany the minister on the two-day tour.The military is keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 2.The minister will visit Ladakh two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled visit to the sector on July 3. The PM then declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China about India’s determination to defend its borders.The July 14 meeting was the fourth round of talks between the corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies who made previous attempts to reduce tensions along the border on June 6, June 22 and June 30.Negotiations are expected to be far harder this time as the continued presence of the PLA in the Finger Area and the Depsang sector could be the sticking point in the talks.In Tuesday’s talks, the agenda included the step-wise withdrawal of weapons and equipment to mutually agreed distances from all friction areas along the LAC and thinning the military buildup in the region.The military dialogue will be followed by another meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. The military commanders set the time-frame and method of disengagement while the WMCC monitors the process.The disengagement effort involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides.The military build-up in Indian and Chinese depth areas hasn’t thinned, with both sides keeping their guard up. The deployment of thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence weapons continues in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-an-intricate-process-needs-constant-verification-army/story-HF3F5XYcULMxyD7bFnqnyI.html

16-07-2020||India||Congress ready for a ‘face saver’ for Pilot, he keeps them on the edge||Sachin Pilot, sacked as deputy chief minister and the state unit chief for leading a rebellion against the Ashok Gehlot government, hasn’t taken up the Congress on its offer to head back to Jaipur along with the other rebel lawmakers sequestered in a Gurugram on the outskirts of national capital Delhi.On Wednesday, the Congress initiated the process to eject Sachin Pilot and the 18 rebel lawmakers from the assembly for skipping a party meet in Jaipur but followed up the many darts that Ashok Gehlot hurled at him with an offer.Pilot had to make contact with the party leadership, pull out his group of legislators from a Gurugram hotel and head back home, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters. Then, Pilot would be given opportunities to raise his grievances with the party’s large-hearted leadership who would look at how best to resolve them, he said. Also Watch | ‘Congress without Gandhis will be unprecedented, but it will work’: Sanjay JhaSurjewala’s message signalled that it was for Sachin Pilot to make the first conciliatory move if he indeed intended to stay in the Congress, and not switch sides. But Surjewala had also made it clear that the party didn’t buy the new narrative floated by his camp that he never intended to jump ship or hadn’t been working with the Bharatiya Janata Party.The measured approach - a contrast to acerbic statements by Ashok Gehlot -- were driven by an assessment in the party headquarters in New Delhi that Congress leaders should not do anything to precipitate the matter.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have told the party’s central observers camping in Jaipur that they should leave a window open for Pilot’s honourable stay in the party.A Congress leader suggested that Sachin Pilot’s reluctance to grab the offer could stem from the fact that any ‘face saver’ being contemplated by the party is unlikely to include any role of significance in Rajasthan, the state where Pilot is heavily invested.His camp had earlier hinted at plans to launch a regional front if the Congress didn’t accommodate his concerns around rival Ashok Gehlot who, Pilot had alleged, had been humiliating him and creating hurdles. Pilot, who had at one point expected 30 legislators to stand with him, subsequently found only 18 legislators willing to put their future in the party at stake.This depleted strength of his camp vastly reduced his ability to negotiate with the Congress or the BJP. The Congress also moved faster than his camp had estimated, sacking him and two ministers from the government, and then purging the state unit of his supporters. But it is the Congress complaint to the assembly to disqualify Team Sachin Pilot as MLAs that could hurt him the most.The BJP, which at one point this week believed the Gehlot government was nearing its end, appears to have stepped back for the moment. The BJP’s state leadership has decided to switch back into the wait-and-watch mode, rather than be seen to be actively pulling down the Gehlot government.A Congress leader in Delhi said Sachin Pilot would want to explore his options outside before driving back to Jaipur, given that the return may not really be on his terms. Gehlot’s continuation in the chief minister’s chair does make it a little difficult for him to return, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-ready-for-a-face-saver-for-pilot-he-keeps-them-on-the-edge/story-9hNBKVIKIRi32wFb2fqlvK.html

The petition accuses Centre of contempt for not conducting periodic review of its orders suspending internet services in Jammu and Kashmir.The apex court has given the Centre a week’s time to file its response.The petitioner, NGO Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP), claimed that no action has been taken by the Centre to comply with the Supreme Court’s order on the issue on May 11. It then urged the court to initiate contempt proceedings against the Centre.The court had asked for a special committee to be formed on restoring mobile internet services in Jammu and Kashmir in its previous order.Attorney General KK Venugopal denied there was any contempt on the Centre’s part. He told a three-judge bench, headed by Justice NV Ramana, that the special committee headed by Secretary, ministry of home affairs, is already in place as per the Supreme Court’s order.Venugopal further pointed out that since May, the committee met twice and asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration to find out if relaxation is possible in restrictions in telecom services.He also agreed to file a response within one week.The Supreme Court had said in its May 11 order that indefinite suspension of internet is not permissible and that these curbs will have to follow principles of proportionality.The Attorney General said that the situation is startling in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of increasing terrorist attacks. He agreed to place the minutes before the top court in a sealed cover.The petitioner had first approached the top court in April, challenging Jammu and Kashmir administration’s March 26 order restricting internet speed. It had urged the court to order restoration of 4G services in Jammu and Kashmir. The FMP had further said that suspension of services had severely impeded normal life of people in the union territory.The FMP had argued that communication shutdown makes it impossible for journalists to perform their duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/internet-curbs-in-j-k-supreme-court-seeks-centre-s-response-on-plea-seeking-contempt-charges/story-Q4lUEM6BQ95bvdTOwavqoM.html

We are hopeful that we will get justice. Looking at the country’s and the state’s financial condition, we want that the Supreme Court allows the resumption of mining. Goa has low-grade iron ore, which can only be exported. We are hopeful,” Sawant said.Also read: Three-day lockdown in Goa from Friday to curb Covid-19 spreadThe review petition, which was belatedly filed, is one of the two petitions before the Supreme Court on which the state is gambling to resume mining. The other is a special leave petition before the Supreme Court by Vedanta Ltd, the largest mining company that operated in Goa. The company which has challenged a decision by the Goa government to decline its request to amend their mining lease and extend the period from 1987 to 2037 i.e. for a period of 50 years in terms of Section 8(A)(3) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDR Act).The Goa government had declined to renew the leases citing the Supreme Court’s order which specifically barred the state from renewing leases and instead directed them to issue fresh leases if mining is to restart.The Goa government is yet to begin the process of issuing fresh leases but has instead hinged its hopes on a favourable order from the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-hopeful-of-favourable-hearing-on-mining-petitions-scheduled-before-sc-today/story-iZTlkuWsENl80OFPK7GYzK.html

Delhi has faired well this month as compared to June concerning the coronavirus situation. By July 15, Delhi was expected to witness 2.25 lakh coronavirus cases but only 1.15 lakh cases have been reported till date. It was estimated that 34 thousand beds would be needed across hospitals but around 10 thousand beds are currently unoccupied across various hospitals in Delhi. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said this is the result of collective efforts by all, adding that while the infection seems to be under control, the administration’s preparedness is necessary. A host of factors have contributed to Delhi’s strong hold on the spread of coronavirus. Here’s taking a look at some of them as reported by Live Hindustan. Ramped up testing Coronavirus cases were rapidly increasing in Delhi in the first week of June. At that time, around 5,500 tests were being done daily in the national capital which has now been increased to more than 21 thousand. Increased number of bedsIn the first week of June, there were only 700 corona beds in eight private hospitals. Today, Delhi has 15,000 beds, out of which more than 10 thousand beds are unoccupied. The administration also launched a mobile application through which patients can easily monitor the availability of beds at various hospitals. Pulse oximeters - the protective shiedDelhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that the national capital has been able to “minimise deaths” of Covid-19 patients in home isolation with the help of pulse oximeters. The chief minister described it as a protective shield or “suraksha kavach”. “If patients detect their oxygen is falling, they reach out to us for help. We immediately send oxygen concentrators to their home or take them to a hospital,” Kejriwal had tweeted.Response time of ambulanceThe response time of an ambulance was previously two hours which has now come down to 30 minutes. A war room was created for ambulance management wherein over 400 ambulances were dedicated for Covid-19 patients. Plasma banks The government introduced plasma therapy for serious Covid-19 patients. A total of 84 patients were provided the therapy, of which 80 were cured. The first plasma bank was set up at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS). Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday inaugurated the national capital’s second plasma bank for Covid-19 patients at government-run Lok Nayak Hospital. According to government data, the administration’s home isolation model has also helped a great deal in the speedy recovery of patients with mild symptoms or those who are asymptomatic. Delhi has reported over 1.1 lakh coronavirus cases till date of which over 95 thousand patients have beaten the virus. Delhi’s active cases stand over 17,000 while more than 3,000 people have succumbed to death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pulse-oximeters-plasma-bank-to-ramped-up-testing-how-delhi-fights-back-covid-19/story-AOsudhu5ew9DB7jOsZhT5K.html

In a tweet on Thursday morning, Sibal hit back at Sachin Pilot and took a swipe at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“False rumours spread to malign. Pilot: “I am not joining BJP”. I guess then legislators at a hotel in Manesar is merely a vacation in Haryana’s comfort zone under BJP’s watchful eye. What about “ghar wapsi”?” Sibal tweeted. False rumours spread to malign Pilot : " I am not joining BJP "I guess then legislators at a hotel in Manesar is merely a vacation in Haryana’s comfort zone under BJP’s watchful eye What about " ghar wapsi "?His tweet came after it was reported that Pilot and several of his followers are at a hotel in Manesar in Haryana. Its location indicated that Pilot’s move had the blessings of the BJP leadership, which leads the ruling coalition in Haryana.The crisis in Rajasthan began after chief minister Ashok Gehlot claimed that attempts were made to topple his government. The state police took notice of the development and its Special Operations Group (SOG) sent notices to a few leaders, including Pilot.His camp called these notices a joke and he left Rajasthan with his supporters, and claimed that the Gehlot government is in minority.A hectic few days began with Congress deputing its senior leaders to defuse the crisis. Attempts were made to woo Pilot back but he refused to listen and did not attend the CLP meetings of the party. Pilot was removed as Rajasthan Congress chief and Gehlot dropped him from his cabinet.On Wednesday, the chief minister claimed that Pilot was involved in horse-trading with the BJP. In an interaction with reporters, the chief minister did not mention Pilot by his name but said the “former Pradesh Congress Committee president” was himself “doing the deal”.“Some of our colleagues fell into the BJP trap, became over-ambitious and got involved in horse-trading,” the CM alleged.“Our deputy chief minister and PCC president himself was doing the deal and was giving statements that no horse-trading was taking place. What clarifications are you giving when you yourself were involved in it,” Gehlot added.Pilot, meanwhile, claimed that he is not joining the BJP, asserting that he had worked hard to defeat the saffron party and bring the Congress back to power in Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-about-ghar-wapsi-kapil-sibal-takes-a-swipe-at-sachin-pilot/story-2nnUpN3i91ysckJZWwYuIK.html

However, the projections are likely to differ after taking into account the current Covid-19 situation in the country.Also read: To ramp up coronavirus testing, Delhi clinics put TB machines to useIn its “worse scenario” projection, the model predicted no Covid-19 peak for India until the end of March 2021. Whereas going by the “better scenario”, India’s Covid-19 peak could come by the “second week of September” or by October.The model laid great emphasis on the initiation of “one or two-day lockdown per week” to cut the rate of new infections. “One or two day lockdown per week (e.g., Sunday, Sunday & Wednesday etc) with complete compliance along with adequate social distancing during other days is effective to reduce the spread,” the study read.Also read: Why Bihar should be conducting more Covid-19 tests than Delhi isIt also noted the steady improvement in India’s Covid-19 recovery rate and emphasised the importance of appropriate medical care and timely quarantine.“Among all measures, contact tracing, quarantine and social distancing are key to contain the spread in the absence of vaccine,” it stated.India’s Covid-19 tally now near the 10 lakh mark with over 24,000 deaths and the number of recovered patients touching 6 lakh.

He later walked into a police station with the severed head and axe, they added.The police said that Kartik Kerei of Chhatara village in Danagadi block of Jajpur district had taken his ailing cousin brother to Nandini Purti, who used to practice black magic. Nandini reportedly assured Kartik that his brother would get cured by her black magic skills.Danagadi inspector AK Mohanty said after Kerei brought his brother home, his condition worsened. Kerei rushed Purti to the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack, but he died on the way.“Angry over Nandini’s black magic skills going wrong, Kerei picked up an axe and went to Nandini’s home where he hacked her to death. He then carried the severed head to police station and surrendered,” said the inspector.Kerei was arrested and the axe seized by police.In a similar incident last month, a 30-year-old man in Mayurbhanj district had killed his aunt on suspicion of practising black magic and then walked with her severed head to police station. Budhuram Singh had severed the head of his aunt Champa Singh, suspecting that his daughter’s death was the result of black magic done by the 60-year-old.On an average, 60 witchcraft-related murders have taken place annually since 2010 across Odisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-killed-over-witchcraft-suspicion-in-odisha-man-walks-into-police-station-with-severed-head/story-uDX0XgXtAxtL5YyaC2s86K.html

The two sides remain committed to the objective of complete disengagement. This process is intricate and requires constant verification. They are taking it forward through regular meetings at diplomatic and military level.The meeting of the corps commanders also discussed and defined specific time lines for total disengagement at PP15 and Pangong Tso. According to Indian officials, there are a smattering of troops of both sides on the ridge of Finger 4 as a precaution, with the Chinese PLA now moving to Finger 6 with a limited presence in Finger 5.The officials added that based on the outcome of the meeting of the commanders, it looks like things have cooled down between the two armies , and that the Chinese PLA is showing signs that it is working towards returning to the April 20 status quo. HT also learns that the Chinese PLA has withdrawn beyond its side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) at Patrolling Point 17 (Hot Springs) with all its tents, vehicles and material.Also read: How PM Modi called China’s bluff in LadakhEven at Gogra, PLA has a very thin presence of around 30 PLA troopers in forward locations, and timelines have been set for a total withdrawal by this weekend. However, the Modi government is monitoring the 1,597km LAC in Ladakh and the 1,127km LAC in Arunachal Pradesh closely and the forces remain on alert. It is only after the disengagement is completed that the two Special Representatives (Doval and Foreign Minister Wang Yi) will discuss steps towards de-escalation.They will also work towards a permanent mechanism to ensure that what happened in Ladakh isn’t repeated.While the Chinese withdrawal is being verified on the ground by both physical observation and technical intelligence, Beijing watchers here are questioning the decision of the PLA military commander or Central Military Commission member who advised President Xi Jinping to indulge in the Ladakh adventure.They point to the presence of the US super carriers openly challenging the PLA Navy in the South China Sea, the ASEAN countries standing up to Beijing, and the economic and political costs.The US, India and UK have all decided to keep Chinese companies out of their 5G networks, and many countries are seriously reviewing the extent of Chinese penetration into their telecom and media sectors.Interestingly, China’s Western Theatre Commander Zhao Zongqi, widely believed to behind the Ladakh gambit and who was also the architect of the Doklam stand-off, turns 65 (the official age for retirement in the PLA for theatre commanders) this November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forward-momentum-in-india-china-commanders-meeting/story-osXRt1KIOyZHZDramvns7I.html
16-07-2020||India||Why Bihar should be conducting more Covid-19 tests than Delhi is||Earlier this month, a wedding in Patna district became the biggest Covid-19 hotspot in Bihar. The groom, who had come from Gurugram had been feeling unwell a few days before the wedding and wanted it to be postponed. However, his family did not agree and forced him to go ahead. Even on the day of wedding, he was made to take paracetamol tablets and go through the rituals. The groom died two days after the wedding. His family cremated him without informing the administration. However, the administration came to know about it. Close relatives of the groom were tested. Fifteen of them were found positive for Covid-19 infection. Of the 364 people who were traced to have participated in the wedding, 86 were found Covid-19 positive.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe entire episode seems to be a result of recklessness on part of the groom’s family. An HT analysis based on the latest Sample Registration System (SRS), National Sample Survey and Covid-19 testing statistics suggest otherwise. It tells us why a state like Bihar is more likely to fail to detect Covid-19 infections and deaths than a place like Delhi or Kerala. Here’s why. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The latest SRS data gives a state-wise breakup of type of medical treatment received before death. There are four categories under this head: government hospital, private hospital, qualified professional and untrained functionary and others. Bihar had the lowest share of deaths (32.1%) where the medical treatment was in a government or private hospital.Also read: Covid-19 rapid antigen tests high on accuracy, but protocols crucial Data on tests per million people compiled by HT shows that Bihar also had the lowest testing per capita among the 22 large states for which data on the treatment received before death is available in the SRS data. To be sure, Bihar is not the only state facing this challenge. Chart 1 shows a scatter plot of Covid-19 tests per million and share of deaths where medical attention before death was at a hospital. States such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, West Bengal are in the worst quadrant. They have lower hospital attention before deaths and are also testing fewer people. Delhi is in the best quadrant. It has the highest per capita testing as well as the highest proportion of deaths where treatment was in a hospital. Kerala, scores badly on per capita testing, but does well on hospitalisation attention before deaths. Assam has a poor score on hospitalisation attention before death, but it has done well in per capita tests.States that have low per capita testing and low hospitalisation rates even in the event of life threatening illnesses will find it difficult to deduct Covid-19 infections, fatalities, and therefore, possible hotspots in time.To be sure, Bihar fares relatively better when it comes to share of deaths where medical attention was received from an untrained professional. It was ranked sixth among 22 states for which data is available. Also, 40% of deaths received attention from a qualified medical professional before death in the state, which is the fourth highest among states. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); However, the collapse of the health system after the pandemic could have made access to doctors more difficult in the state. In an analysis in April this year, Rukmini S used National Health Mission data to highlight a massive disruption to health service provisioning because of the pandemic. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Bihar has been facing absenteeism from doctors after the pandemic. States with poorly functioning health sector could be facing similar problems.There is another reason why a more pro-active approach is needed for detecting Covid-19 infections among the poor. A 2017-18 NSS survey on consumption of health services shows that the poor are less likely to report illnesses. Proportion of persons that responded as ailing (PPRA) in the 15 days prior to the survey among the top 20% (by household expenditure) was 2.2 times in rural areas and 1.7 times in urban areas compared to the bottom 20%.A state-wise comparison of PPRA figures from the NSS and life expectancy statistics from the latest SRS suggests under-reporting of illnesses in states such as Bihar. Bihar has the lowest PPRA figures among the 22 states for which life expectancy statistics are available in the SRS. However, this does not mean that Biharis are the healthiest people. This can be seen from the average life expectancy levels. In contrast, a state like Kerala has the highest level of both PPRA and life expectancy. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();People not reporting themselves as sick when they are unwell, not visiting a hospital when they might be dying, and the state not testing enough to compensate for these institutional oversights is a dangerous combination during a pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-bihar-should-be-conducting-more-covid-19-tests-than-delhi-is/story-Z7pT288etII9ieyQhHQtRM.html
16-07-2020||India||Dalit couple consumes poison after land taken away, beating by police||The Madhya Pradesh government ordered on Wednesday a high-level inquiry into the case of a Dalit couple consuming pesticide in Guna district after police allegedly tried to remove them from a piece of land.The couple and local residents said they were forcibly removed but the local administration refuted these allegations and said a local land mafia was resisting an anti-encroachment drive by the police and using poor people to thwart the government’s efforts.The couple -- Ramkumar Ahirwar, 37, a resident of Janakpur Chak village and his wife Savitri Ahirwar, 35 -- were rushed to the district hospital in Guna on Tuesday where their condition was said to be stable, added police.“On a complaint of a revenue officer in Guna, police on Wednesday registered an FIR against Ramkumar, Savitri, Shishupal Ahirwar [younger brother of Ramkumar] and four others, all residents if Janakpur Chak village for deterring him from discharging his government duty. A separate case has been registered against Ramkumar and Savitri for making an attempt to commit suicide,” said Tarun Nayak, superintendent of police.A video of the incident went viral on social media where police personnel could be seen beating Ahirwar’s brother and sister-in-law. Late on Thursday, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s secretariat ordered the transfer of collector S Vishwanathan and superintendent of police Tarun Nayak. It also ordered a high-level inquiry.Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia said, “Guna incident is unfortunate. I had a discussion with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and requested him to take action against insensitive and irresponsible officials. Taking a serious note of the incident the CM has ordered shifting of Guna collector and SP.”Vishwanathan refuted allegations that the family was beaten up and harassed by the administration.The collector said, “The land at Janakpur Chak was earmarked for a science college but a land mafia Babbu Padri is trying to encroach upon the land by using poor people.” He alleged that Ahirwar and his family were being used by Padri to encroach upon the four acre land.“The government had allocated the fund of ~12 crore to PWD for construction of the science college one year ago. The administration was trying to free the land from encroachment for a long time...Ramkumar Ahirwar and his family resisted,” said Vishwanathan. State Congress president Kamal Nath said, “In which direction is Shivraj government taking the state… If there was any land dispute the same could have been addressed legally.”BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “The government will provide all the possible help to the family and will not allow any land mafia to use poor to encroach upon the land.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dalit-couple-consumes-poison-after-land-taken-away-beating-by-police/story-BJcSmnxHZYeAcHUzOPllVJ.html

His father was also with BJP and acted as a general secretary. This family is loyal to the BJP for many years,” Thakur alleged.Malla’s kidnapping abduction comes days after two BJP leaders resigned from the party. However in the evening Malla reached his home without any harm. Police, however, said that Malla was rescued by the police.Last week, BJP former district president, Bandipore, Waseem Bari, was killed, along with his father Basheer Ahmad and brother Suhail Basheer, inside his shop.Jammu & Kashmir Police had said that two outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists were involved in the killing of Bari and his kin.Last Sunday, Union Minister Jitendra Singh and BJP general secretary Ram Madhav visited Bari’s place and met his next of kin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abducted-kashmir-bjp-leader-returns-home-same-day/story-1PyEZGoinmRPP4UTuuCwuI.html

This has lead to a heightened feeling of uncertainty, anxiety and helplessness among many students. “Things around campus have been very messed up. There is so much debate around the online Open Book Exam. Job offers are not on the table. Our whole future is at stake! There’s a prevalent feeling of hopelessness since the online-offline exam debate has begun, and it just doesn’t seem to end,” says Manish Dhawan, a student of Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College.Students who are still in hostels, miles away from their families, are experiencing loneliness and feeling stressed out due to recent developments on campus. “There’s this constant fear I have for my family that gives me jitters. I’m unable to be with them at this time, and I don’t know how they are coping. Likewise, my parents are worried that I’m living in Delhi, where the number of cases is increasing rapidly,” says Sanjay Kataria, a student of Department of Library and Information Science, DU. To battle against such stressors, some students have resorted to sports whereas certain others are trying different therapies that can help them stay calm. Kataria says, “I play badminton with my hostel mates to distract myself from all depressing news around me. Physical activity leads to release of endorphins and acts as a great benefactor in such times.” On the official website of DU, there’s a list of e-mails and contact numbers of teachers, who are volunteering to provide free online counselling to students who are grappling with the situation. However, students claim that these aren’t of real help. “Some numbers don’t work. I have dialled them, and many a times the calls went unanswered. When somebody did pick up the phone at the other end, they asked me to write a mail to them first. Besides, three email addresses and seven enlisted numbers can’t address the mental health problems of around ten thousand students on campus,” says Utkarsh Singh from Satyawati College, adding, “We were added to a WhatsApp group with a teacher who was supposed to be a mental health counsellor. Once a week, the teacher used to send generic messages regarding staying stress free and then remained unavailable for the rest of the time. How does it help if the volunteer isn’t available when needed!”Akshat Rawal, a student of College Of Vocational Studies, shares that some differently abled students, including him, have taken up art therapy to deal with the mental stress they are experiences. Rawal adds, “Life is certainly more challenging for the differently abled students. We are facing a lot of problems in this pandemic year, and to cope with this anxiety, we have been connecting with each other over video calls. I even teach my friends, who are differently abled, how to use art therapy, to vent out our angst creatively. In those few hours that we spend painting, I forget about the mounting stress in my life... Art is a form of meditation through which one can counter mental stress caused by academic pressures.” If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

16-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Data and science, I wrote in this column a few weeks ago, are the only two things needed to fight the coronavirus disease — and establishments around the world have always had an uneasy relationship with both.I was reminded of this after The New York Times reported that the US federal government has ordered hospitals to stop sending Covid-19 patient information to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and instead send it to a central database. The piece added that “the move has alarmed health experts who fear that the data will be politicised or withheld from the public”.Also read: Covid-19 rapid antigen tests high on accuracy, but protocols crucialAround the world, governments and provincial and local administrations are being feted or faulted for the number of Covid-19 cases and the number of deaths in their countries, states, cities, even districts. This is understandable — the number of new cases and the spread of infections are directly related to how well administrations manage to enforce the wearing of masks and social distancing, and their effectiveness in testing and tracing; and the number of deaths depends on access to and quality of health care.As the number of cases in the US rises (the average new cases for the past week was around 60,000 a day) in an election year, it is understandable that the Trump administration wants to control the data. Understandable, but still not correct.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Closer home, states that aren’t testing enough are equally at fault. Among large states (with a population in excess of 50 million), the states that perform the worst in terms of number of people tested for Covid-19 for every million of the population are Bihar (2,737 per million), Uttar Pradesh (5,144 per million), Madhya Pradesh (6,344 per million), West Bengal (6,589 per million), and Gujarat (7,035 per million). The national average is 9,313, and all other states with a population in excess of 50 million test more than that. If the states don’t test enough, they won’t show enough cases, and the thinking is that this makes them look good. That it may — but only in the short-term. Six months after the pandemic began (though the World Health Organization dragged its feet, declaring it as a pandemic only on March 11), and nearly four months after I started writing this column, it can be safely said that when it comes to Covid-19, there is no such thing as an exception. If the data is too good to be true, it probably isn’t true.Every country, and every region within a country, invariably traverses the same trajectory of infections. It may not when it comes to deaths, because that is also a function of health care, and there may be other factors at play — such as the BCG vaccine, which research, including a very interesting Indian study, has shown to provide some kind of protection from Covid-19 (HT has reported this extensively). Also read: 99 doctors have died fighting Covid 19, IMA sounds ‘Red Alert’The only lucky break anyone can catch is probabilistic — the disease doesn’t infect everyone exposed to it, and everyone infected by it does not transmit it. All of this adds up to just one thing — if every state in India were to test at the same level, the number of infections they find per million of the population should fall within a range. If it doesn’t, there are other factors at play.With deaths beginning to come under control across India, the two key parameters to watch are the tests per million and the positivity rate.The chart accompanying this column shows how large states (population in excess of 50 million) perform when mapped against this — in a classic matrix of the kind that consultants love. States that are housed in the first quadrant (low testing and low positivity rate) are the ones India should be worrying about the most. States that are in the third quadrant (high testing and high positivity rate; Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra) will all eventually enter the fourth one (high testing and low positivity rate) signalling that they have travelled the course of the pandemic. The caveat (there is always one): it is important that states traverse the trajectory in terms of positivity rates as they increase testing. That means Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, which are already in the fourth quadrant, have to be evaluated against this metric. It also means a weekly snapshot of average daily tests and average positivity rates may provide states with a good dashboard to measure their progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-hjzNvHL7vKF9HNQr79qphM.html
16-07-2020||India||Won’t join BJP: Sachin Pilot; CM Ashok Gehlot says a coup was in works||The political turmoil within the Rajasthan Congress continued on Wednesday, with chief minister Ashok Gehlot accusing his former deputy Sachin Pilot of being part of a conspiracy to topple the government and asserting that it was political commitment — and not traits such as looking good and speaking fluent English — that mattered in public life.This sharp attack on Pilot, who was sacked by the Congress as deputy CM and the state unit chief on Tuesday, came hours after the rebel leader said that he remained a Congressman, had not made any disparaging comments against the party and the high command, and would not join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The Congress said its doors were still open for Pilot, with former party president Rahul Gandhi understood to have told party leaders to leave room for an “honourable stay” in the party. But the Congress laid out a clear set of conditions for Pilot — recognise his mistake, stop “conversing” with BJP leaders, get legislators loyal to him to leave the Manesar hotel where they are being “hosted” by Haryana government, communicate directly with Congress leadership rather than through the media, and “return home to Jaipur”.Also read: 24 hours of twists and turns in Rajasthan political dramaIn moves that further highlighted the Congress’s stance, the party on Wednesday dissolved the state, district and block units of the Rajasthan Congress which, so far, had Pilot’s strong imprint.The Rajasthan assembly, too, sent showcase notices to rebel legislators, based on a Congress petition, accusing them of “anti-party activities” — an initial step in disqualification proceedings — and asked them to respond by July 17.Speaking to reporters in Jaipur, Gehlot, said that he had “proof” that horse trading was taking place and money was being offered to legislators (to topple the government). In a direct reference to Pilot, the CM said: “With us, you are deputy CM and PCC (state unit chief) and you make deals with [BJP] people. You ask for mobile number and names and are involved in conspiracy and then... give clarification that there was no horse trading. You were part of the conspiracy and what are you clarifying now... Speaking good English or giving byte or being handsome is not everything. What do you have in your heart, what commitment do you have, all this is seen.”The numbers still remained slightly tenuous for Gehlot, who appeared to have the support of at least 100 members — one short of the majority mark in the 200-member state assembly (though this does not include speaker CP Joshi). The allegiance of one of the two members of the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) remained in flux through the day. Pilot has 18 other Congress MLAs and three independents in his camp.The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. One Congress MLA, Bhanwarlal Meghwal, is indisposed, though he is said to be close to Pilot. If any of the Congress MLAs with Pilot are disqualified, however, it will reduce the strength of the house and increase Gehlot’s majority.Earlier, in an interview to India Today magazine, published on Wednesday morning, Pilot criticised Gehlot’s governance in Rajasthan, said the CM had “humiliated” him, claimed he had repeatedly raised issues in internal party forums, rejected all allegations of conspiring with the BJP, said that he was still a Congressman and that all he wanted was “dignity and the freedom to work”.Outlining his grievances with Gehlot, he said: “He did not allow me and my followers the dignity and space to work for Rajasthan’s development. The bureaucrats were asked not to follow my directives, files were not sent to me, Cabinet meetings and Congress Legislature Party meetings had not been held for months. What’s the worth of a position if that doesn’t allow me to fulfil the commitments I made to my people?” He said he had not attended the recent legislative party meeting because his “self respect” was hurt because of the police notice against him, which included sedition charges.When asked whether he would stay on in the Congress, Pilot said, “Let the feeling sink in. It has not even been 24 hours. I’m still a Congressman. I have to discuss with my followers about my next course of action.” But he categorically said he had not met any BJP leader.After Gehlot spoke on Wednesday afternoon, strongly rebutting Pilot, Rahul Gandhi called up the central observers and asked them to leave a window open for Pilot’s “honourable stay” in the party, according to a person familiar with the development. “Rahulji felt that nothing should be done to precipitate the matter further after Pilot insisted that he will not leave the Congress to join the BJP,” he said. It was after this that Randeep Singh Surjewala, the party’s chief spokesperson and a central party observer delegated for Rajasthan, spoke to the media — in remarks which firmly outlined the party’s red lines but were more accommodative than those of Gehlot. He said that the party had noted Pilot’s statement that he would not go to the BJP. “If you do not want to go to the BJP, stop accepting the hospitality of the BJP immediately,” Surjewala said, claiming that the rebel legislators were under the security net provided by the BJP government in Haryana. “Come back and you can talk to the leadership about all the issues that you have directly, not through the media.”Asked about his comments, and whether they were reconciliatory, Surjewala said, “Whatever I said was with the concurrence, consent and approval of the Congress leadership, the chief minister and the party.”Reacting to Gehlot’s statement on horse-trading, a former minister in his Cabinet and a Pilot loyalist, Ramesh Meena, said: “People are disgruntled from his working and dominating bureaucracy across the state. Our demands and issues were not addressed. The CM made statements on horse trading and luring of MLAs, I want to ask him – how much was paid to us when we joined Congress from BSP?The Rajasthan BJP, which is waiting and watching the events unfold, claimed that the Gehlot government was in a minority but said it will not seek a floor test just yet. The leader of opposition in the assembly, Gulab Chand Kataria, said it was for the Congress government or the rebel MLAs who are supporting former deputy CM Sachin Pilot to do so.He also questioned the notices issued by the assembly speaker to the 19 MLAs, contending that the assembly secretariat had “no locus standi” in the matter.The Rajasthan Assembly sent notices to the MLAs, including Pilot, based on a petition of chief whip Mahesh Joshi to Speaker CP Joshi. The notices were sent through WhatsApp, email and even pasted outside their houses late Tuesday night. The MLAs have been asked to respond by 1pm on Friday.“The Assembly will take a legal view of the future course depending upon the replies,” said Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-join-bjp-pilot-cm-says-a-coup-was-in-works/story-4LbjrRBL0QEaYfzmFudRuL.html
16-07-2020||India||Relief for students as US rolls back visa rule||The US has withdrawn a rule that required international students, including hundreds of thousands of Indians, to leave the country if their schools held classes entirely online amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) restrictions — a move that was welcomed by students who were at risk of being deported, their families, and universities that had vehemently opposed the decision.The Trump administration on Tuesday conveyed its decision to a federal US district court that was hearing a challenge by Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), joined by hundreds of other schools and colleges, and some states.Under the policy, international students in the US would have been prohibited from taking all their courses online this fall. New visas would not have been issued to students at schools planning to provide all classes online, which includes Harvard. Students already in the US would have faced deportation if they didn’t transfer to schools with in-person instructors or leave the country voluntarily amid the pandemic.The US is the worst-hit country by the infectious disease, with the virus infecting more than 3.5 million people and killing about 140,000.“The government has agreed to rescind the July 6 2020 policy directive and the frequently asked questions, the FAQs, that were released the next day on July 7,” district court judge Allison D Burroughs said just as the hearing started. “They also agreed to rescind any implementation of the directive,” the judge added.According to a recent report of the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVP), 194,556 Indian students were enrolled at various academic institutions in the US in January. The issue was raised by Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla during an online meeting with US undersecretary of state for political affairs David Hale.Foreign students earlier said international travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic made it increasingly difficult for them to return to their home countries, while those outside America were uncertain if they will be able to travel back.On Tuesday, US district judge Allison Burroughs said federal immigration authorities agreed to pull the July 6 directive and “return to the status quo”.With the policy rescinded, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will revert to a directive from March that suspended typical limits around online education for foreign students.Harvard president Lawrence Bacow called it a “significant victory”.“While the government may attempt to issue a new directive, our legal arguments remain strong and the Court has retained jurisdiction, which would allow us to seek judicial relief immediately to protect our international students should the government again act unlawfully,” Bacow said in a statement.MIT’s president said his institution also stands ready “to protect our students from any further arbitrary policies”.“This case also made abundantly clear that real lives are at stake in these matters, with the potential for real harm,” president L Rafael Reif said in a statement. “We need to approach policy making, especially now, with more humanity, more decency — not less.”ICE did not immediately comment on the decision.The surprise decision was welcomed by students across who would be affected by the ICE policy.Omkar Joshi, a doctoral student at the University of Maryland, said: “This is a really good development and we are relieved after the order.” Though the university opted for a hybrid model of teaching, “it was still not clear to students how many courses they had to take under the new directive, or how many hours they had to spend on the campus,” Joshi added.Tanujay Saha at the Princeton University said that though he was not personally impacted by the July 6 directive because he finished most of his coursework as a doctoral student and was focused on research work, the work in his lab came to a “standstill” as people could not “work for a day or two” in the aftermath of the order.Immigration officials issued the policy last week, reversing the earlier guidance from March 13, telling colleges that limits around online education would be suspended during the pandemic. University leaders believed the rule was part of President Donald Trump’s effort to pressure the nation’s schools and colleges to reopen this fall even as new virus cases rise.The policy drew sharp backlash from higher education institutions, with more than 200 signing court briefs supporting the challenge by Harvard and MIT. Colleges said the policy would put students’ safety at risk and hurt schools financially.The US admits an estimated one million international students every year and they generate around $41 billion worth of economic activity and support 450,000 jobs, according to the American Council on Education, which represents US colleges and universities. Incomes generated from foreign students are critical to the financial health of many US colleges.Seventeen US states and the District of Columbia, along with top American IT companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft, joined the MIT and Harvard in the US District Court in Massachusetts in seeking an injunction to stop the entire rule from going into effect.The lawsuit alleged that the new rule imposes a significant economic harm by precluding thousands of international students from coming to and residing in the US, and finding employment in fields such as science, technology, biotechnology, health care, business and finance, and education, and contributing to the overall economy.In a separate filing, companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft, along with the US Chamber of Commerce and other IT advocacy groups, asserted that the ICE directive would disrupt their recruiting plansThe American Council on Education, which represents university presidents, applauded ICE’s pullback of the rule. The group called the policy “wrongheaded” and said it drew unprecedented opposition from colleges.“There has never been a case where so many institutions sued the federal government,” said Terry Hartle, the group’s senior vice president. “In this case, the government didn’t even try to defend its policymaking.”Elizabeth Warren, Democratic senator and former presidential candidate, tweeted: “I’m glad the Trump admin agreed to rescind this dangerous & xenophobic #StudentBan policy after we demanded they reverse course & MA schools sued them. I’ll keep fighting to make sure it stays that way… When we fight back, we can make a real difference.” International students enrolled in academic programmes at US universities and colleges study on an F-1 visa and those enrolled in technical programmes at vocational or other recognised non-academic institutions, other than a language training programme, come to the US on an M-1 visa.(With inputs from AP and PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relief-for-students-as-us-rolls-back-visa-rule/story-u23HaSvdvUxqmJbibLerkO.html
16-07-2020||India||PM Modi invites EU firms to invest, boost economy||India and the European Union (EU) agreed on Wednesday to start a high-level dialogue on finalising trade and investment agreements even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited European businesses to invest in the country to hasten a post-Covid-19 economic recovery.During a virtual summit, the leadership of the two sides agreed to scale up defence and security ties, including the launch of a new maritime security dialogue, consultations on crisis management and deeper cooperation between the Indian Navy and the European Union Naval Force Atalanta, the EU’s counter-piracy military operation in the western Indian Ocean.With India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Europol launching negotiations to combat organised crime and terrorism, the two sides decided to intensify cooperation to tackle terror and its financing, radicalisation and abuse of the internet for such activities. Indian officials said Pakistan’s support for terrorism aimed at India and other countries in the region figured in the discussions.While the joint statement and other documents adopted at the meeting, such as the strategic partnership roadmap till 2025, made no direct mention of New Delhi’s standoff with Beijing, many measures agreed on by India and the EU to strengthen multilateralism and protect a rules-based order appeared to be aimed at countering the rise of an assertive China.Modi emphasised the priority India attaches to foreign direct investment (FDI) and efforts to liberalise regulations and improve the ease of doing business, secretary (west) Vikas Swarup of the external affairs ministry told a news briefing.“He invited European businesses to utilise the opportunities in India and conveyed that Atmabirbhar Bharat {Self-Reliant India} is aimed at integrating domestic production with global supply chains,” he said.Though the two sides launched negotiations on a bilateral trade and investment agreement (BTIA) in 2007, talks stalled in 2013 over differences on market access and movement of professionals.Swarup said the two sides have now agreed to launch a high-level dialogue between India’s commerce minister and the EU trade commissioner to foster progress on “balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial” trade and investment agreements, address trade irritants and discuss supply chain linkages. Though no time-frame was set for concluding these agreements, a meeting of the dialogue mechanism will be held “as soon as possible, in the next few months”, he added. Modi, who co-chaired the summit with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said the India-EU partnership can play a key role in post-Covid-19 economic reconstruction and human-centric globalisation.The two sides, he said, are natural partners because of shared values such as democracy, respect for international institutions and multilateralism, at a time when there are “different types of pressures on the rules-based international order”.“Like you, I am committed to deepen relations between India and the EU. For this, we must adopt a long-term strategic perspective and an action-oriented agenda should be implemented within a stipulated time-frame,” Modi said.The European leadership noted that while the 27-member bloc is India’s largest trade and investment partner, India represented only 2% of EU’s total trade. India’s annual trade in goods and services with the EU is worth $140 billion, and European firms have invested more than $91 billion in the country.Von der Leyen said trade and investment agreements will have to ensure market access and avoid barriers. The EU side raised with Modi the need to make tough choices such as phasing out coal while discussing cooperation on climate change. The EU side also offered to share its experience in data protection legislation as convergence of standards will facilitate data flows, she said.Michel, who described India as an “indispensible partner” at a news conference, said India’s recent election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2021-22 and to the G20 presidency in 2022 will allow the two sides to work together on multilateralism and keeping the global trading system open.Officials of both sides acknowledged that the India-China border standoff figured in the discussions, and that Modi shared his views on the current situation in the border areas.Without mentioning China, both Michel and von der Leyen assured India of EU’s support.Michel said: “The EU and India are more than economic partners – we are political partners committed to peaceful resolution of conflicts, security and rule of law...India can count on the EU and we count on India to be a key partner.”Von der Leyen added: “Today, our main message has been that the EU stands by India as friends and partners.”Asked whether India was more strategic than China for the EU, Michel replied the EU-China relationship was “complex” and the bloc supports all efforts to maintain channels of dialogue to find peaceful solutions. However, he added that India was a partner because both sides share the “same vision of globalisation inspired by democratic standards and principles of freedom, liberty and inclusivity”.The two sides decided to ramp up cooperation on Covid-19 vaccines and diagnostic and treatment tools based on their strengths in the production of pharmaceuticals and research and development. They agreed to work for the accessibility and affordability of tools and universal and affordable vaccines.The European Parliament has debated the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the recent past and Michel said the EU side raised the matter with Modi during the meeting. “We trust the Indian institutions, we understand that the Supreme Court will have a role to play in order to assess this legislation,” he said.EU will continue a strong dialogue with India on human rights to exchange best practices and have the “best possible understanding about how to tackle this important issue”, he added.The two sides also welcomed the signing of a civil nuclear cooperation agreement whereby the Department of Atomic Energy and Euratom will cooperate in civilian nuclear applications in agriculture, healthcare and industry, radioactive waste management and nuclear security. The EU also welcomed India’s proposal to build a connectivity partnership that is open, sustainable and rules-based.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-invites-eu-firms-to-invest-boost-economy/story-iIF88adB5QNoPGTEJg4SWM.html
16-07-2020||India||Delhi power tussle: Govt, L-G spar over panel for riots cases||Lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal and the Delhi government led by Arvind Kejriwal are again locked in confrontation -- this time over the appointment of special public prosecutors (SPPs) in the high court to argue cases related to the communal riots in February and the protests against the citizenship amendment act (CAA).On July 10, the Delhi police had sent a proposal to the Delhi government recommending the names of six special public prosecutors including Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aman Lekhi to fight 85 cases related to the NE riots and the anti-CAA protests in the high court.However, the tussle began on Tuesday (July 14) when deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who currently also has temporary charge of the home department, rejected the Delhi police’s proposal, government officials said. “The proposal was rejected by the deputy chief minister saying that Delhi government’s counsel Rahul Mehra and his team were capable enough of handling the cases,” said the official on condition of anonymity.The same day after Sisodia dismissed the Delhi police’s panel and sent back the file, the L-G summoned the file using his special powers, another official said.When contacted, neither the Delhi government nor the L-G office gave any official statement on the matter.The face-off comes barely a month after the L-G and the elected government in Delhi had strong disagreements with regard to the appointment of 11 public prosecutors appointed by the Delhi police in the lower courts for over 750 northeast Delhi riots cases. The L-G then had decided to refer the matter to President Ram Nath Kovind, citing persistent “difference of opinion” , following which the then home minister Satyendar Jain has approved the Delhi Police’s panel.Documents seen by HT suggest the confrontation, brewing since April, is over whose panel of public prosecutors should represent the state in the trials pertaining to the northeast Delhi riots, which claimed 53 lives and left over 400 injured. So far, the police have registered 752 FIRs and arrested 1,300 people in connection with the Hindu-Muslim violence.In the last controversy, the L-G, in a string of written communication between him and the Kejriwal government, had stated that the panel proposed by the Delhi Police should be notified and allowed to fight the cases because the riots “disturbed public order” in the capital and “effective prosecution” was needed “to restore faith of the general public and in the Delhi government”.The Kejriwal government wanted its own panel of “independent and technically qualified” special public prosecutors to be appointed to represent the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-power-tussle-govt-l-g-spar-over-panel-for-riots-cases/story-BVWUIounVKQotAouKAbDYM.html
16-07-2020||India||Rajnath to visit Ladakh Friday to assess military preparedness||New Delhi Defence minister Rajnath Singh will visit Ladakh on Friday to review military preparedness and take stock of the developments along the Line of Actual Control, people aware of the developments said on Wednesday, as India and China work on a framework to disengage at the border after a deadly clash last month.Singh will be accompanied by Chief of Army Staff General MM Naravane during the defence minister’s first visit to Ladakh after the stand-off between the Indian and Chinese armies began in May.The government’s high-powered China Study Group (CSG) on Wednesday reviewed the latest developments in eastern Ladakh, with focus on the next stage of disengagement between the Indian and Chinese armies following a 14-hour meeting between senior military commanders from both sides at Chushul to discuss the road map for reducing tensions along the LAC, people familiar with the developments said.Singh will also visit forward areas in Jammu and Kashmir on July 18, an official said on condition of anonymity. Naravane will accompany the minister.The military is keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict, as reported by HT on July 2.The minister will be in Ladakh two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled visit to the sector on July 3. The PM then declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China about India’s determination to defend its borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-to-visit-ladakh-friday-to-assess-military-preparedness/story-jaah6TTjBWNTodhjL58H1N.html
16-07-2020||India||Monsoon favourable, likely to cover deficiency soon, says IMD||The first 45 days of the four-month south-west monsoon so far have been favourable for agriculture with 17 states receiving normal rain, 10 receiving excess and two receiving “large excess,” rain, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Wednesday.Delhi, which had a deficiency of 46% until Tuesday, received rain in many parts of the city on Wednesday morning. Parts of Noida and Greater Noida in the National Capital Region (NCR) also received rain. “We are expecting moderate category rain on July 17, 18 and 19 which will help cover the deficiency. There is a cyclonic circulation over Uttar Pradesh and the monsoon trough is also likely to bring rains over the city,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre.Only Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are in the “large deficient” category. Apart from Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, west Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Kerala and Dadra and Nagar Haveli are also rain-deficient. The rain deficiency in northwest India will be covered soon, according to IMD scientists. “As of now, there is a slight deficiency in northwest India which is likely to be covered. Rest of India has got very good rains. Rains will further improve in August and September,” said DS Pai, senior scientist at IMD, Pune. Monsoon rains this year were marked by floods and extremely heavy (over 20 cm rain) in Assam, Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh, landslides in Arunachal Pradesh and record rainfall in Saurashtra. A cool El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral phase is prevailing, Pai said. El Nino is a climate pattern characterised by high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean which are neutral now. El Nino years in India are linked to below-normal monsoon rains and higher than normal frequency of heat waves. Last year, weak El Nino conditionsled to a delayed onset of the monsoon according to scientists.A cool El Nino neutral phase indicates that the sea surface temperature is cooler than normal in the tropical Pacific Ocean. “There is no La Nina (La Niña is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific) phase yet. But cool El Nino neutral conditions favour a normal monsoon over India. Further cooling will ensure more rains in August and September,” added Pai. IMD last month said there is an enhanced probability for development of weak La Niña conditions after the monsoon season, which begins in June and runs till the end of September.“Except for six subdivisions, the distribution of monsoon rains have been very good this year,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.Under the influence of a strong lower level wind convergence along the west coast and an east-west shear zone, widespread and very heavy rains are likely in Konkan and Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Gujarat during the next five days, IMD said in its Wednesday bulletin, adding that strengthening of lower level easterlies and the monsoon trough which is passing over parts of northwest India may cause widespread and heavy rains over the northern plains on July 18 and 19.IMD experts said this monsoon is marked by a lot of moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea as opposed to the Bay of Bengal and frequent oscillation of the monsoon trough (line of low pressure) to the north of its normal position. The normal position of the monsoon trough is between Ganganagar in Rajasthan and the Bay of Bengal.“We are seeing a high convergence of strong, moist westerly and southwesterly winds at lower levels from the Arabian sea. It happened between July 2 and 4, again from July 5 and 7 and now again we are seeing the same pattern so the west coast and Gujarat have got very good rains. No system has developed over the Bay of Bengal. Another feature of this monsoon is the frequent oscillation of the trough to the north and sometimes to the south of its normal position which gave us very good distribution of rains even in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Marathwada, Rayalaseema and Telangana,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the national weather forecasting centre. The monsoon trough is likely to move northwards again between July 19 and 20, which will likely lead to rains in the Himalayan foothills.Okha in Gujarat registered an all-time record with 48 cm of rain on July 7. On July 5, Khambala, Kalyanpur and Porbandar recorded 49 cm, 36 cm and 29 cm respectively. Mumbai received over 15 cm rain on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning in two short spells.Predictions of a bountiful monsoon have spurred hopes of a rural sector-led economic recovery. The June-September monsoon is critical to agriculture and the wider economy. A poor monsoon hits incomes because agriculture employs nearly half of all Indians. The rains are a lifeline for about 60% of the country’s net cultivated area, which has no irrigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-favourable-likely-to-cover-deficiency-soon-says-imd/story-2wIywRvFrbuPkFW6XYXotK.html
16-07-2020||India||Military gets spl powers to expedite weapon purchases of up to Rs300 cr||New Delhi: Amid border tensions with China in Ladakh, the government on Wednesday authorised the armed forces to process cases for buying urgently-needed weapons, ammunition and equipment worth up to Rs 300 crore to meet their critical operational requirements, a defence ministry spokesperson said.The step has been taken to cut delays in the acquisition process. “This [delegation of powers to the armed forces] will shrink the procurement timelines and ensure placement of orders within six months and commencement of deliveries within one year,” the ministry said in a statement.The decision was taken at a special meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC). Headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh, DAC is the ministry’s apex procurement body. The ministry said the special meeting was convened “considering the security environment due to the prevailing situation along the northern borders and the need to strengthen the armed forces for the defence of our borders”.India and China are in the middle of complicated negotiations on kicking off the next stage of disengagement between the Indian and Chinese armies in eastern Ladakh. Senior military commanders from the two sides held an hours-long meeting on Tuesday to discuss the road map for further reducing tensions that escalated when 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops on June 15.The government is fast-tracking key purchases to plug gaps in the military’s capabilities. DAC on July 2 approved the purchase of weapons and ammunition worth Rs 38,900 crore. The purchases cleared included 33 new fighter jets for the Indian Air Force, which is grappling with a shortage of warplanes. The proposals green-lighted by the council also included buying of 21 MiG-29s from Russia, 12 new Sukhoi-30 fighters from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, homegrown Astra BVR air-to-air missiles, locally-developed land-attack cruise missile systems with a range of 1,000 km, indigenous rocket systems, and the upgrade of 59 MiG-29 jets.The cost of military hardware cleared for purchase on July 2 from the domestic industry is pegged at Rs 31,130 crore and the orders are expected to give a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Movement).In the midst of the border tensions, the army is also laying the groundwork to buy an additional 72,000 Sig Sauer assault rifles from the US. This proposed purchase follows an order for 72,400 assault rifles placed with the US last year and is expected to be made by invoking a key clause in India’s arms buying rules that govern speeding up purchases to meet urgent requirements. India signed the previous order worth Rs 700 crore in early 2019 and the deliveries of all the rifles have been completed. That order was also made through the fast track procedure prescribed in India’s defence procurement rules.INDEPENDENT COMMENT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-gets-spl-powers-to-expedite-weapon-purchases-of-up-to-rs300-cr/story-ZNs0ylsNMvGIsTY58leODM.html
16-07-2020||India||Locusts arrive in Gujarat from Somalia via Pakistan||A relatively small swarm of crop-eating locusts has arrived in Gujarat’s Bhuj from Somalia via Pakistan, Union agriculture ministry’s Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) said on Wednesday and added authorities were trying to prevent to it from moving to Rajasthan and other surrounding areas by spraying insecticides.“They may have come with the winds across the Indian Ocean to the Pakistan coast and then from there to Bhuj. We will control the [locust] population in Bhuj. Other swarms may also travel across the ocean in the coming days. There are two possibilities—they can migrate from Somalia to Yemen and then migrate from Yemen to Pakistan and reach the border areas, the other is direct migration across the ocean,” said LWO deputy director KL Gurjar.India has faced its worst desert locust invasions in decades this year and prompted the government to deploy helicopters and drones for spraying insecticide. The Centre has amended rules to allow state governments to use drones at night to help neutralise the locusts. The infestation has not caused much damage to crops.The kharif, or summer-sown crops, are vulnerable but Gurjar said their efforts to control the locusts have been intensified following FAO’s warnings.UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on Monday warned the migration of locust swarms from Somalia to their summer breeding areas along both sides of the India-Pakistan border was imminent. More swarms were likely to form in Somalia in the coming weeks and India and Pakistan have been accordingly warned.The summer breeding has commenced along both sides of the border, where numerous swarms are present mainly in Rajasthan. Hatching and band formation will increase during July in Rajasthan and Gujarat as well as adjacent areas of Tharparkar, Nara and Cholistan deserts in Pakistan, FAO has said.Gurjar said the breeding has begun in otherwise arid Rajasthan as the state has received good rains. “We are trying to control the population through insecticides in the mating stage before they start egg-laying. [If] we do not manage to do that, then we try to control their population in the hopper stage before they start flying. Monsoon rains and maturity of locusts in India have coincided. The locusts are yellow in colour indicating their maturity and breeding potential,” said Gurjar.India Meteorological Department director-general M Mohapatra said the wind direction is south-westerly during the ongoing monsoon season and that is why locust migration can happen from that direction.Desert locusts usually fly with the wind and can travel up to about 100-150 km daily, according to FAO. They regularly cross the Red Sea, a distance of around 300 km. Crossing the Indian Ocean with the help of monsoon winds is part of the natural migration cycle of desert locusts. One square-km swarm can eat as much crop as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locusts-arrive-in-guj-from-somalia-via-pak/story-0nA4kZ2w5B3GvyuCVYrLGI.html
16-07-2020||India||Lavasa may leave poll watchdog for ADB job||New Delhi: Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa, who was expected to take over as chief election commissioner in 2021, may leave the commission prematurely to join the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as vice president. The 1980-batch Haryana cadre officer of the Indian Administrative Service has almost two years remaining in his tenure as Election Commissioner and was in line to take as chief election commissioner (CEC ) from Sunil Arora. His early exit will give the other election commissioner Sushil Chandra a shot at the top post.Lavasa, 62, served in several posts with the government, including as secretary in the finance ministry. As CEC, he would have overseen the conduct of elections in West Bengal, Manipur, Goa, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.The Manila-based Asian Development Bank on Wednesday announced that 62-year-old Lavasa had been appointed as vice-president of private sector operations and public-private partnerships. The central government recommends nominees to postings at the multilateral lender, officials familiar with the matter said, although these are usually at the level of the executive director. According to former CEC N Gopalaswamy, Lavasa would have accepted the position before the announcement was made. “The bank would have written to him to get his consent,” Gopalaswamy said. “The bank would have only made the announcement after that.”According to a former joint secretary with the Union government familiar with the workings of the ADB, Lavasa is likely to have applied for the post. “Two kinds of appointments are made to the ADB,” the former joint secretary (JS) said on condition of anonymity. “The country recommends a JS-level officer or higher to the board of directors or one can apply to DoPT (department of personnel and training) to do a stint as a subject specialist.”The former officer added that Lavasa’s appointment would have been made “entirely on merit” and keeping in mind “regional balance’”. “It is a three-year tenure, which is close to what Lavasa had left with the Commission,” this person added. “The appointment could not have been made without in-principle approval from the government,” a senior EC official said on the condition of anonymity. Lavasa was appointed as the Election Commissioner in 2018. ECs generally serve in the commission for six years or till they reach the age of 65 years.People close to Lavasa said that he was approached by a search agency and he agreed to be considered for the post. “Mr Lavasa has a long and distinguished career in the Indian civil service. He is currently one of the Election Commissioners of India and previously served in a range of senior posts including as Union Finance Secretary of India; Union Secretary for the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change; and Union Secretary for the Ministry of Civil Aviation,” ADB said in a statement. “He has extensive experience in public-private partnerships and infrastructure development at the state and federal levels, with deep knowledge on public policy and the role of private sector.”The people close to Lavasa said he is likely to accept the job. “It is a prestigious assignment and he was happy to be considered,’’one of them added on condition of anonymity. CEC Arora said he was not aware of the development.The last time an election commissioner quit the poll body was in 1973, when Nagendra Singh, the then chief election commissioner, resigned to join the International Court of Justice. Lavasa was one of the key dissenters when the poll body cleared prime minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for speeches that allegedly violated the model code conduct ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in April and May 2019. The model code regulates the behaviour of candidates, parties and governments during elections. In November last year , media reports said the goverment, in August, wrote to state-owned companies in the power sector asking them whether Lavasa “exercised undue influence” during his stint in the ministry. The letter pertained to 14 companies in which Lavasa’s wife Noel Lavasa, was a director. In September, media reports said Noel Lavasa and a few more of Lavasa’s relatives were being investigated by the income tax department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lavasa-may-leave-poll-watchdog-for-adb-job/story-qUXbahe8Y13F7OhKx4LJ3I.html
16-07-2020||India||One held for murder of BJP MLA, Mamata Banerjee writes to President Kovind||The investigation into the death of Debendranath Roy, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker from Hemtabad in Bengal’s North Dinajpur district, took a new turn on Wednesday afternoon when the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police charged Niloy Singh, an acquaintance of Roy, with murder. Singh was picked up from Malda district on Tuesday and interrogated for hours.The development came hours after chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind, saying the BJP was “distorting facts” about the death. Roy won the reserved Hemtabad seat on a Communist Party of India (Marxist) ticket in 2016 and joined the BJP in 2019. Banerjee’s letter said it was a case of suspected suicide and had links with monetary transactions.Interestingly, the police found the names, phone numbers and photographs of Singh and Mahmood Ali, another acquaintance of Roy, in an apparent suicide note in the dead legislator’s pocket. The body was found hanging outside a roadside shop in Hemtabad on Monday morning. His left hand was tied with a rope. The handwritten note, which was leaked to the media, along with the post mortem report, held Singh and Ali responsible for Roy’s death. The criminal investigation department (CID) is hunting for Ali. Echoing BJP’s state and central leaders, Roy’s wife claimed that he had been murdered. She also said that Roy wanted to get into the rice trade and had given money to Singh and Ali. Singh was charged under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (crime caused by multiple people with a common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, said Pintu Ghosh, assistant public prosecutor at Raigunj court in North Dinajpur. He said the chief judicial magistrate ordered 10-day police remand for Singh although the CID sought a two-week remand.The BJP leadership said the development exposes the sorry state of governance in West Bengal “By pressing charges under Sections 302 against Singh the government has admitted that Roy was murdered while the chief minister claimed that he committed suicide. More people are involved. Otherwise the CID would not have brought charges under Section 34,” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said.“This is a political murder and needs to be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The CID is influenced by the ruling party,” Sinha added.The 63-yer-old legislator’s body was found hanging on Monday morning about two kilometers away from his home. He left home around 1 am in the night with an unidentified person, his wife said. Demanding a CBI probe, BJP central leaders met Kovind on Tuesday. The party’s state leaders led agitations across Bengal for three days. Banerjee’s letter was handed to the President by Trinamool Congress (TMC) Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien. He also talked to the President for 25 minutes.“I told the President that probe by a local cooperative bank in Raigunj has revealed that Rs 4.97 crore was deposited in the bank but documents relating to Rs 2.60 crore is not available. Roy was the secretary of the bank,” O’Brien told reporters in Delhi. “I am constrained to invite your kind and personal attention to a particular fact. This is in context of your meeting with a delegation of BJP who might have apprised you with some distorted facts” said the letter’s opening lines.“On receipt of post mortem report and on primary investigation West Bengal police has reported that it is a cause of suspected suicide and could be related to some local money transfer activities. The note found in a pocket of the deceased also names two persons who are allegedly found to be related to such money transfer activities in the locality,” Banerjee wrote to Kovind.“Therefore, I am sorry to say that it does not appear to be a political case as being projected by BJP,” she wrote.“Our government has taken all necessary actions immediately for comprehensive investigation. I have already handed over the case to CID for proper investigation. I would like to assure that West Bengal is a state where we always respect all political parties, their leaders and workers,” said the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-held-for-murder-of-bjp-mla-mamata-writes-to-prez-kovind/story-ZXffwX02qeYkMEGhoReBqO.html
16-07-2020||India||24 hours of twists and turns in Rajasthan political drama||Close to 8pm on Tuesday, two sacked Rajasthan ministers, Ramesh Meena and Vishvendra Singh, denied having engaged in anti-party activities and claimed they only raised issues of concern to the people, the first indication of a softening of their stand by Congress rebels led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.“We never went against the party. We had some issues, which we raised at the party forum, but they were not addressed,” Meena, who was food and civil supplies minister in the Ashok Gehlot government, said in the video posted on the microblogging site Twitter.Almost at the same time, Singh, who held the tourism portfolio, released a video in which he wondered why the Congress leadership had taken such a harsh decision. “I just drew the attention of the party towards failure to implement promises made in the manifesto…We never indulged in any anti-party activity or made any statement against the party,” he said.The conciliatory mood was reconfirmed by Pilot, who on Wednesday morning, in separate interviews, said he was not joining the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and was still with the Congress. His statement was seen by experts as an attempt to return back to the party-fold considering that the number of MLAs joining the Pilot camp remained unchanged at 22 even three days after the crisis started. Soon after Pilot’s interviews, Congress general secretary in charge of Rajasthan, Avinash Pande, wrote on Twitter: “Party’s doors aren’t closed on Pilot. May God give him good sense and he realizes his mistake. I pray that he gets out of that BJP’s trap,” he wrote.These conciliatory words were, however, short-lived as Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot lashed out at Pilot on Wednesday in the first direct attack on his former deputy. “You are the deputy CM and PCC {Pradesh Congress Committee chief} and you make deals with (BJP) people. You ask for mobile number and names and are involved in a conspiracy and then they give clarification that there was no horse trading. You were part of the conspiracy and what are you clarifying now,” Gehlot said to reporters outside Hotel Fairmont in Jaipur.Also read: Baseless, says Congress on reports of Rahul Gandhi’s purported comment on Sachin PilotThe CM had until Wednesday accused the BJP of trying to destabilise his government by offering up to Rs 20 crore each to Congress legislators. He also said that there was no reason to get upset with the Rajasthan police notice to record a statement by Pilot as it was part of the investigation process. “I have also got the notice,” Gehlot said. Within an hour of Gehlot’s interaction with reporters, where close to 100 legislators supporting the Congress government have been staying, Congress’s national spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala addressed the media and asked Pilot and other MLAs to return to the party fold after admitting their “mistake”.“Sachin Pilot ji and other MLAs have to first come out of Manohar Lal Khattar’s (Haryana chief minister’s) protection and return to their home in Jaipur. Then only their concerns can be addressed,” Surjewala said in a reference to the rebels camping in a hotel in Gurugram . Also read: Congress gives Sachin Pilot a to-do list, asks him to prove his intentionsPolitical experts said the Congress was still keen on retaining a senior leader like Pilot in its fold despite what Gehlot said. “But these (statements) showed that they were willing to return home. The party’s statement on Wednesday morning and in Surjewala’s press conference also indicated that Congress was still trying to get them back to its fold,” said Avadhesh Akodia, a Jaipur-based political commentator. Prakash Bhandari, another Jaipur-based political analyst, said Wednesday’s remarks by Gehlot were the harshest he had made against Pilot. “Gehlot doesn’t have the reputation of talking through his hat. If he is saying he has evidence, he sure must be having evidence,” he said.Congress leaders said that it was highly unlikely that the party high command will accept Pilot’s demand for his return to Rajasthan politics. “There is a possibility that he may get a position in the central Congress team after some time. But his role now in Rajasthan politics would be very less,” a party leader said on condition of anonymity. There has been buzz that at least two Independent MLAs may return to Jaipur and join the Gehlot camp. This had not happened until Wednesday. A minister in the Gehlot cabinet told HT on condition of anonymity that at least six MLAs from the Pilot camp were in touch with the CM and may return soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-hours-of-twists-and-turns-in-rajasthan-political-drama/story-foW7gSnDQiijBGnbs49NRO.html
16-07-2020||India||India’s population could peak at 1.6 billion in 2048: Study||New Delhi India’s population will peak at 1.6 billion in 2048, after which it will steadily decline to 1.09 billion in 2100, according to an analysis that covered 195 countries in the Global Burden of Diseases 2017 study, findings that hold mixed economic as well as social implications for the country.According to the study, which was published in The Lancet journal, the world’s population will peak at 9.73 billion in 2064, after which it will shrink to 8.79 billion in 2100. The projections set the population peak at about 2 billion lower than the UN Population Division’s estimate of 10.9 billion at the end of the century.Both China and India, the world’s two most populous nations, will register population peaks before 2050, following which they will post sharp declines. In 2100, China’s population will be 51.1% of its peak population, and India’s will be down to 68.1% of its peak, said the analysis.The population of sub-Saharan Africa will triple from an estimated 1.03 billion in 2017 to 3.07 billion in 2100. North and the Middle East is the only other region forecast to host a larger population in 2100 than in 2017, with Asia and Eastern Europe recording the steepest declines. The populations of at least 23 countries, including Japan, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Portugal and South Korea, could decline at least 50%.“Our forecasts for a shrinking global population have positive implications for the environment, climate change, and food production, but possible negative implications for labour forces, economic growth, and social support systems in parts of the world with the greatest fertility declines,” said the study.Older populationThe global age structure will shift dramatically, with 2.37 billion people aged above 65 years in 2100, compared with 1.7 billion under 20 years, which underscores the need for liberal immigration policies in countries with significantly declining working age populations.“The decline in the numbers of working-age adults alone will reduce GDP {gross domestic product} growth rates that could result in major shifts in global economic power by the century’s end... While population decline is potentially good news for reducing carbon emissions and stress on food systems, with more old people and fewer young people, economic challenges will arise as societies struggle to grow with fewer workers and taxpayers, and countries’ abilities to generate the wealth needed to fund social support and health care for the elderly are reduced,” said first author Stein Emil Vollset,a professor at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in the US. In 2100, India will have the world’s largest working-age population of 578 million in the world, followed by Nigeria, China and the US. Although the number of working-age adults in India is projected to fall from 762 million in 2017, it is expected to be one of the few - if not the only - major power in Asia to protect its working-age population over the century to rise up the GDP rankings from the seventh to third, said the report. India is also forecasted to have the second largest net immigration in 2100, with an estimated half a million more people immigrating to the country in 2100 than emigrating.“To fully reap the benefits of this large working age population, called in demographic terms, the demographic dividend, it is critical to invest in quality health and adaptive education that empowers and equips young people to meet the needs of the job market,” said Argentina Matavel Piccin, UNFPA Representative to India.“The diverse fertility situations in the states combined with the inter-regional population dynamics in India present unique opportunities, which can be turned into a powerful engine for the overall socio-economic development, if a differential planning approach is adopted. Very few countries in the world boast of such a scenario of a significant staggered demographic transition. India can afford to fill shortage of labour in one part of the country with migrants from another part, hence reducing the usual cultural adaption periods that most cross-country and cross-continent migrants must go through before they can fully contribute to host countries,” added Piccin.Small familiesThe global total fertility rate (TFR is the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime) is predicted to decline from 2.37 in 2017 to 1.66 in 2100, which is well below the replacement rate of 2.1 births per woman.India’s TFR declined to below 2.1 in 2019, and is projected to have a continued steep fertility decline until about 2040, reaching a TFR of 1.29 in 2100, said the report.“The sustained decline in population size is an obvious outcome of educating and empowering women along with meeting their contraceptive needs and choices. Family planning services are likely to have an economic impact for families that extends beyond the reductions in fertility and improvements in health to many other aspects of their lives. If women’s needs for family planning and reproductive healthcare are met, along with other basic health and education needs, then population stabilization will be achieved naturally, not as a matter of control or coercion,” said Poonam Muttreja, executive director, Population Foundation of India, New Delhi.Liberal immigration policies could help maintain population size and economic growth even as fertility falls, said the study, which notes that some countries, such as the US, Australia, and Canada, are likely to maintain their working-age populations through net immigration.“We need a fundamental rethink of global politics. Greater multilateralism and a new global leadership should enable both migrant sending and migrant-receiving countries to benefit, while protecting the rights of individuals. Nations would need to cooperate at levels that have eluded us to date to strategically support and fund the development of excess skilled human capital in countries that are a source of migrants.... The projected changes in the sizes of national economies and the consequent change in military power might force these discussions,” said Professor Ibrahim Abubakar, University College London, UK, and Chair of Lancet Migration (who was not involved in the study), in a linked comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-population-to-peak-in-2048/story-GYGj9N4ZiVNlRDI8NKoJAI.html
16-07-2020||India||Gehlot’s statement confirms Gandhis’ ownership over Congress: Shekhawat||Rebel Congress leader and former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s declaration that he wouldn’t be joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was met with silence from the BJP on Wednesday. Pilot’s comments came a day after several BJP leaders said he was welcome to join the party.BJP leaders avoided commenting on Pilot’s statement and limited their response to blaming the Congress and the Gandhi family, in particular, for not being able to keep their flock together. The party also attacked Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot for trying to blame the BJP for an internal Congress rift.Also read: 24 hours of twists and turns in Rajasthan political drama“The very statement of Gehlot ji confirms the ownership of Gandhi family over Congressmen,” Union minister and MP from Rajasthan Gajendra Singh Shekhawat tweeted. Shekhawat, among the BJP politicians who had said any leader with the people’s mandate was welcome to join the party, commented: “They blame every bit of their dispute on the neighbor, and when dealing with the neighbor, they curse the family members!”In response to Gehlot’s jibe at Pilot that “…speaking good English, giving good quotes and being handsome isn’t everything”, Shekhawat took a dig at the Gandhis, “Speaking good English does nothing, committing to family matters!” Shekhawat also clarified that his comment about welcoming Pilot into the party had been misconstrued. “What I had said was anyone who aligns with our party’s ideology and has the mandate of the people is welcome. It did not mean that we have laid out a carpet for anyone,” he said.The party also chose to remain silent on the issue of pushing the Gehlot government to prove its majority in the house. “We will let the issue play out before taking recourse to other democratic and legal options available to us. Right now what we are seeing is internal rift for which the BJP is being blamed,” said a senior leader in Delhi.In response to Gehlot’s comment that the Congress had proof of the BJP tying to topple the government, Shekhawat said the CM should furnish the proof and reveal who all were part of the conspiracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-s-statement-confirms-gandhis-ownership-over-cong-shekhawat/story-pps72cacQRrK36dRwXWo7N.html
16-07-2020||India||Rajasthan political crisis: Congress evolves 6-pronged plan to counter Sachin Pilot||As the face-off between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy, Sachin Pilot, intensified, the Congress dialled its prominent legal brains to guide the former’s team at every step even as the experts hold the latter in high regard, people involved in the matter.The legal experts evolved a six-pronged strategy to counter Pilot and his loyalists, which culminated in state assembly speaker CP Joshi’s move of sending a show-cause notice to them on Wednesday morning. The decision to hold two Congress legislative party meetings, keeping the doors open for Pilot even as he was incommunicado, stripping him of his portfolios but keeping him in the party, and preparing drafts of letters were all done in consultations with top party leader and lawyer Abhishek Singhvi.Gehlot , Randeep Singh Surjewala, Ajay Maken, and Avinash Pandey held frequent consultations with Singhvi, who was assisted by other lawyers. They relied on the Rajasthan’s state anti-defection law and the Constitution’s 10th schedule to make the disqualification case against Pilot and lawmakers loyal to him. “As the shadow of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] loomed large, we realised that we have to try our best to protect the Congress government. We decided to ask for disqualification of Pilot and his loyalists from the assembly as it would reduce the numbers in the House and brighten the prospect of the Congress’ majority,” said a leader involved in the meetings who asked not to be named.Also read: 24 hours of twists and turns in Rajasthan political dramaThe Congress decided against expelling Pilot from the party as it would benefit him. Under the legislative laws, if lawmakers are sacked from a party, they remain members of legislative bodies as independents. For Gehlot, it was a chance to kill three birds with one stone. He could minimise the prospects of the BJP toppling his government, oust his arch-rival, and consolidate his position within the party, said a second Congress leader who spoke on condition of anonymity.  On Tuesday, Pilot called Singhvi and requested him to fight his legal battle, oblivious of the fact that he was actually helping the other side. “Singhvi revealed this and told Pilot that the honourable thing for him would be not to take [up] his case,” said a Singhvi aide who asked not to be named. The Congress on Tuesday dismissed Pilot as Rajasthan’s deputy chief minister and the party’s state unit chief over his rebellion against Gehlot. It also removed two of his loyalists from the cabinet while accusing his camp of “conspiring” with the BJP to destabilise the government.PDT Achary, former secretary general of lok sabha said that the Congress wants to use the clause (a) of para 2 of the 10th schedule that says “if the member has voluntarily given up the membership of such political party.” “There is a vague area and that Congress might try to show that as Pilot didn’t come for two CLP meetings that were called to save thr government, he has shown his intent. But these interpretations can be challenged in court “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-evolves-6-pronged-plan-to-counter-pilot/story-w7rAWM8BnTMxp1NmL8M8UO.html
16-07-2020||India||House panel urges govt to cap coronavirus medicine prices||The parliamentary standing committee on home affairs, chaired by Congress leader Anand Sharma, has asked the Union government to regulate the prices of coronavirus medicines being made by various pharma companies, citing reports of black marketing of drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, people familiar with the matter said.The panel also told the government that hospitals and pharma companies are charging exorbitant amounts from the patients and that this “lobby” needs to be stopped, the people added.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, joint secretary in health ministry Lav Agarwal, and other senior officials the briefed the committee, which pointed out that locally made affordable drugs should be made available to the public. The home secretary informed the committee that letters have been sent to states asking them to take measures to stop the sale at higher than prescribed prices of life-saving drugs. The panel also stressed that there was a need to promote locally made drugs for the benefit of public. Sharma, the chairman of the committee, said in the meeting that the pandemic gives us a unique opportunity to come out with a report that can be a guiding force for any such health crisis in the future. Members of Parliament (MPs) from different parties also spoke about the issue of migrant workers and said that it must be ensured these labourers do not face such hardships in future, and suggested that they be covered under special welfare schemes to protect them in the event of job losses.The committee heard the government’s report on the management of the Covid-19 pandemic and the phased unlocking and resumption of economic activities.Bhalla told the committee that government has managed the Covid-19 crisis “successfully”. In a detailed presentation on steps taken by the government since early this year, he pointed out that India has one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.Luv Agarwal informed the committee that there are many estimates and researches on when Covid-19 will peak in India, but it is not right to make any estimate on the possible peak period as it might lead to either complacency or fear among the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-urges-govt-to-cap-medicine-prices/story-NHu5KSJemfKvxkjXy49WsL.html
16-07-2020||India||One BTP MLA says he will back Cong, his party non-committal||The Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) is likely to support the Congress government in case of a floor test in the Rajasthan assembly following Sachin Pilot’s rebellion against chief minister Ashok Gehlot, two functionaries said on Wednesday.Ramprasad Dindor, one of the two BTP lawmakers in the state, said they would support the Congress even as the party has asked them to stay neutral.Velaram Goghra, BTP’s Rajasthan chief, said the party has been giving issue-based support to the Congress and if the government meets their demands, they will consider supporting it in case a floor test. He added BTP voted for the Congress in the Rajya Sabha elections last month after the government promised to meet its demands.Two BTP members were among 101 lawmakers, who attended the Congress legislative party meeting at a Jaipur hotel on Tuesday. They later left the hotel saying they would take a call on supporting a political party at an “appropriate” time. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has 72 lawmakers in the 200-member Rajasthan assembly. Pilot’s camp has claimed to have the support of 22 legislators, including three independents.Goghra said their demands include the implementation of the Maharashtra model for the development of tribal areas in Rajasthan. Under the model, funds for tribal development are given to a tribal commissioner instead of various departments. “If Gehlot announces it as promised, then we can discuss with our high command and within the community and offer our support,” said Goghra. “Our accountability is to our people and whatever is in their interest, we will do. We need to have an understanding with the government to get benefits of schemes for our people.”Rajkumar Roat, the second BTP lawmaker, whose videos surfaced on Tuesday in which he claimed police were harassing him, said the party will take the final decision on supporting the Congress in a floor test.On Wednesday, Roat said he was not harassed. “...I had put out the videos, the incident was true but it was a case of mistaken identity by police. They did not recognise me,” he said.Roat on Tuesday said police snatched keys to his car and that he was under detention and several people were asking him to go with them.Pilot’s social media team circulated Roat’s video to highlight how the government was harassing lawmakers. The BJP, too, cited the videos to claim the government was intimidating the lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-btp-mla-says-he-will-back-cong-his-party-non-committal/story-1xNHQCMdmAKOllh5MTE34J.html
16-07-2020||India||Disqualification of Sachin Pilot, 18 others sought by Congress||The Congress’ chief whip in the Rajasthan assembly Mahesh Joshi wrote to speaker CP Joshi seeking the disqualification of former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 members of the legislative assembly under the provisions of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution (popularly known as the anti-defection law). But it emerges that the party may have taken an expansive view of the anti-defection law. While Joshi confirmed to news agency PTI that disqualification proceedings have begun with notices being issued to the 19 legislators, efforts continued to convince Pilot, who reiterated on Wednesday that he doesn’t plan to join the Bharatiya Janata Party, to return to the fold -- although HT learns that chief minister Ashok Gehlot is keen to disqualify Pilot. Congress leaders involved in the strategy said on condition of anonymity that Pilot’s conduct, statements by his close aides and his absence from two meetings of the Congress legislature party in Rajasthan together make a strong case for his disqualification.Some constitutional experts say Pilot may take the legal route to respond to the disqualification notice and even seek the removal of CP Joshi as the speaker on the ground of partial conduct to gain more time. The disqualification of the 19 will reduce the effective strength of the House to 181, with a majority mark of 91, well below the 104 legislators Gehlot whose support Gehlot confirmed to the state’s governor on Tuesday. The 10th Schedule says that a lawmaker can be disqualified from the House “if he has voluntarily given up his membership of such political party” or “if he votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction issued by the political party to which he belongs or by any person or authority authorised by it in this behalf without obtaining prior permission of such political party.”Two of the Congress leaders cited above argued that the law can be extended to behaviour outside the House. “An elected lawmaker’s conduct, his speeches, his hobnobbing with rivals too can be counted as grounds for disqualification,” said one of them. “He skipped two meetings of Congress legislature party, his loyalists gave three interviews demanding trust vote are proof of his intention. There are several examples how Supreme Court considered such issues in the Ravi Naik and the BS Yediyurappa cases,” said the second leader. The BS Yediyurappa case related to the defection of Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs in Karnataka in July 2019 that resulted in the ouster of a coalition government headed by the two parties last year, paving the way for the BJP’s Yediyurappa to become CM. The court, while adjudicating on a petition challenging the disqualification of the 17 MLAs by the speaker on the grounds that they had “voluntarily given up their membership of the party, through their undisputed conduct”, partly upheld the presiding officer’s decision. The Ravi Naik case refers to former Goa CM Ravi Naik, and dates to 1994. In its judgement the Supreme Court said that lawmakers need not necessarily resign from their parties to attract disqualification under the 10th schedule, referring to the “conduct of a member” that indicates that “he has voluntarily given up his membership of the political party to which he belongs.”The emphasis here seems to be on conduct of the member but P Sreedharan, former secretary general of the Lok Sabha, does not believe this will work in this case. “Disqualification on grounds of defection is mentioned clearly in para two of the 10th schedule: If he has voluntarily given up his membership or if he votes against the party or abstains from voting. The issues of not following the direction of the party is connected to the House only. So any whip issued for non-House activities can’t be a sufficient grounds (for disqualification).” For Rajasthan assembly speaker Joshi, too, these are testing times. In the recent past, Joshi has advocated that the speaker’s powers vis-à-vis the 10th schedule be curtailed and the decision to expel a member be left to political parties.In two conferences of presiding officers, he spearheaded the campaign to delink speakers from anti-defection issues because he said that speakers come under unnecessary political pressure and the courts have often tarnished the image of speakers in their rulingson defection issues. Now, Joshi himself has a high-profile defection issue—the first in 2020—on his table to decide on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disqualification-of-pilot-18-others-sought-by-cong/story-0tdHN1cCGvrTyCPZPivPfJ.html
16-07-2020||India||CBSE class 10 pass percentage rises marginally, fewer high scorers||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Wednesday released Class 10 examination results with an overall pass percentage of 91.46%, recording a marginal improvement over last year’s figure, even as the board did not announce a merit list in view of the circumstances triggered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Out of the 1,873,015 students who appeared for the Class 10 examination this year, 1,713,121 students cleared the test across 20,837 schools in the country, with the overall pass percentage 0.36 percentage points higher than last year. Of these, 150,198 students received “compartment” this year compared to 138,705 last year.As many as 184,358 and 41,804 students scored above 90% and 95% marks, respectively, 18% and 26.98% lower than last year’s figures.In Delhi, the overall pass percentage increased five percentage points from 80.97% last year to 85.86% this year. The pass percentage in private schools (90.19%) this year decreased by nearly three percentage points over last year, while that in government schools (82.61%) increased by 11 percentage points.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, said: “Our children have made us proud again! After record breaking results of Class 12, upwards graph of Delhi Education continues in Class 10. Overjoyed that this year, results have improved to 82.61% from 71.58% last year.”CBSE’s controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said the increase in the number of “compartments” could be due to the increase in the number of students who took the test this year. “There seems to be no specific reason behind the dip [in the number of high-scorers]. One possible reason could be the stress due to the Covid-19 pandemic since the students were still preparing for their papers and taking exams at the beginning of March.”In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, CBSE postponed all Class 10 and Class 12 exams scheduled between March 19 and March 31 earlier this year. The move, however, had little effect on Class 10 exams that were scheduled to end on March 20. Only two exams were scheduled to take place on that day – Information and Communication Technology, and Computer Application.“CBSE has decided to replace the term ‘Fail’ by the term ‘Essential Repeat’. Hence, in the result declared, no ‘Fail’ term will be mentioned in the documents issued to the candidates and the result hosted on the website,” CBSE said. Board officials said this was done to ensure students did not feel discouraged about their performance amid the Covid-19 pandemic.In north-east Delhi, however, CBSE had to cancel exams on four days because of communal riots in February. Though the board announced in April that it would conduct six exams in north-east Delhi in July, they could not be held due to the Covid-19 outbreak.“After reassessing the situation and worldwide spread of Covid19, it was decided that board will no longer be able to conduct examinations including those to be conducted in North-Eastern Delhi,” CBSE said in a statement on Wednesday.For subjects for which exams could not be conducted, the board announced the results on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme. For students who appeared in the exams in more than three subjects, the average of the marks obtained in the best three subjects have been be awarded in the subjects whose examinations have not been conducted.For students who have appeared in the exams in only three subjects, the average of the marks obtained in the best two performing subjects have been awarded in the subjects whose examinations have not been conducted.Gauri Shrivastava, 16, a student of a government senior secondary school in riot-hit Yamuna Vihar has scored 97.6% marks under the revised assessment scheme. While she appeared for her science, social science, mathematics and Sanskrit exams, the situation in north-east Delhi prevented her from appearing for her English and Hindi exams.Her father Vinay Shrivastava, who runs a business in Okhla, said his daughter would have scored more if she appeared for the remaining tests. “The riots broke out barely 500 metres from our place and though the atmosphere was tense outside, the thought of appearing for their papers kept my children distracted,” he said.Richa Sharma, principal of Sanskriti School, whose average score stands at 88.43%, said: “The results have been as per our expectation because most of the Class 10 papers had already taken place before the exams were cancelled.

16-07-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot accuses Sachin Pilot, BJP of conspiracy to topple govt||Hours after Sachin Pilot appeared to strike a conciliatory note on Wednesday by saying he would not join the Bharatiya Janata Party, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot accused his former deputy, without naming him, of being involved in a conspiracy to topple the state government. Pilot, who was on Tuesday removed as the Rajasthan deputy chief minister and Congress’s state unit chief for rebelling against Gehlot, denied he was going to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Pilot also rejected allegations that he was planning to bring down the government with the BJP’s help and added those saying so were trying to lower him in “the eyes of the Gandhis”. Also read: 24 hours of twists and turns in Rajasthan political dramaGehlot wasn’t impressed. “Money was offered. And who gave a clarification that nothing was happening? Those leaders, who themselves were involved and part of the conspiracy, are giving clarifications,” Gehlot said, without naming his deputy with whom he has an extremely strained relationship. “With us, you are deputy CM [chief minister] and PCC [Pradesh Congress Committee chief] and you make deals with people [BJP]. You ask for mobile number and names and are involved in the conspiracy... and then give the clarification that there was no horsetrading. You were part of the conspiracy and what are you clarifying now?”Gehlot insisted his team has proof that Congress lawmakers were being lured into a rebellion against the government. He said the attempts to topple his government have been going on for some time. He added the current crisis would have unfolded earlier had the party not been on guard.Also read: Congress evolves 6-pronged plan to counter Sachin Pilot“Horsetrading was being done in Jaipur; we have the proof. We had to keep people [lawmakers] at a hotel for 10 days...if we had not done that, the same thing that is happening in Manesar now would have happened back then,” Gehlot said, referring to Pilot and 18 legislators, who are staying at a hotel in Haryana’s Manesar. Gehlot said he has been in politics for 40 years and that he loves the new generation. “The future will be theirs. This new generation... they have become central ministers, state presidents. If they had gone through what we did in our time, they would have worked better,” said Gehlot amid criticism that the Congress’s old guard was not letting younger leaders grow. “Speaking good English or giving bytes is not everything. What do you have in your heart, what commitment do you have, this all is seen.” Gehlot said Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former president Rahul Gandhi and he himself all love young people.Pilot did not respond to the text messages or phone calls for comments on Gehlot’s charges.The Congress separately dissolved all district and block party committees in Rajasthan.BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said Congress is leveling charges on BJP but they should look at their history, whenever they had been out of power from the centre, the party has disintegrated – from Devraj Urs to Sachin Pilot, the history is repeating. But every time they level charges on BJP and take a sideway out, instead of holding a introspection.He said the CM repeatedly is speaking of evidence of horse trading since Rajya Sabha polls but haven’t brought in the public. “Who is he trying to threaten? If he has evidence than present it,” he said.Political analyst Narayan Bareth said Gehlot is party’s strategist and manager in crisis. He is known for cool headed working and loyalist of Congress. He becoming aggressive shows to what extent he was compelled to give such statements. “Gehlot is an organizational man and emotional toward the party, the statements made against the party might have hurt him to speak in such aggressive manner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-accuses-pilot-bjp-of-conspiracy-to-topple-govt/story-z0DbxAHNBNeMo5xSXCTTYJ.html
16-07-2020||India||Skill, re-skill, upskill to stay relevant: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said no matter how educated a person is, one must always be ready to acquire new skills. He said skill, reskilling and upskilling is the only way to remain relevant in the ever-changing market scenario. Speaking on the occasion of the World Youth Skill Day, Modi said, “The biggest strength of the millennials is their ability to get skilled.”Modi said the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has changed the work culture and started the concept of work from home. He added young people are acquiring new skills keeping in mind the new work culture and new nature of jobs. “People ask me business and markets are changing too fast; it is hard to remain relevant. In times of corona [Covid-19], this is even more relevant. My answer to that is to skill, reskill and upskill. To keep learning new skills is to reskill and continuing to scale it up is to upskill,” he said.Modi, who has stressed on self-reliance and the need for becoming employment generators, added: “Skill is something which you give yourself and which is timeless and keeps getting better with time. It is unique and makes you different from others.” He added it is self-reliance and also self employability.Modi underlined there is a difference between skill and knowledge and said people often confuse the two. “People get confused between knowledge and skill. You can watch on YouTube or read in books how to ride a bike; this is knowledge, but to ride a bike you need skill,” he said.Referring to the work opportunities for skilled people, he said there is a requirement for tens of thousands of skilled people, especially in the health sector. “...That is why we have started skill mapping. Information about which country needs skilled works in which sector will be available.”Modi referred to the portal for skill mapping of migrant labour that has been recently started. He added employers can connect with the labour at the click of a button. Modi said in today’s rapidly changing world, millions of skilled people are needed in many sectors. He also spoke about the skill centres opened by the government and how the number of Industrial Training Institutes was increased. “...skill development of more than 5 crore [50 million] people has been done. And this campaign continues,” he said.Modi reiterated that since there is a raging worldwide pandemic, people should remember to stay healthy, maintain social distancing and wear masks, and stop spitting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skill-re-skill-upskill-to-stay-relevant-pm-modi/story-g5Eldv97AVJd7iEVkKyfMP.html
16-07-2020||India||30% drop in use of firearms in serious crimes in Delhi: Police data||Ten days ago, the 28-year-old son of a retired Delhi police officer was shot to death by four assailants in a car, who fired more than a dozen shots at the sedan he was driving in outer Delhi’s Rama Vihar. A month ago, a 35-year-old cash collection agent was shot in the arm and robbed of Rs2.5 lakh by bike-riding gunmen in north Delhi’s Wazirabad.Until June 30, the city had recorded 292 serious crimes such as dacoity, murder, attempt to murder and robbery in which the criminals used firearms, which have been their preferred choice in Delhi, but the trend has declined in the first half of 2020 compared to the previous two years. During the same period (January 1 to June 30) in 2019 and 2018, there were 415 and 405 cases of dacoity, robbery, murder and attempt to murder, respectively, in which firearms were used, according to data shared by Delhi police.Police statistics show that the use of firearms in murder, attempt to murder, dacoity, and robbery cases reported between January 1 and June 30 this year posted a 30% decrease compared to the corresponding period of the last two years. Data show that firearms were used in 125 robbery and two dacoity cases while in 48 murder cases, guns were used in the last six months. Similarly, in 117 attempt to murder cases, pistols and revolvers were used.In 2019 till June 30, there were 225 robbery and five dacoity cases in which firearms were used. A total of 54 murders and 131 attempts to murder were committed using guns. During the same period in 2018, in 44 murders and 134 attempts to murder, pistols or revolvers were used while 222 robberies and five dacoities were committed using firearms. Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava said that efforts by the police personnel to catch criminals, especially those involved in the sale and supply of firearms, was a prime reason behind the decline in the use of firearms in Delhi.“Countering the trend of use of firearms has remained a top priority for me ever since I took charge of the head of the police force in February this year. I have a zero-tolerance policy against this gun culture and time and again it has been conveyed to my colleagues and other personnel during various meetings. We will continue our pursuit against gunrunners and criminals using firearms,” said Shrivastava. According to police records, a total of 1,051 cases of dacoity, murder, attempt to murder and robbery were reported in Delhi till June 30 this year. Of them, 292 cases involved the use of firearms, which means in nearly 28% of the incidents, pistols and revolvers were used. The firearms were mostly guns manufactured in illegal factories in Bihar’s Munger, Madhya Pradesh’s Burhanpur and Khargone and Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut and Aligarh, senior Delhi police officers said.In the remaining cases, criminals used knives and blunt objects such as iron rods, sticks, bricks and stones. The data related to use of these objects as weapons in crimes is not available but is being compiled, said a senior police officer related to the research cell, which collates data related to crimes in the city.Factors responsible for change in the trendThe Sars-CoV-2 virus outbreak followed by the lockdown has also contributed to the decline in the use of firearms and has affected the illegal business of smuggling and supply of such weapons into Delhi from other states, a senior police officer said.“Suspension of interstate bus services and limited services of passengers trains to and from Delhi due to the Covid-19 outbreak has hit the gunrunners’ business. They mostly preferred interstate buses and private vehicles for transporting illegal guns. But buses are still not operational and checking of private vehicles was intensified during and after the lockdown. The gunrunners have now begun using trucks carrying goods for smuggling of illegal firearms,” a special cell officer instrumental in busting many inter-state gunrunning rackets said, requesting anonymity.Police data shows that 1,172 firearms had been seized this year till June 30, which is 360 fewer than the number recovered during the same period last year. It is 149 more than the recovery of firearms made in 2018.“Their {police} conclusion that use of firearms decreased because the smuggling of such weapons was affected due to the lockdown is fallacious. In reality, Sars-CoV-2 virus outbreak resulted in a decrease in crimes not only in Delhi but other states as well,” said former Uttar Pradesh director general of police Vikram Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/30-drop-in-use-of-firearms-in-serious-crimes-in-delhi-police-data/story-plQoHaOfeYUkwbzhrAVUIP.html
16-07-2020||India||Delhi high court gives police time to go through Sunanda Pushkar’s tweets||The Delhi high court on Wednesday gave the police time to go through the Twitter posts of the late Sunanda Pushkar after the city police’s counsel said the department had not seen the tweets nor was it relying on them in the case related to her death.Pushkar, 51, was found dead in a hotel room on January 17, 2014 following which the police charged her husband and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor with abetment to suicide, among other charges. Justice Manoj Ohri was told by the Delhi police counsel that her tweets were not a part of the record or the charge sheet filed in the case and if Tharoor wanted to rely on them, they were in the public domain and he can access them.The court was hearing a plea by Tharoor seeking directions to the Delhi police to preserve the Twitter account and posts on the microblogging site by Pushkar prior to her death.Appearing for Tharoor, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa submitted that the tweets were part of the electronic record before the trial court in the form of Pushkar’s laptop and mobile phone. He said all the police have to do is put it up as evidence before the court as an indicator of her state of mind prior to her death. Pahwa also said that Pushkar’s cause of death was “inconclusive” and this was relevant because four autopsy reports and three medical board reports had not been able to confirm till date whether it was a case of suicide or homicide. Pahwa has said that report was not conclusive on the reason for the death, the police had gone for psychological autopsy in 2017 , a process which involves acertaining the state of mind prior to the death. He contended that if the police relied on the tweets, the case would be closed. “Instead, they relied on the witness statements, recorded by the police, who has referred to Pushkar’s tweets while commenting on her state of mind,” he said.After hearing both sides, the high court gave time to the police to file its submissions along with case law on the issue raised by Tharoor in his plea and listed the matter for hearing on September 18.Tharoor, in his application, said the tweets and Twitter timeline of Pushkar were of utmost importance in the case and as she was not alive, there was an apprehension that they may be deleted, denying him a crucial right to exonerate himself from the charges levelled against him.The plea referred to Twitter’s policies as per which it can delete the accounts of users who have been inactive for a prolonged period of time.The police had earlier told the court that Pushkar was suffering from mental agony because of a strained relationship with her husband. It had then charged Tharoor with domestic violence (498A) and abetment to suicide while claiming that Pushkar had a scuffle with her husband and bore various injury marks a few days before her death.Tharoor has consistently denied all charges, calling them preposterous and motivated. When asked for his reaction on Wednesday’s hearing, the Congress MP said, “My counsel has already argued for me in the court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-gives-police-time-to-go-through-sunanda-s-tweets/story-prNLWwmKF4ZNP0u8lvWaMJ.html
16-07-2020||India||Congress gives Sachin Pilot a to-do list, asks him to prove his intentions||Having secured the Ashok Gehlot-led government, the Congress on Wednesday maintained its hard stance on Sachin Pilot and told him to reject the hospitality of the Haryana government and come back to Jaipur to prove his claim that he did not want to go with the Bharatiya Janata Party.Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala’s call for evidence came in a video message put out by the party that started with declaring that the BJP conspiracy to topple the Gehlot government had failed.Surjewala then listed what Sachin Pilot, who he pointedly and repeatedly referred to as a youth leader - should do to prove his intentions.Also read | ‘Come back to your home in Jaipur’: Congress to Sachin Pilot after his ‘not joining BJP’ remarkReject the hospitality of the BJP-led Haryana government and come back to your home in Jaipur, Surjewala said, asking Pilot to get Congress legislators sequestered in two Gurugram hotels where, he said, they were being guarded by Haryana’s security forces. The remarks indicate hardening of the stand of the central leadership after Ashok Gehlot claimed that he has proof of his involvement in toppling the governmentCome back and you can talk to the leadership about all the issues that you have directly, not through the media, he said.But Surjewala made it clear that the party didn’t think that Pilot’s effort to reduce the Gehlot government to a minority was a stand-alone effort. He underlined the various efforts that had been made over the last five days to retain Pilot.In the last five days, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and the Congress leadership in a large-hearted gesture kept all doors open for Sachin Pilot. The top leadership - a reference to the Gandhi family - and two Congress Working Committee members told him that if he still supported the Congress, he should at least tell the media waiting outside his hotel that you stand with the Congress. This message was conveyed by the Congress leadership half-a-dozen times and by two Congress Working Committee members, a dozen more.But Sachin Pilot did not make this statement.It was only after all these efforts to placate Sachin Pilot didn’t convince Pilot and the lawmakers supporting him that the Congress, “with a heavy heart”, had to act.Pilot was yesterday sacked as Rajasthan’s deputy chief minister and state party chief. The Congress also started the process to disqualify Pilot and 18 lawmakers who had skipped the two Congress legislature party meetings from the state assembly. Pilot and his supporters have been given time till Friday to respond to the notice.Surjewala’s message to Pilot came hours after Ashok Gehlot lashed out at his younger, “ambitious” colleagues, a clear reference to Sachin Pilot, who he accused of colluding with the BJP. Gehlot said he had proof that some people from the about the involvement of his party colleagues.“We have proof that horse trading was being committed. Money was offered. And who gave clarification that nothing was happening? Those leaders, who themselves were involved and part of the conspiracy, were giving clarifications,” Gehlot said, claiming that he has evidence of horse trading taking place.“With us, you are Deputy CM and PCC and you make deals with (BJP) people. You ask for mobile number and names and are involved in conspiracy and then they give clarification that there was no horse trading. You were part of the conspiracy and what are you clarifying now,” he said, clearly determined that the party does not come under pressure to go easy on Sachin Pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-gives-sachin-pilot-a-to-do-list-asks-him-to-prove-his-intentions/story-4npN2M1LqUqUyhrecnr6kO.html
16-07-2020||India||3 green youth movements allege digital censorship||The websites of three environmental, youth and student movements have been blocked since June 29, the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) said on Monday.These include fridaysforfuture.in, the India arm of a global climate movement started by Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg in 2018 and known widely for its school strikes against global warming; letindiabreathe.in and thereisnoearthb.com--Indian movements focused on various environmental issues including air pollution.Two of them - Fridays For Future and Let India Breathe - have approached the Internet Freedom Foundation for legal help after they received messages from National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) which manages the operations of in. registry for the government.LetIndiaBreathe was informed by their domain registrar that their domain was placed on hold by NIXI, which neither gave reasons for its action nor provided an opportunity for a hearing, according to Apar Gupta of IFF.“We are seeing a spike in cases of internet censorship during the Covid-19 pandemic when the internet is one of the few mediums to engage and interact. Such blocking of websites is a violation of fundamental right to speech and expression and directive principle of the state policy on protection of environment,” said Gupta. Fridays For Future on Monday posted a statement on its social media accounts which read: “We are a group of students and youth working advocacy on the climate crisis and ecological breakdown…we felt it was our duty to engage with the public when the draft consultation for environment impact assessment (EIA) was open and feedback was invited by the government. We launched a feedback process in fridaysforfuture.in but since July 10 2020, the website has been inaccessible.”Incidentally, all three youth movements were running campaigns on the environment ministry’s draft EIA 2020 notification. The draft has been in the eye of a storm because it is expected to overhaul the process of environmental regulation of infrastructure projects and has contentious clauses on regularising projects that violate environmental norms and shortening the time period for public hearings.IFF has sent a legal notice to NIXI on the issue.“That we submit that such actions are violative of the existing Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and .IN registry guidelines as well as the fundamental rights of the collective who operate and the public participants who exercise their fundamental rights. It is specifically asserted that no specific notice, hearing or opportunity for defence has been provided till date. There is no information about any legal order… such actions smack of arbitrariness, secrecy and are prima facie illegal especially given that contact details and email addresses for the website are prominently displayed on the homepage,” the notice reads.Yash Marwah, founder of Let India Breathe said, “We haven’t been told why our website is on hold. But since March some 2 lakh visitors have seen our website. We were running a campaign against the draft EIA 2020. We were demanding that it be replaced by a progressive law.”Meanwhile, an official of NIXI said that they take action against a website only if asked by a law enforcement agency to do so.“We don’t take any action on our part unless a law enforcement agency asks us to do so. I haven’t looked at the details of these cases but it should be because some law enforcement agency has directed us,” Shubham Saran, General Manager, NIXI said.Responding to the news of blocking of websites of the three groups, RP Gupta, secretary, environment ministry, said, “ “We are not aware of these developments.”In an interview to HT last month, Gupta had said the ministry had received 30,000 comments on the draft EIA 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-green-youth-movements-allege-digital-censorship/story-TSipMNu23ASOcBhATX2jIK.html
16-07-2020||Editorials||Mukesh Ambani’s gamble pays off | HT Editorial||Google. Facebook. Intel. Qualcomm. A bunch of storied private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds. These are some of the companies that have, in the span of a year, together invested around Rs 150,000 crore in Jio Platforms for a one-third ownership of the company promoted by India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani. The investments have come in neatly in the period between Reliance’s 2019 and 2020 annual general meetings (AGMs). Why is everyone investing in Jio Platforms?That’s an easy question. Combining hi-tech with low cost, and aided by a conducive regulatory regime, Mr Ambani has built India’s largest telecom company (it has a one-third share of the market), ahead of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel. It has one of the most modern high speed wireless networks in the country, and while building this, it launched services at a price its competitors called “predatory”. This cost the company a lot of money (and forced it to take on debt), but the investments that have flowed in over the past year show that Mr Ambani’s strategy has paid off. Having built the pipe (as analysts called it), and acquired customers (for long, Reliance was criticised for faltering in consumer businesses), Mr Ambani has embarked on doing what Reliance does best — integrating forwards and backwards. The synergies and linkages between telecom, banking, and retail have been known since the early 2000s, and Jio (or its parent Reliance) have a toehold in all three. On Wednesday, during the Reliance AGM, Mr Ambani also announced that his company is capable of building 5G networks on its own — obviating the need to tap companies such as China’s Huawei (at the receiving end of the global backlash against China and concerns that the company could provide a backdoor into its network, for surveillance, to Chinese authorities). Mr Ambani’s father, Dhirubhai Ambani, followed the same strategy in the petrochemicals business — integrating forward and backward to own the entire supply chain. Mukesh Ambani has sought to do the same thing in petroleum (with limited success), retail (where Reliance Retail’s farm-to-fork strategy is playing out), and telecom.There is one difference, though. In the 1980s, the company’s efforts at integration were largely driven by a desire to reap cost-efficiencies. Now, its expansive play revolves around data and information — something that American technology majors realise. They were locked out of China, and while they were present in India, none of them were in a position to dominate the emerging digital landscape (which has leapfrogged at least a decade on account of Covid-19). Their investments in Jio gives them all stake in a business that could do just that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/mukesh-ambani-s-gamble-pays-off/story-JwyCihDzxX4QI2VnCbmP1J.html
16-07-2020||Editorials||Allow committee meets, virtually | HT Editorial||The Parliament of India has been a victim of the coronavirus pandemic. The Budget session ended early — and rightly so, given the surge in Covid-19 cases. The monsoon session has not been scheduled yet. Given the compulsions of social distancing, the predicament of officials in coming up with a workable formula to ensure that India’s most important democratic institution is functional — but safe — is understandable. But it can be legitimately argued that not enough thought has gone into finding such methods.But even as having full sessions of both houses must be the goal, it is perplexing that parliamentary committees — which are important pillars in keeping the government accountable, rigorously examining an issue of public interest, and developing a cross-party consensus on issues — have been barely functional. This is primarily because virtual meetings of panels have not been allowed, and physical meetings are difficult given that Members of Parliament (MPs) are spread out across the country, with difficulties in mobility and state-specific quarantine rules. In this backdrop, given how the rest of the world has adapted to digital technologies, an obvious solution would have been to allow committees to adapt and meet virtually.But this has not happened and two reasons have been offered as justification. The first is that rules don’t allow it — but then the obvious solution is tweaking rules, given the circumstances. The second, more important, reason is the need for secrecy — which may not be possible during a virtual meeting. The solution to this is ensuring the use of technological platforms which are secure, and owned and vetted by the government. The prime minister, for instance, uses video conference facilities for a range of meetings. And if the top executive can do it, so canthe legislature. Insisting on physical meetings — just recently, MPs who attended a committee meeting had to go into quarantine because a staff of a committee secretariat tested positive — isn’t wise. India is confronted by a range of serious issues, from the pandemic to economic distress, from the security threat from China to rapidly changing global geopolitics. All of them require careful examination. MPs have a role in providing inputs, scrutinising the executive’s approach, involving domain experts in the discussion, and ensuring accountability. Let them get back to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/allow-committee-meets-virtually/story-tLGk08PCshOlgXtbE23VGL.html
