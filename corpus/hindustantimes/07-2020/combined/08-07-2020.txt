08-07-2020||News||India needs a universal social security system | Opinion||The lockdown necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic has caused misery to all those workers whose daily incomes disappeared. This was revealed in the painful images of families of migrant labourers struggling to get back to their villages.This tragedy has driven home the imperative of providing universal social security. The founders of the Republic wanted this. The Directive Principles of State Policy in Article 41 of the Constitution says that within the limits of its economic capacity, the State would provide “public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness, disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want”. The time has now come to make this a reality. About 10% of workers are in the organised sector. They have the protection of social security under the labour laws. These laws are based on similar legislation in industrialised nations. Contributions from both the employers and the employees fund the social security provided to workers. This principle of joint contribution evolved in the early part of the last century as industrialisation and workers’ movements gained momentum. The organised sector workers, who constitute less than 10% of all workers in India, have far greater job security than the remaining 90%, who work as casual labour in large, medium, small, and micro enterprises in cities, at construction sites, in transport, in agriculture and non-farm work. Or, they are self-employed as street vendors or in job work. This 90% is the most vulnerable. The intention to cover all workers is also indicated in the draft legislation on the Social Security Code that has been introduced in Parliament. The challenge for the State is how to provide social security to all with its limited financial and administrative capacities. A universal social security system will have to be built progressively. The most pressing need of the most vulnerable citizens is income, preferably through work for pay. In fact, it is the lack of employment, or fragility of their employment and incomes, that made so many so vulnerable when the pandemic struck. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), which assures 100 days of employment to the poor in rural areas, was a landmark development. In its design, it has the advantage of providing self-selection. Only those who are willing to do manual work can seek employment. Useful assets are created in villages through the programme. In the present crisis, the government has relied on this system to give relief to migrant workers. The time has come to extend this programme to urban areas with municipal bodies being given the responsibility for providing 100 days work to all those seeking it. Self-selection would work equally well in urban areas. Municipal bodies have a range of work to get done, such as improving sanitation, minor repairs, in which they could productively use labour. This should be financed by the Centre in the same way that MGNREGS is. The principle of “learning while earning” should be more vigorously applied to improve India’s skill development systems. These have not delivered enough, in spite of great attention given to skills development in the last 15 years by the United Progressive Alliance and the National Democratic Alliance governments. In a dynamic market-economy, workers will lose jobs and this will happen at a faster pace with technological changes. Workers will have to keep learning to stay productively employed. The best way to learn useful skills is on the job, supplemented with off-line modules, which has been the successful approach of governments and employers in Germany and Japan. An improvement that should be made in the design of MGNREGS-like schemes is to attach on-the-job skill development with the schemes. That way, not only can physical infrastructure be improved in rural and urban areas along with wage payments, but human capabilities will also be simultaneously developed. The principle of on-the-job learning supplemented with government-supported training can be applied in clusters of small and medium enterprises as well. Covid-19 has highlighted the urgency for providing universal free health care. It has demonstrated that for-profit private health care is only for the wealthy. The poor need to be provided with good health care too. Raising the share of expenditure on health care to 2.5% of the Gross Domestic Product in the next two years would be a good beginning. Universal insurance coverage will not be enough. The State must also provide the infrastructure and make doctors and facilities accessible. Digital technologies, telemedicine, pharmacy chains of generic drugs, promotion of healthier lifestyles, and greater use of trained nurses and paramedics can improve health care and lower costs dramatically. Income support with skill improvement and good health care for all who need it, are essential for a universal social security system in India. The State must round these off with improvements to schemes for those who, due to life circumstances, cannot work, such as the disabled, the elderly, and expectant mothers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-needs-a-universal-social-security-system/story-zXURLxf4Xy5dxdEdk5dOMP.html
08-07-2020||News||In India, the deepening of the mental health crisis | Opinion||Humanity has rarely experienced such a collective sense of vulnerability, a dual threat to the body and mind. While the effects of Covid-19 on physical health have been documented, its unprecedented psycho-social health effects have not got the required attention. For centuries, we have prided ourselves on the ability to deal with mental health through various indigenous ways, particularly the strong social networks. Physical meetings, celebrations and gatherings are connections that strengthen us and replenish collective mental energies.With physical, and, therefore, implied social distancing, being enforced globally as one of the most effective ways to deal with the physiological aspect of the pandemic, the social networking that aided mental well-being is suddenly missing. Instead, the majority of information consumed by people and communities has been tinged with fear and dread about an uncertain future. This has led to collective stress, anxiety and deteriorating mental health parameters. The gentle touch of a supportive friend, a friendly embrace or a pat on the back for a job well done, the wiping of tears from grieving eyes, these are not possible in a Covid-19-stricken world. Unlike in the case of physical health, there is a denial of and resistance to less-than-perfect mental health in India. In most western societies, chemical/neural imbalances, genetics, endocrine system functioning and external stress factors are accepted as being at the root of major mental health disorders. Unfortunately, many Indians have a hard time accepting that those close to them may need professional clinical help. A state-level report by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), published in 2017, noted that about one in seven persons in the country suffers from mental disorders of varying severity, with depression and anxiety disorders being the most common, affecting 45.7 million and 44.9 million people, respectively. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2017) report predicts that depression will be the second leading cause of disability worldwide by 2020. Further, the findings of a countrywide National Mental Health Survey 2015-16 by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) revealed that nearly 150 million Indians need active mental health care interventions while fewer than 30 million are seeking this support.Covid-19 has inadvertently fast-tracked attention to this mental health timebomb. Health care workers and Covid-19 suspects/patients have borne the brunt of this. The stigma associated with Covid-19 patients is an unfortunate reflection of the uninformed judgments we are subjected to daily. Doctors and caregivers who work round-the-clock away from their families, risking their lives for others, are being ostracised by their communities. This is enough to cause stress even to the most resilient. Many are likely to suffer mental health issues as the fear of the future linked to the “new normal”, reluctant adaption to Covid-19-appropriate social behaviour, and adjusting to the unlocking of economic activities may weigh people down and possibly weaken already-fragile minds. Technology has helped. The extensive use of digital technologies in places of worship, gyms, and yoga studios; virtual workspaces and school classrooms have helped foster physical distancing without social isolation. Social media networks have ensured check-ins with millions of individuals across the globe. These include Covid-19 patients recovering alone in hospitals or those in forced quarantine. We have successfully completed the mass training of health workers using digital tools. Training and capacity-building resources on Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, anti-stigma and psycho-social health is a mandatory module in the Integrated Government Online Training platform (iGOT). In this, special response groups such as the police, defence personnel, volunteers and students are learning via online training content, alongside health care workers. The coordinates of psycho-social professionals and volunteers have been made accessible district-wise. NIMHANS launched a national helpline (080-46110007) on March 30 to provide counselling on mental health and psycho-social issues related to the pandemic and lockdown. This is available in several vernacular languages, with a dedicated helpline for Covid-19 health care warriors. A separate online platform (psychcare-nimhans.in) has also been set up for mental health support. Several webinars and videos including stress management, social stigma during the coronavirus pandemic, addressing psycho-social concerns of health care workers and dealing with issues of children and senior citizens, among others, are being uploaded regularly by NIMHANS and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on the ministry of health website. This is a clarion call to open our hearts for our minds, and speak up without fear or shame about issues of the mind. It’s a call to stop viewing ourselves and others through a prejudiced lens and stand together as a nation and humanity to help us heal and move forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-india-the-deepening-of-the-mental-health-crisis/story-lsi7m4qbPlQOFbv9qRhkvL.html
08-07-2020||News||The big secret of tech innovation | Opinion||The chairman of Reliance Industries Limited, Mukesh Ambani, recently announced a video-conferencing tool, JioMeet, that looks just like Zoom. On social media, Indian entrepreneurs are panning him for copying; one person tweeted that he should have called it “Jhoom” because that is how it would be pronounced locally. It isn’t Ambani that is out of touch with the way the tech industry works, it is Ambani’s critics. They don’t understand how tech innovation works.Although this may sound strange, copying is good for innovation. This is how Chinese technology companies got started — by adapting Silicon Valley’s technologies for Chinese use and improving on them. The Chinese routinely monitor what app is achieving success elsewhere, and duplicate it before they start adding features and innovating; they learn from the best and improve.It’s how Silicon Valley works too and even Zoom is a knock-off of the technologies it is competing with: WebEx, Skype, and BlueJeans.Steve Jobs built the Macintosh by copying the windowing interface from the Palo Alto Research Center. As he admitted in 1994, “Picasso had a saying, ‘Good artists copy, great artists steal’; and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.” Almost every Apple product has features that were first developed by others; rarely do its technologies wholly originate within the company.The iPod, for example, was created by British inventor Kane Kramer; iTunes was built on a technology purchased from Soundjam; and the iPhone frequently copies Samsung’s mobile technologies — while Samsung copies Apple’s.Mark Zuckerberg also built Facebook by copying from MySpace and Friendster, and he continues to copy products. Facebook Places is a replica of Foursquare; Messenger video imitates Skype; Facebook Stories is a clone of Snapchat; and Facebook Live combines the best features of Meerkat and Periscope.Now, Zuckerberg is trying to copy WeChat by integrating private messaging, groups and payments. This is why he is so focused on getting WhatsApp Payments approved by the Indian regulators. Before purchasing the company, he desperately tried to copy WhatsApp, but repeatedly failed. So he ended up purchasing the company, which had almost no revenue, for an astonishing $20 billion or so, which was about 10% of Facebook’s market cap.This is another one of Silicon Valley’s secrets: If stealing doesn’t work, then buy the company.By the way, they don’t call this copying or stealing; it is called “knowledge-sharing”. Silicon Valley has very high rates of job-hopping, and top engineers rarely work at any one company for more than three years. They routinely join their competitors or start their own companies. As long as engineers don’t steal computer codes or designs, they can build on the work they did before. Silicon Valley firms understand that collaborating and competing at the same time leads to success. This is even reflected in California’s unusual laws, which bar non-competition agreements.In most places, entrepreneurs hesitate to tell others what they are doing. Yet, in Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs know that when they share an idea, they get important feedback. Both sides learn by exchanging ideas and developing new ones. So when you walk into a coffee shop in Palo Alto, those you ask will not hesitate to tell you their product-development plans.Neither companies nor countries can succeed, however, merely by copying. They must move very fast and keep improving themselves and adapting to changing markets and technologies.Apple became the most valuable company in the world because it didn’t hesitate to cannibalise its own technologies. Jobs didn’t worry that the iPad would hurt the sales of its laptops or that the music player in the iPhone would eliminate the need to buy an iPod. The company moved forward quickly as competitors copied its designs. I expect Jio will do this as well; learn from what works best in the Indian market, and come out with better technologies.There is a line here that should never be crossed, however, and that is intellectual property theft. China’s Huawei was sued by Cisco for its “systematic and wholesale infringement of Cisco’s intellectual property”, for example. Its 5G technologies were likely stolen from Nokia and others. The core of many of China’s most advanced technologies is based on such theft. This is never good for innovation and leads to even more destructive habits and the types of blowback that Huawei is seeing all over the world as countries rightfully ban its technologies.My simple message to Indian entrepreneurs is to imitate before they innovate — but don’t cross any ethical lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-big-secret-of-tech-innovation/story-fBkqqP81tdyGReYmtDefoI.html
08-07-2020||News||How India has responded to the global pandemic, writes Harsh Vardhan Shringla||The Covid-19 pandemic has been the biggest crisis to hit humanity since World War II. It has already cost us over 500,000 deaths and countless livelihoods. The impact on the economy has been extremely sharp­­­­­­­. International financial institutions have projected a contraction of nearly 5% in global output in 2020, and a cumulative loss to global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of around $12 trillion. How quickly the global economy recovers from what the International Monetary Fund has referred to as the “Great Lockdown” depends on how soon the pandemic is controlled. As India enters Unlock 2.0, our government’s efforts are geared towards further expansion of economic activity while not letting our guard down.We have been proactive in assessing and dealing with the challenges caused by the pandemic. Saving lives has been our foremost priority. On this count, while our caseload continues to be high, we have fared comparatively better than many other countries with a low death rate and high recovery rate. This can be attributed to early steps to protect and insulate people. The government has channelled public resources to the health care sector for the development of hospitals, emergency rooms, the provision of equipment and supplies, and training health care professionals.To deal with the economic challenges posed by the pandemic, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has enunciated a forward-looking economic approach under the rubric of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan. The stimulus package of nearly Rs 20 lakh crore aims to both reinvigorate the economy and provide a social safety net to our vulnerable sections. The vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat will stand on five pillars: Economy, infrastructure, our system, demography and demand.The Abhiyaan is aimed at not only mitigating the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic in the short-term, but also instilling confidence in businesses and industries; making manufacturing globally competitive; integrating our agriculture and small farmers with global food supply chains; and embracing both investment and technology. The size of the economic relief and stimuli measures under the Abhiyaan is equivalent to 10% of India’s GDP.Private sector participation has been given a big push in eight areas, including coal, minerals, defence production, civil aviation, power distribution, social infrastructure, space and atomic energy. The government is opening previously restricted sectors to greater private participation. The call for Aatmnirbharta is not about reverting to economic isolationism. Its essential aim is to ensure India’s position as a key participant in global supply chains. Through building capacities at home, we also intend to contribute to mitigating disruptions in global markets. It is important to identify products and commodities where India has the ability or potential to expand domestic production and enhance global availability. True, we cannot make everything — but we can certainly make many, many more things than we currently are.Global engagement and cooperation are critical to deal with the pandemic and ensure economic recovery. The PM took the lead in engaging world leaders for evolving a coordinated response. The PM also highlighted that during the pandemic, India had tried to live up to the teaching of seeing the world as one family, Vasudhaiva Kutumbkam, by sharing medicines with over 120 countries, forging a common response strategy with its neighbouring countries, and providing specific support to countries that sought it, while also protecting our own population.The pandemic has generated a debate about the future of globalisation and the structural limitations of the international order. Virtual summits of global leaders have been useful platforms to highlight shortcomings of existing arrangements for global cooperation, and to share India’s vision of a new, people-centric template for multilateral cooperation. This formed the thrust of PM’s interventions in the virtual summits of the G-20 and Non-Aligned Movement to cite two examples. The pandemic has disrupted diplomatic calendars causing almost all international meetings and summits to be cancelled. While face-to-face meetings with counterparts have traditionally been considered essential to resolve complicated issues or conduct difficult negotiations, diplomatic engagement cannot be allowed to stop in their absence. At the ministry of external affairs (MEA), we are attempting to find common ground between time-honoured diplomatic protocols and new-age Internet protocols. A crisis of this magnitude requires a coordinated global response, making sustained communication between countries all the more essential. The increase in tensions in different parts of the world, including on the Line of Actual Control between India and China, have only emphasised the criticality of continued communication. Diplomacy has to adapt to new situations. Virtual diplomacy has been complemented by efforts to deliver medical aid and assistance. This has included the supply of essential medicines, test kits and protective gear worth around Rs 82 crores to 89 countries. Even in these difficult times, India has remained dependable and responsive in living up to its international commitments.As health security and health supply chains move up on the priority lists of the world’s governments, India must prime itself to emerging opportunities. Indian diplomacy will support this process all the way. The MEA is actively engaged in promoting India as an alternative manufacturing and innovation destination.There are lessons we are learning in all contexts and domains — whether in diplomacy or the economy, whether in policymaking or in society. I am confident that they will serve to strengthen our systems, our resolve and our country as we put our current challenges behind us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-india-has-responded-to-the-global-pandemic/story-xEts6wZ9540c4W9J2iQYAN.html
08-07-2020||Gurugram||Man, driver shot at near Farrukhnagar||A businessman and his driver were allegedly shot at by three unidentified assailants on Wazirpur road near Farrukhnagar on Tuesday evening. Police said the bullets missed them and suspects were yet to be identified. According to the police, the incident was reported around 6.30 pm when Farrukhnagar residents Manoj Jain, who owns grocery shops in Kasan village, and his driver, identified by first name as Deepak, were on their way to Farrukhnagar in an SUV. A police officer, requesting anonymity, said, “Three suspects, on a motorcycle, followed them and when they had reached near an electricity office on Wazirpur road, they signalled the driver to stop the car. When the driver stopped the vehicle, the suspects fired multiple gunshots at the occupants. The bullets whizzed through the windows of the car and missed the targets.”Police said the suspects fled to Wazirpur. Two cartridges were recovered from the spot. Police said prima facie, probe suggests that the suspects wanted to rob the businessman and decamp with the SUV, adding that they were also probing other angles, including extortion. A case was registered against the suspects under sections 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code and section 25/54/59 of The Arms Act at Farrukhnagar police station on Tuesday night, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-driver-shot-at-near-farrukhnagar/story-AwZHIZQNsKVrfeoPAAjBfM.html

A case of murder has been registered against unidentified persons.The victim, Uttam Singh, a resident of Kasganj in Uttar Pradesh, worked as a supplier in an automobile company in Gurugram’s Sector 37. According to the police, he had gone to IMT Manesar to supply materials to a firm as part of his official duties on Tuesday morning but did not return to his house in Hari Nagar, Sector 10 A.His brother told the police that when he did not return by the evening, the family tried calling him on his mobile phone but there was no response. In an earlier conversation during the day, the victim had told his brother that he did not have any conveyance to return from Manesar and had asked if his brother could pick him up. Sanjay Kumar, station house officer (SHO), sector 10 A police station, said, “A commuter informed the control room regarding a dead body lying near a school in Sector 94, following which our teams rushed to the spot in the morning. Prima facie, it appears that the victim’s throat was slit with a knife. His phone and other belongings have been recovered, which rules out loot as the motive. It is possible that he took a lift for the commute from Manesar.”Police said they are checking CCTVs in the area to identify possible leads. The victim’s body was handed over to the family after an autopsy, on Wednesday evening. A case under Section 302 (punishment for murder) has been registered against unidentified persons at Sector 10-A police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-20-year-old-found-murdered-in-sector-94/story-iPmMnIBEjp4iCMfOij8kfJ.html

HSVP constructed the 28-km long Badshahpur drain as a box-type concrete structure to prevent waterlogging. However, a 30 metre stretch in the Khandsa village could not be built due to legal dispute over acquisition of some land. On June 20, when they had inspected the area, officials said they found iron bars were protruding out from the under-construction drain that posed a threat to anyone walking alongside it.“The work on the walls started on June 23 and it has been completed. This safety wall will ensure that water does not get collected there and prevent people or vehicles accidentally falling into the drain during rains,” said Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP. The Badshahpur drain originates from Ghata village and brings monsoon water that collects at the Ghata dam to the Najafgarh drain passing through the city. To ensure that the water does not flow back and flood the Hero Honda Chowk, officials said that a pump with high capacity was installed at the location to ensure that the water flowed towards the Najafgarh drain. In 2018, Hero Honda Chowk underpass was submerged after the drain at Khandsa started flowing the other way forcing road closure for four days.In a recent stock taking meeting of different civic agencies, Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, Gurugram also said that heavy water pumps have been installed at this and several other locations to ensure no waterlogging takes place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-builds-wall-at-khandsa-alongside-badshahpur-drain-to-prevent-accidents/story-mBcJSm9No7X8CooJFakK5N.html
08-07-2020||City||UP govt extends term of CEO of nodal agency behind Noida airport||GREATER NOIDA: The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday extended the term of the chief executive officer (CEO) of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), Arun Vir Singh, for a year. Singh is also the CEO of the Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL) that is developing the airport at Jewar.The retired IAS officer’s term was extended due to his long association with the airport project, which the government wants to start work on at the earliest after the Covid-19 pandemic is over, sources said.In June 2019 after superannuation from the Uttar Pradesh government, former IAS officer Arun Vir Singh had got a year’s extension as CEO of YEIDA. The government had given him a year’s extension as he was involved with the airport project since the beginning and his expertise in the project can help in the timely execution of the Noida International Greenfield Airport scheduled to come up at Jewar along the 165km Yamuna Expressway. However, work at the site could not be started due to the nationwide lockdown imposed from March 25 in light of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The foundation of the airport was to be laid down in April this year but the event was put off, said officials. Now, the UP government has given him another year’s extension in the hopes that he can get the work expedited for not only the airport but for infrastructure projects proposed along the expressway as well.“The work had got affected due to the coronavirus crisis. Our priority is to first start the work of the airport at the site as and when restrictions on air travel are removed. We hope that the agreement signing and other formalities for the airport with the Swiss firm, selected to develop the facility, are completed on July 17, paving way for the work to begin at the site,” said Singh, CEO of Yeida and NIAL.Apart from the airport, Singh said his priority is also to bring investment into this region.“We want to attract more and more investment, create jobs and also develop world class infrastructure in this region. Metro, the expressway, an electronic cluster, a skill university and a mobile manufacturing hub, among other projects, will help create jobs for youth in this region. Our aim is to make that happen within a stipulated time frame,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-govt-extends-term-of-ceo-of-nodal-agency-behind-noida-airport/story-oQLFIveRn7tdnJub1zJOtI.html
08-07-2020||City||Noida: Circle rate revision process begins, builders raise concerns over pitfalls of possible hike||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar administration on Wednesday started the process to revise the circle rates for the 2020-21 fiscal.Developers, homebuyers and other stakeholders said they believe that due to the repercussions of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic on the realty market, increasing circle rates will not be a feasible move. However, according to the administration, it has merely initiated the exercise on the process.“Today (Wednesday), we merely held the first meeting on the issue of circle rates. We have discussed the circle rates with the sub-registrar and other administration officials. We have adequate time to deliberate and finalise the rates as it is just the start of the process,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar. The Noida, Greater Noida and the Yamuna Expressway authorities, the sub-divisional magistrates and other officials, took part in the meeting and gave their opinions. In a week’s time, a proposal will be made after which objections or suggestions will be invited from the public before a final decision on the rates, said officials.“No authority is of the view to increase the circle rates as the real estate market is undergoing its worst phase due to the pandemic,” said a Noida authority official, asking not to be named.The ongoing circle rates will be effective till August 7, 2020. New rates are put into effect beginning August 8 of every year.“We will finalise the new rates before August 7 as per rules. The decision on revision is to be taken in the future,” said LY. The DM discussed the circle rate issues with officials at the Sector 27 office.Circle rates revision is an annual exercise done after inviting objections and suggestions from the general public. The circle rate is the rate at which a property is sold or bought. It is the circle rate at which the government charges stamp duty in fee for the registration process, which is required to transfer the property from one person to another. In Noida, the government charges 5% of the total property cost as the property fee, as of nowThe homebuyers said they feel that a hike in the circle rate will affect their budget. The circle rates in Gautam Budh Nagar are in the range of Rs 20,000 per square metre to Rs 3 lakh per square metre, depending upon the location.“The circle rates are already unrealistic in most of the sectors as compared to the level of civic services and existing infrastructure. The problem the buyers face is, for example, if in some areas the cost of a property is Rs 40 lakh, but it is valued at Rs 70 lakh as per the prevailing circle rates, the buyer will have to pay the stamp duty according to Rs 70 lakh value,” said SK Nagrath president of Jaypee Aman flat buyers’ association.Developers said they also hope the rates will be reduced in some areas.“The administration must reduce circle rates as per the market sentiment. Due to unrealistic circle rates, buyers are unable to purchase the property, which in turn affects the market,” said Prashant Tiwari, president of Western UP confederation of real estate developers association of India (CREDAI), a developers’ group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-circle-rate-revision-process-begins-builders-raise-concerns-over-pitfalls-of-possible-hike/story-Sdd8gksvLBDFtX60RLBkDJ.html
08-07-2020||City||‘Bed pooling’ an option to deal with shortage of Covid beds: health department||Districts in western UP are planning to pool in their hospital beds to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) if cases surge further, said officials from the Ghaziabad health department.This way, if all beds in a district are occupied, patients can be referred to other appropriate hospitals in the neighbouring district.At present the six districts falling under the Meerut division -- Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Meerut, Hapur, Baghpat and Bulandshahr -- account for 28.7% cases out of the total 31,156 cases in the state.“Since the cases are on rise, there are plans that hospitals in Meerut, Hapur and Ghaziabad get integrated. In case the number of patients get spillover in one district, they can be referred to hospitals having vacant beds in other districts. This will make better utilisation of available beds. The concept is in the planning stage and being considered in case Covid-19 count rises in future,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “Once the plan is finalised, the medical colleges/hospitals will be connected to each other in order to find out availability of beds.”Compared to the other five, Hapur has a relatively low case count and officials said that keeping accessibility in mind, the three medical colleges there could be the first alternative under the plan for Ghaziabad. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls.On the other hand, CMO said, Ghaziabad is also banking on paid private Covid-19 facilities for patients and more hospitals will be added to the list in coming days.According to officials, they have 444 beds Covid beds available for patients in seven private hospitals in Ghaziabad and 84 of these are ICU beds.“Of the total beds we have also acquired 13 ventilator beds from the seven hospitals so far. We need to take our total ventilator beds to 80 in the district. Apart from the 13 ventilator beds acquired by the government, we have 33 ventilator beds available at our government facilities. Apart from seven private hospitals presently under Covid operations, two more private hospitals have shown interest and will start with paid Covid treatment soon. Together, the two hospitals will add 150 more Covid beds,” Gupta added.New L-1 facilitiesThe health department will also open up two more L-1 category Covid hospitals (for mild cases) within the week -- IMS, Dasna (350 beds) and AKGIT College (400 beds).“We have added 100 more beds to the L-1 category Divyajyoti Hospital at Niwari taking its capacity to 350. At the SRM Campus, Modinagar we have opened up three storeys of the building with 250 beds. It has two more storeys where 100 additional beds can be added,” Dr Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bed-pooling-an-option-to-deal-with-shortage-of-covid-beds-health-department/story-CrwiH1nEtgGhoG4J5GlOaI.html
08-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers await opening of tractor mandis even during Unlock 2.0||Farmers across Punjab are eagerly awaiting opening of the much sought-after ‘tractor mandis’ that continue to face closure even in the Unlock 2.0 phase. For the last three decades, these informal open markets for the sale and purchase of used tractors were held every week at Talwandi Sabo (Bathinda), Moga, Kotkapura (Faridkot) and Barnala. Ahead of the sowing season in June and November, the sale and purchase of used tractors hits the peak. But these markets are completely out of business since the lockdown was imposed in March in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. Major Singh, a farmer from Talwandi Sabo who has taken 30 acres land on lease to sow paddy, wanted to sell his Ford-7,000 tractor to buy a smaller used machine to pay for farm labour. “Due to the lockdown, locally available farm labourers charged exorbitant rates for sowing of paddy. This year’s rate for per acre is Rs 1,400 higher than the last season and I had no means to pay them the additional cost. As the tractor mandis are still closed, my plan to get cash for payments after buying a lower version of the tractor has been dashed,” he said.Mahinder Singh, an enterprising farmer from Bathinda, said traders and farmers from various districts of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh used to visit the tractor mandis every week.“After these mandis started in the 90s, they became the most preferred platform to sell or buy second-hand tractors. Several farmers have been contacting me to finalise deals for their tractors, but we have no buyers,” said Mahinder, who was among a group of farmers behind starting the concept of tractor mandis.Resham Singh, a resident of Bhai Bakhtour village, said he intended to invest in a rotavator after selling his old tractor. But he ended up hiring a machine to prepare his fields for the kharif crop last month. “I bought tractors at the Talwandi Sabo mandi thrice as it is a reliable place to invest in used tractors. Traders outside the mandi quoted low rate for my tractor and I have no option but to wait for the mandi to resume,” he added. A marginal farmer from Barnala Gurdeep Singh said his additional income as a sales agent at the local mandi stopped due to the pandemic.“During the peak season, about 250 tractors are sold in a month at the Barnala mandi. Like vegetable or fruit mandis, the authorities should also consider resuming the tractor mandis with adherence to Covid-19 guidelines as several farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-farmers-await-opening-of-tractor-mandis-even-during-unlock-2-0/story-mMMn2kueXHQVxKiopvmQvI.html
08-07-2020||City||Special surveillance drive: 8.5 lakh houses surveyed, only 724 found with Covid-like symptoms||A special surveillance drive launched on July 2 to check for Covid-like symptoms has turned out to be a dud in its first six days. Although, the teams have been able to cover close to 8.5 lakh households so far in Ghaziabad , only 724 cases of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) have been detected. The teams are likely to cover around 12 lakh houses by July 12.Residents said that the surveillance drive lacked intent and seems to being conducted only as a matter of formality.Under the special surveillance drive, the teams were to visit door-to-door in the entire district and survey the residents about having co-morbid conditions, and also identify those having symptoms of Covid-19 or ILI/SARI-related symptoms. The teams were required to put up markings on flats/houses that had been surveyed.Each teams comprising of two members were assigned a target of covering 75 houses in one day and each member will be paid Rs 75 per day for the survey.Residents, however, said that although teams did arrive at their doorsteps, they mostly restricted themselves to questions about people having symptoms like cold, cough or fever.“The teams arrived in Kaushambi highrises and our RWAs allowed them entry. They stood at the doorstep and just asked if anyone in family has any cough, cold or fever like symptoms. They did not ask about comorbidity and no marking was done on the flats. They noted down details of people living in the houses and went away,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartments’ RWA.The teams also went to highrises in Indirapuram and covered areas of Ahimsa Khand and Vaibhv Khand.“Two people teams visit the flats and seek replies. There were no markings put up on the flats after the survey. We feel that the teams were primarily dependent on whatever information (whether correct or incorrect) was provided to them by residents. The door-to-door survey would have been better if the teams were provided with infrared thermometers and they should have been allowed to scan residents living in a flat/house. Otherwise, the survey is reduced to a mere formality,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners.The first surveillance drive was launched in Meerut division — that comprises the six districts of Ghaziabad, Meerut, Gautam Budh Nagar, Baghpat, Hapur and Bulandshahr. According to official records of the Ghaziabad district administration, total of 12,072 teams (at an average of 2012 teams being deployed each day) went out for surveys in containment and non-containment areas of the district in first six days and covered 842216 houses, covering a total population of 3631165 people living in it.During the first six days, the teams could identify only 724 cases of ILI/SARI out of which 321 were tested and 10 have turned positive so far, officials said . They said that the results were far from satisfactory as of now, but the numbers will improve as the drive picks up steam in the remaining four days, before ending on July 12.“There were complaints that teams were visiting houses in evening timings against fixed timing given to them. Some residents complained that there were no signs marked on surveyed houses and teams just went away after asking 3-4 questions. After this, we called a meeting of all the 237 supervisory heads and asked them to take corrective measures immediately,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.“Considering the hardship involved in the work amid peak summer season, we are of view that if 60-70% survey gets finished by the teams, a lot of ground would have been covered. The teams are trying their best to get more details from households and onus is also on residents to extend full cooperation,” Dr Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/special-surveillance-drive-8-5-lakh-houses-surveyed-only-724-found-with-covid-like-symptoms/story-gIxDTsDnj8bbpOS35h1HUM.html
08-07-2020||City||Four months on, Gautam Budh Nagar DM says surge in cases due to better testing||NOIDA: On Wednesday, the Gautam Budh Nagar completed four months since the first Covid-19 positive case was reported in the district.From just about one positive case a day in March, the district now sees around 92 cases per day in the first week of July alone. District magistrate Suhas LY said that the rising number of cases with less than 1% fatality rate indicated better testing and treatment. The recovery rate in the district is about 67%.“We are focusing on containment as well as early treatment. We have increased our testing multifold. Antigen testing kits are being used for large scale testing every day. In the last six days, over 14,000 tests have been done, including around 9,000 antigen kit tests and nearly 5,000 RT-PCR tests. Because of this, positive case numbers have definitely gone up, but it has helped us in containment and isolation of positive cases, thereby reducing positivity rate,” he said.The DM further said that testing includes Covid-19 contacts, high risk persons in containment zones, symptomatic patients and others. “We shall continue with the intensive screening and testing, till the infection of deadly virus ends,” he said. Over 1,500 teams have been formed of health and other departmental workers. “These teams are visiting households and identifying high risk groups, persons with symptoms of Covid-19. These teams are carrying thermal screening equipment and pulse oximeters for oxygen saturation monitoring. The better we do our comorbidity management, lesser will be our mortality rate. We have also requested different residents’ welfare associations and local panchayats, to actively participate in this fight against the coronavirus,” he said.He further said that the Covid-19 facilities of different levels are continuously being ramped up. “The district, at present, has around 1,100 active cases. But, we are ready with over 3,000 beds. Not only that, based on the feedback given by the cured patients, we are making improvement in the hospitals – where they had been admitted,” he said. He also said that the 24X7 call centre 18004192211 continue to be at residents’ service for scheduling tests and positive declaration/bed request. “Our portal tinyurl.com/GBN-COVID-HELP is also actively disposing off public health related grievances. We believe, there is always scope for improvement in delivery of services and we shall strive to do better,” he said and appealed the people for self-regulation, awareness and protocol adherence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-months-on-gautam-budh-nagar-dm-says-surge-in-cases-due-to-better-testing/story-4kLOydsbspspAUtrBEKvMM.html
08-07-2020||Chandigarh||Brahmpura sees BJP hand behind Dhindsa’s move, feels ‘betrayed’||A day after a faction of dissident Akali leaders “elected” Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa as the SAD president, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD-Taksali) president and former MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpura said he was seeing the BJP hand behind Dhindsa’s political move.Dhindsa, along with his son and former state finance minister, was expelled from the SAD in February this year for “anti-party” activities. Dhindsa later joined hands with SAD (Taksali), which was formed by Brahmpura, Sekhwan and former MP Dr Rattan Singh Ajnala in December 2018.“A few days ago, Dhindsa and Sewa Singh Sekhwan had come to me. I informed Dhindsa that there had been talks that he was going to form a new party. I suggested him take over the reins of the SAD-Taksali. I offered to step down as the party president. To this, Dhindsa said he would let me know his decision in a couple of days, but he didn’t reply. I think he has followed the instructions of his friends in New Delhi,” said Brahmpura, while talking to HT over phone.“At a function in Ludhiana on Tuesday, the stage secretary was seen saying that I would also join the function, but he was lying. I am not with them. Dhindsa has betrayed me. I will expose him and his team in the coming days. People are saying that Dhindsa wants to make his son Parminder Punjab chief minister. I feel that he is being guided by the BJP’s central leadership, who are trying to increase their foothold in Punjab,” he said.On Tuesday, the SAD had accused Dhindsa of acting at the behest of the Congress.When asked why Dhindsa didn’t accept his offer to become SAD-Taksali president, Brahmpura said: “I have reports that Dhindsa is eying Hindu votes in Punjab and for this he would take BJP’s help. He even had a problem with the ‘Taksali’ word.”He said he will not join Dhindsa, but will continue working for his party and its principals. “The party was formed after taking a pledge at the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhs. I and my supporters will continue working for the party and for the betterment of Punjab,” he said.Lashing out on former minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan, who was present with Dhindsa at Tuesday’s function in Ludhiana, Brahmpura said: “Sekhwan has betrayed me. He didn’t even inform me that he was joining Dhindsa. The people of Punjab know how to deal with such leaders. He was in the forefront when our party was formed at the Akal Takht. He is a PO (proclaimed offender) of the people of Punjab.”Brahmpura said it is his appeal to the people not to make any contact with Sekhwan, who has betrayed the Punjabis. Brahmpura also said his party will fight the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) elections as announced earlier. “The BJP-led Union government is deliberately delaying the SGPC elections,” he said. Sekhwan, however, said: “As Brahmpura was not physically fit to lead the party, we had asked him to dissolve the party and constitute its new team, but he was unwilling to do so. Our repeated meetings with him proved futile and we were forced to elect Dhindsa our president. Brahmpura’s leadership was not accepted to the people as he failed to fulfil the ambition of the party for which it was made at Akal Takht.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/brahmpura-sees-bjp-hand-behind-dhindsa-s-move-feels-betrayed/story-PFOSLysBi9QQq9AB7pH59I.html

08-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad’s patient discharge rate slips to 40%, worst in Uttar Pradesh||Ghaziabad has earned the dubious record of having the highest number of active Covid-19 cases among all the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh — as per as per state control room figures (from June 30 till July 7)— with health officials worried that either patients were not getting discharged or their entries were not being updated on the portal.Ghaziabad breached the 2,000 mark of Covid-19 cases on July 4 and has been the top district in UP in terms of active cases since June 30. On June 30, the district had 822 active cases, which rose to 1,390 on July 7. The number of patients discharged as on June 30 stood at 738, while the figure for July 7 was 977. This means that only 239 patients were discharged in the district since July 1.On Wednesday, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad stood at 2612 with number of active cases going up to 1477 and number of total patients discharged stood at 1072 besides 63 deaths. Since June 30, the Ghaziabad district has been featuring on top of all 75 districts in UP having highest number, more than one thousand, of active cases.“The fewer number of patients getting discharged is a cause of concern. We think this is happening either because the patients are not getting discharged on time as per the latest guidelines or they have been discharged but the same information has not been uploaded to the state portal,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of the district.“We think that entires of about 300 patients will to be updated in the next few days and this will bring down our number of active cases,” he added.The discharge rate of patients in Ghaziabad district had been on the higher side ever since the Covid-19 outbreak. On April 30, the discharge rate was 66.66% out of total 66 cases. It jumped to 76.39% (out of total of 305 cases) till May 31. However, it started seeing a downward slip after that. The discharge rate, as per the state health bulletin, was quoted at 45.69% till June 30 out of a total of 1,615 cases.It has slipped further since and till July 7, the overall discharge rate was 40.2% out of a total of 2430 cases.The officials said that they suspected the government’s L1 category facilities were the main culprits in not uploading details.“We have now changed the staff deployed at our L1 hospital at Niwari, which was opened last week. The physical verification from patient’s register is being taken up by other staff. Each hospital has been given a login ID and password and they are supposed to make entires on state portal. The same has been issued to private hospitals but we expect that they have much more efficient staff and make proper entries,” Dr Gupta added.Ghaziabad district at present has seven private paid Covid-19 facilities for treatment of patients while the government is operating three L1 category hospitals at ESCI Sahibabad, Divyajyoti Hospital at Niwari and SRM Campus at Modinagar. The district also has an L2 hospital at Sanjay Nagar and L3 hospital at Santosh Medical.As per the new discharge guidelines issued on June 19, if any asymptomatic patient shows no symptoms, he/she can be discharged without undergoing any test on the tenth day from their date of admission. But, such patients will have to remain in home quarantine for seven days after discharge from hospital.According to officials, the recovery rate of L1 category patients ranges from 8-16 days while the L2 and L3 patients, who have moderate to critical conditions, need full recovery before they can be discharged.The officials also added that with increased sampling and testing through various means like RT-PCR, rapid antigen kits and TrueNat machines, the district had been witnessing an increase in the overall number of Covid-19 cases.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on July 16 had approved a special RT-PCR laboratory for Ghaziabad district for conduct of testing in view of the rising number of cases in the district.HT on July 18 had reported about the approval given by the CM.“We expect the laboratory to be functional in another month. The old women’s hospital building at the premises of MMG Hospital will be modified for installation of the new RT-PCR laboratory. Two doctors are undergoing training at present and new staff — including nine lab technicians — will also be provided for the operation of the new laboratory,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, the chief medical superintendent of MMG Hospital.“Once the lab gets is inaugurated, we will be able to conduct about 100 tests per day and will slowly scale up testing, depending on requirement,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-s-patient-discharge-rate-slips-to-40-worst-in-uttar-pradesh/story-4OGDnfknOr5W7ix8pka2kO.html

The mall said that the clip was of June and that repair works were on.The video showed a section of the roof collapsing, creating a cloud of dust. “We had commenced planned enhancement works in a part of The Mall of India, Noida when the lockdown was suddenly implemented. During this time, a small portion, measuring approx. 650 square metres -- under 3% of total roof area ... was in the process of being prepared … the thunderstorm and extreme weather conditions that hit the city of Noida in June adversely impacted this portion of the roof in its vulnerable state. As a consequence of the damage suffered, a decision was taken to bring down that entire portion of the roof and rebuild it completely with enhanced standards,” read an official statement from the mall.According to the police, they have neither received any complaint nor has such an incident that happened on Wednesday.“The video is old and we did not receive any complaint nor any such incident has happened.

The private room or paid facility would be an option for patients who want and can afford extra facilities,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS.He added that GIMS will be getting more hands from the hospital into the Covid-19 team to cater the needs of the private room patients.“The private facility will be soon ready. The rooms will also have oxygen channels. We just want to provide an option of better facilities to those who can afford them,” said Gupta.City’s first hospital that had started the treatment for Covid-19 patients and testing, GIMS currently has several wards with a total of 150 beds, including 10 ventilator beds and 18 beds with oxygen channels.

08-07-2020||City||Support syllabus cut but CBSE must say how deleted topics were chosen: Sisodia||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday sought the Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) response over the rationalisation of syllabi from classes 9 to 12 announced a day earlier and questioned the selection process adopted by the board while deciding on reduction of the course material.To compensate for the lack of classroom teaching during the Covid-19 crisis, the national board on Tuesday announced that it had reduced the course load by 30% for students of classes 9 to 12. The move, however, evoked sharp responses from many who claimed that important chapters had been omitted.On Wednesday, Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, said students should learn about social sciences through “authentic sources". “The topics of social science which are dropped are so relevant in a contemporary context that it is important that children learn about it through authentic sources rather than through WhatsApp University,” he said in a statement.Last month, Sisodia had also written to the Union minister of human resource development, requesting a syllabus reduction of 30%. While saying that the Delhi government had been “a votary of syllabus reduction” to encourage in-depth learning, Sisodia on Wednesday questioned the process the course committees, curriculum committee and the governing body of CBSE adopted to arrive at the decision to remove or include specific chapters.“The ‘curriculum deduction details’ containing subject-wise topics that have been deleted do not give any reason as to why that particular topic or chapter has been left out,” Sisodia said, adding that the board should have explained the rationale behind dropping certain topics. The 1,030 Delhi government schools are affiliated to CBSE. More than 15 lakh students from Delhi’s private and government schools will be learning under the revised syllabi.The education minister asked why topics such as Democratic Rights and Food Security in India had been removed completely from class 9 syllabus; four chapters from Democratic Politics-Democracy and Diversity, Gender, Religion and Caste, Popular Struggles and Movement and Challenges to Democracy have been completely removed from class 10 syllabus; Federalism, Citizenship, Nationalism, and Secularism were completely removed from class 11 Political Science syllabus; and why Understanding Partition, Social Movements and New Social Movements in India, and Regional Aspirations were removed from class 12 syllabus.He questioned the removal of Science topics such as Human Eye and Sources of Energy along with dropping of a different genre of writing like Article and Report Writing, Letter to the Editor and Application for Jobs from English Core subjects among other things.On Tuesday, the board said schools could ensure the reduced topics could be explained to students to understand other concepts. However, students would not be evaluated on those topics in the 2020-21 examinations.To this, Sisodia said, “Asking the heads of schools and teachers to cover those topics while explicitly saying these will not be part of internal or year-end board exams is not enough as it is well known that evaluation drives the teaching-learning in class. Hence, for all practical purpose these topics are unlikely to be covered.”Calls and texts to the CBSE officials for a response were not answered. Earlier on Wednesday, the board clarified that topics removed from the syllabi were either being covered by a rationalised syllabus or were included in the Alternative Academic Calendar of NCERT, which prescribes a list of activities for students with specific learning outcomes.“Since the syllabus reduction came so late, we have already covered a lot of removed topics in the online classes. Teachers are currently busy analysing the syllabus and deciding on how they will be taught. The reduction in the syllabus will also affect the paper pattern during the assessment and we are keeping that in mind as well,” said the head of a government school in Dwarka, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/support-syllabus-cut-but-cbse-must-say-how-deleted-topics-were-chosen-sisodia/story-4a2k5PlHV9wB8h5uNZfnJJ.html

The SIT chargesheet, submitted in the court of Faridkot judicial magistrate Chetan Sharma, says that some dera followers arrested in connection with sacrilege revealed that Mohinderpal Singh Bittu, who was killed in a Nabha jail in 2019, told them that the sacrilege was executed at the behest of the dera chief. “During a diwan (religious congregation) in on March 22, 2015, Harjinder Singh Manjhi, a Sikh preacher, asked some dera followers to remove their lockets or leave. Bittu raised the issue with dera’s now absconding national committee members — Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri — who saw it as an act of sacrilege and decided to take revenge. The sacrilege conspiracy was hatched thereafter,” the document reads. Arrest warrants against dera’s 3 national committee membersA Faridkot court on Wednesday issued arrest warrants against the three absconding members of the dera’s national committee after the Khatra-led SIT named them as accused in a case of the theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in the district. The SIT had filed an application in the court seeking arrest warrants of three Haryana residents — Sandeep Bareta of Bareta Mandi, Pardeep Kler of Kalait village and Harsh Dhuri of Dhuri. Judicial magistrate Suresh Kumar issued arrest warrants of the trio. The three were also named in the Malke and Gurusar cases. Torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib were found at Malke village in Moga district in November 2015 and Gurusar (Bhagta) village in Bathinda district in October 2015. The SIT claims that the instructions to execute the theft of Guru Granth Sahib were given by the three. “The trio directed dera’s state committee member Mohinder Pal Bittu to steal the bir,” claims SIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sacrilege-done-to-avenge-insult-of-dera-men-by-a-sikh-preacher-khatra-led-sit-in-chargesheet/story-WK7RKRoY21qlm7iP7SVCbI.html

We pay our homage to this great warrior (sic),” the Delhi Police tweeted from their official handle on Wednesday.According to his family, “I am having breathing problem but will recover and return home soon,” were his last words to his family during their 90-second video conversation on July 6, a day before he succumbed to Covid-19 at Park Hospital. “When I asked my son about his health, he said he was having breathlessness and was on oxygen support. I asked him to do yoga for enhancing his immunity. Knowing that we all were worried, he tried to comfort us by saying that he will recover and return home. But he is gone now and will never return,” said Yoginder’s father Jagdish Prasad Yadav, who retired from the police force in 2017 as an assistant sub-inspector (ASI).According to Yadav, his son was put on a ventilator support a few hours after their last conversation on July 6. The next day around 3 pm, he died during treatment.“The constable used to visit our hospital for liver disease treatment. On June 12, he was admitted with chronic liver ailment. He was later tested positive for Covid-19 and died on July 7,” said Dr. Rekha Gupta, medical superintendent of Park Hospital. Following the protocols for cremating Covid-19 patients, the constable’s last rites were performed the same day at the Uttam Nagar crematorium in the presence of his family members and police officials, said deputy commissioner of police (outer) A Koan.DCP Koan said that Yoginder had joined the Delhi Police as a constable in 2003 and was posted in Paschim Vihar West police station since January 2019. He is survived by his parents, wife, two children – a 14-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter – and two siblings. The family lives in police colony Paschim Vihar. The family originally belongs to Haryana’s Mahendragarh.So far, 12 officers of the Delhi Police, including a decorated inspector of the special cell, Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, have succumbed to Covid-19. However, over 22,000 personnel have tested positive for the infection, more than 1,400 have recovered from the viral infection and resumed their duties so far, a Delhi Police spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/constable-12th-policeman-to-succumb-to-covid-19-in-delhi/story-CVD53nlTZ22JvyQFCfzXsI.html

For more than a week, the daily Covid-19 deaths in Delhi have been ranging between 50 and 60.“To take all possible measures to further reduce deaths due to Covid-19, the chief minister has sought a detailed report from the Delhi government’s health secretary on the factors responsible for Covid-19 deaths in the city,” a government statement read.Delhi’s present fatality rate is 3.1%, which is higher than the national average of 2.8%. A total of 104,864 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Delhi till now, which includes 78,199 recoveries and 3,213 deaths.“The detailed analytical report on Covid-19 related deaths in Delhi will aid the implementation of more stringent measures to reduce deaths.

This will ascertain the cause of the deaths,” the government said.The death rate in Delhi has seen a decline since June, government officials said on Wednesday, with the number of fatalities falling to around 50-60 every day.The chief minister’s office said various measures taken by the Delhi government, such as increasing the number of ICU beds in hospitals, installation of more oxygen beds, plasma bank and so on, had reduced the death and positivity rates. Delhi at present has 1,995 ICU beds, government records showed.“To bring the death rate to zero, the Delhi government will prepare further steps to be taken after obtaining a detailed analysis of Covid-19 deaths from the health secretary,” the government’s statement said.Principal secretary (health and family welfare) Vikram Dev Dutt said he will soon prepare and submit a detailed analysis of Covid-related deaths so the Delhi government can execute further measures to reduce the fatality rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-seeks-report-on-covid-deaths/story-GP9MJL1sF658HkCXwAVJlL.html
08-07-2020||Chandigarh||CABINET DECISIONS: Punjab CM to review state’s fiscal health on monthly basis||With Punjab’s revenue receipts falling by 21% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday announced to undertake monthly review of the fiscal situation of the state.The decision was taken at the cabinet meeting, in which the CM said the financial support was not forthcoming from the Centre. He agreed to finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal’s suggestion to draw short-term financial plans on quarterly basis in view of the critical situation since the beginning of this fiscal, on account of the Covid outbreak and the prolonged lockdown.Manpreet warned that faced with its own revenue shortfall, the Government of India was likely to pull back finances even further from states in the coming quarter. The funds expected from the Centre in the first quarter had not come, thus leaving the state government struggling to cope, he said. Earlier, highlighting the grim fiscal situation prevailing in the state, principal secretary (finance) KAP Sinha said as of June 30, the share of central taxes for Punjab had gone down by 32%. The grant-in-aid from the Centre for the March-June period showed an increase of 38%, but that was mainly on account of the GST receipt of Rs 3,070 crore received in April, which included Rs 2,366.46 crore against pending arrears for 2019-20.While state’s own tax revenue fell by 51%, the first quarter decline in the state’s non-tax revenue stood at 68%, Sinha informed the cabinet, adding that more prudent measures would need to be taken to survive the current crisis.MUTATION FEE DOUBLEDIn a bid to mobilise additional revenue, the cabinet gave the go-ahead to increase the mutation fee from Rs 300 to Rs 600 and the decision would help add nearly Rs 10 crore to the state exchequer.The CM also asked the revenue department to launch a special campaign for clearing all pending mutations in the interest of landowners.According to a spokesperson of the chief minister’s office, the fees set by government for revenue collection is very low in today’s high currency environment and the mutation fees was last increase in October 2012, when it went up from Rs 150 to Rs 300.Earlier, the Cabinet also reviewed the Covid situation in the state, with the chief minister appealing to all to be extra cautious in view of the increasing number of cases. The state government’s expert health advisor Dr KK Talwar said the next four weeks were critical and every individual would have to take full precautions for their own safety and the safety of otherThe cabinet also approved increase in the number of attempts for candidates belonging to ex-servicemen category in the Punjab State Civil Services combined competitive examination.NOD TO TWO NEW INDUSTRIAL PARKSThe cbinet approved setting up of a Modern Industrial Park and Integrated Manufacturing Cluster over an area of 2,000 acres on government and panchayat land near Mattewara (Ludhiana) and Rajpura in Patiala district, respectively, at a total cost of Rs 3,200 crore. To be set up at a cost of Rs 1,600 crore each, the projects will cater to the needs of prospective entrepreneurs/industrialists for setting up their ventures expeditiously, in line with the urgent need to develop such industrial/economic hubs in the state. The panchayat land for the said projects would be purchased by the Housing and Urban Development Department, for development as mixed land use/industrial park/IMC.The ambitious Mattewara project had been envisioned and pursued by the industries department, and land of government departments would be taken over by the Housing and Urban Development Department under OUVGL. The project site had been under active consideration of the state government for past several years, and it was originally conceived and constantly pursued by the Industries department. However, considering the capacity of Housing and Urban Development to raise finance and execute the project of such scale, the same was transferred to it.The integrated manufacturing cluster (IMC) near Rajpura would be developed with the assistance of National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation on 1,000 acres of government and panchayat land.SCHOOL FEE: AG ASKED TO FILE LPAThe Punjab government will file a letters patent appeal (LPA) in the Punjab and Haryana high court this week against the decision of a single-judge bench in the matter of payment of school fee during the lockdown period.The issue came up for discussion informally during the cabinet meeting after which the CM said the LPA should be filed in the HC this week, advocate general Atul Nanda said later.On June 30, a single-judge bench of the high court ruled that all the schools were entitled to collect tuition fee irrespective of offering online classes during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cabinet-decisions-punjab-cm-to-review-state-s-fiscal-health-on-monthly-basis/story-xWsN5iV3QsREJ4SX9i3IPN.html

08-07-2020||Delhi||Baijal, Kejriwal inaugurate 500-bed Covid care centre at CWG campus||In a bid to enhance Delhi’s medical infrastructure to fight the coronavirus disease, lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday inaugurated a 500-bedded Covid care centre at the Commonwealth Games (CWG) complex in East Delhi. Kejriwal and Baijal inaugurated the facility through video-conferencing in the presence of deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and officials from the east district administration. The facility was set up by the Delhi government’s east district administration in a record six days, the government said in a statement. The 500-bedded care centre was made operational from Wednesday and has been attached to Delhi government’s Lok Nayak Hospital. A team of 80 doctors and 150 nurses has been stationed at the new facility by the NGO ‘Doctors For You’ for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “I am happy that the facility was built in just six days with the district administration’s efforts. Lok Nayak hospital earlier had 2,000 beds, then 100 beds were added through Shehnai Banquet and now, 500 beds have been added through this facility, which makes it a total of 2,600 beds that are serviced by this hospital,” Kejriwal said during the video conference.Looking back at the days gone by, Kejriwal said all the preparations done by the Delhi government during the lockdown fell short eventually when the cases started surging.“We lifted the lockdown on June 1. During the lockdown, the level of Covid management in Delhi was remarkable. We had anticipated a surge in the number of Covid cases after lifting of the lockdown, but this surge was unexpected. All our preparations we did during the lockdown fell short after we lifted it. Now, the situation in Delhi is under control,” he said.The chief minister assured that the Covid situation in Delhi was “much better now” and that there was no shortage of beds at present.“But this does not mean we do not take steps any further to tackle the surge. We have to learn from our past experiences and prepare for the future so that if there is a spike in Corona cases, there should be no shortage of medical facilities. There has been a massive expansion of Covid infrastructure in Delhi in terms of beds and other facilities, be it Covid centres or Covid hospitals,” Kejriwal said.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the residential quarters had also been readied in the CWG campus for medical professionals to stay. The facility has been jointly readied by the east district administration team, the health department, and the NGO ‘Doctors For You’.“If the condition of a patient gets serious, he/she will be transferred from the general ward to the high dependency unit (HDU), and if no improvement is noticed, he/she will be taken to LN Hospital,” Sisodia said.The newly set up Covid care centre in the CWG stadium is equipped with CCTV cameras, arrangements for food for up to 700 people and ambulances for taking serious patients to LN Hospital. Apart from specialists and doctors, mental health counsellors have been deployed. Patients will have access to leisure activities such as books or board games.This facility is equipped with separate beds for men and women. Out of the 500 total beds, 350 beds are reserved for men and 100 beds for women. The remaining 50 beds have been reserved for patients with critical conditions, and have attached oxygen supply with them. Sisodia, who visited the facility to review its preparedness, said patients will start coming from Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/baijal-kejriwal-inaugurate-500-bed-covid-care-centre-at-cwg-campus/story-YsfKg4jq0DBCy05F8QLkYK.html
08-07-2020||Delhi||Stricter surveillance for places that record isolated Covid cases||The Delhi health department on Wednesday issued fresh directions according to which neighbourhoods where isolated Covid-19 cases are recorded on-and-off for a period of 28 days will be put under stricter surveillance by district officials.A standard operating procedure (SOP) attached with Wednesday’s order, which HT has seen, require districts to prepare lists of high-risk groups and special surveillance groups in areas that have witnessed isolated Covid-19 cases in any frequency for 28 days.The high-risk groups include people aged over 60 years, pregnant women and those with comorbidities, much like a protocol that was earlier drafted for prioritising containment zone residents for rapid antigen tests. People belonging to high-risk groups have to be screened and their health records fed into a database, the order said.Health officers are required to regularly check on the high-risk groups in the localities recording isolated Covid cases and maintain a record of each visit or call, the SOP said.According to the order, special surveillance groups include domestic workers, self-employed individuals such as plumbers, mechanics, etc, daily essential suppliers, auto-rickshaw drivers and transporters operating in the locality concerned. All individuals belonging to the special surveillance groups also have to be screened and their health records fed into a separate database.If any of the individuals belonging to the special surveillance groups is found Covid-19 positive, a system has to be set up to enable contract tracing of all people in the neighbourhood who have come in contact with the patient and assign them 15-day home isolation.The directions were issued as a modification to the revised Covid response plan for Delhi that was notified through an order issued on June 22, incorporating a bunch of Covid management strategies recommended by Union home minister Amit Shah, which included delineation of containment zones in Delhi, health survey of residents, improving contact tracing and a sero-survey for the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stricter-surveillance-for-places-that-record-isolated-covid-cases/story-i5Zbji9cO6LcQtZyAXyDpM.html
08-07-2020||Dehradun||Iconic Bougainvillea-Devdar tree ‘beautiful love affair’ duo collapses due to heavy rains||The residents of Uttarakhand’s picturesque hill town of Almora woke up to a disheartening sight after famous 40 feet high Bougainvillea tree and its supporting Devdar tree collapsed due to overnight heavy rains on Wednesday morning. The Bougainville tree which was about 30-years old had grown over a century old Devdar tree near GB Pant Park in Almora’s Chaughanpata area.The two trees often termed by local as a ‘beautiful love affair’ had become the identity of Almora and emerged as a very popular tourist destination.Ever since the news broke out that the two iconic trees had collapsed, locals started gathering at the spot for a last glimpse. Nitin Singh Bhadauria, district magistrate Almora termed the incident as a “big loss for the region as it had become a part of everyone’s life.”“The incident happened at around 7 in the morning. The beautiful Bougainvillea tree which was about 30-years-old had grown over the Devdar tree which was more than 100-years-old and from the British era. Due to the heavy rains, the latter collapsed on the ground taking down the Bougainvillea along with it,” said Bhadauria. The DM said ‘fortunately there was no loss of property or life in the incident.’“But, it’s like the soul of the city has died. There will always be a sense of emptiness whenever anyone will pass from that spot. As of now, local authorities are trying to clear the road by removing the fallen trees from the road. A large number of locals have gathered there to have one last glimpse of the two trees which were the identity of Almora,” he said. The locals gathered at the spot were quietly witnessing the clearing of collapsed trees from the road, mourning the loss.“Locals called it a beautiful love affair between two trees. They were dear to every single soul living in Almora. The spot was like a landmark of the city but now when they are no more, it’s like a family member has passed away,” said Paritosh Joshi a resident of Almora. Another local Hemendra Chauhan said, “The void created by the loss will never be filled. We all have memories with them from our childhood ““The century-old Devdar tree was fully covered in the flowers of the Bougainvillea. It was so popular that if you Google Almora, you will definitely see pictures of the two in full bloom,” said Chauhan. Considering the significance of the trees, the district administration said it will try to ‘at least restore the Bougainvillea tree there.’DM Bhadauria said, “We are in talks with GB Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment (NIHE) and Vivekananda Parvatiya Krishi Anusandhan Sansthan based in Almora for their expertise in restoring the Bougainvillea tree which still has its roots intact in the ground. We are hopeful it will re-grow to its size in 3-4 years. However, as the Devdar tree has completely collapsed, we will see what could be done with it.”RS Rawal, director of GB Pant NIHE confirmed that the Bougainvillea tree ‘could be restored but there will be issues with its support system.’“Bougainvillea being a hard species can re-grow if its roots are intact. However, in this case, there will be an issue of providing a support base like the now collapsed Devdar tree. I have not visited the spot yet but will need to first analyse the remaining condition of the Bougainvillea before saying to what extent it could re-grow,” said Rawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/iconin-bougainvillea-devdar-tree-beautiful-love-affair-duo-collapses-due-to-heavy-rains/story-obzJJ1bTL9HznkRmSvrLnI.html

The coronavirus count of the district went up from 115 on June 8 to 593 on July 7. The district, which now has 126 active cases, reported its first death on June 10 even as the state had witnessed 175 fatalities till July 7. In the past one month, the district went on to attain 9.14% share of the state’s death tally.

Swaranjit Singh, a member of the Punjab Paramedical and Health Employees Front, said cases are increasing due to the poor healthcare infrastructure. “Though the current testing ratio is satisfactory, it was not the case earlier. Also, people are avoiding getting their test done due to shortage of isolation facilities,” he added. Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir said, “There is no community transmission in the district. We are tracing all contacts of Covid patients. Malerkotla is the worst hit area but we have deployed senior officials to monitor the situation.

08-07-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan gets 9 mn acre-foot Ravi, Beas water, highest in 5 years||Rajasthan received 9.051 million acre-foot (MAF) Ravi, Beas water this year, which is highest in last five years, said officials. One acre-foot is equal to water in a football field with a depth of one foot. The state receives its share of water from Ravi and Beas rivers through Rajasthan Feeder and Bikaner Canal. Rajasthan Feeder off-takes from Harike headworks in Punjab and provides water to Indira Gandhi Nahar Project (IGNP), which serves the command lying in western Rajasthan.Ten districts, including major cities such as Jodhpur, Bikaner and Jaisalmer, are totally dependent on the IGNP for drinking water. The Bikaner canal off-takes from tail of Ferozepur feeder which in turns off-takes from Harike headworks and serves the command lying in Sriganganagar district.Ravi-Beas water was allocated to Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and J&K by an interstate agreement signed on December 31, 1981. Rajasthan has been allocated 1.11 MAF pre-partition share and 8.60 MAF surplus water.“As per the agreement, pre-partition share remains fixed but availability of surplus water varies every year. In case of any variation in availability of surplus water in any year, the share of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana is changed on pro-rata basis,” said water resources department secretary Naveen Mahajan.He said Rajasthan has share of water in Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers through various interstate agreements. Western districts of Rajasthan are solely dependent on this water.The Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) regulates and distributes interstate water among the partner states.At the 235th meeting of BBMB on July 7, Rajasthan raised the issue of short supply this year through the Bhakra Main Line (BML) via Haryana.Mahajan, who is a member in the board from Rajasthan, said Rajasthan raised the matter of short supply by Haryana to Rajasthan through BML. Haryana also raised the matter of short supply and conveyed to the Board that Punjab was continuously giving short supply at Haryana Contact Point to the tune of 200 to 1000 cusecs.“We told the Board that there was resentment in the farmers due to short and erratic supplies,” said the WRD secretary. “We requested the BBMB that if there was short supply, the water should be distributed proportionately between Rajasthan and Haryana.”BBMB has divided year into two parts – filling period from May 21 to September 20, and depletion period from September 21 to May 20. Water accounts are maintained separately for each period.Rajasthan requested the Board that during the current filling period Haryana has received 7.43% short supply; and it transferred shortage at an average of 37.15% to Rajasthan. It means whatever short supply has been received to Haryana, all has been passed to Rajasthan.The BBMB chairman ordered setting up of a committee of chief engineers of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana to resolve this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-gets-9-mn-acre-foot-ravi-beas-water-highest-in-5-years/story-axXpspUGuTafni6pLqQANN.html
08-07-2020||City||Banquet halls suitable for Covid care facilities: Delhi govt tells high court||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Wednesday told the Delhi High Court that banquet halls are among the most suitable premises to serve as extended Covid care centres as they are permanent roofed structures of large size that are already fitted with air-conditioning, kitchens, washrooms and other basic amenities.The government said it was correct in attaching banquet halls as Covid care centres as the number of cases is increasing in the city every day and at this rate, the total count could go up to 5,50,000 by the end of August.Justice Jayanth Nath, who was hearing a bunch of pleas challenging the state government’s decision to take over banquet halls and use them for mild or asymptomatic patients, was told by the government that these facilities are preferable over other premises such as stadiums and railway coaches, which lack these infrastructure advantages for use as extended Covid hospitals and care centres.The Delhi government initially plans to use eight banquet halls as Covid care facilities and make space for at least over 1,100 beds in such spaces across the city. These eight are part of the 77 banquet halls that have been identified and requisitioned by the government, which will be used on a need basis.In an affidavit, the Delhi government told the court that the problem of increasing Covid-19 cases was compounded by the partial roll-back of the lockdown. It said due to the absence of targeted measures, it may not be possible to exit the lockdown completely even in the medium to long term.Appearing for one of the banquet halls, its counsel Sandeep Agarwal told the court that these units are not like the hotels where there are separate facilities as well as a common area for people to move around. He said the ceilings of banquet halls are higher and are not feasible to be converted into Covid care centres. Advocate Sachin Chopra, appearing for another petitioner, said all banquet halls are centrally air-conditioned and cannot be used for patients as it can aggravate the spread of the virus. He said 30,000 beds are already vacant and available with the Delhi government, which still wants to take over the banquet halls.Chopra said 63,000 patients had already been discharged and migrated and hence there is no need for more beds. Following the arguments, the court posted the matter for further hearing on July 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/banquet-halls-suitable-for-covid-care-facilities-delhi-govt-tells-high-court/story-67SIw5bF2m4fYuvZFfG2rK.html
08-07-2020||Delhi||Lack of identity proof deprives homeless and mentally ill of Covid tests||The Delhi government’s Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS) is facing a major hurdle while trying to get homeless people with mental health issues tested for Covid-19—their lack of identity proof. According to a June 22 Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) order based on Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, proof of identity and a contact number are mandatory for a Covid-19 test to be administered—both by the RT-PCR and rapid antigen methods—to a patient.IHBAS has requested both the Centre and Delhi government to modify the testing guidelines. Dr Nimesh Desai, the director of IHBAS, said that the present norms of Covid-19 testing are not only depriving homeless people with mental health issues of timely and proper medical care, they are also posing a risk to health care workers at the institute.“Of the 25 homeless people with mental health illnesses brought to the institute in the past three months, we could get just four tested for Covid-19 because we found their relatives who then furnished the requisite papers. Of the four, three tested positive. We can’t get the others tested—these people don’t even remember their names,” Dr Desai said.The institute has created an isolation ward where such persons are kept under observation for 14 days or until they can be tested. “It is creating a difficult situation for us. Without a test, we can’t get them admitted to a Covid-19 hospital. Nearly 40 members of my staff (doctors, nurses and attendants) and 10 patients have tested positive for Covid-19 so far,” he said.In an order dated June 22, chief secretary Vijay Dev, who is also the chairperson of the state executive committee of DDMA, had directed all testing labs and authorities to ensure that a person has a government-issued identity card and functional mobile number before a test could be conducted for Covid-19.“The mobile number furnished (by the person who is getting the test done) is tested to be functional and correct through a missed call…The testing labs/authorities concerned shall be held responsible if the person tested is untraceable…,” the order read.Dr Desai said that he had raised the matter with the Centre, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Delhi government, as well as requested it to take it up with the Centre. “There should be clear guidelines about Covid-19 tests for homeless people who don’t have valid identity proofs and contact numbers. We do understand that the directions issued by the chief secretary are in accordance with ICMR guidelines. We have requested the government to take up the matter with the Centre, as the issue needs to be reviewed and sorted out by ICMR and the central government.”Indu Prakash, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee for homeless shelters in Delhi, said that the concern raised by IHBAS is valid. “Though we have tried to get Aadhaar cards and voter IDs made for a lot of homeless people, those who don’t have them shouldn’t be deprived of medical treatment for the contagious disease. They have a right to proper medical care during this pandemic, even if they don’t have an identity card.”An ICMR official said, “The ICMR form doesn’t mandatorily require an individual’s phone number or address at the time of sample collection; they are required for the RT-PCR app for the state to conduct surveillance.”However, a senior Delhi government official with the health department put the onus of responsibility back on ICMR’s shoulders and said, “We have received the letter from the IHBAS director regarding the problem they’ve been facing while getting the test administered to homeless persons with mental health issues. We are writing to ICMR in this regard. It is ICMR which has made the RT-PCR app mandatory so we have no option but to ask for the contact numbers and identity proofs before testing for Covid-19.” The Delhi government spokesperson didn’t not comment on the issue. Meanwhile, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Delhi High Court by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal on June 22 seeking directions to the Centre and the Delhi government to issue guidelines for the Covid-19 testing of homeless people with mental health issues in the Capital. The court had directed the Centre and the state government to file their reply in the matter, which is listed for a hearing on July 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lack-of-identity-proof-deprives-homeless-and-mentally-ill-of-covid-tests/story-OavuyjkOiowvkLVOiYiNNK.html

08-07-2020||City||Homeless left to fend for themselves as free meals during lockdown period discontinued||New Delhi: The free meal scheme for marginalised occupants of government night shelter homes has been discontinued since July 1 after the relaxation of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions in the capital, forcing its occupants to look for alternative arrangements, including stepping out to beg for food or looking for menial jobs..Hundreds of homeless people lived in more than 230 Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) night shelters. Before the Covid-19 crisis struck in March, there was no provision for meals to residents of these shelters.Azad Singh, 68, a resident of a shelter at Yamuna Bazaar, said he and his friends were dependent on alms provided by people in nearby temples and gurudwaras before the lockdown, as they were too old to find work.“With the free meal system closed, we have to step out once again and arrange for food. Even if there are donations outsides the few temples and gurudwaras that are open, the place would be crowded and we run the risk of contracting the virus.” Singh said, adding he hoped the free meal scheme would resume.Singh often brings food for his fellow occupant Suresh Rikki, 84, who doesn’t know where his next meal will come from these days. “I went to sleep on an empty stomach last Thursday – the first day we didn’t get food at the shelter,” he said. “Since Friday, I am relying on locals and other residents who bring me food sometimes.”Due to the Covid-19 crisis and the subsequent loss of employment, many daily wage labourers, homeless population and people living on the streets relied on these shelters to get cooked meals. The Delhi government had provided cooked food twice daily through the network of Hunger Relief Centres to an average of 10 lakh beneficiaries per day for almost two months. Activists have raised their voices against the discontinuation of free meals at these shelters. “Until and unless work resumes completely and their livelihood is secure, these people should be provided food because they don’t have any social security. Most vulnerable are children, women, elderly, and the disabled. These are the people who don’t protest for their rights and we must take care of them,” said Indu Prakash Singh, member of the State Level Shelter Monitoring Committee.Rakesh Kumar, member of the non-governmental organisation, Society For Promotion of Youth and Masses (SPYM), which runs a night shelter at Sarai Kale Khan, said most people in shelter homes cook food on their own. “Only a few are dependent on the free meal scheme. For them, it is a problem because there is not much work. Most of them are daily wage labourers and expressed their disappointment when the scheme was discontinued.”Kumar’s NGO had been preparing food for children at the Sarai Kale Khan shelter and for those who require extra care at the recovery shelter home in the premises before lockdown as well. “During the lockdown, we were preparing meals for around 1,000 people since we had to feed everyone. Now, the number has gone down to 150,” he said.Savita Topno, 35, a resident at the Sarai Kale Khan shelter, had come to Delhi from her village in Jharkhand only a year ago with her husband looking for work. The Covid-19 crisis and the discontinuation of the free meal scheme have caused difficulties for the family.“My husband is a daily wage labourer. He went to work on Friday after four days. We had little money and managed to buy some supplies to cook food since. There is no certainty about the coming days. Many are begging for food outside,” she said.NH Sharma, Director, Night shelter, DUSIB, said, “The arrangement had started March 22 onwards and was till the ‘lockdown’ period ends. The National Urban Livelihoods Mission’s March 28 notification from the central government clearly stated free meals to be provided in all shelters across the country for the ‘lockdown’ period.”Despite repeated requests through call and messages, Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/homeless-left-to-fend-for-themselves-as-free-meals-during-lockdown-period-discontinued/story-qBbtOXZGo7UMljZL0ndgUO.html

Additional chief secretary (health) RD Dhiman confirmed that the state plans to bring in an ordinance to impose penalties on those violating guidelines.“The work on preparing a draft is in process and the same is likely to be placed in the cabinet meeting slated for July 10,” said Dhiman.Dhiman said that it has been noticed that the people were not paying heed to health guidelines, though the pandemic was far from over. “Ever since Unlock Phase-2 has been implemented, people are behaving in an irresponsible manner by not wearing masks and flouting social distancing norms,” he said. Wearing facemask and maintaining social distance has been made mandatory through orders issued by the government from time-to-time under Epidemic Disease Act or Disaster Management Act, he said. The ordinance will confer special powers on the administration and anyone violating the norms will be penalised and punishedSources say the monetary fine may begin from ₹100 for first time violations and then go up for every repeated violation. In case of default in payment of the penalties,violators could land in jail or be slapped with a heavy penalty or both.Spitting in public places will also invite a heavy penalty or jail. Fine may also be imposed if shopkeepers sell items to a person not wearing a mask. Not maintaining social distancing will also attract monetary fine, he said. STRICT MONITORING ON BORDERSThe government will also keep a strict vigil on borders to discourage weekend tourism. Tourists entering the state must have at least a five-day valid booking in a hotel and a Covid-19 negative report from an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved lab is also mandatory.Tourists will not be allowed to make short visits. Last week, some tourists from Punjab managed to enter the state after misleading cops at the border and they returned same day after merry making at Kasauli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-people-flouting-covid-19-norms-himachal-govt-mulls-over-enforcing-ordinance/story-Fg20e0cFLh8WnFDbVrOVuJ.html
08-07-2020||City||Delhi: Bootlegger straps 100 alcohol bottles inside jacket, arrested||New Delhi: An alleged bootlegger, who taped 100 bottles of illicit liquor to the inside of his jacket, and another who hid 18 cartons below a pile of garbage on a cart to smuggle them from Haryana to outer Delhi, were caught within hours of each other on Tuesday after police found the clothes of the first one to be “odd” and the presence of the second to be “suspicious”.The first suspect was identified as 20-year-old Ishu, who was caught from outer Delhi’s Mundka Tuesday afternoon after a police personnel noticed him wearing a heavy jacket despite the sweltering heat, said A Koan, deputy commissioner of police (outer). Another investigator, on condition of anonymity, said that not only was his choice of dressing odd for the weather, his torso also looked unusually fat for a man with a lean face.“A policeman who noticed these odd signs stopped him for a casual checking. When he asked him to take off his inside jacket, he was found to be wearing another half-sleeved jacket inside that resembled a bullet-proof vest,” said the investigator mentioned above.The inner jacket was found to have a total of 100 quarter bottles of illicit liquor stuck using tape, added the investigator.Ishu allegedly turned out to be a bootlegger who would make five such trips from Haryana to Delhi to smuggle in country made liquor using this modus operandi. “Since the checking of the vehicles along the border has been strict in the recent past, Ishu was using the bylanes on the border to bring in the liquor,” said the officer.The other suspect was caught in the evening in the jurisdiction of the same police station. The DCP identified him as Jagmohan Shakya, also allegedly a regular bootlegger.“He had placed 18 cartons of illicit liquor bottles under a pile of garbage on a cart and was riding it into Delhi. A policeman noticed him and found it suspicious that he was plying the garbage cart in the evening when garbage collection is usually done in the morning in that neighborhood,” said the investigator quoted above.When questioned casually by the policeman, Shakya said he belonged to Nihal Vihar. “It was surprising that a man from Nihal Vihar was picking garbage at the far away Tigri Border,” the officer said, adding that it was around that time that the policeman noticed some cartons below the garbage.Both the men have been arrested and the sources of the recovered illicit liquor are being probed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-bootlegger-straps-100-alcohol-bottles-inside-jacket-arrested/story-ixDsuF7a5XjOJtjvMcPoFK.html
08-07-2020||City||Delhi: EDMC demolishes encroachments in East Laxmi Market, residents question timing of move||New Delhi: The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Wednesday demolished temporary and permanent encroachments in the East Laxmi Market near Chitra Vihar in the eastern part of the city. Officials of the EDMC said the drive was started Monday in light of directions of the Delhi High Court to remove encroachment on the service road alongside the nullah road, which is also known as the Master Plan Road, in the area.The action was taken after the high court gave an ultimatum to the civic body to remove encroachment and clear the road’s right of way (ROW) before August 17, 2020. According to EDMC officials, the matter pertaining to construction of houses on the service lane along the nullah road in east Delhi had been going on in the high court since 2011 and those who had encroached upon the service road were also given proper hearing. Residents — many of them are sanitation workers — however, alleged the demolition was carried out without giving them an opportunity to remove their belongings. They described the move as “inhumane” and tried to stage a protest but the police foiled their bid.“I had been living here for the past seven years but all this time no one came to tell us about irregularities. Then one fine day, they come with bulldozers and demolish our houses. Where will we go now in times of coronavirus? It is inhumane,” Santoshi Devi, whose house was demolished, alleged.Jeevanram Valmiki, another person whose accommodation was demolished, questioned the timing of the drive. “Why did the civic body let the service road get encroached in the first place? Why did they not nip it in the bud? The EDMC could have waited for the demolition drive till the pandemic gets over. Forget about social distancing, we are literally on the road. Now we have no other place to go and have no idea how we’ll survive. The government should make some arrangements to rehabilitate us.”A senior EDMC official said the service road alongside ‘nullah road’— which connects the East Laxmi Market with Pushta Road — converts into a dead-end near Chitra Vihar, hence people “mostly from lower-income groups” encroached upon the stretch and slowly built houses. “In 2011, residents of the East Laxmi Market area had approached the high court against the encroachment on the service road. In 2015, the court had ordered the demolition of permanent structures on the stretch. Later, in 2016, the other party also approached the high court against the order, after which the court gave them the liberty to prove their ownership to the property in the lower court. The lower court, however, dismissed the case as the encroachers could not prove their point. So again in January 2020, the high court asked the EDMC, the Public Works Department (PWD) and the police to remove this encroachment and submit a report by August 17, 2020. Now we are complying with the order and hence launched the demolition exercise,” an EDMC spokesperson said.He said nearly 56 houses were to be demolished and that the action has now been completed. He said that prior notices were given to each occupant to vacate houses before the demolition drive.Sanjay Gehlot, chairman, Delhi Safai Karmachari Ayog, also demanded that the “victims” of the demolition drive be rehabilitated as many of them are sanitation workers. “This was a mixed population area and was majorly a Valmiki Colony. Many residents are sanitation workers. Sanitation workers are playing a major role in fighting Covid-19; the authorities should have waited till the pandemic was over. I have written to the chief minister to rehabilitate these victims of the demolition drive. For the time being, arrangements are being made to shift them to a nearby MCD school,” Gehlot said.Residents are now planning to move the high court for rehabilitation. “They have no place to live especially in times of Covid-19 crisis. Tomorrow (Thursday) residents will move the high court seeking their rehabilitation,” Dev Pal, a field researcher of housing and land rights network, said. Pal is assisting the residents with legal remedies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-edmc-demolishes-encroachments-in-east-laxmi-market-residents-question-timing-of-move/story-0U8m60PmMfrTMkcckEcctM.html

He was interacting with anganwari workers from different parts of the state through video-conference. Appreciating the workers’ role amid the Covid-19 crisis, he said anganwari workers had ensured that Covid-19 does not spread at community level. “Anganwari workers have played a commendable role in making the ‘Nigah’ programme of the state government a success and ensuring that persons under home quarantine do not violate guidelines,” he said. ACTIVE CASE FINDING CAMPAIGN Thakur said the ‘active case finding campaign’ launched by the state government was also appreciated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The PM also advised CMs of other states to take up this campaign in their respective states. Around 70 lakh people are covered under this mega campaign. It was due to this campaign that the state was able to collect a sound database of people with influenza-like symptoms,” the CM said, adding that around 4,021 anganwari workers were involved in the active case finding campaign and 4,083 were involved in the cluster containment survey. He said the workers had prepared and distributed about 5.68 lakh masks to the people.The CM said that the government had launched several schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, Mukhya Mantri Kanya Daan Yojana, Mother Teresa Asahay Matri Sambal Yojana, Beti Hai Anmol Yojana and Beti Padhao Beti Bachao to ensure women welfare and empowerment. The state government has provided smart phones to the Anganwari workers for their effective functioning. He particularly appreciated the anganwari workers of Hamirpur district for preparing creative masks and face shields. Jai Ram Thakur said that keeping in view the commendable services rendered by the Anganwari workers, the state government has increased the honorarium of anganwari workers by Rs 500 per month and that of mini-anganwari workers and anganwari helpers by Rs. 300 per month. He said that now anganwari workers are getting Rs 6,800 per month instead of Rs 6,300 whereas mini-anganwari workers are getting Rs 4,900 instead of Rs 4,600 and anganwari helpers are receiving Rs 3,500 per month instead of Rs 3,200..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-has-alloted-rs-587-crore-to-woman-child-welfare-cm/story-nBu2x31OwAPIkmgNDnfuvI.html

Jain said all dues had been cleared by the Delhi government and asked the Delhi government counsel to file a response to the submissions made by the civic body.The bench made it clear that it was only dealing with the non-payment of salaries of resident doctors of hospitals run by the corporation and not all its doctors and other employees.In its status report, filed in response to the plea that the court has initiated, the corporation said salaries for March and April months of all resident doctors in hospitals run by the civic body had been paid. The corporation also said that salaries for the month of March of all of its regular doctors had also been paid.It said because of non-release of the requisite amount by the Delhi government, the corporation has been unable to release salaries of its doctors in time. The Delhi government in its status report said it had released Rs 8 crore to the corporation, as directed by the court, for payment of the April salary of resident doctors. It said paying salaries of doctors and other employees of the corporation was the sole responsibility of the civic body and the Delhi government only releases funds which it is obliged to as per budget estimates of the financial year.The government said the urban development department had released the first instalment of the funds allocated to the north and south MCDs under the basic tax assignment. It said Rs 212.53 crore had been released to north MCD and Rs 112.62 to south MCD.The state government said its education department had already released Rs 147.50 crore to north MCD, Rs 97.50 crore to south MCD and Rs 75 crore to east MCD as grant-in-aid for the current financial year.Besides that, its revenue department had released Rs 33.65 crore to north MCD, Rs 48.02 crore to south MCD and Rs 11.40 crore to east MCD in the current financial year, the Delhi government said in its report.The matter would be now heard on July 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-mcd-says-yet-to-get-funds-for-teachers-salaries-govt-says-released-money/story-2l8qwRwGoddG8PIF6sHToJ.html

So the stretch was open for the vehicular movement. This continued even after the lockdown was ended as all the staff was busy with the management of the Covid-19 crisis. So we have decided to keep status quo for some more months,” the official said.He said after the markets were opened, traders of the area requested that traffic movement should remain on the stretch as their business was down due to Covid-19. “We will assess the situation again in August and decide the future course of action,” the official said.EDMC had in September last year pedestrianised a 1-km stretch between Chhachi Building to Ghondli Chowk in Krishna Nagar Market, which was built in 1947. Similarly, the north corporation also opened the emergency lane of the nearly 1.5-km Ajmal Khan Road in Karol Bagh for visitors to drive through for pick and drop. Parking won’t be allowed.Ajmal Khan Road in Karol Bagh market was pedestrianised about a year ago. Ajmal Khan Road has been clogged with traffic and haphazard parking for decades before it was made car-free in May last year.A senior official at the north corporation said that traders were complaining of poor business and people were not feeling comfortable walking in the streets due to the Covid scare. “So, a proposal has been finalised to open the 6 metre emergency lane for public vehicles, 3 metres on each side, for the two-way movement of vehicles,” he said.The decision comes after the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Delhi chief Adesh Gupta on Tuesday met traders of the area and said movement of vehicles on the pedestrianised stretch will be allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traffic-movement-allowed-on-pedestrianised-stretches-at-krishna-nagar-and-karol-bagh-markets/story-iND7FVIHZ1TbJBY3gjwt4K.html

The state government- approved charges for the said distance is Rs 900 and the patient was charged nine times the approved amount.Also, the driver demanded an additional Rs 1,500 for the PPE masks provided to the accompanying doctor and nurse in the ambulanceIn the Gujar-Nimbalkarwadi case, Ram has also asked the health authorities to ensure ambulances visit each village where there are patients, once a day.The woman was initially asked by the administration to stay at her home in Gujar-Nimbalkarwadi, on the outskirts of Pune. However, on Monday, her condition worsened as she due to the non-availability of a ventilator in the hospital situated in her neighbourhood, said her kin.“We have issued a show-cause notice to the concerned staff of the health department and sought their reply in seven days. This is a lesson for the administration and the health department must follow all the standard operating procedures (SOPs) essential for the management of a Covid patient’s health and wellbeing. We will ensure that the best treatment is given to the patients and such incidents don’t repeat in the future,” said Ram.Ram said, “She was diagnosed on June 29 and her report came on June 30. She died on July 3. We have found that private lab Thyrocare did not share the report with the government and this has come after an on-the-spot inquiry. Their report is not coming to the authorities and we are banning them in Haveli taluka for this strange working style,” According to Ram a bed was available for the woman at Aundh hospital, but the family insisted on another hospital.“I have taken a serious view of the incident and conducted a meeting with the villagers. I have instructed the tehsildar to visit all villages and take feedback from villagers. Home isolation was not there in the beginning for these villages. We are starting a practice where a government doctor will go to the village in an ambulance and check the details of each patient and take immediate steps for facilitating medical services depending on the patient condition. In this way we will keep co complete control on the situation unfolding in the villages,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/collector-seeks-report-on-covid-positive-woman-s-death-files-fir-against-ambulance-service-provider-for-overcharging/story-uLH33o8cIKGvR1RreXedZO.html

08-07-2020||City||65% complaints to Punjab real estate regulator are from Mohali district||Of 1,572 complaints to the Punjab Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Rera), since its inception in September 2017, 65% have been from buyers in Mohali district. In the past one decade, Mohali, particularly the peripheral towns of Zirakpur, Kharar and New Chandigarh (Mullanpur), has emerged as the tricity’s development hub with around 500 residential and commercial projects. Since last year, with Greater Mohali Area Development Authority coming up with IT City and Aero City projects, Airport Road has also become a prominent realty destination.Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, was passed by the Parliament in 2016 to address grievances of homebuyers. It has provisions to penalise builders for malicious acts. In Punjab, Rera came into force in September 2017.A senior Rera officer, not wishing to be named, said most complaints received pertain to delay in possession of property, non-payment of interest and penalty, sale of a flat to multiple buyers, unnecessary demands by builders and construction left midway.He said the number of complaints has gone up during the lockdown period, with Mohali accounting for the bulk — 100 of the 179 received since March 25 this year.Alka Kapoor, an allottee at Chandigarh Citi Center, Zirakpur, said: “I have recently lodged a complaint with Rera after waiting for possession for nearly two years. As per the agreement, possession was to be given in December 2018, but work has still not been completed.”Harish Gupta, president of the builders association in Zirakpur, said: “Due to the nationwide lockdown, we have already got a six-month extension for delivery of projects. Builders are also facing financial issues for the past few months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/65-complaints-to-punjab-real-estate-regulator-are-from-mohali-district/story-NKzDLokU4L2yERxgZzEZjM.html
08-07-2020||City||Oswal family feud: Apex court sets aside NCLT’s order in favour of petitioner||In yet another twist in the Oswal family feud, the Supreme Court (SC) set aside an National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) order in favour of Pankaj Oswal, ruling that the company petition filed by him against his mother Aruna Oswal is an ‘afterthought’ and needs to be dropped. In the order passed on July 6 (copy with HT), the SC held that the proceeding before the NCLT, Chandigarh, should not be entertained because of a pending civil suit, filed by Pankaj, in the Delhi high court (HC). The court noted that the basis of the company petition is a claim of inherence, which cannot be decided by NCLT under the provisions of law.The NCLT had issued an order in 2018 recognising that Pankaj, the eldest son of industrialist late Abhey Oswal, is entitled to the shares of listed companies that his father promoted-- Oswal Agro Mills Ltd and Oswal Greentech Limited. Setting aside this order, the SC allowed the appeals filed on behalf of Oswal Agro Mills Limited, Oswal Greentech Limited and Aruna.The apex court held that filing of the company petition by Pankaj seeking waiver of the minimum eligibility criteria of 10% shareholding under the Companies Act is a “misconceived exercise”. It further held that Pankaj should have waited for the decision of the high court as his entitlement is under cloud of a pending civil suit. The court labelled the attempt by Pankaj Oswal in filing the company petition, after choosing to avail the remedy of civil suit as “nothing but an afterthought”.The court noted that after the demise of Abhey Kumar Oswal, the shareholding was registered in the name of his widow Aruna on the basis of nomination. The court noted that regarding the said shares, the Delhi HC has passed a status-quo order on February 8, 2017, thus shares have to be held in Aruna’s name till the civil suit is finally decided.At the NCLT earlier, Pankaj had filed a petition alleging mismanagement, misappropriation and related party transactions happening in his late father’s companies. It was also alleged that after the sudden intestate (not having made a will before death) Abhey’s wife Aruna had arbitrarily taken control of both the companies, on the basis of nominations in her name. In February 2017, Pankaj had filed a petition in the Delhi HC, claiming absolute properietary rights to the extent of 1/4th undivided share in the estate of his father. In the petition, Pankaj had alleged that the other three heirs, his mother Aruna, younger brother Shailendra and sister Shalu Jindal, were attempting to oust him from the estate of his father.The HC had issued a stay order against the other legal heirs. Abhey, 67, had control and held the promoters’ shareholding over both these listed companies (Oswal Agro Mills Ltd and Oswal Greentech Ltd), before he died of heart attack on a business tour to Moscow on March 29, 2016. Abhey Oswal held 5,35,3,960 shares with Agro Mills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/oswal-family-feud-apex-court-sets-aside-nclt-s-order-in-favour-of-petitioner/story-kmvHvRyTxFjrzmiDPhMP1J.html

Accumulated rainwater also entered a few shops near Clock Tower. The cremation ground behind KVM school, Civil Lines, was also waterlogged. The internal drains near Domoria bridge and Dharampura also overflowed and sewer water overflowed in nearby areas. Councillor Manju Aggarwal’s husband Inder Aggarwal, said, “The internal drain was damaged while it was being cleaned a few days back due to which it choked. But, the drain is being cleaned and the accumulated water has been drained out. Meanwhile, the MC’s failure to upgrade the disposal points also resulted in rain water accumulation in different wards.”Potholed roads in different parts of the city added to the woes of residents. A Dugri resident, Gurkamal Singh said, “The Dugri main road starting from police station till cremation ground is in bad shape which is resulting in accidents. A few residents on two-wheelers fell on the potholed road due to water accumulation.”MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said,”Water logging is mostly witnessed in low lying areas. The MC teams were on the field and efforts are being made to drain out the water as soon as possible. I had also visited different areas of the city to inspect the work being done by sweepers and sewermen. The sewer lines are being cleaned regularly.” Rainfall good for paddy: ExpertsPunjab Agricultural University’s (PAU), assistant agro meteorologist, KK Gill said, “The rainfall is good for paddy farmers.

08-07-2020||Gurugram||Amid uncertainty of Covid-19 pandemic, Gurugram schools start online nursery admission||Private schools in the city have started inviting online applications for admissions to nursery and Kindergarten classes for the academic year 2021-22. However, with no centralised monitoring from a state agency and given the extraordinary circumstances thrown open by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, there is very little consensus among schools as to how the process should be carried out. Unlike Delhi, admissions to private schools in Gurugram usually take place between July and October every year in a staggered manner with most schools deciding their own schedule and criteria. Although the admission process gets over by October each year, the new session for successful candidates usually starts between March and April of the following year. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic this year, most schools are exploring ways of conducting the admission process entirely online. Manav Rachna International School, Sector 46, initiated its online admission process last week. The school follows a first-come, first-served basis for admission. However, in view of the pandemic, the school will be conducting the whole process online, including the interview and counselling of parents. It has also introduced three days of virtual classes that would enable parents to experience how such classes are conducted. “Parents can place a request and inform us about the various subjects they would wish to explore. They will be given a unique identity number with which they enter the virtual class and observe silently,” said Dhriti Malhotra, school principal. She said that the online process was a new experience for both parents and schools. “Earlier, parents could walk into the school for a tour before admissions. With the changed circumstances, everything is being done virtually now. I have a chat with parents for five to 10 minutes, and then they get the chance to attend the classes,” said Malhotra. Malhotra added that the age criteria would remain the same as last year. The admission cut-off age of the school is three years and six months as on March 31 for nursery and four years and six months for Kindergarten. Preference will also be given to children who have siblings studying in the same school. As per the guidelines issued by the state directorate of elementary education last year, a 1km neighbourhood preference, a uniform age limit, and a random lottery system were some of the criteria that schools needed to follow for admitting children to the nursery section. However, with very little monitoring on the part of the state government, it is not clear as to how many schools followed the guidelines in reality. So far this year, the department has not issued any new guidelines. Although the admission process has started, several schools in the city are still trying to figure out as to how the process would be conducted. For instance, Kunal Bhadoo, director of Kunskapsskolan Schools, said that while the school has opened a registration link, the admission process is yet to be launched formally. He said that the school was still holding discussions on the modalities of the admission process. “Queries pertaining to admission have started pouring in, but the finer details regarding the process are still in the works due to the unpredictable situation this year. We will be incorporating feedback from the parents as we go ahead. In view of the pandemic situation, distance as a criterion will be significant. There is a growing preference for schools that are in the vicinity,” said Bhadoo.Aditi Misra, principal, Delhi Public School, Sector 45, also said that the school had been receiving queries from parents but the details regarding the admission process would only be finalised in the coming weeks. “We are planning to discuss the modalities of the admission process with other schools this week. Every year, we usually have a draw of lots but keeping the current situation in mind, we are open to exploring ways of conducting the draw online,” said Misra. The age criteria adopted by the school will remain same as previous years’, that is, 3+ as on September 30 for pre-nursery and 4+ as on September 30 for Kindergarten. Anita Malhotra, principal of Lotus Valley, said that the school would delay the admission process in view of the pandemic. “Admissions might get delayed this year. Earlier, we used to carry out admissions in August and September itself. This time, the process will get postponed due to the pandemic. The time is not appropriate,” said Malhotra. She added that the other factors, such as the age criteria, were likely to remain the same as last year.When contacted, Pardeep Kumar, elementary education department director, said that the department has not issued any new guidelines so far. “Guidelines concerning nursery admissions in private schools in the city had already been issued last year and the same may be followed this year.” Given the lack of clarity, parents of children who are slated to take admission this year are worried about how the situation would unfold amid the current Covid-19 pandemic. Umang Singla, whose daughter is eligible for nursery admission, said that he had started applying for admission with the hope that the situation would improve by next year, when the new session starts. “I have started looking out for schools. Hopefully, the situation created by the pandemic would improve by next year. Moreover, some sort of learning needs to take place regardless of the circumstances,” said Singla, whose elder son is taking online classes for nursery.Frequently asked questions: Nursery and Kindergarten admission, 2020-21When will the admission process start? Will it be postponed due to Covid-19?Unlike Delhi, private schools in Gurugram do not follow a uniform admission schedule. Admissions take place in a staggered manner between July and October each year. This year, while some schools have started the registration process, others are expected to do so in the coming weeks. There is no clarity if the admission cycle will be postponed.What is the age criterion for admission? As per the guidelines issued by the directorate of elementary education in February 2019, a child needs to be 3+ on March 31 for being admitted to nursery. For Kindergarten, a child needs to be 4+ on March 31. No new guideline has been issued so far. Parents whose children don’t meet the age criterion by a few days or months can approach the schools directly. Is there an upper cut-off age? Some schools impose an upper cut-off age while others don’t. The current government rules in place do not mention anything on the upper cut-off age for admission to nursery and Kindergarten.Will admission be difficult for children without playschool experience? As per the government guidelines shared in 2019, playschool is not a requirement for nursery admissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/amid-uncertainty-of-covid-19-pandemic-gurugram-schools-start-online-nursery-admission/story-sUsVEd0uCH6CiUQo4E6WJK.html
08-07-2020||Chandigarh||HC allows Chandigarh woman to terminate 26-week pregnancy||Noting PGIMER’s report that the foetus’ brain and skull were poorly formed, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday allowed termination of a Chandigarh woman’s 26-week pregnancy.The high court bench of justice Ramendra Jain acted on the woman’s plea filed on July 1, following which the court had sought a report from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, does not permit termination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks. The law allows termination of pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner, where the length of the pregnancy does not exceed 12 weeks. Where the length of the pregnancy is up to 20 weeks, it can be terminated on doctors’ opinion that continuance of the pregnancy will involve a risk to the life of the mother or of grave injury to her physical or mental health. It can also be terminated, if there is a substantial risk to the newborn or upon birth, the child will suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. A PGIMER panel on Wednesday informed the court that the woman has a single live intrauterine foetus with features suggestive of anencephaly (underdeveloped brain and incomplete skull) with spinal deformity and polyhydramnios (excess of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac). “It is a severe congenital malformation in which the foetal skull and brain are poorly formed, and are incompatible with life,” the panel informed the court, adding that the woman was clinically fit. But, she was under mental stress due to the foetus being affected with anencephaly.The panel informed the court that she may undergo medical termination of pregnancy at this stage due to severe congenital anomaly. The risks, involved with termination of pregnancy at an advanced gestation of more than 25 weeks, have been explained to patient.On this, the court now allowed termination of the pregnancy and asked PGIMER to admit the woman within the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-allows-chandigarh-woman-to-terminate-26-week-pregnancy/story-6akuODXrVXo9hwrm51EVwI.html

School authorities sent a circular to parents recently asking them to deposit all charges as decided by the Punjab and Haryana high court.On June 30, the HC ruled that all schools were entitled to collect tuition fee irrespective of whether they offered online classes during the Covid-19 lockdown. The court has also permitted schools to charge admission fees.The parents said their economic condition has deteriorated amid the Covid-19 lockdown and they can’t afford the charges. Standing outside the school gate for an hour, the parents urged the school authorities to allow them to deposit the tuition fee and waive off the other charges. The parents said they have sent an email to the school authorities and will wait for the reply till tomorrow. A parent, Vishal Jain, said, “I have requested school authorities to take the tuition fee and when the school reopens, we will pay the admission fee.

The revised schedule will be uploaded on the university website on July 9.Two aspirants had filed a writ petition in the HC claiming that they should be given the same benefits for admission to private colleges as are given to PCMS doctors for admission to government colleges.The state has argued that one major problem which will be faced is that PCMS doctors who are granted incentive for admission in government colleges are given full salary because during their course they are undertaking duties at the hospitals.“However, this benefit cannot be insisted for PCMS doctors who may get admissions at private colleges and will then get salary from the government while working in the private hospitals,” state informed court.While the petitioners’ counsel said that the petitioners have stated that in case government decides to give them the same incentive for admission, they will not seek any salary or remuneration for the period during which they are undergoing their course and will be willing to sign any bond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/legal-tangle-bfuhs-postpones-2nd-pg-admissions-counselling/story-JklF1R0LA3zK0WtRxhvRJI.html

08-07-2020||Chandigarh||New guidance on alcoholism in Punjabi community published in UK||Following a three year programme that highlighted the issue of alcoholism in the Punjabi community and improved access to support services, new guidance on dealing with alcoholism in the Punjabi community has been published in the United Kingdom. A first of its kind initiative, called the Shanti Project, was launched in 2016-19. IT was led by charitable organisation Aquarius that supports people affected by alcohol, drugs and gambling. The guidance has been developed by Aquarius with the University of Birmingham and the Manchester Metropolitan University.Co-author of the guidance, Surinder Guru of the University of Birmingham, said: “Drinking within the Punjabi community is gendered. Heavy drinking is a common practice among men but women’s drinking is frowned upon. This creates tensions in families and women can suffer rejection and shame within the community and family.”“The original research underpinning Shanti showed that young Punjabi people had noticed this unequal treatment and deemed it unfair. We need to pay attention to women’s drinking and the impact of men’s drinking on women and children within the Punjabi community,” Guru added.The guidance offers advice on setting up projects, developing a project model, project management, project delivery, as well as useful resources, the University of Birmingham said in a release on Wednesday. It also details best practices on how to work productively when providing services that address alcohol use within south Asian communities in general, and the Punjabi community in particular.‘AVOID ONE-SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH’ Richard McVey of Aquarius said, “It is important that all alcohol and drug services hear the particular needs of our diverse communities. We must avoid a ‘one size fits all’ approach. To do this, partnership with the community from the outset is vital.”The Shanti Project was developed out of Aquarius’ concern for the number of middle-aged Punjabi men being taken to accident and emergency departments in hospitals with serious alcohol-related liver conditions that needed earlier detection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/new-guidance-on-alcoholism-in-punjabi-community-published-in-uk/story-fbBkp2WcAVlf6vXiIyjntK.html

If suitable local candidates are not available for a particular category of job, a provision will be made in the law for the labour commissioner to allow firms to hire candidates from outside the state. The people who are already working in state’s industries need not panic at all as they will not be removed from their jobs, he added. Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, meanwhile, said the state government is laying special emphasis on skilling youths to make them employable. He made the remark while interacting with the beneficiaries of Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) during a webinar organized here on Tuesday by the newly formed Department of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Haryana.

It aims at reserving 75 per cent of new jobs with salaries less than Rs 50,000 a month in private firms, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms and partnership firms for local youths, he had added. The draft ordinance is to be placed before the Cabinet in its next meeting. Providing 75 per cent quota in private sector jobs to local youths was a key poll promise of Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janta Party, which is a coalition partner of the BJP government in Haryana.

The erstwhile ruler’s granddaughter and Mehtab’s sister, Nisha D Kher, who is vice-chairperson of the trust, is also named in the FIR.The other accused include trust CEO Jagir Singh Sran, trust legal adviser Navjot Singh Wahniwal, Paramjit Singh Sandhu, Santosh Kumar, Jaspal Kaur, Bhushan Sharma, Shankarpal, Baljit Kaur, Harpreet Kaur, Babu Ram Pal, Madan Mohan Devgan, Naresh, BS Sandhu, Sheparwah Singh, Raghubir Singh, Resham Singh, Kuldeep Chand, Barjinder Pal Singh Brar, Jatinder Pal Singh, SK Kataria and then trust CEO Lalit Mohan Gupta, who is chairman of the improvement trust, Faridkot, at present.A case was registered under Sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property); 465 (forgery); 467 (forgery of valuable security, will); 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating); 471 (using as genuine a forged document); and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC at the city police station in Faridkot.Senior superintendent of police Swarndeep Singh said that on the basis of the high court order Amrit Kaur filed a complaint and a case was registered after taking legal advice. “She has stated in her complaint that the accused have committed forgery by preparing a fake will of Faridkot ruler,” he said.The high court had upheld a Chandigarh court’s order last month, awarding majority share in the ₹20,000-crore property of Harinder Singh Brar to his two daughters —Amrit Kaur and Deepinder Kaur. The court held that descendents of Manjit Inder Singh, the last ruler’s brother, would get their mother Mohinder Kaur’s share.As of the will in dispute, the court observed, trustees conspired to create the will to take over the property. “The will is proved to be forged, fictitious, fabricated and shrouded with suspicious circumstances,” the court order said.FARIDKOT ROYAL DISPUTECrowned maharaja at the age of three in 1918, Harinder Singh Brar was the last ruler of the Faridkot estate and was married to Narinder Kaur. The royal couple had three daughters, Amrit Kaur, Deepinder Kaur and Maheepinder Kaur and a son, Harmohinder Singh.The son died in a road accident in 1981.One of the rulers of the seven Sikh princely states, Harinder died in 1989 and left behind prime properties in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana and Chandigarh.Maheepinder Kaur died a spinster, while Deepinder died while the legal battle was on. Amrit Kaur lives in Chandigarh.The property dispute started soon after Harinder Singh Brar died in October 1989 after a will surfaced in which he had bequeathed his properties to the Maharwal Khewaji Trust, with his daughter Deepinder as its head.The property dispute reached the high court in 2018 after a Chandigarh court declared the trust void and gave property to the daughters. In June this year, the high court upheld the Chandigarh court’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/23-members-employees-of-maharwal-khewaji-trust-booked-for-forging-faridkot-erstwhile-maharaja-s-will/story-p2iVUWXdOMiMCdn76KmMHP.html

Later, Barwadih sub divisional police officer (SDPO) Amarnath reached the spot and persuaded the youths to withdraw the protest.The protest was taken back after an hour after the police assured to fulfil their demands of providing security to Jaiwardhan’s family, immediate arrest of the culprits, installation of CCTV cameras, and deployment of police force at the Chowk.Some of the protestors also demanded action against Barwadih police station officer-in-charge Dinesh Kumar for demanding money during the lockdown.Confirming the same, SDPO Amarnath said, “Some people have levelled bribery charges against the Barwadih OC.

If found true, we will recommend action in this regard.”Meanwhile, Sunil Kumar Singh met with the Jharkhand director general of police (DGP) MV Rao on Tuesday to demand security cover for the deceased leader’s family and arrest of the culprits.Two days after the murder, a special investigation team (SIT) held some villagers for interrogation in this connection. The team again visited the spot on Tuesday for detailed investigation. Latehar superintendent of police Prashant Anand said, “We have collected some vital forensic clues and held some persons for interrogation but it’s too early to say anything in this regard.”Unidentified assailants had shot dead Jaiwardhan Singh at Barwadih bus stand on Sunday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/locals-protest-demand-cbi-probe-in-bjp-leader-s-murder/story-BInI7bVe8I3IID6KOyNHTI.html

08-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugramwale: The story behind the walker||The walker can have many uses. Shiraz Muhammad discovered it not long after acquiring one for himself, following a leg injury.“You cover the walker with a cloth, sit down under it and you will be protected from the rain,” he says — though this morning he is protecting himself from a resentfully strong sun.Mr Muhammed is seated on a central Delhi pavement. He indicates his “current status” is being a beggar. “I have nobody in this world,” he says. He suggests—rhetorically—to go through his I-card. “My father’s name: khali (empty); my mother’s name: khali; my place of birth: khali.”Mr Muhammed doesn’t have any idea of his age but says he cannot be more than 40.He pauses to gather his thoughts. “From top to bottom I’m a lawaris (orphan).” He says it in a bland tone.His life used to be far superior to his present, he points out. “I worked as a waiter in Ludhiana (Punjab). This is where I was hit by a car, last year, and hurt my leg.”It’s more than a mere hurt. The great part of the left leg is not only bandaged but encased in a metallic casing. “Doctors fitted it.... there is a steel rod inside my leg,” he says in awe.Mr Muhammed came all the way from Ludhiana to Delhi, believing that “as the country’s capital, it would have better facilities for a quick recovery.”He got the walker not long after getting his leg treated in a “sarkari aspatal (government hospital).” A stranger donated it, he says. And “before the lockdown my legs would be dressed after ever few weeks by nurses in the aspatal, with fresh patti (bandage), for free.” Mr Muhammed has not visited the hospital since the coronavirus pandemic has started — he is indeed acting very responsibly since the first lockdown and, unlike most people on the street, he has his mouth covered with mask.These days, he says, he buys new “patti” after every two weeks for 120 rupees from a chemist shop, and does the bandaging himself.Mr Muhammed plans to follow his current profession until his leg fully recovers. “Doctor says my leg will heal faster if I walk more.” But he hardly employs the walker to walk, which, he now feels, will serve more as an umbrella as monsoon takes over the city. At night, it becomes his shelter. “I sleep over there across the road... with my top body under the walker that I cover with a chaddar(sheet).”It’s about ten and the air is getting extremely humid. Mr Muhammed hasn’t had breakfast yet. Soon, a passerby drops a 20-rupee note by his side. He silently nods his head in acknowledgment. Not long after he is joined by another man who sits besides him, and reads aloud the headlines on India-China border dispute from the day’s newspaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugramwale-the-story-behind-the-walker/story-QYpvs3lFL4Ybfgk6Ujt0zO.html
08-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwala: The pickle store tolls||The obvious and subtle ways in which the pandemic has affected a landmark storeIt ought to be a truth universally acknowledged that dal-chawal-subzi remains an incomplete meal without being accompanied by aam ka achar. Or, for that matter, by any pickle.The humble pickle has even been recognized as an essential commodity by the authorities, and “so we were permitted to open our pickle shop before the complete lockdown was lifted,” says Rohit Dhingra, 38. Along with two of his brothers, he run the landmark Shri Sai Pickle Store in Gurugram’s Old Subzi Mandi in Sadar Bazar. He is chatting this morning on WhatsApp from his home on “Gali Number 1, Madan Puri” and is just preparing to leave for the shop.Obviously, the pickle shop took its toll in the going coronavirus pandemic too. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of them.Toll no. 1The two employees who had been serving as store assistants for a long time left for home before the lockdown began, Mr Dhingra says. Aakash went back to his village in UP, and Sanjay returned to his parents in Bihar. “The last time I talked to Aakash, he said he was busy looking after his mango orchard and would get back only after the (mango) season gets over, while Sanjay is more vague about his return.” Sanjay actually says he will consider coming back only after the virus has disappeared.For now, Mr Dhingra is running the shop with his two brothers daily from 7 am to 7 pm.Toll no. 2It was a difficult time for the eleven women who make the pickles in the shop’s factory, in nearby Rewari town. “They all have been working with us for a long time, so we had to look after them even when the business was closed,” notes Mr Dhingra. Now about seven women have started reporting to work—Ravi, Bhagwati, Angoorie, Jyoti, Seems, Mahindra, and Madhu. “The rest of the staff will also come hopeful soon.” Being women, Mr Dhingra observes, they have additional responsibilities at home too.Toll no. 3Mr Dhingra’s wife, Kirti, remains suspended in a state of anxiety. She was greatly alarmed when the shop reopened. “But she understood that we had to restart the business, and I assured her that we all would wear masks and gloves in the shop at all times, and would exercise physical distancing from customers.”Nevertheless, Kirti isn’t taking any chances. Every morning she keeps some additional two masks in her husband’s bag “because it’s hot and humid now, and one sweats a lot, making it tempting to change the sweaty mask for a fresh one.” Kirti also serves Mr Dhingra an extra-fortified breakfast with two pieces of their shop’s very own aamla ka murabba-“an immunity booster, and currently our best seller.” She also arms him with a large bottle of freshly squeezed musambi juice.Toll no. 4Mr Dhingra’s 9-year-old son, Priyansh, also had to change his ways. In the BC (before corona) era, he would run out to welcome his father and two uncles as they would return from the shop in the evening. He would first join his palm in a respectful namaste, and then would reverently touch the feet of each of the three men. “But now we would immediately tell him “Nahin nahin beta abhi door rahon! (No son, stay away!)” The men first head straight to the bathroom, thoroughly wash themselves with soap and change into clean, sanitized, clothes before entering the rooms and letting Priyansh follow his daily ritual.Despite these professional and personal tolls, however, Mr Dhingra isn’t perturbed too much. “This situation is beyond one’s control, it’s happening to everyone... so we need to bear it and carry on with caution.” He later Whatsapps a joint portrait of the achar shop-owning family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwala-the-pickle-store-tolls/story-S7gq6GfDSQ1XVznmmmlIrJ.html
08-07-2020||Delhi||HC cites freedom of speech in turning down Murthy’s plea||The Delhi high court has declined a plea by venture capitalist Mahesh Murthy to restrain publication of sexual harassment allegations against him by some women entrepreneurs. Murthy’s prayer for compensation to the tune of Rs 2,50,00,000 from eighteen defendants for publication of posts against him was also turned down by the court.“It would not be reasonable in the facts and circumstances to fetter the narration of alleged facts and comments of defendants. The defendants have a right to exercise their right of freedom of speech. If these incidents and claims of the said defendants are in trial proved to be false, the plaintiff (Murthy) would have a right to claim damages,” the single-judge bench of justice Jayant Nath said on Monday.Some women published details of conversations with Murthy to expose his alleged inappropriate responses. Such posts were published on websites like LinkedIn and Indian Ceo. Articles were also FactorDaily and YourStory. The Delhi high court had, by a 2017 order, restrained publication of such material till his plea was decided. The HC on Monday vacated the stay. Murthy said he will be filing an appeal and that “justice will prevail”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-cites-freedom-of-speech-in-turning-down-murthy-s-plea/story-mkuOMWLbvuhyKwXZgqBXiP.html
08-07-2020||Delhi||Chandni Mahal’s lanes of uncertainty||At least 70 families in two lanes of Chandni Mahal have been stayed in containment for the past 88 days -- the longest duration for which restrictions were imposed in any part of the city to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease. The residents are now clamouring for easing of restrictions but the district officials asserted that till cases are emerging from the area, there cannot be any let up in the containment measures. On April 10, Chandni Mahal was sealed with only one entry and exit remaining open.Before the area was unsealed on June 6, 89 cases had been reported from there. However, the two lanes -- Gali Chhatta Lal Miyan and Gali Dakotan -- remained closed. Though officials said cases were still surfacing in the two lanes, local residents said the last known case was reported on June 1 and the infected woman has fully recovered. As per the protocol, the administration waits for at least 28 days since the last case before unsealing a containment zone. The residents also complained that their life has come to a halt as they have been marooned in their locality and facing difficulty in managing essential items and daily chores. “After June first week, the main road outside was opened. Police barricades were removed. Chandni Mahal residents were allowed to move out but for us, it has been like a prisoner’s life. Even the building (Markaz) at Nizamuddin was removed from the list of containment in lesser time compared to us,” said Shoaib, 45, a resident.Mohammed Malik, 33, a resident of Chhatta Lal Miyan, said, “We give the address of our friends (living outside contained lanes) to get online deliveries. Our friends collect those items and hand it to us over the police barricades. From cell phone battery chargers to gas cylinders, this is how we have been managing. We don’t know how long our troubles are going to continue,” Malik said.Till Tuesday, Delhi had 454 containment zones.Junaid, 24, another resident of the Chatta Lal Miyan, said his brother had written to the sub-divisional magistrate office last Friday, urging lifting of containment measures. He said his aunt had tested positive following which the lane was sealed. “My aunt had tested positive on June 1 at the Lok Nayak hospital where she regularly went for dialysis. She was admitted at the hospital and returned on June 12. She has completed her home quarantine too. My aunt is fully recovered but the government is yet to remove containment measures,” he said.Nidhi Srivastava, district magistrate (central), said regular door-to-door surveys are being conducted in the area. “Our teams are collecting samples from the restricted area. We are also ensuring that home delivery of essential items is maintained. For this purpose, we have deployed civil defence volunteers and also distributed contact numbers of designated vendors and traders to the residents,” she said.“Nearly 6,000 cases were reported from the central district and most of them are from Old Delhi areas. Some fresh cases were reported last month (from the two lanes) so they could not be unsealed. We are closely monitoring the situation,” the DM said.The area councillor , Ale Mohammad, said though the locality is congested and there were chances of virus spreading rapidly but no fresh cases were reported from the two lanes in the last 15-20 days.“There is no need to keep the lanes under containment. For over three months, residents of these localities are facing trouble in procuring necessary items as they are unable to move out,” he said.District officials, however, said two new cases were reported from Gali Dakotan on June 22 and therefore, it cannot be unsealed. Officials said, as per guidelines, any area is declared containment zone when three or more cluster cases appear from there but it also depends on the demographics of the area. If an area is densely populated and is congested like localities in old city, it can be made containment zone even when the number of cases is less than three and the risk factor is high. Any area is declared containment zones only after due survey and risk assessment in the region.Besides the two Chandni Mahal lanes, other areas which have been remained in containment for at least 50 days include Pratap Khand in east Delhi, Block B and C in Jahangirpuri and Zakir Nagar in Jamia Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chandni-mahal-s-lanes-of-uncertainty/story-wtMmpwrmZxHFaN4hJAMcSI.html

Addressing a gathering of farmers at Litran village in Jalandhar, Jakhar said the Congress’ state unit will explore ways of challenging the validity of the ordinances brought by the Narendra Modi-led government as they violated the basic spirit of the Indian Constitution. Accompanied by Jalandhar MP Santokh Singh Chaudhary, MLAs Pargat Singh, Hardev Singh Laddi and state water resources chairman Jagbir Singh Brar and others, Jakhar said the Centre has no right to frame any law on the subject. The former Gurdaspur MP said the ordinances were aimed at breaking the backbone of the of country’s foodgrain growers. “The move to stop government purchase of foodgrains is aimed at making the farmers a puppet of the private players to whom the BJP government wanted to benefit. The Akalis are more concerned about enjoying power rather than protecting the interests of the state and its people,” added Jakhar. The Akalis have already backstabbed the Sikh community as a series of incidents of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib took place during their tenure, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akalis-first-backstabbed-sikhs-now-ditching-farmers-for-power-jakhar/story-vBORWzRrZbaob495s3A0SK.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Two constables dismissed from Mumbai Police for failing to report to duty||Two constables were dismissed from the city police force for not reporting to duty despite several warnings. The two were suspended earlier and asked to be present for an inquiry. However, they remained unavailable for inquiry, following which they were dismissed. The dismissal orders were sent to them. A senior police officer said that in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, the Disaster Management Act is implemented in the state and the police force is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining law and order. So the police department is taking stern action against those personnel who are not cooperating with the department during this crisis. The dismissed constables – Dada Bapu Sonawane and Madhav Rajendra Jadhav – were attached to Tardeo local arms division (LA-2). “Both remained absent for a very long period. They did not respond to the show-cause notices that were issued during the departmental inquiry and hence have been dismissed,” said Nandkumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police, LA-2.Jadhav was absent since December 22, 2018, while Sonawane has a history of remaining absent from duty for long periods, said the police. “He was absent for 107 days in 2009 and later in 2011, did not report to duty for over four years. After resuming duty in May 2015, he was again stopped reporting to work on November 7 last year and since then did not come back on duty,” said a police officer.Sonawane is in his village. The departmental inquiry found him guilty for indiscipline and “not fit for police service”.To prevent the spread of the virus and save the lives of the personnel, those with comorbidities and above 55 years of age are exempted assigned indoor duties or exempted from reporting to duty. As a result, the number of personnel on the field has reduced and the leaves of all the personnel were cancelled, while those on leave were asked to report to duty on an immediate basis. But several personnel are yet to resume the services, prompting their superiors to take stern action. “Strict action sends a clear message across the force that such attitude will not be tolerated,” said Thakur. Last month, in a similar development, a criminal case was registered against six police personnel for not reporting to duty, despite several warnings. The personnel were suspended earlier and were asked to be present for an inquiry by the Borivli police. However, they remained unavailable during the inquiry, following which they were booked in a criminal case.In May, the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) registered a similar complaint against 17 personnel at the Vanrai police station not reporting to duty despite several warnings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-constables-dismissed-from-mumbai-police-for-failing-to-report-to-duty/story-h6mByM8RCkaycZ4cgbim6K.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Amend Act to keep fee hikes by private schools in check: Parents, experts to Maharashtra government||As several private schools in the city have hiked their fees, parents and experts urged the state to make amendments to the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, to allow the government to regulate the fees of private schools.An official from the education department said that the state is reviewing the fee-related laws.As parents reel under financial stress owing to the lockdown, they said they were unable to pay huge amounts at the moment. Many schools are removing students from their online learning groups or threatening parents to remove them from the school altogether, if the fees are not paid.Vaishali Bafna from SYSCOM, a Pune-based think tank, said the government needs to amend the fee regulation Act to include a provision, in which fees of private schools can be capped during a crisis.“The current provisions of the Act allow private schools to set their own fee structure. Schools are using this system to their own advantage even in difficult times such as these to put pressure on parents to pay huge sums. The government needs to intervene and bring amendments in the Act urgently,” she added.A government resolution released on May 8 stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay high court on June 26, in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. The petitioners argued that the government cannot regulate fees of private schools as per the current rules.Parents said that in the absence of strict norms, they have nowhere to go.“We are all stuck now because even if we complain to the education department, schools will still get away, as the court put a stay on the GR. On the other hand, schools are discriminating against students whose parents are unable to pay the fees, by removing them from online learning groups. The government needs to intervene,” said a Goregaon-based parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amend-act-to-keep-fee-hikes-by-private-schools-in-check-parents-experts-to-maharashtra-government/story-HdwGiTuchD0PP96otLQ7AJ.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||PIL challenges cancellation of exams: Bombay HC asks UGC to be made party, Maharashtra govt to respond||A division bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has called for the University Grants Commission (UGC) to be made a party to a public interest litigation (PIL) that has challenged a Maharashtra government resolution (GR) of June 19 which decided to not conduct exams for professional and non-professional courses due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The bench also asked the state to respond to the petition.The PIL filed by Dhananjay Kulkarni, a retired teacher from Pune, has stated that because UGC was the regulation authority, Maharashtra state was not empowered to decide and announce the mode of assessment for final-year students, and has sought to set aside and quash the GR.The division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice MS Karnik was informed by Kulkarni’s advocate Uday Warunjikar that the decision of the higher and technical education ministry to not conduct exams for professional and non-professional courses was not valid.The GR had stated that students of non-professional courses who have cleared all previous semesters and do not want to appear for last semester exams of their final year should submit their decision in writing to their respective universities. These students will be awarded a score based on the average of their aggregate marks of previous semesters and provided with results.The GR had also offered an exception for those students who were not satisfied with their score and wished to fare better, to give a written undertaking to the effect which would enable them to take an optional exam later.It had stated that it will not be able to conduct final-semester exams of professional courses like engineering, pharmacy, hotel management, architecture, planning, management studies, computer studies, law, physical education, and pedagogy, but had given students the option to take the exam for better scores later.The plea stated, “There is an artificial classification made by the state among students admitted to professional and non-professional courses. If the state government is not going to conduct examinations for non-professional courses because of the coronavirus outbreak, there is no reason to conduct exams for professional courses either. There is no logic behind the decision and it is arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore, the court’s intervention is required.”Warunjikar further submitted that the dual assessment method offered to the students in the GR was without logic, and such methods cannot be adopted while granting degrees. “Such an exercise is unknown to the educational field, and therefore, there is non-application of mind on the part of the state,” said Warunjikar, and submitted that even the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016 did not permit the state government to take such a decision, and only the UGC could take such decisions. Hence, he said, the decision was beyond the purview of the provisions of the UGC Act as well.The plea stated, “The hanging sword of uncertainty is faced by final-year students and the GR is not clear as to when the exams will be conducted and the academic year will get over. The fate of a large number of students who wish to take admission for post-graduation courses is kept hanging.”Stating this, the petitioner sought from the court to quash and set aside the GR, and pending hearing sought a stay on the same. After hearing the submissions, the court directed that UGC should also be made a party to the PIL and directed the state to file a response to the plea within a week, the court posted further hearing on July 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pil-challenges-cancellation-of-exams-bombay-hc-asks-ugc-to-be-made-party-maharashtra-govt-to-respond/story-mf5Uswi9RefP1uKZyezRPN.html
08-07-2020||City||Maharashtra can’t conduct final-year exams, state education minister writes to Union HRD ministry||A day after the University Grants Commission (UGC) accepted a recommendation by an expert committee, clarifying that universities should conduct end-of-term exams for their final-year batches, state minister of higher and technical education Uday Samant on Tuesday wrote to the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), reiterating that Maharashtra is not in a position to conduct the exams.“At present, Maharashtra is the worst-affected state, with more than two lakh confirmed Covid-19 cases. In such an unforeseen and challenging situation, conducting final-year exams of more than 10 lakh students seems a highly infeasible task, and if conducted, would endanger the well-being of students, teachers, parents, support staff and other machinery involved in it,” said Samant in a statement addressed to the union HRD minister, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank.He asked authorities to make the revised guidelines of UGC not mandatory and instead to suggest a formula to promote students based on their previous semester performances.The two-page letter is also marked to Union home minister Amit Shah, secretary of higher education, government of India and UGC chairman.“Due to this pandemic situation, most students have travelled back to their hometowns and to appear for exams, they will have to travel back to cities and this travel could also hamper their health. There have been incidences in other states and countries where exams were conducted and a large number of students got infected by the virus,” stated his letter.The UGC-appointed committee on Monday revealed that it is in favour of holding exams, especially for final-year students. However, it suggested that the exams may be held either in the online, offline or blended modes. The panel also clarified that universities must hold these exams latest by September-end for which revised guidelines will be released soon.Officials from city colleges, however, say it will be impossible to work out an exam schedule and conduct them in the state.“The UGC’s decision will be applicable to all the states but the Covid-19 situation is not the same everywhere. Maharashtra is facing a grave situation at present and even though the UGC directive says exams should be held by September, who knows how the situation will be in the next two months?” asked TA Shiware, chairman of the Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges.Teacher groups too feel that the UGC’s decision has been taken without understanding the ground reality.“UGC in its decision in April made exams optional, but now when the Covid-19 cases are at an all -time high, it are making exams mandatory, which is very illogical,” said Tapati Mukhopadhyay president the Maharashtra Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation (MFUCTO).She added that forcing lakhs of students to appear for exams at different colleges, some of which have been used as quarantine centres, any time soon will be putting the lives of students as well as the teachers conducting the exams in danger.“As a teacher organisation, we are against the decision by UGC and stand by our students’ safety. The central government should leave the decision on the state governments,” she added.Several student organisations too have criticised the UGC’s decision. Many called the revised guidelines issued by the UGC on exams and the academic calendar as “utterly pointless, unreasonable and unfair to students, teachers and educational institutes.”“The commission’s suggestion to conduct exams in online, offline or blended modes is detached from the ground reality. Despite the relaxations provided by the Centre, many parts of the country continue to remain under strict lockdown imposed by the state governments and local bodies, rendering offline examinations impossible and also undesirable. Several colleges, especially those located in the remote parts of the country, lack the necessary infrastructure for conducting online examinations. Reports have pointed out that a large number of students don’t have access to the Internet or digital equipment. These students will suffer if exams are conducted online,” said Mohammad Salman, south Maharashtra president of Students’ Islamic Organisation.He added that the guidelines will only to confusion and anxiety among students, and at worst, will disturb the academic calendar of universities, create health issues and put additional burden on teachers and colleges.Many student organisations, including the Yuva Sena and the Maharashtra Students Union (MASU) started online petitions against the implementation of the latest recommendations by the UGC- appointed committee.Yuva Sena general secretary Varun Sardesai outlined the concerns on behalf of the students and questioned the logic behind holding the exams at a time when the Covid-19 cases in the country have crossed the 7-lakh figure. Sardesai said that Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has already taken a decision to cancel the final-year exams, and given students an option to take voluntary exams for better grades.“When exams were originally scheduled, Covid cases were far lesser and it had not reached all parts of our country. The cases have been steadily rising and we cannot be sure they would decline by September,” his letter stated to the minister.“Lakhs of final year students have secured jobs as campus placements or enrolled in private Indian universities or foreign universities. Exams in September would mean they effectively lose all these opportunities,” Sardesai said in the letter.The youth leader said that the decision by the Centre has caused “confusion, panic and immense stress” among students and the education fraternity. He has also started an online petition, seeking the cancellation of final-year exams.“Yesterday, the UGC made final-year exams compulsory, and therefore, Yuva Sena has raised its voice against it and written to the HRD Minister. When the cases are increasing by the day, is the government expecting any vaccine or medicine to be developed by September? Secondly, they have given options for online and offline exams, but we all know that in rural India the Internet infrastructure is weak. If exams are conducted offline, the university staff and students are likely to get infected with coronavirus,” Sardesai said.(with inputs from Swapnil Rawal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-can-t-conduct-final-year-exams-state-education-minister-writes-to-union-hrd-ministry/story-X3rbq4GB6AXONFhItgg5fP.html
08-07-2020||City||3 absconding Dera Sacha Sauda national committee members key link in 2015 sacrilege: SIT||The three absconding members of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda’s national committee are the key link in Punjab’s three sacrilege incidents that sparked off state-wide protests in 2015, says the police’s special investigation team (SIT) led by Jalandhar range deputy inspector general (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra. The team probing the sacrilege cases claims to have found that the instructions to execute sacrilege at Bargari, Moga and Gurusar were given by dera’s national committee members Sandeep Bareta, a resident of Bareta in Mansa district, Pardeep Kler of Panipat in Haryana and Harsh Dhuri of Dhuri in Sangrur district, to the district dera committee members.The SIT has named Breta, Kler and Dhuri as accused in a 2015 case relating to the theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of the ‘bir’ were found scattered in front of a gurdwara at Bargari village in Faridkot. The trio was also named as accused in the Malke and Gurusar cases. Torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib were found at Malke village in Moga district in November 2015 and Gurusar (Bhagta) village in Bathinda district in October 2015. In 2018, the Khatra-led SIT had arrested more than 20 dera followers, including Mohinder Pal Bittu who was killed in the Nabha jail in 2019, in connection with the sacrilege incidents and rioting in Punjab in 2015. But the police have failed to nab the trio even after two years.DIG Khatra said Bareta, Kler, and Dhuri were the main link between the Sirsa dera and district committees in the sacrilege incidents. “In the Bargari sacrilege case, the instructions to steal a bir came through the three. The trio had met Bittu and instructed him for the theft and sacrilege. Similarly, in Moga sacrilege case, they gave instructions to dera state committee member Pirthi Singh after which sacrilege was done by a dera follower at Malke village,” he said.“In the Gurusar case, the torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib found in October 2015 were delivered to a dera state committee member, Jatindervir alias Jimmy, from the Sirsa dera directly. Deepak, a Malout resident, picked these pages from the dera headquarters and hand it over to Jimmy near the Bathinda thermal plant. There could be another case of sacrilege as we are yet to identify from where the dera had got those pages. The trio’s link was revealed during the interrogation of the accused dera followers, including Bittu, Pirthi and Jimmy,” he added.An SIT official said the arrest of the trio could lead SIT to chance upon the names of more people involved in sacrileges. “We recently conducted raids to nab them, but got no clue. I am afraid they might have left the country,” he added. The Moga and Gurusar sacrilege cases are at different stages in the courts. The charges were framed against five dera followers, including Pirthi, in the Moga case last year.In the Gurusar case, the court has framed charges against six dera followers, including Jimmy, and evidence has started. Bretta, Kler and Dhuri have been declared proclaimed offenders (POs) in these cases.Now, the SIT has sought arrest warrant of the absconding trio in the bir theft case and the matter is listed for hearing on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-absconding-dera-sacha-sauda-national-committee-members-key-link-in-2015-sacrilege-sit/story-zPErZaqPHzThsk5PJeC2mN.html

08-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab water regulatory body chairman to get salary, perks on a par with HC judge||The chairman of the newly constituted Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority (PWRDA) will get salary and perks on a par with a serving high court judge, it is learnt. The Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in the state has appointed former chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh as the first incumbent of the top post. Apart from the basic pay of Rs 2.25 lakh with a dearness allowance (DA) of 21% for the chairman, other entitlements include subsidised power supply for home, free furnished accommodation, a servant for lifetime and leave traveling allowance twice a year. The perks and salary will be paid after deducting pension drawn by him.Officials in the water resources department said the salary drawn by Karan Avtar Singh as chairman will almost equal to the last salary drawn by him when he was serving as the chief secretary.The PWRDA members will get salary equal to that of an IAS officer of the rank of financial commissioner Rs 2.24 lakh basic pay with 21% DA besides 20% house rent allowance. They are also entitled to entertainment allowance of Rs 1,000 and LTC once in two years.Meanwhile, assuming of charge by Karan Avtar along with two newly appointed members Sushil Gupta and Surinder Singh Kukal has been delayed as a petition challenging Singh’s appointment was filed in the Punjab and Haryana high court and is listed for hearing on Wednesday. Inderjit Kaushal, an HC lawyer who was also a contender for the post along with Singh and 20 other, has challenged the selection citing favouritism. Karan Avtar Singh, a 1984-batch IAS officer, was appointed as chairman two months prior to his retirement on August 31. He is learnt to have requested for premature retirement and the approval for the same is pending.The state government is also likely to appoint secretary of the water regulatory authority — a retired or serving officer of the rank of special secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-water-regulatory-body-chairman-to-get-salary-perks-on-par-with-hc-judge/story-1IKygVFRlK15RuhMVHBxGM.html
08-07-2020||City||785 Covid-19 cases in a day: New low for Mumbai||In its lowest new case count in 56 days, Mumbai reported 785 Covid-19 cases on Tuesday. The city had recorded 426 cases on May 12. The case tally is now 86,509. The city, however, reported 65 deaths, taking the toll to 5,002. The total number of discharged patients in Mumbai is 58,137, with a recovery rate of 67%. There are 23,359 active cases. The fatality rate as of Tuesday was 5.80%, followed by a doubling rate of 43 days. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s data (BMC) shows that 55% of the total 4,896 deaths until July 5 are in the 50-70 age group. Twenty per cent deaths are in the 0-50 age group, while the remaining are in the 70-100 age group. In terms of cases, 56% of the around 82,000 cases are from the 0-50 age group.The overall deaths crossed the 500 mark on May 10, and 15 days later, it crossed 1,000. After another 17 days, it crossed the 2,000 mark on June 12. The city quickly breached the 2,500 mark on June 16, and crossed the 4,000 mark on June 25. The data on 4,892 of the 4,896 deaths shows the highest number (1,417) is in the age group of 60-70 and 1,324 in the 50-60 age group. A total of 836 deaths are in the age group of 70 and 80, 633 between 40 and 50, 319 between 80 and 90, 227 between 30 and 40. Seventy-five deaths were reported in the 20-30 age group, 35 deaths in the 90-110 age group, 18 deaths in the 10 to 20 age group, and eight deaths in the 0-10 age group.The highest fatality rate is in the 80-90 age group (18.90%), followed by 18.6% in the 90-100 age group, 15.1% for 70-80 age group, 12.31% for 60-70 age group, 7.96% for 50 to 60 age group, 4.10% for 40-50 age group, 1.5% for 30-40 age group, 0.6% for 10 to 30 age group and 0.5% for 0-10 age group.The jump in fatality rate is also due to recalibration of data that added 862 deaths, not reported or pending from city hospitals, to the figures in June. BMC has claimed these figures are from March and April, which had not been recorded properly. This had led to a controversy with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleging BMC had been fudging and misreporting data on deaths. The civic authorities have denied the claims.According to BMC officials, the deaths and fatality rates are high in those aged above 50 because of comorbidities and other ailments leading to lower immunity. “The death rate is high owing to comorbidities and other ailments. Along with this, other factors such as reporting late or delayed medical attention also result in deaths. We are taking several measures as part of the mission ‘Save Lives’ to bring down the number of deaths.”On June 30, BMC launched ‘Save Lives’ to reduce the fatality rate. BMC had noted that several deaths occurred between 1am and 5am, often when serious and critical patients disconnect oxygen support and leave their beds to go to the toilet. They end up straining themselves and collapse. As part of the ‘Save Lives’ strategy, the civic body decided to keep a bedpan for every bed and a commode near every four beds and instructed all healthcare staff to cooperate with patients who want to use the toilet at night. Several such measures were introduced as part of the strategy for all centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/785-covid-19-cases-in-a-day-new-low-for-mumbai/story-NiPBKm8BxTdve7EWuJHT0H.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||HC allows gynaecologist accused of illegal abortions to resume practice||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday allowed a gynecologist booked for performing illegal abortions and convicted under provisions of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, to resume medical practice. The gynaecologist, Dr Suhas Jadhavar had moved HC challenging an order dated June 18 passed by the additional sessions judge, Pandharpur, refusing to relax a bail condition prohibiting him from practicing medicine till completion of his trial.Dr Jadhavar and his wife Dr Ashwini, also a gynecologist, have been booked by Sangola police in Solapur district in February 2018 for performing illegal abortions.On June 4, 2018, HC granted bail to Dr Ashwini on the condition that she will not practice medicine until the conclusion of the trial.A fortnight later, the Pandharpur sessions court granted bail to Dr Jadhavar on the same condition.Last year, Dr Ashwini moved HC seeking relaxation of the condition, and on February 20, 2020, HC allowed her to resume practice.Dr Jadhavar then moved the sessions court seeking a similar relaxation for himself on the ground of parity, but the sessions court rejected his plea, prompting him to move HC.His lawyer, advocate Vishwanath Talkute, submitted that on the ground of parity, the petitioner doctor was entitled to the same relief as was granted to his wife and a co-accused in the case, but it was refused only on the ground that Dr Jadhavar has been convicted in a separate case under the PCPNDT Act – the legislation that prohibits the use of modern techniques for sex-selective abortions.Assistant public prosecutor RM Pethe had opposed the plea, saying that the doctor was rightly refused the relief in view of his conviction.Justice CV Bhadang, however, felt that the gynecologist should not have been denied the same relief as that granted to the co-accused in the case.The judge felt that the conviction under the PCPNDT Act was an extraneous consideration. “The consideration in my view has to be principally confined to the present case,” said the judge.“Once the said condition has been relaxed in respect of the co-accused, and where the reasons for such relaxation, namely that the co-accused Dr Ashwini Jadhavar has abided by the said condition and that there is no likelihood of the trial coming to end in the near future [which apply equally to the case of the petitioner], the parity cannot be refused,” the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-allows-gynaecologist-accused-of-illegal-abortions-to-resume-practice/story-ab0LpYab4Z6ZC8gZdejbUN.html
08-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s Covid deaths per million half of national average||Punjab’s Covid-19 deaths per million are half of the national average even as the state’s death rate of 3% is almost equal to the countrywide figure. As per the state health department’s daily Covid-19 analysis till July 5, Punjab has witnessed 5 deaths per million against overall India figure of 11, which government officials believe is a positive sign.“The death figure per million reflects that the state has fared well in terms of crisis management. Timely detection of cases and improvement in clinical management are apparently the key reasons behind this,” state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said. Till June 5, the state’s death toll was 164 as compared to India’s total of 19,692.There has been a sudden surge in deaths due to the virus of late, with 99 people succumbing to the virus in June only. Since July 1, the state recorded 26 deaths, taking the toll to 175. The state nodal officer, however, claims that of the 175 deceased, the coronavirus was the only reason of death only among 22.“In rest of the cases, the patients did not die due to Covid-19 but because they had other ailments like high blood pressure, high sugar, renal complication, etc when they tested positive. Less deaths per million when the state is doing more testing is encouraging,” Dr Bhaskar added.Analysis also reveals that Punjab’s cases per million population is 209 against India’s figures of 386 positive patients per million. Also, Punjab has one of the best recovery rates of 70% against the national averages of 61%.In Punjab, 27% of the total cases are active against India’s 36%.LUDHIANA EMERGESAS NEW VIRUS HUBLudhiana has emerged as the new Covid-19 hub in the state whereas Amritsar, which topped the tally of cases for nearly two months, has shown improvement in the past one week.In the week preceding July 5, Amritsar witnessed 74 new cases against Ludhiana’s 298, followed by Jalandhar, Sangrur and and Patiala at 137, 127 and 98, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-covid-deaths-per-million-half-of-national-average/story-dintNIUD9rnUtgyZs8PELL.html

The accused’s elder brother and three friends were also arrested in connection with the girl’s kidnapping.The accused befriended the girl on social media in February this year and used to talk to each other regularly. The man, who works in a bottled water company in Haryana, is a resident of Rajasthan.Last month, the girl along with her elder sister visited her grandmother’s home at Agripada. “On July 1, the accused, along with his brother and three friends, who were from Madhya Pradesh (MP), came to Mumbai in a private seven sitter vehicle without any ePass and picked the girl from Agripada. The accused then took the girl to Rajasthan and raped her in a lodge there,” said an officer from Agripada police.On not finding the girl around when the grandmother asked girl’s mother who is a teacher by profession, if the kid returned to Naigaon (near Virar) home, she said no. The girl’s grandmother then approached police following which a case of kidnapping was registered at Agripada police station. During the preliminary probe, the girl’s family told them that the she was in contact with someone on social media since long and used to regularly talk to him.Through her social media profile, the police zeroed in on one suspect. The police also found some phone numbers linked to the social media account and on going through the call details of both the numbers, traced the number trails to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.Following this, the police formed separate teams and visited the two states. One of the teams arrested the accused, his brother from Rajasthan’s Jhalawad district and rescued the girl. Three of the accused’s friends, who helped him kidnap the girl were arrested from Madhya Pradesh by the other team. One of these three, who drove the vehicle, initially was kept in the dark about the plan by the main accused by saying that the girl is his sister. The police also seized the vehicle used in the kidnapping. One of the accused who aided the kidnapping is still absconding.“We brought the accused to Mumbai on transit remand and on Tuesday produced them in a court that remanded them to police custody up to July 13,” said inspector R Syed from Agripada police station. The accused are booked under the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and Indian Penal Code (IPC), said Sawlaram Agawane, senior inspector of Agripada police, adding, that the girl is sent to a children’s home, keeping in view her safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/22-year-old-from-rajasthan-arrested-for-kidnapping-raping-minor/story-f9ekGWUwRr7yH8AR4IPThO.html

The exact reasons are yet to be confirmed by research bodies that collected water samples.The district collector and forest department both said the natural lake colour was restored last week following heavy rain.The HC bench noted that the Geological Survey of India (GSI) had conducted a survey of the pink water and will submit a report within a week, while reports from scientific bodies such as the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and Agarkar Research Institute, Pune, to be submitted before the next date of hearing on July 22.On Monday, the HC bench of justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor, while hearing a 2009 petition by lawyer Kirti Atul Nipankar and others against various state bodies through senior counsel Anand Parchure, rapped the Buldhana district administration, Lonar Municipal Council, and public works department (PWD) for their indifference to previous HC orders, callous approach in conserving the lake. It cautioned that further disobedience of court orders could lead to contempt proceedings against erring authorities.Based on submissions by Parchure, the bench highlighted two issues of immediate concern – open defecation by Lonar citizens at the lake, including the area where the sewage treatment plant (STP) is located, and discharge of sewage water from Lonar city, freely entering the lake.During the last hearing on June 15, HC had taken cognisance of the change in the lake’s colour, open defecation, and improper sewage treatment. HC had directed four senior lawyers to visit the crater and submit a status report. The inspection was undertaken on June 17.“The inspection report has now been placed on record. We find that the situation obtaining at and around Lonar lake is really pathetic,” the bench said in its 12-page order published on Tuesday. “The pathetic situation has arisen mainly because of the indifference, rather callous indifference of many of the authorities responsible in their own way for conservation and preservation of Lonar crater lake.”Meanwhile, the bench took serious cognisance of the failures of implementing HC directions by the Buldhana collector, and accountability of the officer for not attending hearings, even through video conferencing, for the latest hearing, and in person prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are of the prima-facie view that the Buldhana collector… has failed in discharging fundamental duties in the recent past, thereby owing an explanation to this court for dislodgement of the prima facie impression,” the bench said.Suman Chandra, district collector and magistrate, Buldhana, said, “There has been no intentional negligence. Over the past three months, there was a delay due to Covid-19. Special efforts will be made to ensure that all directions of the HC are complied with at the earliest. Meanwhile, the lake colour has normalised after rain that led to dilution. The colour had turned pink due to the increased salinity.”The bench, however, took cognisance of the efforts by the forest department that were taking matters seriously and had complied with previous directions of the court. The additional chief secretary, revenue and forests, was directed to fill up vacant posts of the range forest officer and assistant conservator of forest before the next date of hearing.“The directions of the HC will be complied with and the additional posts would help us achieve the targets set by the bench much faster,” said a senior forest official.The bench directed the civic body to furnish copies of increasing STP capacity (from 500 kilo litres per day (KLD) to 1,000 KLD) by July 22 and ensure untreated sewage be stopped from entering the lake within three days from the order date. As per orders issued during its previous hearing, samples of ejecta debris were submitted before the bench, which would be inspected by July 22. The bench intends to understand the possible impact of the ejecta blanket (debris surrounding the impact area of a crater made of unique material) during shifting of the Lonar- Kinhi Road and directed PWD to carry out an environmental impact assessment on June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lonar-lake-in-pathetic-condition-hc-raps-state-for-callous-approach-to-preserving-geo-heritage-site/story-gaQMg5c5jE3Q2dTYkrxNVL.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Cyber criminals use fake TikTok app for phishing||After the Indian government banned 59 Chinese mobile apps, cyber fraudsters have come up with a fake TikTok app named TikTok Pro to dupe people. The state cyber police on Tuesday alerted mobile users about this fraud application.Cyber police officers said that despite the ban, many previous TikTok users and fresh ones are still searching for the app on the various internet platforms. The fraudsters have chanced on this opportunity to scam people.“To target people, the fraudsters are randomly sending a link to internet users through SMS or WhatsApp forwards in bulk. On downloading it, malware gets installed in the system and all the vital information of the user gets compromised. It’s a phishing attack,” said Yashasvi Yadav, special inspector general of police (cyber).“We have recently come across this trend, prompting us to issue an advisory,” the senior IPS officer added.The advisory has appealed to internet and mobile users not to fell prey to such fraud and not to click on the link.Police said that by clicking such links, an individual can expose himself to the threat of ransomware that can also take control of the system and vital information. Later, by misusing this personal information, the fraudster may blackmail the victim or use the information for some other offensive acts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyber-criminals-use-fake-tiktok-app-for-phishing/story-0ejJziWHe4FnCLwuLsr4PP.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Family’s financial condition, woman’s unpreparedness no grounds to allow termination of pregnancy: HC||In a significant order, the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday rejected a petition filed by a 39-year-old woman to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy, after it observed that the financial condition of a family or the mental unpreparedness of a woman to be a mother cannot be the grounds to allow termination under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971.The woman, who is 24-weeks pregnant, moved HC stating that she learnt of her pregnancy belatedly, on May 14, when she underwent a sonography. She claimed that the pregnancy occurred owing to the failure of the contraceptive method and she did not suspect that she was pregnant because she has a history of irregular menstruation, owing to which the pregnancy was detected late.She added that the pregnancy at the age of 39 may lead to various complications in her life and cause her physical and mental agony. The woman also claimed that she and her family were not in the financial condition nor was she mentally prepared to become a mother under the given circumstances.The bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Riyaz Chagla, however, refused to accept the grounds put forth by the woman from Ratnagiri district.“We are of the considered view that the reasons for medical termination of pregnancy beyond the statutory limit of 20 weeks viz. that the petitioner and her family are in no condition financially and/or that the petitioner would be of an advanced age of 39 years to be mentally prepared to be a mother are not valid grounds for termination of pregnancy under the said (MTP) Act,” said the bench.Failure of contraceptive method in under certain circumstances is a valid ground for MTP under the Act, but the bench said it was not applicable to the woman. In this regard, the bench accepted the arguments advanced by additional government pleader MP Thakur that the ground will be available only to a married woman who already has a child and the pregnancy has occurred as a result of failure of any device or method used by the married woman for limiting the number of children. The anguish caused by such unwanted pregnancy may be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman, but the petitioner, although married has no child, and hence there can be no limiting the number of children.The petitioner relied in a Supreme Court judgment observing that a pregnant woman has a personal autonomy to exercise her reproductive choice and terminate her pregnancy. But the bench found the reliance misplaced. It clarified that the right to reproductive choice “would necessarily be exercisable in terms of section 3 of the MTP Act, that is, within the statutory limit (of 12 to 20 week’s) provided thereunder.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/family-s-financial-condition-woman-s-unpreparedness-no-grounds-to-allow-termination-of-pregnancy-hc/story-Z6eYGN7RR8FDtCHTRNAzUM.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Introduce new grading pattern only for first-year students this year: MU to Mithibai College||Months after protesting against the management’s decision to introduce a new grading pattern for all students, the University of Mumbai (MU) on Monday directed Vile Parle’s Mithibai College to implement the system progressively, starting with only first-year students this year.MU’s board of examination (BoE), in a letter to the college principal, questioned the institute’s decision to implement the new grading pattern for all the classes, instead of implementing it phase-wise, starting from the fresh batch of students. It further stated that the institute will have to refrain from implementing the new grading pattern to all batches, except their first-year batch.“In response to the reply sent by you to the vice-chancellor of MU, I bring to your notice that any change/modification/revision to grading system has to be implemented only with effect from first year and must not be implemented for students who have already cleared the previous year on the basis of an earlier grading system,” said a letter signed by BoE director, Vinod Patil.He further added that this rule is followed by the university as well as all affiliated colleges, including autonomous institutes.Despite repeated attempts, Mithibai College principal Rajpal Hande and Asoke Basak, chief executive officer of the Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal (SVKM) (the trust which runs the college), were unavailable for comments.HT previously reported that for over four months undergraduate students of Mithibai College protested against the introduction of the new grading system. In February, hundreds of students staged a silent protest on campus after receiving the results of the previous semester. Many, especially final-year students, pointed out that their scores fell drastically in the previous semester after the college introduced a 10-point grading system, instead of the seven-point system followed by MU.“This new system, which was introduced after the college got autonomy, is affecting our scores. We requested the management to introduce the new system in the first semester and not in the middle of the academic year, and we were assured that the academic council will look into it,” said a student.However, despite repeated assurances to students that the decision will be reviewed, the college, two weeks ago, announced the results of second-year students based on the new grading pattern.“We are in a single, integrated three-year course and so the administration can’t introduce new grading patterns without our consent. Changes to the grading system left most students with lower grades as compared to previous semesters and that is unacceptable, especially because it’s not our fault,” said another student, who did not wished to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/introduce-new-grading-pattern-only-for-first-year-students-this-year-mu-to-mithibai-college/story-nbFTtFcHaiZ4Esnj7i6NUN.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Moderate showers on Tuesday with intense isolated spells||Contrary to the weather bureau’s forecast of reduced intensity of rain on Tuesday, the city saw moderate to heavy showers while a few spells of intense showers were witnessed in the suburbs.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) updated its original forecast from ‘light to moderate rain’ to a yellow alert (heavy rain across isolated areas) on Tuesday afternoon. While no alert has been issued for Wednesday, IMD issued a yellow alert and predicted the possibility of heavy rain from Thursday to Saturday.On Tuesday, a Nowcast warning for intense rain spells for Mumbai, Thane, and Satara districts was issued at 2 pm. The suburbs recorded an intense rain spell of 30mm between 11.30 pm and 2.30 pm.Between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm Tuesday, the Santacruz weather station, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 45.2 mm rain while Colaba, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 49.4 mm. IMD classifies 15.6-64.4 mm as moderate rain while 64.5-115.5 mm rain as heavy.For the season so far, Mumbai suburbs have received 972 mm rain from June 1 to July 7 at 5.30pm and is just 28 mm short of the 1,000 mm mark while south Mumbai has received 991mm rain during the same time. While Mumbai has already received 69% of its July average rain, 42% of the seasonal average rainfall has been received over five weeks.“Monsoon conditions are active along the west coast. Under the influence of a well-marked low-pressure area near the Saurashtra-Kutch region, rain intensity over north Konkan including the Mumbai region increased on Tuesday. The weather system is influencing strong westerly winds, which is pulling a lot of moisture from the Arabian Sea and strengthening the offshore trough extending from Gujarat to north Kerala coast,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD.Location-wise rain in the suburbs showed 87mm rain in Mulund, 84 mm in Borivali, 80mm in Kandivali, 75mm in Thane 59mm in Malad, Vikhroli 52mm between 8.30 am and 5.30pm. During the same time, central Mumbai received 35-40 mm rain while the southern tip of the island city recorded 45-50 mm.Independent meteorologists said Tuesday’s intense downpour was unexpected. “This was due to the offshore trough. The trough itself has a periodic north and south oscillation, and on Tuesday, it was active near Ratnagiri since morning but later shifted up towards Raigad. The southwesterly winds further pushed cloud bands towards Mumbai,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, adding that until the Arabian Sea weather system remains active, such sudden changes could be expected. “Until July 9, we could expect such rainfall episodes in Mumbai.”Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom said, “More moisture availability increased rain activity on Tuesday. But that low-pressure system is likely to lose intensity from Wednesday due to which moisture will reduce leading to momentary weakening of the offshore trough. This will lead to light intermittent showers at least until July 12. Rain intensity is expected to increase again next week.” Almost a month after the onset of monsoon, the water stock in city’s seven lakes finally saw a significant increase of 3%in the past two days. The rise in the lake levels was witnessed after heavy downpour in the catchment areas between July 5 and 6. The total water quantum in the seven lakes has gone up to 1.60 lakh million litre which is 11.10% of the required water stock from 1.15 lakh million litre (7.98%) of water stock two days ago. The total storage capacity of these lakes is 14.47 lakh million litre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/moderate-showers-on-tuesday-with-intense-isolated-spells/story-0exmyyzS2IdOJxZu2lBReJ.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Amid talks of rift, Uddhav Thackeray meets Ajit Pawar||A day after differences between the Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) came to the fore, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his deputy Ajit Pawar met on Tuesday evening. The meeting between the two leaders came after NCP chief Sharad Pawar met Thackeray on Monday, who was believed to be upset over the unilateral decision to transfer 10 IPS officers and poaching of five Sena corporators by the NCP.Thackeray and Ajit Pawar met at the Bal Thackeray memorial plot at Shivaji Park and the two leaders are believed to have discussed the two issues and matters related to lockdown. Sena ministers Aaditya Thackeray, Eknath Shinde and Anil Parab, and NCP minister Anil Deshmukh were also present at the former Mayor’s bungalow.Meanwhile, Pawar on Tuesday said appointments of IPS and IAS officers are done with the approval of chief minister, ending the controversy.Earlier in the day, Sena leader Sanjay Raut chose to downplay the friction between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies. Commenting on the recent developments, Raut said, “There is no lack of coordination or bickering or any ‘internal differences’ within the government as the leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis has been claiming. The word ‘internal differences’ is not part of MVA’s dictionary. If there are issues, we discuss and resolve them.”He also said it would not be correct to say that Ajit Pawar engineered the defection of five Sena corporators from Parner Nagar Panchayat in Ahmednagar. The Sena leader termed the issue of corporators a “local” one, which has now been resolved.On Monday, Thackeray conveyed to Pawar that the five corporators should come back to the Sena. The message was sent to the NCP leader by Thackeray’s personal assistant and party secretary Milind Narvekar. However, the five corporators are unwilling to go back and are planning to resign and remain with the NCP, as they are unhappy with the party’s local leadership in Ahmednagar.Muddassar Sayyad, one of the corporators, told TV channels, “If the NCP asks us to return to the Sena, we will resign and seek membership of the NCP, but will not return.” Another corporator Nandkumar Deshmukh said, “Former MLA [Vijay Auti] did not let us work, neither did he do anything for people.”Raut, a Rajya Sabha MP, who is the executive editor of Sena mouthpiece Saamana, recorded an interview with Pawar on Monday. He said Pawar, in the interview that will be published on July 11, has expressed confidence that the three-party government will complete its full term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-talks-of-rift-uddhav-thackeray-meets-ajit-pawar/story-J6y4CnqiKIQpTS3LJa2lnN.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Five weeks after Cyclone Nisarga, 184 villages still without electricity||More than five weeks after Cyclone Nisarga made landfall in Raigad and Ratnagiri districts, damaging thousands of houses and crops, 184 villages are still without electricity. The restoration of electricity is expected to take one more week.Cyclone Nisarga had hit the coastal districts on June 3 and damaged multiple structures, including electricity and mobile poles, leading to the outage of the electricity. More than 1,500 villages in Alibag, Diveagar, and Shrivardhan in Raigad district were disconnected from power. Around 4.2 lakh customers in 628 villages in Mandangad and Dapoli tehsils of Ratnagiri were without power supply after the cyclone hit the villages. Of the 149 villages in Raigad, 35 villages are still without power.“Of 1,900 affected villages in the district, 1,500 had no power supply after the cyclone hit them badly. We could restore the electricity in almost all the villages barring just 149. The restoration work is being done on a war footing despite the many challenges the authorities came across. Some of the employees, who had come from other districts, especially for the restoration work, tested positive for the coronavirus. We expect the total restoration to be completed within a week,” said Padmashree Bainade, resident deputy collector, Raigad.Devendra Sayanekar, superintendent engineer, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited, said, “Around 10,000 houses from four villages in Dapoli and 31 in Mandangad are left disconnected now. Around 8,500 electricity poles and 103 transformers had been damaged, leading to losses of ₹32 crore. We had to bring manpower from other districts like Solapur, Pune, and Sangli to complete the work on priority. At least 800 employees are at work of restoration and expect it to be completed in a week.”In Shrivardhan, the cyclone damaged crops on 11,430 hectares and damaged 1.83 lakh houses in Raigad. Ratnagiri witnessed damage to crops on 58 hectares, while more than 28,000 houses were partially or fully damaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/five-weeks-after-cyclone-nisarga-184-villages-still-without-electricity/story-c0eoW9YOIsQROdQQLStD8H.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||SC to hear Maratha reservation petition on July 15, no stay on state law||The Supreme Court (SC) will undertake hearings on a day-to-day basis in the Maratha reservation case following a plea made by petitioners challenging the constitutional validity of the Maharashtra law granting quota to the community in education and jobs.The Apex court has asked all the counsels to submit and specify the time they need to argue. It will take up hearing on petitions now on July 15 and may pass an interim order on the matter.The three-judge bench led by Justice L Nageswara Rao heard the petitions, including one challenging reservation benefit to postgraduate medical students from the Maratha community in admission for this academic year on Tuesday.The court indicated that the petition challenging the validity of the law can be heard on a day-to-day basis following a plea from the petitioners. The court also seemed amenable to conduct physical hearings after senior advocate Shyam Divan insisted on it. Mukul Rohatgi, former attorney general of India, who is representing Maharashtra government, too supported the demand.Petitioner Vinod Patil, in his plea, had demanded the case to be transferred to the five-judge bench. However, the court ruled that out in the current scenario.Public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan, who is heading a cabinet sub-committee formed to review progress of legal matters for Maratha reservation and take decisions, said the Apex court again refused to grant a stay on the law for reservation. “The petitioners had demanded a stay on reservation but the battery of senior lawyers led by Mukul Rohatgi for the state argued effectively,” said Chavan.He said that the Apex court will now hear petitions on granting reservation benefits in admissions for postgraduate medical courses on July 15. “The state will fight to ensure that the students from the community will continue to get reservation benefits in admissions,” he said.The erstwhile BJP-led state government has granted a 16% reservation to the Maratha community by enacting the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, in government jobs and education, in November 2018. The Act was upheld by the Bombay high court in June 2019, but it said that the quantum of 16% was not justifiable, and should be reduced to 12%-13%, as recommended by the State Backward Classes Commission in its report.Later, it was challenged in the SC. On February 5, the SC, while hearing a bunch of petitions against Maratha reservation, refused to stay the high court order.Recently, the state government reduced reservation quota to 12% for students from the Maratha community for junior college admissions from this academic year. The decision was taken following the order issued by the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sc-to-hear-maratha-reservation-petition-on-july-15-no-stay-on-state-law/story-GpiS8Ch8tLwSFSrYV9r9DN.html

The panel had received a complaint from a human rights activist, Sukhvinder Singh Nara. A copy of the notice accessed by Hindustan Times reads that the commission had received a complaint by Sukhvinder Singh Nara and action was taken on July 1, marking the due date to the DC as August 22. “The commission directs the Yamunanagar DC and the district jail superintendent to send a detailed report (covering all aspects leading to the death, including action if any taken on the complaint by relatives of deceased), inquest report, postmortem report, video cassette of the postmortem examination, chemical examination and histopathology report of viscera, final cause of death based on FSL report, complete medical treatment record of the deceased, site plan of the scene of occurrence, panchnama of scene of occurrence and magisterial enquiry report,” the notice mentioned. The commission has also asked for an action-taken report on the magisterial enquiry report, medico legal certificate, besides copy of the FIR and other relevant documents.NHRC has meanwhile asked the Haryana state human rights commission whether they have taken cognisance of this case or not. Despite repeated attempts, comments of DC Mukul Kumar could not be elicited on the development. Jail superintendent Ratan Singh said that he has been transferred, whereas superintendent of police Kamaldeep Goyal reserved his comments on the issue. “Whatever the commission has asked will be duly sent to it,” he, however, said. HAVE ASKED Rs 1 CRORE COMPENSATION FOR FAMILY: PETITIONERHuman rights activist Sukhvinder Singh Nara, the petitioner in the case, said he had approached the commission the next day Raman Valmiki, a Dalit, died in judicial custody. “I have asked for a compensation of Rs 1 crore for the family, besides action against the jail officials involved in the case,” he added. Raman’s father Rajinder Valmiki said, “My son was not given proper medical treatment because of negligence on the part of jail authorities and he died inside the prison.”THE CASERaman Valmiki, a Yamunanagar resident in his 30s, was sent to judicial custody on April 22 after he was arrested in an attempt to murder case. As per police records, the FIR against him was registered at Yamunanagar City police station on March 10 on the complaint of Manoj Kumar, a liquor contractor. He died on April 25. The jail authorities claimed that his health started deteriorating in the afternoon and he was taken to jail hospital from where he was shifted to the civil hospital.

The proposal has been earlier deferred by the authority, which had asked the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to conduct a public hearing on the project, specifically for the residents of Worli sea face, “considering the impact of environment at this location owing to the proposed elevated corridor”. Anil Diggikar, chairman, MCZMA and principal secretary, environment, confirmed that the connector project has been approved. “We had asked them [MMRDA] to undertake a public consultation in the earlier meeting, which they have done,” said Diggikar.The project, estimated to cost ₹1,276 crore, will connect Worli to the upcoming 22-km Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) at Sewri. MTHL, a sea-bridge, will connect Mumbai to Navi Mumbai. The elevated corridor, which starts at Sewri railway station, will pass over Eastern Freeway, the monorail on Acharya Donde Marg, Dr Ambedkar Road, Senapati Bapat Marg and Dr Annie Besant Road. According to MMRDA, 438 metres on both ends of the corridor falls under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)-II. In the public consultation, MMRDA said, citizens had asked if the corridor can be built underground as it passes over congested areas and if it can also be connected to the coastal road project.The MCZMA on Tuesday also gave CRZ clearance to the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation’s (MMRC) Vidhan Bhavan station box and allied activities. Meanwhile, the authority is yet to approve the multi-modal corridor between Virar-Alibaug, which was also discussed on Tuesday. MCZMA had earlier deferred the proposal, stating MMRDA must look at “minimal environmental damage”. “The project involves usage of forest land and mangroves. The authority needs a forest clearance,” Diggikar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coastal-authority-clears-4-5-km-elevated-corridor-between-sewri-and-worli-in-mumbai/story-CiGG0UqMwZ0eHk391Tzb3L.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||1.2 million snakebite deaths in India from 2000 to 2019: Study||India has recorded 1.2 million snakebite deaths from 2000 to 2019, with an average of 58,000 deaths annually, a recent international study said.Close to 70% of deaths occurred in rural areas recorded during monsoon at low-altitude regions. Rate of deaths was highest across eight states – Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand. Most deaths were due to Russell’s vipers followed by kraits and cobras.Published in the peer-reviewed journal e-Life on Tuesday, the study was conducted by the Centre for Global Health Research (CGHR), University of Toronto, Canada, Oxford University, United Kingdom, the Madras Crocodile Bank, Chennai, Indian Council of Medical Research, Delhi, and St John’s National Academy of Health Sciences, Bengaluru.“India is witnessing almost half of the world’s total snakebite deaths,” said professor David Warrell, author of the paper.Overall, the study analysed 2,833 snakebite deaths from 6.11 lakh verbal autopsies in the Indian Million Death Study (MDS), nationally representative mortality survey, from 2001 to 2014, and assessed data over 20 years (2000-2019) covering 87,590 snakebites.Venomous snakebites are medical emergencies that escalate to deaths due to killing by shock, paralysis, haemorrhage or acute kidney injury, the study said. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated snakebite as type A or priority disease and aims to reduce deaths by 50% by 2030.“Snakebites need to be made a nationally notified disease in India. Health facilities in rural spaces across high-burden states are inadequate,” said Romulus Whitaker, author, and founder, Madras Crocodile Bank.The study revealed gross underreporting of snakebites in India with the Union health ministry’s declaration of 15,500 deaths between 2003 and 2015, which was only one-tenth of 1.54 lakh deaths detected by MDS during the same period.Whitaker added that government data reflects a fraction of what is happening on ground. “Anti-venom is not being distributed to resolve the issue though India has sufficient manufacturing capacity to produce large volumes,” said Whitaker.The latest analysis identified an 18% increase in annual average deaths in India due to snakebites as against a Lancet study from October 2017 that reported 49,000 envenoming deaths every year. “Overall lifetime risk (before age 70) of being killed by snakebite is about 1 in 250, but in some areas, especially high burden states, lifetime risk reaches one in 100. While 50% of deaths occurred between the age group of 30 and 69 years, over a quarter of deaths were for children less than 15 years old,” said Prabhat Jha, author and director, CGHR.MAHARASHTRA STORY: LOW BURDEN STATEMaharashtra witnessed a steep decline in deaths during this period but had some of the highest cases of snakebites over 15 years, according to the Centre’s data. The latest study however pointed out that while there was underreporting of data by the government, there were better medical facilities and faster response time for snakebite cases than other states allowing Maharashtra to be identified as a low burden for snakebite deaths. Independent herpetologist Kedar Bhide said that the state needed to declare compensation for snakebite deaths as it does for mortalities related to wild animals and identify such cases as a notified disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-2-million-snakebite-deaths-in-india-from-2000-to-2019-study/story-2f5cvgKv8RPKkyqNuInrgJ.html

State forest dept seeks clarity from green ministry||The Union ministry of road transport has expressed its intention to make it easier for state bodies to garner faster forest clearances on national highway projects. The Maharashtra forest department, however, has asked the Union environment ministry to issue formal instructions on recent directions issued by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) regarding diversion of forest land for such projects.Sanjeev Kumar, chief engineer, MoRTH said, “The directions strictly pertain to major highway projects proposed by the Centre. Some of the stretches of these projects are handled by state agencies, but owing to existing norms applicable to them, there is a delay in overall project completion. We are not exempting any state agency from existing rules nor are we changing the rules, we are only bringing them under the aegis of the Centre while applying for clearances (under Forest Conservation Act) for faster forest land diversion.”Kumar added that the decision was finalised only after a meeting with the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC).On June 30, MoRTH issued a letter to all state governments informing them that state bodies like the public works department (PWD) and other agencies involved in developing national highway projects be exempted from purchasing non-forest land in lieu of forest area being diverted. This is mandatory for state agencies as per the Forest Conservation (FC) Act, 1980. Instead, MoRTH suggested, state agencies be allowed to carry out compensatory afforestation (CA) on degraded forest land, which applies to certain small projects (link roads, minor irrigation projects etc which directly benefit local livelihood) under the Act.The letter also stated that since MoRTH and central bodies like the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) are already exempted from the rule (purchasing non-forest area for loss of forest cover), state bodies should use the name ‘MoRTH’ as the user agency while applying for project clearances on the Union environment ministry’s Parivesh portal - a web-based application for online monitoring and submission of project proposals.The move was intended to ‘avoid unnecessary delay in identification for transfer of non-forest land and diversion of forest land approval could be expedited’, the letter read.Meanwhile, apprehending that state agencies may commence submitting proposals based on MoRTH’s letter, Sanjeev Gaur, nodal officer, Maharashtra forest department said, “We have referred the issue to the director-general of forest (DG), MoEFCC, to issue formal communication regarding the ministry’s stand on the MoRTH letter, and convey further course of directions when we receive such proposals.”MoEFCC DG Sanjay Kumar and inspector general AK Mohanty refused to comment. However, a MoEFCC officer looking into FC issues, requesting anonymity said, “The MoRTH directive will apply to those state agencies working directly with NHAI only. Specific details on forest area diversion are still being examined, and a notification in this regard will be issued soon.” Environmentalists vehemently objected to the decision. “India roughly has 20% forest area, and the cover needs to be 33% as per the National Forest Policy. To ensure we have additional 13%, mandatory conditions under the FC Act to bring equivalent non-forest land have to be followed by every project proponent, irrespective of who they are,” said Kishor Rithe, former member, National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) Standing Committee (SC).Environmentalist Debi Goenka explained that post Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s demise, the FC Act was diluted due to a lack of political will. “Earlier equivalent revenue land (non-forest land) was to be declared as forests for areas being diverted for projects. Post Gandhi’s death, a newly evolved strategy saw agencies pay for CA on degraded forest land twice the extent of forest area diverted for faster clearance. However, most cases of CA are a disaster as they are monoculture plantations that do not survive. We are losing thousands of hectares of forest land annually with negligible restoration in comparison,” said Goenka.Former SC-NBWL member Bittu Sahgal said CA had been a total failure so far. “Several high court and Supreme Court orders highlighted the threat of not having enough forest cover in India since user agencies only accept carrying out CA on degraded forest land. The courts also raised concerns about the failure of this practice. Such plantations are not being done properly and have yielded unsuccessful results,” he said adding, “If MoEFCC brings such agencies under this sub-clause, India will continue losing forest land. We would never achieve the 33% forest cover goal, as we won’t have that many forest areas left.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/issue-clear-instructions-state-forest-department-to-green-ministry/story-OLZcHu1TJvrRaD5a7dXsdL.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Developers in Mumbai woo migrant workers back to sites with sops||Expensive airline tickets, enhanced wages, medical insurance, weekly doctor visits... just some of the perks that Mumbai’s real estate barons are offering. Not to their Ivy-league-educated senior executives, but to entice hundreds of thousands of construction workers who left the city in the wake of the Covid-19 spread in April, May and June this year to return.According to the Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry (shortened as CREDAI-MCHI), the apex industry body in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), close to 700,000 of the 900,000 on-site real estate workforce migrated back to their hometowns as soon as Mumbai became the country’s worst-affected Covid-19 hotspot.“There are hardly 200,000 on-site workers left in Mumbai, and a majority of the projects are in limbo. We desperately need to start work and hence we are trying all means possible to bring them back,” said Rajesh Prajapati, managing committee member, Credai-MCHI. “The workers are not ready to come back fearing infection and due to family pressure. We are assuring them that we will take good care of them, and offer them best of the facilities such as Covid-19 insurance as well as weekly visits by doctors.”On June 8, the Maharashtra government allowed private construction activity to restart, but builders say they have been facing an acute shortage of workers since then, and that they are left with no option but to lure them back with flight tickets, enhanced wages, boarding facilities and medical insurance, in addition to weekly medical check-ups.Recently, the Avighna Group — best known for erecting highrises in the erstwhile mills cluster in central Mumbai — arranged flight tickets for 88 workers from West Bengal for their new project in south Mumbai’s Worli area. “Work is delayed by six months due to the pandemic, and we cannot afford more setbacks. This forced us to arrange flight tickets as well as offer 25% extra wages for our workers,” said Nishant Agrawal, managing director, Avighna Group. He said Avighna has spent ₹9 lakh to transport them from West Bengal to Mumbai.Real estate executives said they have appointed independent contractors who are scouting for skilled construction workers from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha.Real estate consultancy Liases Foras warns that the sector will face long-term crises if work does not start soon. “The disbursement of money by the banks to companies is construction-linked (according to the stage of the project) and hence builders will not get money till work starts and there is progress in the project. Delays will make projects unviable,” said Pankaj Kapoor, CEO, Liases Foras.Liases Foras estimates that there are at least 4,500 ongoing projects in the MMR, of which less than 40% have started after the June 8 notification. “Here also, the work has not started in full swing and is progressing slowly,” Kapoor added.Take Shraddha Lifescapes. This construction firm, which had started their Jogeshwari (in north-west Mumbai) project just before the March lockdown, has sent contractors scouting for workers in places like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. “Our project is delayed by at least a year, and if we don’t get workers fast, it will be delayed further,” said Bhavesh Sanghrajka, CEO, Shraddha Lifescapes. Shraddha Lifescapes has constructed projects in places like IC Colony in Borivli in north Mumbai and Jogeshwari, and is offering higher wages to bring back its workforce.The National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco), however, estimates that reverse migration has started and the construction workforce will return within the next three months. “There is no work in the villages and hence we are seeing a healthy reverse migration. We estimate that all construction workers will return by Diwali (November),” said Rajan Bandelkar, president, Naredco (Maharashtra).Niranjan Hiranandani, co-founder and managing director of real estate major Hiranandani Group, said the process of workforce returning to Mumbai has started. “They are attracted to Mumbai as it gives them employment and they will return,” he said. “Things will normalise in the coming months as people are realising that they need to live with this virus. Those who have gone are talking to other labourers, and the response has been positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/developers-in-mumbai-woo-migrant-workers-back-to-sites-with-sops/story-dGdZMNktlO8V8sKmuLCFaN.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||MMRDA nod for raising height of Ambedkar statue, 15 other proposals||In a meeting chaired by Maharashtra urban development minister Eknath Shinde after four months, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority cleared 16 proposals, including increasing the height of the upcoming Babasaheb Ambedkar memorial at Indu Mills; a policy to enable direct access between Metro stations by private developers and an in-principle approval for the redevelopment of ‘E’ block in BKC, expected to earn MMRDA ₹18,000 crore.BG Pawar, joint metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA said, “Raising the height of the Ambedkar memorial was already passed by the Maharashtra cabinet. Since we are the executing authority, the amendment was included on Tuesday.” “The authority meeting was to be held on February 28, but got delayed later owing to the lockdown,” said Pawar. In January, the cabinet approved the height to be raised from 250ft to 350ft with a pedestal height at 100ft. The total height of the proposed statue will be 450ft now.MMRDA on Tuesday also approved a 550m ‘hanging pedestrian bridge’, connecting City Park, BKC and the Maharashtra Nature Park. In January, HT had reported that the plan was revived four years after MMRDA held a global competition for the bridge. A decade-old plan to build a funicular railway in the tourist place of Matheran and a ₹550-crore Mahavir Nagar-Gorai ropeway project was also approved on Tuesday, Pawar added.Along with this, a multi-modal integration project for Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro 7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E), that will enable last-mile connectivity in the western suburbs and a revised proposal for the integrated ticketing system that will enable commuters to use a single card to travel across different modes was also passed. “MMRDA has also decided to purchase a plot belonging to Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd worth ₹800 crore in Rasayani in Raigad district to develop it in the future,” an official from MMRDA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrda-nod-for-raising-height-of-ambedkar-statue-15-other-proposals/story-pqiaHjRn7WcADRx6FJnZ0J.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||PMC Bank scam accused Rakesh Wadhawan admitted in hospital||Seventy-two-year-old Rakesh Wadhawan, an accused in the ₹6,670 crore Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) bank scam and director of Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) who was lodged in the Arthur Road central prison, has been admitted to JJ Hospital after he complained of breathlessness.Deepak Pandey, inspector general of police (south range) confirmed the development and said that he was rushed to the hospital on Monday night.Police sources said that his condition is said to stable now. When asked if Wadhawan will be undergoing a Covid test, Pandey said, “It will be decided by the doctors at JJ Hospital. He also has other comorbidities.”Wadhawan and his son Sarang were arrested on October 3, 2019, by the economic offence wing (EOW) in Mumbai after they were named in the FIR registered by Reserve Bank of India on September 30.EOW in their charge sheet claimed that Rakesh is the key accused of the fraud as the ‘patriarch’ of the HDIL’s business. He gradually plotted the fraud and obtained loans from the bank with the help of other accused, the agency alleged. The police investigation has revealed that HDIL accounted for 73% of the bank’s total loan book.On September 23, 2019, the RBI had placed restrictions on PMC Bank and barred it from proceeding fresh loans or accepting deposits.The EOW has arrested a total of 15 people in the case. All accused have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-scam-accused-rakesh-wadhawan-admitted-in-hospital/story-k82pz4fz9WnvEvg9eUhlqO.html

08-07-2020||Mumbai||No prescription needed for Covid test in Mumbai’s private labs now||Citizens can now get tested for Covid-19 from private clinics without requiring any doctor’s prescription or self-declaration after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday issued an order. In view of the importance of early detection of the disease, the civic body has decided to allow citizens to get tests done from all 17 private clinics approved by the BMC without needing any prescription. This comes into effect from Wednesday. In Thane too, symptomatic residents can get themselves tested without showing a prescription, as per the civic chief’s directive on Tuesday.The cost for Covid tests is ₹2,500 for swab samples collected in private clinics or health camps and ₹2, 800 for sample-collection at home. Earlier, the testing charges were capped at ₹4,500, which was recently brought down. By allowing everyone to get the tests done, BMC is aiming to increase the testing numbers from the current 4,000-5,000 tests daily.In a press statement issued on Tuesday, BMC said, “Earlier, a doctor’s prescription was mandatory for getting tests done. The condition has now been removed. This will make it easier for citizens to get tested. If the test is positive, a bed will be allotted by the team set up by us in local civic ward offices. This will help patients get timely treatment, which is much more crucial for early recovery.”BMC further stated that those who are in institutional quarantine facilities (those who are high-risk contacts of a Covid-19 patient) will be allowed to go home only after their Covid-19 tests are negative. Prior to this, the civic body had permitted testing only for those contacts who had symptoms and could produce a doctor’s prescription. Later on June 7, BMC allowed all direct and high-risk contacts of the patient, including asymptomatic, to get tested by a private lab without requiring a doctor’s prescription. The tests were said to be carried out between five and 10 days of coming in contact with the patient. Now any citizen can approach a private laboratory if he or she suspects they were infected and want to get tested for Covid-19. In Thane, earlier, no testing was allowed without a prescription, however, the new civic commissioner, Dr Vipin Sharma, on Tuesday has given directives to test symptomatic patients without prescription.“Earlier, general practitioners were not allowed to prescribe testing for Covid-19. Only doctors from fever clinic or corporation was allowed to prescribe for the test. However, we have now given them permission. This is to ensure that timely treatment is provided, those with symptoms can be isolated immediately if testing is done. This will also help break the chain for Covid-19 in the city,” said Sharma, commissioner.Meanwhile, Mumbai municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, on Tuesday, directed all ward officers of 24 administrative wards in the city to increase daily testings in high-risk zones by conducting rapid antigen tests every day through setting up camps or using mobile vans. The ward officers have been directed to conduct at least 250 rapid tests through private laboratories assigned to the wards. For high- risk zones, the commissioner has directed officers to collect samples of all symptomatic individuals as well as their contacts having co-morbidities. A circular regarding this was issued on Tuesday and has come into effect already.

08-07-2020||Mumbai||Can’t allow street vendors amid pandemic: State to HC||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday informed Bombay high court that they do not intend to allow street vendors to resume their business during Covid-19 pandemic.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the bench of justice Amjad Sayed and justice MS Karnik that as of now the government does not intend to frame any policy allowing street vendors to resume their business during Covid-19 pandemic, as street vending is a highly unregulated sector and it will contribute to the spread of the virus.He was responding to public interest litigation (PIL) filed by activist Manoj Oswal, for a declaration that the imposition of a complete ban on sale of products or food by street vendors to be illegal or unconstitutional and violative of the rights of the people to conduct legitimate business.The 43-year-old animal welfare and animal rights activist from Pune said in his petition that the nationwide lockdown has led to serious issues for the survival of a large component of the population, including street vendors and traders who own very small informal shops and vends. The situation of people working as employees in the informal sector was equally pitiable and they were left to survive without any government support, it said, adding that since they are not registered with the Government in any form, it would be impossible to provide them with any monetary relief. “The only possible relief for them is that they are allowed to conduct their daily business with reasonable restrictions,” the PIL added.On June 19, HC had asked Kumbhakoni to obtain instructions on the framing of appropriate policy to enable street vendors to earn their livelihood. The directive came after Oswal’s counsel, advocate Ashish Verma had pointed out that, on June 2, Pune Municipal Corporation had decided to allow street vendors, when Pune is a hotbed of Covid-19. Verma urged the court to direct the state to frame a policy to allow street vending across Maharashtra.On Tuesday, Verma again pointed out to HC that street vendors belong to the poorest section of the society and this vast population has been compelled to live without a source of livelihood for past three-four months, and they must be allowed to earn a livelihood.Advocate general, however, responded saying the government has not allowed even standalone restaurants to resume services. Only the restaurants attached to hotels are allowed to serve food to the guests.The bench then asked him to put the stand of the government on affidavit and posted the PIL for further hearing after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-t-allow-street-vendors-amid-pandemic-state-to-hc/story-ONA5aVBeaCHjQ8a8t5escM.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sees lowest 1-day spike in cases in 56 days||Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 5,134 Covid-19 cases, taking its tally to 217, 121, as Mumbai recorded its lowest single-day jump in new infections in 56 days with 785 more patients. Mumbai’s tally is 86,509, while there are 89,294 active cases in the state after 1,18,558 patients have recovered. The recovery rate of the state is 56.4%. The state also reported 224 new fatalities in the past 24 hours, of which 137 were in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), including 64 in Mumbai. The death toll in Mumbai crossed the 5,000 mark to touch 5,002. The state toll stands at 9,250. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state dropped to 4.26% from 4.69% on June 25. The national fatality rate is 2.80%. At present 6.32 lakh people are home quarantined, while 45,463 are institutionally quarantined. The state, till Tuesday, has conducted 11,61,311 tests and the positivity rate stands at 18.69%. After constantly reporting daily new infections at an average of 1,280 over the past week, the Mumbai new case count dropped to its lowest since 426 cases were reported on May 12. Although Mumbai reported a drop in cases, cases in other cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) have witnessed a rise after economic and commercial activities were opened up under Mission Begin Again. Mumbai’s share in the state case tally has dropped to 40.44% on Monday, from 56.58% on June 8, when private offices were allowed to operate. During the period, rest of MMR’s share (eight corporations excluding Mumbai) rose to 29.91% from 18.7%. The share of the cases in state figures of cities like Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli rose to 5.78%, 4.39% and 5.12% during the period, from 5.67%, 4.06% and 2.13% respectively. Rest of MMR’s share in the toll of the state rose to 17.48% from 13.63% on June 8. The CFR of Mumbai is still high at 5.76%, against rest of MMR’s 2.49% and Maharashtra’s 4.26% The state government, on Tuesday, extended the timings of shops and markets by 2 hours across the state. The earlier order issued on June 29 had restricted shops to remain open till 5pm from 9 am to avoid crowding at market places in cities and rural areas. The decision was taken after the authorities found unnecessary crowding after the relaxations were rolled out from June 3. The order issued on Tuesday however extended it by 2 more hours and the order will come into effect from July 9. “The market and shop owners associations will ensure that the additional relaxations do not lead to crowding in shopping areas,” the orders issued by chief secretary Sajay Kumar stated.The shops will continue to operate on alternate days, while markets will remain open throughout the week. The state government has allowed hotels and lodges to open their shutters from Wednesday. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the authorities are wary about the spread of the virus after more activities, including operation of hotels were allowed. “Most of this in the beginning had come from hotels and thus we have taken due care, while opening hotels and restaurants. We have issued a strict SOP for them to ensure social distancing and there was no spread of the virus through them. We want to draw a perfect balance between economic normalcy and containment of the virus,” he said. Thane mayor Naresh Mhaske said, “We have adequately augmented bed capacity and there is no dearth of beds with oxygen or ventilator facilities. It is true that the cases are high compared to Mumbai, but we are continuing with aggressive tracing and testing of suspected contacts. Earlier the transmission was more in slums, now it has shifted to buildings and colonies and thus it is comparatively easier for us to contain the spread. The number of cases is expected to drop in next few weeks.”The state government is also wary about the surge more in MMR than in the rest of the state if more activities are allowed. Besides the differences in relaxations from the lockdown curbs in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, the bureaucracy and political leadership is also divided over the exemptions to the sectors. The permissions to the hotels and lodges to open from Wednesday, was a surprise for a section of bureaucrats and ministers. They were expecting the opening of more transportation facilities as it could have normalised more number of industrial and commercial activities. “Ramping up public transport and allowing more workforce in the offices, was on the priority list. The decision of opening of hotels and lodges was surprising for many in the government,” said a state government official.Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders are not on the same page with the Shiv Sena leadership when it comes to relaxations from the lockdown curbs. NCP and Congress want more relaxations, against which Sena chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is opposed, as he wants to go slow in the wake of rising cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-lowest-1-day-spike-in-cases-in-56-days/story-lcqNjg0dxQX09OnLZNpLzL.html

The Main Brijpuri Road was one of those places where large -scale destruction of properties and loss of lives took place on February 24 and 25, police said in the charge sheet. The mosque that was vandalised before rioters attempted to set it on fire and Rajdhani Public Senior Secondary School, which was torched, are near the Main Brijpuri Road, said a senior police officer, privy to the cases. “Nearly 10 people were killed from both the communities on the first two days(February 24 and 25) in the area.

They were outside their house when the mob assaulted, stabbed and murdered them.,” said a police officer associated with the probe.Police said in the charge sheet that on February 25, large-scale rioting took place in many parts of northeast Delhi. Around 4 pm, the members of one particular community targeted the shops and houses of the other community, which was fiercely resisted and this led to a large-scale rioting, stone pelting and arson from both the sides, police said in the charge sheet.“...three members of the minority community were caught by a mob in front of Gali No 10, main Brijpuri Road near Chawla Kirana Store. They were assaulted and it led to their death.

The MC officials, accompanied by police, conducted a surprise raid, seized at least 15 animals, and sent them to a community centre. Karnal MC joint commissioner Gagandeep Singh said the corporation had identified 188 plots at Pingli village for relocating dairy farms and in February this year, a draw of plots was held in the presence of dairy owners. Seventy-nine dairy owners had participated in the draw, 54 of whom deposited 20% of the payment, but others did not show any interest. He said they had served a 15-day ultimatum on dairy owners to pay the 20% of the allotment money, but on failing to get any response, they conducted the drive. The joint MC chief said it was a violation of MC norms to keep animals for dairy farming purposes in the city and violators will have to face action. “The owners will have to pay ₹5,000 to get their animals back,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/karnal-mc-officials-seal-12-dairy-farms/story-IqSc7BysZMwJmGGd0moLSP.html

The action came after the district administration ordered registration of FIR against the owners of New India Rice mills and Balaji Rice Mill over ‘irregularities’ in their stock. Karnal deputy commissioner (DC) Nishant Kumar Yadav confirmed that orders for the registration of FIR have been issued. It is pertinent to mention here that the district administration had swung into action after two trucks allegedly carrying the rice meant for the public distribution in Uttar Pradesh were seized by officials of the district food and supplies department. During an investigation, it was found that the owners of both these rice mills had purchased the PDS rice from Uttar Pradesh to complete their stock and return it to the government. DC Yadav then ordered a physical verification of their stock where 4,520 quintal rice was found missing. Karnal superintendent of police (SP) Surender Singh Bhoria said the FIR has been registered under sections 406, 420 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. Inquiry marked against all mills in districtAs per the information, 238 rice mills in the district were given 11.47 lakh MT of paddy for milling as per the custom milling of rice contract and they had to return the rice to the government by June 30. But, only 77% of the rice was returned by the mills. “We have ordered an inquiry under the Karnal ADC against all rice mills and physical verification of their stock would be done. Action will be taken if any irregularity is found in their stock,” the DC said. In a similar case in February, brothers Rajnish Miglani and Girish Miglani, owners of RG Enterprises, were booked after 4,000 MT rice worth Rs 7 crore was found missing from their stock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-karnal-millers-booked-after-4-520-quintal-rice-found-missing-from-their-stock/story-K15nK6DCFEZuDGqe6XaKZL.html

It is observed that bout 5-10% of people who are giving their sample do not give correct phone numbers making it difficult to trace them if they are found positive later. “The testing teams have been told to get the ID proofs of all persons getting tested and also record their mobile numbers after proper verification. We have also directed the municipal corporation to coordinate with us for getting tests done for vulnerable sections like fruit and vegetable vendors and those engaged in the distribution of milk and groceries, ”district magistrate Ajay Kumar Pandey said.Meanwhile, with cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) rising, officials of the district administration are pushing for stricter measures to ensure compliance with social distancing norms and curfew rules. The administration on Tuesday said that shops, where social distancing norms were not being followed, will be shut down for five days and legal action will be taken against shopkeepers.DM Ajay Shankar Pandey also directed the police to step up inspections in public places and impose a fine of ₹100 on those are found without a mask and double the penalty amount if the offense is repeated.The directives come after the district officials had a meeting with Senthil Pandian C, the nodal officer appointed by the Uttar Pradesh government.DM Pandey said that stricter measures are needed for strict compliance of social distancing norms to contain the spread of the infection. “I have directed the officials to ensure compliance of social distancing norms and curfew norms by shop owners. If they are found violating the norms, their shops will be shut for a period of five days and police will also ensure legal action against them under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant). On the other hand, we will also felicitate market associations in they enforce social distancing norms effectively,” Pandey added.Under the guidelines issued for unlock 2, which kicked in on July 1 in the state, the UP government has enforced a night curfew in six districts of Meerut division, which included Ghaziabad, from 8pm to 6am.

As many as six suspects have been arrested in the case so far.The victim, Dr Maha Singh, was shot dead allegedly by a group of people on August 7, 2012, in Silani village of Sohna, when he was lowering the shutter of his clinic to go to his house in Nuh. Police had registered a case and after investigation by state crime branch, an untraced report was filed by the police in 2015. The case was re-opened and marked to crime branch of Sohna, following which the police had arrested four persons- Rizwan, 34, Vikram, Jaydeep and Raju- from Sonepat in February and March 2019.The main accused, Dharambir, who is the former sarpanch of village Ahir Majra in Sonepat, was arrested from Kaithal in April last year for allegedly giving a contract of Rs 25 lakh to a group of people to murder Singh.The sixth suspect, Ramniwas alias Bholu, was arrested by the crime branch of Sohna from village Palri Khurd in Sonepat.

08-07-2020||Gurugram||2,000 people to be covered in second serological survey in Gurugram||To expedite the process tracing the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in Gurugram, the state health department has planned to expand the coverage of the second round of serological survey. The test, which helps to check undetected community transmission, will now be conducted among 2,000 people to check the presence of Covid-19 antibodies in their blood serum. The state health department officials are presently working on the details of the survey but said that the survey will start as soon the plan is ready. A serological survey is a tool used by the epidemiologists to study the prevalence of an infection within a community. Officials of the health department said the survey will cover people from different backgrounds, including cab drivers, people working in malls and shopping complexes and other sections of the vulnerable population, as per the guidelines of the Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR). “The sample size of the serological survey is being increased to 2,000. It will involve the use of 278 antibody kits that are yet to be utilised from the previous stock of 460 kits,” Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), said. The district health department conducted the first round of serological survey on June 24 at the CMO office in the old Civil Hospital. At least 182 blood samples were collected mostly from police personnel, healthcare workers, etc. A total of 32 people tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. “A detailed plan will be prepared by the health department this week to conduct the survey in different parts of the city,” said Yadav.Following the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines on the serological survey, 20 categories, such as immunocompromised patients, healthcare workers, industrial workers, aviation staff, taxi and auto drivers, prisoners, staff members of urban local bodies (ULBs) and persons working with banks, post offices, couriers and telecom companies, among others, will be covered. A few other sections, such as preoperative patients, pregnant women and elderly people have also been included by the state government in the survey. Yadav said that these people will be covered in both containment as well as non-containment zones across the city. The survey will involve the use of an improved Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Elisa)-based antibody kit. The IgG ELISA test has been approved by the ICMR because of it of its high sensitivity and specificity. Al least 50% of the kit will be used on patients, who have been tested positive within the last two weeks. The remaining kits will be used on those who have no history of contracting the Covid-19 infection. Studies show that the IgG antibodies start appearing after two weeks of the onset of infection. Even if the patients have recovered, the antibodies can last for several months. To conduct the test, the five millilitres of blood is collected, which is then separated into blood and plasma. The plasma is used to detect the antibodies developed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infection but indicates episodes of Covid-19 infection in the recent past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-to-cover-more-people-in-the-second-round-of-serological-survey/story-uPrw97bdqkg90UOkLrTcjP.html
08-07-2020||Delhi||A DU student is fighting two battles: Covid and the stress of online exams||A 21-year-old student of BA (Hons) in English at Delhi University’s SGTB Khalsa College is fighting two battles at the same time—the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and stress of the upcoming online open-book exams. Despite opposition from both teachers and students, the University is set to conduct open-book exams online for final-year students from Friday.While hundreds of students said they might boycott the online open-book exams after facing several technical issues during the mock tests, Gaurisha Kapila, who tested positive for Covid-19 on July 1, said that she does not want to miss future opportunities by skipping exams. The resident of west Delhi’s Uttam Nagar area is in home isolation. “I do not have a choice but to appear in the exams. The University is saying it will conduct another round of exams whenever the situation improves. But I cannot wait for my degree for an unknown period. There is so much uncertainty. If I wait, my graduation will be stuck and I will not be able to do anything else,” she said. Even as the Delhi University has said that it will provide students who could not appear in online exams with another opportunity, the University has not made specific announcements for Covid-19 positive students like Kapila. “I had contacted my college teachers and written to the college authorities about my situation. The college had forwarded my letter to the university administration. But there has been no response yet,” she said.Kapila said that she was already stressed about the online exams before she tested positive for Covid-19 on July 1. “I visited my aunt’s house in the last week of June. I wanted some change since I was anxious about the online exams. My aunt and her family live in the same neighbourhood. A few days later, my aunt and cousin both tested positive. I also developed symptoms, following which my parents got me tested from a private lab. My result arrived on July 1,” she said.Her father, who has diabetes, and seven-year-old brother shifted to her grandparents’ house in Faridabad immediately. Kapila, who is now living with her mother, said that a team from the District Surveillance Office (DS0) visited them the day she tested positive. “They put up a home isolation poster outside our house and gave us some medicines and an oximeter to monitor my oxygen level. Although I am feeling well physically, I’m very stressed out. I keep wondering what would happen if it also infects my mother. There is a table outside my room where she keeps my food and other stuff to avoid contact with me. I wash my dishes and clothes, and clean my room several times a day. How do I study amid all this and write exams?” she said. Kapila, who wants to pursue a masters degree in theatre from the National School of Drama, could not even appear in any mock online test the University conducted to familiarise students with the new format. Her mother Sonia Kapila said that the family is stressed about their daughter’s health. “How can the University put students under so much stress amid the pandemic? My daughter is fighting the virus, and she is so worried about her exams at the same time. I do not know how she will write the exams from Friday,” she said.Saikat Ghosh, an assistant professor at Kapila’s College, said that she contacted him when she tested positive for Covid-19. “She had also written to the college administration. The college administration had forwarded her letter to the University. We are yet to hear anything from them,” he said. The University Grants Commission (UGC) on Monday advised against the cancellation of final-year exams in colleges. The UGC recommended the colleges hold exams in any medium—online, offline, or mixed—by September 30. Despite several attempts, DU’s Dean of Examination Vinay Gupta and Dean of Students Rajeev Gupta did not respond to calls and text for comment. A senior University official, requesting anonymity, said, “The University will surely give another opportunity to students who will not be able to take exams now. In cases like these, the student should give priority to his or her health.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-du-student-is-fighting-two-battles-covid-and-the-stress-of-online-exams/story-OFATQ84Lry2mZUw8XWozBM.html
08-07-2020||Delhi||Five days on, teething troubles at plasma bank||Confusion over procedures and paperwork was among teething troubles facing donors as well as prospective recipients at the country’s first plasma bank for Covid-19 patients, which was set up by the Delhi government five days ago to streamline access to one of the few effective treatments against the coronavirus disease. Convalescent plasma therapy uses a blood component called plasma, which contains virus-fighting antibodies, from a person who has recovered from the infection. When given to a patient with Covid-19, it has been established to help their immune system fight off the virus. Other states such as West Bengal and Goa have also decided to set up plasma banks. “There were several forms that had to be filled, and even if one column or stamp was missing, the applicants were asked to go back to the hospital. Apart from that, transporting the plasma is also the responsibility of the patient’s family. So, I had to go looking for an ice box,” said Sujeet Kumar, 35, who went to the plasma bank on Monday with a friend whose father needed the therapy.  Similar problems were faced by donors, who reported waiting for long waiting hours.Ravi Sharma, 33, was one of the recovered Covid-19 patients who registered as a convalescent plasma donor. Sharma, a Delhi government educator, left the Delhi Plasma Bank without donating after waiting for over six hours at the hospital.“After I registered on the website, I got a call from a doctor who told me about the therapy. Then, we fixed an appointment for Monday afternoon,” he said.The confusion started when he reached the hospital. “I was not told that I had to carry any document. But once I reached the hospital, they asked me to fill a form and provide my test reports – both positive and negative. I had the negative report on my phone but not the other one. It took two hours of back and forth for my sample to be taken,” he said.He left around 7pm after waiting in vain for his fresh test report. “I was the only voluntary donor at that time,” he said.“The process will definitely get streamlined in the next few days. It is a new process and we will take their feedback to make it as easy as possible. It is monitored directly by the CM and a dedicated team is personally reaching out to potential plasma donors to make the process smooth and convenient at the earliest,” said a Delhi govt spokesperson.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday had urged all recovered Covid-19 patients to donate plasma, particularly since the criteria for who can donate leaves many people out.The number of patients receiving plasma therapy has gone up with the Union ministry of health allowing hospitals to administer the therapy outside of a clinical trial in patients with moderate disease whose requirement for oxygen kept increasing despite being given oxygen therapy and steroids. So far, over 74,000 people have recovered in the city and many of them can donate plasma, health officials said. “So far, we have administered the therapy to 12 patients. However, its efficacy in treating Covid-19 is not yet proven,” said Dr Gauri Shankar, head of the department of critical care at Fortis hospital, Vasant Kunj. Max hospital, Saket, which was the first hospital in the city to administer the therapy, has been receiving increased requests and queries about the therapy.“We counsel all Covid-19 patients at the time of discharge to return in two weeks to donate plasma. However, we are not getting enough donations at the moment for us to create a plasma ban,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare.“The delays could possibly be because people might come to the hospital without checking what papers are needed on the website. The process of plasmapheresis is meticulous. We are able to manage nearly 20 donors and recipients everyday and hope to get better with time,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences that runs the plasma bank. Around 200 patients in each of the two hospitals will receive the therapy under the trial.In two separate orders on Tuesday, the Delhi government directed all Covid hospitals in the city to obtain feedback of patients on prescribed proforma and ask them if they want to donate plasma. The government has also decided to put up boards at entry gates of all hospitals requesting recovered patients to donate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/five-days-on-teething-troubles-at-plasma-bank/story-qZzBdv36hXKZqmD4vOlBrL.html
08-07-2020||Delhi||Mayur Vihar’s efforts to end containment rules end in police case||From lighting candles to marching their children wearing black bands, from banging plates to switching off lights, residents of a containment zone in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar have done it all over the past few days in an effort to get their neighbourhood unlocked. One such protest march on Saturday with lighted candles and torchlights ended in the police registering a case against them for allegedly violating social distancing norms. While the police action may have stopped further protest marches, it hasn’t stopped residents of A-3 pocket in Mayur Vihar Phase-3 -- a neighbourhood mostly inhabited by a large number of working professionals -- from continuing to draw the attention of authorities to what they term a “desperate situation in which people are losing their jobs”.“Today (Tuesday) evening, the children of our neighbourhood will stand outside their homes wearing black bands and holding placards. There has not been a single positive Covid-19 case in our neighbourhood after June 24, yet, we are being contained inside a small colony,” said the residents welfare association president, Rajkumar Upadhyay, who has been named as an accused in the police case. While the FIR mentions only Upadhyay’s name, the police said they have booked a host of unknown people as well, belonging to Group-13 of the A-3 pocket. The A-3 pocket consists of 128 houses and was turned into a containment zone on June 5, after nine residents tested positive for Covid-19. “By June 16, all infected persons tested negative for Covid-19 and, on June 24, antigen tests were conducted on all residents,” said Upadhyay.There are around 350 people living in the 128 houses, and about 275 of them took the antigen tests. “There were a few cancer patients, some senior citizens and a few children who didn’t take the tests. But at least one member from each occupied house took the test,” said Upadhyay. But the fact that a few chose not to take the antigen tests made matters difficult for the neighbourhood. A senior government official, on condition of anonymity, said some respite could have been given to the colony had every single resident taken the test.Upadhyay said while he would welcome the authorities getting all residents tested, those who didn’t go for the test were those who feared contracting the infection from the test centre. “These are people who have remained completely secluded all this while. They don’t want to risk catching the virus by visiting a testing centre,” said Upadhyay.In any case, the antigen tests results threw up one more positive case. While the new patient was sent to a quarantine centre in nearby Mandoli, the containment plan of the neighbourhood was extended by another 28 days in keeping with the government rules on de-containment. According to the rules, if a new Covid-19 patient is detected in a containment zone, then the containment plan starts all over again for 28 days. But this rule has left residents agitated. “If none of our residents was going out since the past 20 days, and if the infected patients have recovered nine days before the other residents underwent antigen testing, then the only way a person got infected was through the milk, vegetables and other ration that are being supplied to us. How do we know that our neighbourhood won’t be turned into a containment zone again and again?” said Upadhyay. But Arun Mishra, district magistrate of East Delhi, said the authorities were only going by the rules.“We are following the rules, but at the same time viewing their problems from a humanitarian point of view. We are discussing with higher authorities on ways to deal with such situations,” said the DM. Talking about Saturday’s march, Upadhyay said, about 50 residents held lighted candles and phone torchlights and marched towards the neighbourhood gates. “We maintained a gap of one metre between each person. Four people took turns to march till about 20 feet from the barricades and left our candles there as a mark of protest,” he said.But the police said there was no social distancing during the march. “One man was walking between the queues to click photos, not maintaining any distance in the process. We don’t mind them protesting inside houses and from balconies, but walking out in large numbers is against their own interest,” said a senior police officer, who didn’t want to be identified. Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police (east), said a case under four sections of the Indian Penal Code and one section of the Pandemic Act has been registered at Ghazipur police station. “They were not maintaining social distancing,” said the DCP. The most stringent section under which the FIR has been registered is Section 270 of the IPC which pertains to “malignant act that can spread a disease”. If convicted for this offence, the maximum punishment is two years in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mayur-vihar-s-efforts-to-end-containment-rules-end-in-police-case/story-mLJzTp1mlLgFPqIibvbBEL.html

Five days later, his mother too succumbed to the disease. Nagpal neither got a chance to bid them goodbye nor could he cremate them. In home-isolation after six members of his joint family tested positive for Covid-19, he had mourned the loss in solitude.On Tuesday, Nagpal paid what he described as “shradhanjali” (tribute) to his parents. He landed at Delhi’s Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) and donated his plasma.The day happened to be 54-year-old Nagpal’s birthday. And it wasn’t a mere coincidence.“Whenever there was a birthday in our family, my mother would perform a ‘havan’. Today there was no such ritual and I missed her badly. I couldn’t control my emotions and decided to pay back to my parents by trying to save someone else’s life,” Nagpal said about what inspired him to make the donation at a time when the city is grappling with a shortage of plasma donors.Plasma therapy is a process in which blood rich in antibodies from a Covid-19 recovered patient is transfused into the body of someone still struggling with the virus to boost immune response to the virus.Nagpal, an engineer by education and owner of an insurance advisory firm, lived in a ten-member joint family in Faridabad Sector 28. It included his elderly parents, his wife and son, his brother’s family and a domestic help. “We were a blessed, happy family that looked out for each other at all times,” said Nagpal.Since March 19, Nagpal said, only the domestic help would leave the house once a week to bring essential items which would then be first left outside, and then ritualistically washed with turmeric water and dried in the sun before being used.The family still has no answers to how the virus crept into their household, given the fact that their domestic help tested negative for Covid-19.Nagpal’s 78-year-old mother, Kaushal who retired as a lecturer in Karnal, was the first to show symptoms. She had complained of weakness on May 31 and her subsequent blood test showed low platelet count. “We got her admitted to Apollo Hospital for treatment where her Covid test on June 1 showed she was infected with coronavirus,” said Nagpal.All other nine members of the family, including the domestic help, got themselves tested soon after. On June 4, when the test results arrived, Nagpal said it hit them like a “tsunami”. Nagpal, his father, his wife, brother and nephew were found to be infected.“Until then, the disease was just a statistic for us. We would see the numbers rise every day and think we were insulated from it,” said Nagpal.The other five infected members of the family did not have any severe symptoms and went into home isolation, but on June 8 his father, 84-year-old Prithviraj, began having difficulty breathing. The elderly man, a retired lawyer, was admitted to a private hospital in Faridabad.He passed away the next day. “It was so sudden and unexpected. We couldn’t even get to speak to him one last time,” said Nagpal.Over the next five days, the family prayed for the recovery of Nagpal’s mother who was on a ventilator at Apollo Hospital. “I had last spoken to her on phone two days before my father’s death. The call had lasted a minute and all I could tell her was to pray to god,” Nagpal said.But Nagpal couldn’t speak to his mother ever again. “There was no way to communicate with her. She was in the ICU and not in a position to speak over the phone,” said Nagpal.Nagpal’s mother passed away on June 14, in the absence of her family. Like her husband, she was cremated by some relatives even as their two sons suffered the agony at their home. The four infected surviving members of the family recovered from the disease by June 20, but life was never the same for them again. “There was a constant sense of regret,” said Nagpal.It was in those days of sadness and gloom that Nagpal read extensively on plasma donation. “There are so many myths about the disease. But as I read more and more, I realised that it is a harmless process for those without co-morbidities,” Nagpal said.On Saturday -- 14 days after he had recovered -- he dialled an NGO and offered to donate his plasma.While they told him that he would receive a call soon, Nagpal on Tuesday morning drove to the plasma bank recently established by the Delhi government at ILBS in Vasant Kunj. “I saw relatives of some patients literally begging doctors to arrange plasma,” said Nagpal.And true to what he had read up, Nagpal didn’t feel “an iota of weakness” after donation.Dr Meenu Bajpai, professor of transfusion medicine at ILBS, said she was overwhelmed on realising that a man who had lost both his parents to Covid-19 was out to donate his plasma.“He told me he had lost his own parents, but wanted to save someone else’s. It was a moment I felt inspired to work harder,” said Dr Bajpai.Having experienced the how safe the process is, Nagpal has now requested his brother and nephew to donate plasma. “The doctor told me that I would be in a position to donate again after 14 days,” said Nagpal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-who-lost-both-parents-to-covid-donates-plasma-on-his-54th-birthday-as-a-tribute-to-them/story-ODjlWBXxkK7m25ibeensZI.html
08-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Podar hospital gets robot to distribute food, medicines||To minimise contact between healthcare staff and people admitted in the quarantine ward at Poddar Hospital in Worli, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has acquired a robot named ‘Gollar’ for food, water and medicine distribution. The automated machine has several trays where items can be placed, and it is remote monitored to move around the room, where people in quarantine can come and pick up the items.This will limit the number of times health workers have to interact with quarantine patients, and reduce chances of nurses and hospital staff getting infected. According to Maharashtra Minister for environment, Aaditya Thackeray, the robot will also be used to distribute medicines and food to patients at the National Sports Complex of India’s (NSCI) stadium done in Worli, where a 530-bed jumbo facility is operational for Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/poddar-hospital-gets-robot-to-distribute-food-medicines/story-SJhnEpQcIKr68s2XbJW3gO.html
08-07-2020||Delhi||Jail inmates allowed to consult private lawyers via video conference||The Delhi government on Tuesday told the Delhi high court that inmates of city prisons can now consult their private or legal aid lawyers via video conference. The court was hearing a couple of pleas that had challenged the March 25 notification of the prisons authority, suspending all legal interviews and family visits to jails in view of the coronavirus outbreak.Additional standing counsel Satyakam for the Delhi government told a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan that the facility was earlier available only for consulting legal aid lawyers, but a circular issued on Monday allows all inmates to use it to even consult their private lawyers.Taking note of the submission made by the Delhi government’s additional standing counsel, appearing for the prisons authority, the bench said it was not going to interfere in the matter at this stage and issue any directions.The court was hearing two separate PILs moved by two lawyers -- Sarthak Maggon and Ajit P Singh -- challenging a March 25 notification of the prisons authority suspending all legal interviews and family visits in jails in view of the coronavirus outbreak.The court said the restrictions on legal interviews were put in place by the prisons authority to save the lives of the inmates and with the July 6 circular, the March 25 notification is no longer applicable.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Maggon, and advocate Lav Kumar Agrawal, appearing for Singh, expressed some reservations regarding the circular. They said privacy of privileged communication between an inmate and lawyer ought to be maintained and no jail official should be within hearing range of the video meeting.Satyakam said no jail official would be in hearing range of the video conference. Taking note of all the submissions, the bench asked the prisons authority to consider them as suggestions if and when in the future it decides to amend the circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jail-inmates-allowed-to-consult-private-lawyers-via-video-conference/story-AmeOzwB8gNA7Wqt9JM4QIJ.html
08-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi police crack down on snatchers as pandemic keeps crime low||A hard crackdown, coupled with the fear of an invisible but deadly virus, has given Delhi Police the opportunity of cleaning up the city’s streets like never before.If numbers could speak, then the ones accessed by HT from the police control room, would say that common street crimes in the city — like robbery and snatching — are at an all-time low , having dipped by around 60%, when compared to average number of calls received each month last year. Data accessed by HT shows that the police control room used to receive around 5,000 distress calls on an average every month.. The numbers have come down to less than 2,000 in the last few months. Senior Delhi police officers said that they had launched a massive crackdown in the last two months and a large number of people have been arrested for snatching and robbery . Snatching was one of the most common crimes last year.Senior police officers said all station heads have been directed to focus on street crime by police chief SN Shrivastava. The SHOs have been told to ensure that bikers do not have a free run and ensure that snatching cases do not remain unsolved. Between May and June this year, since the lockdown norms started to be eased, police have arrested 15,678 persons. During the same period last year, there were 11,250 arrests.“The number of calls received has gone down, which definitely means that the crime is coming down. From mid May to June, the lockdown norms have relaxed. People are back on the streets but the calls are reducing,” said additional commissioner of police(crime) MS Randhawa.Randhawa said that every police district has been told to focus on nipping street crime in the bud. “At every meeting, the district DCPs are told probe the whole gang involved in snatching — like people receiving/buying stolen property. The number of arrests has increased suddenly because after every snatching, investigating teams are arresting every person related to the crime to break the chain.”The officer cited the example of a cell phone repair mechanic in north Delhi, who was arrested on Saturday with 27 stolen phones. Police had then said that the man, bought snatched mobile phones and sold it in the market by tampering its IMEI number. The increase in the number of arrests has also prompted Tihar jail authorities to create more spaces for isolation wards to ensure social distancing in jails.Tihar has reported two Covid-19 deaths and 141 positive cases until Tuesday . The prison chief, director general Sandeep Goel said that while the situation is manageable currently, the department has written to the government requesting for a temporary jail to be built in the police colony at Mandoli. “There are around 350 flats in the police colony, which can house around 2000 prisoners and can be utilized for isolation of new inmates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-crack-down-on-snatchers-as-pandemic-keeps-crime-low/story-AGm4AjvKELT2QJFUXQqmIN.html

According to the proposed plan, the students will be accommodated in the institution’s hostels.Former Panjab University vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Grover, who is a member of the board, said, “The proposal regarding this was presented by the PEC director during the meeting and was appreciated by the board members.”It was also discussed in the meeting that PEC had placed students in various companies during an online placement drive held amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The students whose offers were revoked earlier have been placed in other companies.The members were also briefed about the recent National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings in which PEC went up ten notches. “It was discussed that despite the upward movement in the rank, the institution needs to strive for better quality in the future,” said one of the members.Last month, PEC had decided that the examinations for the next semester would be held offline in November, if the situation allows, following which the pending exams would be held in December after a three-week gap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-engineering-college-to-bring-students-back-from-remote-areas-to-facilitate-online-learning/story-FKRjAYLdbIKJP9HyhLmolI.html

08-07-2020||Pune||Serious lapses in ambulance service, bed availability in Pune hospitals, patients say||A day after a 68-year-old diabetic patient living in Wadgaonsheri succumbed to a heart attack as his relatives failed to first get an ambulance and then, ICU beds in various hospitals, another incident of a 62-year-old Covid patient succumbing to the contagion due to non-availability of a vacant bed has come to light. Besides these two cases, two more incidents of hospitals denying service to needy patients have come to light during the past two days, bringing into focus the shortage of beds in the city as the Covid tally surges ahead.In the 62-year-old woman’s case, she was initially asked by the administration since no bed was available for admission, she can stay at her house in Gujar-Nimbalkarwadi on the outskirts of Pune. However, on Monday, her condition worsened as she gasped for breath amid non-availability of a ventilator in the hospital situated in neighbourhood complicated the situation, said her kin.Vyankoji Khope, sarpanch of Gujar Nimbalkarwadi said, “The health department has not provided adequate facilities to us to fight Covid-19. The health department officials have still not visited our villages despite there being 10 positive patients. The villagers have to spend from their pockets, pay extra charges for vehicles and other facilities to save their lives. We are ready to give our halls for free for establishing Covid quarantine facility in the village.”After the incident, district health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar promised an inquiry saying negligence will not be tolerated at any cost. “Special checking squads will be formed to check the spread of Covid-19 in Haveli area and all the grievances of the residents would be addressed,” said Pawar.In the 68-year-old Wadgaonsheri resident’s case, the deceased and the relatives had to go looking for a vacant ICU bed for two-and-a-half hours on Sunday, before the patient got a bed in the casualty of Sassoon Hospital, which also did not have a vacant ICU bed. Although the patient was suspected to be a Covid-19 person, he was never tested for the same.Anant Dudhane, brother of the deceased who was present with the patient said, “After rushing my brother to two hospitals early hours on July 5 and then inquiring for a vacant ICU bed in multiple other hospitals, we did not get any response. We first went to Ruby Hall Clinic, then to Inlaks and Budhrani hospital and faced a similar situation. On the way, we also made calls to Jehangir, KEM and Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital over the phone but we got to know that there are no vacant ICU beds. Finally at 5.20am, we admitted him at Sassoon hospital where he suffered a severe heart attack and breathed his last at 6am. Even at Sassoon, he was taken to the casualty ward and not the critical care centre as they too did not have any beds.”The patient also did not get a cardiac ambulance on time which would have helped save the golden hours, said Anant. “We had to take my brother in our own car as we did not get an ambulance. We were denied an ambulance at Ruby Hall and then when we called the government service at 108 they said they will call back but they never did. Although my brother had Covid-19 symptoms he was not tested for the same. Had those hospitals provided critical care at the right time, my brother would have survived.”The hospital in its clarification has stated that they did not have any vacant beds to accommodate the patient and so they stabilised the patient by improving the oxygen saturation, following which they were advised to take the patient for isolation ICU care. Dr Sanjay Pathare, medical director of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “We had a patient named Tanaji Dudane who complained of breathlessness, fever with chills and was a Covid-19 suspect. His SPO2 or oxygen saturation was 80 per cent we gave him oxygen support on venture mask started with 5ltr. When the saturation reached 93 per cent saturation we asked them to take him to a hospital with a vacant ICU facility. We did offer them an ambulance but they denied it and took the patient in their own vehicle. With the current divisional commissioner’s dashboard, anyone can check for a vacancy on real-time bases so there is nothing to hide. We are having 130 plus patients admitted at any point in time.”Dr Dnyaneshwar Shelke, chief operating officer at BVG India for the Maharashtra emergency medical services (MEMS) which run the 108 ambulance service stated that they did get two calls with regards to this patient. He said, “We got a call from Ruby hall clinic but we do not provide ambulance services to private hospitals. The next call we got was from Sassoon but by the time the ambulance was dispatched, the relatives said that they do not require it anymore. Before we dispatch any ambulance we need to check the medico-legal part of it and the scope of the patient so we need to talk to the medical officer, nurse or the treating doctor.”He further added that every hospital needs to stabilise a person before sending them to a different hospital even if they do not have a vacant ICU bed. “The ambulance is not above hospital it is just transit care. Usually, the response time for urban areas is 20 minutes and for rural areas, it is 30 mins. We are integrating private ambulances too to increase our strength. Out of the current 937 ambulances we have, 440 are dedicated to Covid-19 and we cannot transfer a non-covid patient in that ambulance.”Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “We have formed a special committee to look into the complaints of overcharging, denial of the hospital facility and overcharging by ambulances. We have the power to impound ambulances and book them for denying service to the needy patients both COVID and regular patients.”As of Monday evening, only two hospitals showed vacant ICU beds with ventilators in PMC areas and only four hospitals showed vacant ICU beds without ventilators Difficulty in getting admittedA senior citizen from Kothrud had to face the worst ordeal of her life as several prominent hospitals denied her admission on the ground that whether her Covid-19 test was undertaken and the results had come. Her doctors advised treatment in a multi-speciality hospital as she was having breathing issues. Those patients who have Covid like symptoms and whose tests have not been done find great difficulty in getting admitted in prominent hospitals across the city, her family members said.Death at SassoonA diabetic died of a heart attack at Sassoon Hospital after he was denied a bed by hospitals in the city. The deceased developed severe breathing issues at around 3 am on Monday night, but despite requests for admission by relatives, a bed was denied to him. He was rushed to Sassoon hospital where he suffered a heart attack and died. His relatives alleged that the private hospitals were flatly denying hospital beds without any fear of action.

Fadnavis in his letter said that the third phase of the Central scheme had been announced under which roads of 1.25 lakh kilometers would be built. “It had been decided that the state would get to build 6,550 kms of road and a proposal had to be tabled in January. But, so far, no such proposal has been sent to the Centre by Maharashtra. That is really unfortunate. Projects worth 17,000 kms have been approved of other states” states the letter. Fadnavis added that during the pandemic the road works under the Central scheme would have ensured jobs for rural unemployed, but the state government has been working at a snail’s pace, despite reminders by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-losing-out-on-pm-gram-sadak-yojana-funds-says-fadnavis/story-K5DBjhBJvqLaT550DtvpVJ.html

In November 2019, the woman allegedly threatened to file false rape charges against Karnataki if he failed to hand over the ownership of the house and Rs 6 lakh, of which he paid Rs 1,50,000 to her, according to his complaint.Futhermore, the five allegedly later increased the demand to Rs 2 crore and a property in Bhavani peth in order to save the complainant from getting killed or named in a false case.The complainant is an accused in a sexual assault case registered in Hinjewadi in January. Karnataki claims that he was wrongly accused in the sexual assault case as he did not pay heed to the extortion demand of Rs 2 crore, according to his complaint.A case under Sections 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), 388 (extortion by threat of accusation of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life), 389 (putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion), 506(2) (criminal intimidation), 120(b) (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered at the Kothrud police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/suspended-constable-journalist-and-woman-arrested-in-extortion-case-rti-activist-booked/story-YG0cf4JG1zYJujHOmE2ZjJ.html

You are therefore requested to motivate and request advocates in district and taluka courts for registering themselves on e-filing portal.”The required help can be found on efiling.ecourts.gov.in/help.An advocate or an applicant can register on the portal. For advocates, it is necessary for them to have their contact information — phone number and email address — to be registered with the court before registering with the application. Applicants in personal capacity can register using only their phone number and email address.“Around 7,100 lawyers are registered with Pune bar association. We could access the e-filing system only 10-15 days ago. The system has not reached the entire fraternity yet,” said advocate Ghanshyam Darade, secretary of the Pune Bar AssociationThe court had started functioning in two shifts from the beginning of June. However, later, the timing was reduced to one shift and for emergency matters only till July 31.“It will save time and avoid mishandling of documents.

08-07-2020||Pune||Pune varsities prepare to hold final-year exams, student groups oppose UGC decision||With University Grants Commission (UGC) asking universities and colleges to “compulsorily” take final-year exams by the end of September 2020 in offline/online/blended mode, universities in Pune have started preparations. The UGC decision has evoked mixed responses from student groups.Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) board of examinations and evaluation department director Mahesh Kakade said, “We have already taken steps to conduct the exams according to the May 8 state government notification. As per the instructions of SPPU academic council and board of examination and management council, we had planned to conduct the exam. We are yet to get the UGC notification and will follow it as per the state government guidelines.”Dr Vidya Yeravdekar, pro chancellor of Symbiosis International (deemed university) and principal director, Symbiosis said, “We had conducted final-year exams for post graduate students before the lockdown was announced. Only undergraduate final-year students exams needs to be taken. We are in a continuous assessment evaluation mode and have a very large component of internal assessment. We have 60 per cent internal assignments and studies and 40 per cent for term-end exams. We take scores of semesters and internal assignments. We give online assignments and take vivas online.”Prof MM Salunkhe, vice-chancellor, Bharati Vidyapeeth (deemed university), Pune said, “The state government had directed us to not conduct final-year exams and yesterday UGC announced to hold exams till September. We have started preparations and will hold exams as we have students coming from across the country. The exams will be held online and many aspects need to be considered like device, connectivity and electricity supply.”MIT World Peace University (WPU) registrar Prashant Dave said, “We have been requesting the state government and UGC to hold exams for final-year students as it has a long term impact on their career. We will see whether it will be taken online or in blended model in compliance with the directives of state government.”Maharashtra Students Welfare Association has written to education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal demanding cancellation of exams. Vaibhav Edke, president of the organisation, said, “Students are never afraid of exams, but the current situation of pandemic has left us with fear of getting infected by the virus. Most of the students have returned to their hometowns or villages. We request the Centre and UGC to rethink on the decision or else we will have no option but to go on hunger strike and oppose it across the state.”Dayanand Shinde, president of Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) SPPU unit said, “It is a big risk to cancel the exam of final-year students as it will impact their career.

However, in spite of lockdown orders, it was found that citizens in the area were violating rules, breaking barricades and walking out from the sealed areas and openly travelling through bikes and cars in the lockdown area.“Since May this year, the numbers of cases were on a rise in ward number 33 which consists of the Vadgaon Budruk area. On July 1, I personally visited the spot and as per the instructions given to us by the PMC commissioner on closing down an area if three or more positive cases are found, we gave orders for a lockdown in the gavthan part of Vadgaon budruk for eight days from July 4 to July 11,” said Sambhaji Khot, Sinhagad road PMC ward officer.Accordingly, the area is sealed with barricades and the essential shops are allowed to remain open from 7am to 1pm. Roadside hawkers are not allowed and all the residents in this area have been given a physical copy of notices to follow the lockdown strictly. Unless there is an emergency, people should not come out of their homes and use their vehicles.Despite all these precautionary measures and orders, on Monday it was seen that lockdown rules were violated by citizens. The vehicular movement inside the Vadgaon budruk area was in full swing. People were walking and travelling through the side parts of the barricades which were put to close down the area. Even some of the non-essential shops like mobile phones, clothes and electronics operated throughout the day.“If anyone is found violating the rules of the lockdown then action will be taken on them. I once again appeal to the citizens in this area please follow the lockdown rules, keep proper social distancing and take all the precautionary measures for your own safety,” added Khot.On the other hand, residents in the area are not happy with the lockdown imposed again.Rohan Nalawade a Vadgaon budruk resident said, “When we work then only can we earn bread and butter for our family, we have already suffered a lot during three months of lockdown. My family and I are following all the safety measures given by the government and we are aware of the rules of lockdown. But again closing down the entire area is not good.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/lockdown-restrictions-go-for-a-toss-in-vadgaon-budruk/story-wAZ9c03Y1szplucIkg14mJ.html
08-07-2020||Pune||Pune markets filled with customers with a disregard for distancing norms, masks||In most areas of the city, people have been stepping out to visit market places in large numbers, ignoring masks and social distancing norms at a time when Pune’s Covid tally has reached 22,381 with 730 dead.At most places at Tilak road, Tulshibaug, Laxmi road and Fergusson college road, many were seen without protective gear to cover their face, forcing police to act against them. On Friday and Saturday alone, Pune police have fined more than 100 persons for not wearing masks. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has acted against 300 persons for not wearing masks and collected Rs 1.5 lakh.Taking into consideration the spike in people venturing out amid a lack of regard for social distancing norms and masks, Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram warned of another lockdown in the district if the situation continues.Ashish Gaikwad, the owner of Style clothing, Tilak Road said while insisting a customer to wear a mask, “I have not seen people entering my store without a mask and I have seen them wearing a mask outside my door too. Most of the people do not wear a mask and tend to remove it while walking on the road.”Khushi Kundrani, manager at Cake Studio, stated: “People who enter the café do wear masks and follow social distancing even outside the café.”Neeraj, a shopkeeper from FC Road said, “I have seen residents wearing a mask but the nose is mostly not covered. I don’t understand how that is going to protect them from Covid-19”. Besides youngsters, teenagers were seen on roads in a group of six to seven without maintaining distance. Amit Dashanave, a resident of Erandawane and a regular on Fergusson college road said he sees many youngsters every day not wearing masks while standing at tea stalls.Taking serious cognisance of people’s increased movement and disregard for masks, Ram has threatened to re-impose lockdown in the entire district. During a recent meeting, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has also asked police to be strict in enforcing the mask and social distancing related guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/markets-filled-with-customers-with-a-disregard-for-distancing-norms-masks/story-eTd8ItoTXz2XPldxqXa4lI.html
08-07-2020||Pune||State approves TOD zone for Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar metro line in Pune||PUNE: The Maharashtra government has approved the transit oriented development (TOD) zone for the Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar metro line and has invited suggestions and objections from residents .The state government has declared the 500 metre radius area from metro station as the TOD zone where developers can use additional floor space index (FSI) to increase population density. Maximum four FSI has been allowed in the TOD zone — anyone having a 1000 square feet plot can construct up to 4000 square feet if the property falls in the TOD zone.The state had earlier approved the TOD policy for Vanaz to Ramwadi route and Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate metro lines. PMC city engineer Prashant Waghmare said, “Most of the part of Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar line is falling in PMC area and some part from Balewadi-Hinjewadi is under Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA). The state released the notification as the revenue generated through this corridor would be shared by both the organisations and would be used for developing metro and transport related works. As the TOD zone has been declared, both the organisations would get more revenue through premium for additional construction.”Earlier, it was proposed that additional FSI would be allowed on both sides of the metro corridor, but instead of the corridor, the state has approved TOD zone in the 500 square metre radius area of the metro station.Waghmare said, “The town planning director has invited suggestions and objections and residents can do it within a month from the publication of the advertisement.”Some NGOs have opposed the issuance of additional 4 FSI on metro corridors. They state that it is wrong that the government is trying to improve public transport and it will lead to increasing population in the city. It will be additional burden on city’s infrastructure.City’s metro lines PCMC to Swargate metro line number 1Vanaz to Ramwadi metro line Number 2Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar metro Line Number 3TOD zone approved along the 500 metre radius of each metro stationCitizens can use up to 4 FSI on plots falling in TOD zoneState government approves TOD zone for all three lines and invited suggestions and objections for line number 3||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tod-zone-approved-for-hinjewadi-shivajinagar-metro-line/story-GKpuudsvwzrF0oPG75dr0O.html

These teams included doctors and staff members from the health department and teachers from PCMC schools. However, many teachers submitted fake medical certificates to avail leave from work, according to PCMC officials. Duties of the team includes taking care of people at Covid care centres, door-to-door screening of residents, assisting hospitals performing Covid-19 duties and sending Whatsapp awareness messages to the public.“Right now, we are serving show-cause notices and once we get a response from them, we will decide on the penalty. If they were truly not well, then, we will not take any action against them. Every month, we are issuing such notices to teachers who are absent from duty,” said Manoj Lonkar, assistant commissioner, F Zone.Swati Shinde, a PCMC school teacher, who was served one of the notices, said,“I received the notice in May and I have not replied to them yet. My family was not willing to send me on Covid-19 duty and hence, I stopped going to work. The civic body should appoint other people for Covid-19 duty and not teachers. The civic body has sought the reason why I did not come on duty. Nothing else is specified in the show-cause notice.Sharad Javedkar, vice-president, Akhil Bharatiya Samajwadi Shikshan Haq Sabha, said,“We are not in favour of any organisation or the civic body allocating non-teaching work to teachers. When elections are conducted, teachers are called for duty and when the Census is conducted, teachers are called for duty. Now, even for Covid-19 duties, teachers are being appointed. How will they continue with their school work, if they do all this? I do not support the submission of fake medical certificates, but teachers should only be doing teaching work.”Rikibe Uja, Asha Maid, who has been on duty in Bhosari since the last three months, said,“PCMC teachers in Bhosari locality are doing their Covid-19 duty promptly. It is good to have them here as there is a shortage of people doing Covid-19 duty.” The teachers who have received notices are generally sports teachers and school clerks, according to PCMC officials. “With the rising coronavirus cases, I fear contracting the infection and hence, I was not doing the duty assigned to me by PCMC. I hope PCMC understands us,” said another teacher, requesting anonymity.Notices servedMonth- Number of teachersMarch: 22April: 11May: 14June: 27||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/74-pcmc-teachers-slapped-with-show-cause-notice-for-ignoring-covid-19-duty/story-Y0L4ftvzgEeNuInYOzZanK.html

The letter comes amid a debate over so-called “cancel culture” - where prominent people face attack for sharing controversial opinions. “The forces of illiberalism are gaining strength throughout the world and have a powerful ally in Donald Trump, who represents a real threat to democracy,’’ the letter said.“But resistance must not be allowed to harden into its own brand of dogma or coercion - which right-wing demagogues are already exploiting. The democratic inclusion we want can be achieved only if we speak out against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides.’’The letter criticised the state of public debate and the “swift and severe retribution” dealt out to any perceived wrongs. It decried an “intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism.’’“The way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away,’’ the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rowling-rushdie-atwood-sign-letter-warning-liberals-of-illiberalism/story-nbdDBMVkLJ2fjzOxqpR5aK.html

Look, what happened with China with this virus, what they’ve done to this country and to the entire world is disgraceful.”Trump said the banning of the app was “one of many” options he was considering against China.Separately, vice-president Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the United States would “continue to take a strong stand” regarding Chinese entities that threaten its security, including potentially TikTok. The federal trade commission and the US justice department are also looking into allegations TikTok failed to live up to an agreement on protecting children’s privacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-considering-ban-on-tiktok-to-punish-china/story-3XhchP3HF1VugikYkn1JVO.html

Look, what happened with China with this virus, what they’ve done to this country and to the entire world is disgraceful.”Trump was responding to a question about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s remarks suggesting the US was considering a ba TikTok, the popular video-sharing app that is at the top of every hit-list here and around the world after India banned it along with others with suspected links to Chinese government.On Wednesday, the secretary of state stated that the US was looking at an entire range of Chinese products, devices and apps, not just TikTok.“We have been engaged in constant evaluation about ensuring we protect the privacy of American citizens and their information,” Pompeo told reporters Wednesday, and “(not) to any one business or company but rather to American national security.”His comments from earlier in the week about “any one company” — TikTok — he said, “fall in the context of us evaluating the threat from the Chinese Communist Party”. He went on to cite ZTE, Huawei as examples of the ongoing evaluation.“We are now evaluating each instance where we believe that US citizens’ data they have on their phones or in the system or in their health care records we want to make sure that the Chinese government does not have the way to easily access them,” he said, adding the administration will be taking actions to preserve and protect that information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-evaluating-an-entire-range-of-chinese-products-with-access-to-data-on-americans/story-S1D5waD0bdIbRgyrdl7PkI.html

The president has further threatened to “cut off” federal funds for reluctant and defiant states, without citing what funding he would cut off or under what authority.The United States is undergoing a renewed surge in cases specially in southern and westerns states, with Texas, Florida and California hit the hardest. Amid this, citizens and health experts have voiced continuous concerns about the spread of the virus in confined and closes spaces such as schools and colleges.The number of confirmed infections went up by a record single-day spike of 60,021 to 3,009,611 on Wednesday and the fatalities climbed by 1,195 to 131,594.The president has focused on the lower number of fatalities compared to the past to push his reopening drive; he has sought to dismiss the spike in infections to increased testing, with questionable claims.Trump backed his argument on Twitter and said that countries including Germany, Denmark and Norway have reopened schools “with no problems.” The Republican president also repeated his claim that Democrats want to keep schools closed for political reasons and not because of any risks associated with the coronavirus.The Trump administration has pushed for a full reopening of the nation’s schools, with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos saying anything less would be a failure.In another tweet he publicly disagreed with the reopening guidelines for schools put forward by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), calling them “tough and expensive”. The American president has disagreed with this own public health officials and disregarded their advise whenever he finds them incompatible with his plans.Vice president Mike Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, said at a news briefing later in the day the CDC will be issuing a five-part guideline for reopening of schools.In the US, most schools are funded by the state and local property taxes, not federal funds. However, a large number of schools would seek federal funding to pay their teacher and meet other expenses because of depleted resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-cross-3-million-mark-donald-trump-pushes-school-reopening/story-OitLQiCrfkHd854krxYAzI.html
08-07-2020||World||Mike Pompeo says Xi’s aggressive ‘behaviour’ behind India-China conflict||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday said the “incredibly aggressive” Chinese actions along the border with China were a reflection of the “behaviour” of General Secretary and President Xi Jinping in the region and the world, holding the Chinese leader more directly accountable for it than before. “I put this in the context of General Secretary Xi Jinping and his behaviour throughout the region (and) the world,” Pompeo said referring to Xi by his party title, and not as president, in response to a question about the ongoing India-China border tensions at a news conference.“I don’t think it is possible to look at that particular instance — the Chinese Communist Party aggression (the border conflict with India) — in isolation; you need to be put it in the larger context.” he added.The secretary of state pointed to the number of both maritime band boundary disputes the Chinese Communist Party has “engaged in is unequal to any place in the world”.Pompeo said there is hardly any neighbour of China that can say with satisfaction where their “sovereignty end”, which will be respected by the Chinese. “That is certainly true now for the people of Bhutan as well,” the secretary of state said, bringing up the newest of China’s border disputes. Beijing announced last week the boundary with Bhutan have never been “delimited” and that there have been “disputes over the eastern, central and western sectors for a long time.”This was in addition to all the other continuing 14 territorial disputes, with India, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines and others. The United States has been unequivocal in its support of India in this round of border of tensions with China and has squarely blamed Beijing for it. But it had until now put it mostly on the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA, the Chinese military).Pompeo has led the Trump administration’s increasing attacks on China over a growing range of issues from the Covid-19 epidemic to the suppression of Uighur minorities, the new national security law for Hong Kong and the border conflict with India.Two US aircraft carriers began the largest naval exercises in recent years in the South China Sea last Saturday in a move to send “an unambiguous signal to our partners and allies that we are committed to regional security and stability”, as Rear Adm. George M. Wikoff, commander of the strike group, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.Trump administration officials have signaled a more direct link to the India-China border conflict. “The message is clear,” Mark Meadows, President Donald Trump’s chief of staff, told Fox News Monday. “Our military might stands strong and will continue to stand strong, whether it’s in relationship to a conflict between India and China or anywhere else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-says-xi-s-aggressive-behaviour-behind-india-china-conflict/story-wMLhzAnfLKrHc1fyWIqKWM.html

The protest was reportedly organised by groups such as Overseas Pakistan Welfare Council, Global Pakistan and Kashmir Supreme.The area in The Strand in central London had witnessed major protests and violence on the Kashmir issue on August 15 and September 3 last year, when several people were injured and projectiles hurled at the building as the police struggled to deal with the situation.According to the high commission, the protest was “essentially organised to glorify the death of slain terrorist Burhan Wani”, noting that Hizbul Mujahideen is proscribed by the European Union, besides India.The mission said: “Before he was killed during a counter insurgency operation on July 2016, Burhan Wani and his group carried out multiple attacks in J & K, causing deaths of security personnel and civilians”.“During 2017-18, he was single-handedly responsible for recruitment of innocent Kashmiri youth into Jihadi campaign through religious bigotry and hate. Some of them such as Adil Khandey, Asad dam Padder, Riaz Naikoo became well known terror operatives, who carried out suicide attacks and killed innocent civilians and security personnel,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-flays-burhan-wani-protest-outside-india-house-in-london/story-SxFVDLQDgmjUZc8Esz16hI.html

08-07-2020||World||Incredibly aggressive action, says Mike Pompeo on China’s moves in Ladakh||China’s “incredibly aggressive action” along the border with India should not be seen in isolation but in a larger context where Xi Jinping’s Chinese communist party is engaging in an increasing revisionist effort with its neighbours, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday. Pompeo added he was confident that the world will come to understand the threat that is presented by Xi Jinping’s party and will come together to respond in a way that is “powerful and important”.“I have spoken with (foreign) minister S Jaishankar a number of times about this. The Chinese took incredibly aggressive action and the Indians have done their best to respond to that,” Pompeo said in response to the question on the Chinese efforts to expand its territory that led to the two-month-long stand-off between soldiers of India and China.China’s People’s Liberation Army has started scaling down its presence along the Line of Actual Control as part of a de-escalation process agreed between the two countries but insisted that it was India that had crossed the line.“I put this in the context of general secretary Xi Jinping and his behaviour throughout the region and indeed, throughout the world. I don’t think it is possible to look at that particular instance, Chinese Communist Party’s aggression in isolation. I think you need to put it in the larger context,” Pompeo said.The US secretary of state referred to the large number of boundary and maritime disputes that China had opened with its neighbours. “I think it is unequaled any place in the world,” he said.“There aren’t many neighbours that can satisfactorily say that they know where their sovereignty ends and the Chinese community party will respect that sovereignty. That is certainly true now for the people of Bhutan as well,” he said.China stunned Thimphu last month when it objected to a grant request for the 650-sq km Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district at a meeting of the Washington-based Global Environment Facility. Beijing reasoned that the sanctuary, which Bhutan always considered as its easternmost part, was Chinese territory.When Hindustan Times reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry for a clarification, Beijing said the China-Bhutan boundary had never been delimited and there were disputes “over the eastern, central and western sections for a long time”.“This is what the world must come together to respond to. This increasing revisionist effort that the Chinese communist party is engaged in, something that President Trump has taken incredibly seriously,” Pompeo said.Pompeo said the United States had attempted to communicate to the Chinese leadership that “we are serious about this. “When I say we, it is not just the United States but we will shortly start a dialogue with the EU (European Union) friends on how we collectively can respond to this challenge from the Chinese communist party,” he said.“I think what has happened with this spread of virus from Wuhan China, I think the world has seen the true colours of the Chinese communist party and I am convinced now than ever before that the free peoples of the world will come to understand the threat that is presented, not only internally, inside of China, but the impact that general secretary Xi has on the world is not good… and the world will come together to respond in a way that is powerful and important and will preserve sovereign nations operating under the rule of law and the way we have all become accustomed to, and benefits people all across the world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/incredibly-aggressive-action-says-mike-pompeo-on-china-s-moves-in-ladakh/story-4RS5HVXAONi6vMGQzi9SvO.html
08-07-2020||World||Harvard, MIT sue Trump admin over foreign student visa rule||Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the proposed new rules for international students as the Trump administration sought to soften the impact of its controversial order arguing, one, it was only a temporary measure and, two, it was meant to force these institutions to reopen fully. In the lawsuit filed in a Boston court, the two top universities sought a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction to bar the Department of Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from implementing the proposed order that will force foreign students of universities and colleges offering online-only classes for the upcoming fall semester to leave the country.“The order came down without notice—its cruelty surpassed only by its recklessness,” Harvard University president Lawrence S Bacow wrote in an email to affiliates. as reported by the campus news publication The Harvard Crimson. “We believe that the ICE order is bad public policy, and we believe that it is illegal.”Harvard is among the institutions directly impact by the order as it had announced plans to hold online classes only for the fall semester just hours before ICE issued the guidelines on Monday, which had come completely without warning as many colleges and universities were still planning their fall reopening after a long break forced by the Covid-19 epidemic.The push back to the new guideline came swiftly at home from US institutions, with echoes around the world. India, which is the second largest source of international students to the US with an estimated 200,000, brought up the issue at the “foreign office consultations” between Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and US under-secretary of state for political affairs David Hale on Tuesday. Other countries are reported to have reached out as well.Hours later, state department said in a statement that the intended measure was a “temporary accommodation” meant only for the fall semester, and that it will allow international students to, in fact, continue their education through a mixture of online and in-person teaching while ensuring adherence to social distancing norms still required to battle the Covid-19 epidemic. There was no mention of students being forced to leave.Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, also emphasized the temporary nature of the new rule in an interview on CNN and went to say it will “encourage schools to reopen”. The Trump administration has been pushing for reopening the country after the Covid-19 lockdowns wreaked havoc on the US economy, leaving a trail of shuttered businesses and lay-offs, that have left the president without his best pitch for a second-term, a booming economy.On Tuesday, Trump said he will force schools to reopen as well.Foreign students enrolled in US institutions offering online-only classes for their fall semester will be not allowed to come to the US and if they are already here they may be forced to leave, unless a majority of their coursework was taught in-person, according to a proposed rule the Trump administration announced Monday. It is expected to be notified later this month.But foreign students of colleges and universities that were shifting to a hybrid model of mixed online and in-person classes will be allowed opt for more online classes than previously allowed. But these institutions had show to authorities that hey had indeed shifted to this model, also called “blended”.The Unites States has admitted an estimated 1 million international students every year, who generated around $41 billion worth of economic activity and supported 450,000 jobs, according to the American Council on Education, which represents US colleges and universities. Incomes generated from foreign students are critical to the financial health of many US colleges.China, India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Canada are the top-five sources of international students, in that order.Indian students have said their first reactions were panic and confusion. “The words ‘removal proceedings’ in the order set us off really,” said a graduate student who wished not to be identified. The student was referring to the new guideline issued Monday by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency for international students.US universities are still trying to sift through the implications of the proposed guideline, and the confusion. “We highly value our international community,” the University of Maryland in Maryland state, which has a large number of Indian students, said in a statement. “We are urgently considering alternative options, as this newly announced rule has caused great concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvard-mit-sue-trump-admin-over-foreign-student-visa-rule/story-IcDAPxK94qaiUZAoZmnRhK.html
08-07-2020||World||Sick with Covid, Brazil’s Bolsonaro defends his coronavirus approach||Now infected with the virus he has shrugged off as a “little flu,” President Jair Bolsonaro is insisting that his approach to the coronavirus, a pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of fellow Brazilians, was correct all along.After months of clashing with doctors, governors and mayors who clamored for strict quarantine measures, Bolsonaro announced Tuesday on live television he had tested positive for Covid-19. He told reporters through a mask that he felt “perfectly well,” after taking two doses of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven anti-malarial he has touted as a successful remedy.“We know there are other remedies that can help fight the coronavirus,” he said hours later in a video he posted to Facebook after swallowing a third dose of the drug. “None are scientifically proven, but there’s one that’s working.”Medical experts say otherwise, but Bolsonaro’s supporters are coalescing around the stricken president as proof that Brazilians should get back to work and not hide from the illness tearing through Latin American’s largest economy.“The president took the right approach,” lawmaker Jose Medeiros, the government’s deputy leader in the lower house, said in an interview. “He will be proven right that there was no way we would stay hiding in our homes.”Critics blame Bolsonaro for creating a public health disaster as the country’s politics have grown increasingly polarized and toxic. Brazil’s largest daily, Folha de S. Paulo, published an op-ed late Tuesday titled “Why I am Cheering for Bolsonaro to Die.”In a Twitter post on Wednesday, the president said that “those who are rooting against hydroxychloroquine” should know that he’s doing very well because of the medication and that will still “live for a long time.”Second WorstBrazil trails only the U.S. with more than 65,000 confirmed deaths and over 1.62 million total cases. Its response has been erratic partly because of Bolsonaro’s insistence that shutting down the economy would be more dangerous than the virus. Governors have rejected his advice and imposed various lockdowns in recent months but his refusal to back those steps has made enforcement harder.His argument has been that the virus can’t be escaped or beaten and the country has to learn to accept it. As he said on Tuesday, “This virus is like the rain. It’s going to get you.”Bolsonaro has had recent health troubles that could complicate his condition. In September 2018 while campaigning for president, he was stabbed in the abdomen, leading to multiple surgeries. For months, he relied on a feeding tube and colostomy bag.Thomaz Favaro, a Sao Paulo-based analyst for the consultancy Control Risks, says Bolsonaro’s illness could help shift the conversation to the state of his health rather what he’s doing to control the pandemic.“It’s a lot easier for him to answer questions about how he is feeling and whether he was able to exercise, rather than what your government is doing to address the latest 1000 deaths,” he said.Keeping Up NormalityBolsonaro, 65, is already making a point of keeping up a sense of normality. So far, the only adjustments to his agenda has been canceling two trips to Brazil’s interior and turning face-to-face meetings into virtual ones, according to two officials speaking on condition of anonymity. They said his symptoms remained mild.Marcio Coimbra, a political scientist with Interlegis, a Brasilia-based think tank, says that barring severe illness Bolsonaro will now feel vindicated in prioritizing opening the economy at all costs. But the health of his cabinet remains in question after his frequent meetings with ministers without a mask.“Many of them are potential high-risk patients and could develop strong symptoms -- something that may end up harming Bolsonaro’s narrative if he recovers fast and easy,” Coimbra said.Bolsonaro generally refused to use a mask in public and even battled a court over an order forcing him to, insisted on maintaining close-quarter meetings with his advisers and inner circle. According to data collected by Bloomberg of Bolsonaro’s recent agenda, the president has met with more than two dozen senior government officials in the past week.U.S. AmbassadorOn Saturday, he attended a lunch in honor of July 4, the U.S. Independence Day, at the residence of U.S. Ambassador Todd Chapman. Chapman and his wife tested negative but would remain in quarantine, the embassy said on Tuesday.Key advisers, such as the chief of staff, have also tested negative for Covid-19. His minister of defense was tested Tuesday morning and was awaiting the result.Investors are carefully following the next steps and health of Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who has promised a rash of reforms as Brazil faces a looming recession. The minister, who is 70 years old, tested negative last week and will be tested again in the coming days, his office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sick-with-covid-brazil-s-bolsonaro-defends-his-coronavirus-approach/story-GKHfDnQh7voelUjaz93YbJ.html
08-07-2020||World||Violence in Serbia over plan to reimpose coronavirus curfew||Thousands of protesters clashed with police in Serbia’s capital after the president said he’d reinstate one of Europe’s strictest lockdown regimes to confront a spike in new cases of Covid-19 in the city.Riot police used tear gas to repel rock-throwing, mostly right-wing demonstrators who briefly broke into the parliament building in central Belgrade in the biggest outbreak of violence against President Aleksandar Vucic since he came to power in 2014. Seven protesters and 13 police were injured, according to police.The crowd of about 5,000 smashed several shop windows and set five police cars on fire, while smaller groups rallied peacefully in the biggest northern city of Novi Sad and in the central city of Kragujevac. The government, led by Vucic’s dominant Serbian Progressive Party, denounced the violence.“The state and all its institutions will preserve and protect our constitutional order,” Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said late Tuesday. She condemned opposition politicians “behind the violent charge into Serbia’s parliament at the moment when the state and the health system are facing the biggest onslaught of coronavirus since the pandemic began.”The former Yugoslav republic of 7 million lifted its lockdown restrictions -- which included overnight and weekend curfews and banned inter-city travel -- in May along with the rest of Europe after the social-distancing restrictions helped stifle contagion.However, a new surge in cases hit the country following June 21 elections, with the head of Serbia’s government office for Kosovo, the speaker of parliament and the defense minister all testing positive.The protests have little chance of unseating Vucic’s party, which won a constitutional majority in the vote. At the news conference where he announced the renewed lockdown, he said a new government would be formed by Aug. 25.‘Handful of Hooligans’Protesters gathered at the parliament building shortly after the president spoke, demanding his resignation. Aside from opposing the plan for the new lockdown, they chanted “We don’t want migrants” and “Kosovo is the heart of Serbia,” the latter of which underscores the Balkan state’s dispute with its neighbor, which declared independence a decade after the two sides fought a war.The violence was instigated by “just a handful of hooligans,” said Police Chief Vladimir Rebic, distinguishing them from peaceful protesters.The new surge in infections is overwhelming the national health-care system, and Serbia will quickly build a new hospital with 800 to 1,000 beds, Vucic said.“The situation in Belgrade is alarming,” he told a televised news conference late Tuesday. “Hospitals are literally packed.”Four other Serbian cities are also strongly affected, with 13 new deaths from coronavirus on Tuesday, the country’s highest daily death toll since the pandemic began. Some 330 have died from Covid-19.There’s also the risk that the disease will persist into the winter, when it may coincide with the seasonal flu, Vucic said.“We’ll be facing a difficult autumn with the coronavirus,” he said. “There won’t be a vaccine by then.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-in-serbia-over-plan-to-reimpose-coronavirus-curfew/story-sCFcrHMiYmmwrbWujCPgeN.html
08-07-2020||World||Covid-19: UK to pay 50% of pub, restaurant bills to aid recovery||Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday announced more billions of pounds to help revive the economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic, including a plan to encourage people to ‘eat out to help out’ by paying 50 per cent of their bills in pubs, restaurants and cafes. Delivering his Summer Economic Update in the House of Commons, Sunak announced a package of measures to support jobs, give businesses the confidence to retain and hire, and provide people with the tools they need to get better jobs.The government paying 50% of customer bills in pubs, restaurants and cafés will be available throughout August, he said, amidst reports of crippling impact on the hospitality and tourism sectors. Dwindling recent figures of new infections have prompted an easing of lockdown curbs.Officials said the tourism and hospitality sectors – both major employers – have been severely impacted by the pandemic due to necessary closures to protect public health. Nearly 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million hospitality workers have been furloughed – the highest proportions of any sector.To encourage demand for businesses to reopen, Sunak set out the new ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ discount scheme that will provide a 50% reduction for sit-down meals in cafes, restaurants and pubs across the UK from Monday to Wednesday every week throughout August.Sunak said: “Throughout this crisis I have never been the prisoner of ideology. For me, this has never just been a question of economics, but of values….Our plan has a clear goal: to protect, support and create jobs. It will give businesses the confidence to retain and hire”.Since March, the Boris Johnson government has been paying 80% wages of private sector employees and 80% of earnings of the self-employed people, together amounting to billions of pounds, adding to the mounting borrowing bill to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic.The new plans include a temporary rise in the threshold of house prices at which buyers need to pay the mandatory stamp duty to the government: from property worth £125,000 to £500,000 until March 31, 2021 to help revive the housing sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-to-pay-50-of-pub-restaurant-bills-to-aid-recovery/story-CBpHmV1ELQJ6fwNG1TW0fP.html
08-07-2020||World||Harvard, MIT sue US immigration authorities over new student visa rule: Report||Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have sued the Department of Homeland Security and the federal immigration agency over new guidelines barring foreign students from remaining in America if their universities switched to online-only classes in the Fall.A report in The Harvard Crimson said the two pre-eminent educational institutions filed a lawsuit in District Court in Boston Wednesday morning against the two federal agencies. The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to bar the US Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from the enforcing federal guidelines that will force international students to leave the US.Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow said in an email to affiliates that the “order came down without notice—its cruelty surpassed only by its recklessness. We believe that the ICE order is bad public policy, and we believe that it is illegal.” “We will pursue this case vigorously so that our international students—and international students at institutions across the country—can continue their studies without the threat of deportation,” Bacow said, according to the Crimson report.The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a press release issued Monday that for the fall 2020 semester students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States. “The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States,” the release said.In what could cause increased anxiety for the international students already present in the US, the agency said, “active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programmes must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status or potentially face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.” The Crimson report said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced Tuesday that her office “will sue” over the guidelines, which she called “cruel” and “illegal.” The Harvard lawsuit argues that the guidelines violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to consider “important aspects of the problem” in advance of its release, failing to provide a reasonable basis for the policy, and failing to adequately notify the public.Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh said in a panel Monday that Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliot is also contacting ambassadors on behalf of international students.“As a university with a profound commitment to residential education, we hope and intend to resume full in-person instruction as soon as it is safe and responsible to do so,” Bacow said. “But, until that time comes, we will not stand by to see our international students’ dreams extinguished by a deeply misguided order. We owe it to them to stand up and to fight—and we will.” The federal agency has said that students attending schools adopting a “hybrid model”, which includes a mixture of online and in-person classes, will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. The guidance is certain to cause severe anxiety and uncertainty for the hundreds of thousands of international students who are studying in the country and for those who were preparing to arrive in the US to begin their education when the new academic session begins in September. International travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic have made it increasingly difficult for international students in the US to return to their home countries, while those outside the US are uncertain if they will be able to travel to join their courses in American colleges and universities.Before the ICE guidance was issued, Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) had said that it will bring up to 40 per cent of undergraduates to campus for the fall semester, including all first-year students. Bacow, FAS Edgerley Family Dean Claudine Gay, and Danoff Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana co-authored a message to the FAS community that described the path forward, allowing first-years the opportunity to adjust to college academics and to begin creating connections with faculty and other classmates, while learning on campus in September. It said the College will address gaps in students’ home learning environments and identify those who need to return to campus to continue to progress academically. Students on campus will move out before Thanksgiving in November and complete reading and exams periods from home. MIT has said that many graduate students and research staff will be allowed on campus for the fall. But to limit the density of the campus population, most administrative staff who can work remotely will continue to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvard-mit-sue-us-immigration-authorities-over-new-rule-for-foreign-students-report/story-8Kxk4P1d1GgF07lVKqbNMO.html

There was no record of West filing any official paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. The deadline to add independent candidates to the ballot has not yet passed in many states.West denied that his aim was to split the Black vote and hurt the chances of Trump’s Democratic opponent, Joe Biden. It was “a form of racism and white supremacy” to suggest all Black people should support the Democrats, he said.Trump, who hosted Kanye West in a widely publicized visit to the Oval Office in 2018, said the rapper’s candidacy “would be a great trial run” and that he had a “real voice,” according to an interview Tuesday with Real Clear Politics news website.White House spokesman Hogan Gidley on Wednesday called Kanye’s announcement “a scathing indictment of the Democrat Party, not just their policies on abortion, the Planned Parenthood, but also the policies that disproportionately affected African Americans in a negative way.”West told Forbes he believed “Planned Parenthoods have been placed inside cities by white supremacists to do the Devil’s work.” The group provides reproductive health care and education, with most of that being preventive care.The rapper also said he had been ill in February with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and would be suspicious of any vaccines developed to prevent the infection. Reiterating false theories that link vaccines with child developmental disorders, he said: “So when they say the way we’re going to fix COVID is with a vaccine, I’m extremely cautious.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/birthday-party-kanye-west-s-banner-for-fighting-us-elections-vows-to-win-presidential-race/story-qS2DsfFIvSHQGh1lfC6FIL.html

That means it could be reversed by a new administration or if circumstances change.Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said he would reverse the decision on his first day in office if elected.President Donald Trump has harshly criticized WHO over its response to the coronavirus pandemic and accused it of bowing to Chinese influence. Trump said in a White House announcement that Chinese officials “ignored” their reporting obligations to WHO and pressured the organization to mislead the public about an outbreak that has now killed more than 130,000 Americans.The move was immediately assailed by health officials and critics of the administration, including numerous Democrats who said it would cost the U.S. influence in the global arena while undermining an important institution that is leading vaccine development efforts and drug trials to address the coronavirus.The withdrawal notice was sent to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday and will take effect in a year, on July 6, 2021.The U.S. is WHO’s largest donor and provides it with more than $450 million per year, but owes about $200 million in current and past dues.

The Trump administration’s move announcing its new travel ban targets an unspecified number of Chinese officials with visa restrictions, limiting or entirely eliminating their ability to travel to the United States.Zhao said that China strongly opposes the relevant US measures. In response to the wrong actions of the US, China decided to impose visa restrictions on US personnel who “behaved badly” on Tibet-related issues, he said.Though China does not allow diplomats and journalists inside TAR without the government inviting – and escorting – them, Zhao said: “Tibet is an open Tibet and has never made any regulations restricting foreigners from entering Tibet”.Zhao defended that by saying that “…taking into account the special geographical and climatic conditions of Tibet, the Chinese government has taken certain management and protection measures against foreigners entering Tibet in accordance with law and regulations, “which are absolutely necessary and beyond reproach”.Quoting “incomplete statistics from 2015 to 2018”, Zhao said between the three years TAR had received nearly 176,000 foreigners for official, tourism, business and other activities. Ties between the US and China are going through some of the worst times with the two countries quarrelling on trade, Taiwan, the South China Sea – where Washington has dispatched two of its super aircraft carriers, the origin of the Coronavirus, Xinjiang and Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/urge-us-to-stop-interfering-now-china-slaps-visa-restrictions-on-washington-officials-over-tibet/story-W4oYqeEuf57S1sZJbBMV7K.html

By far the most successful launch anywhere in the world,” Paul Reid, the head of Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE), said on Twitter.Ireland has had a manual contact tracing programme in place since the end of February and says the app will cut the time it takes to trace close contacts “from days to hours”, as well as helping to identify close contacts who are not known to each other.Research conducted for the health service showed that 82% of respondents were willing to install the app, which adopts a decentralised model where the data is held on the person’s mobile phone and not centrally by the government.Ireland currently has one of the lowest infection rates in Europe, with just three infections per 100,000 people during the past two weeks. So far, 1,720 people have died from the disease, a number that has also slowed sharply in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irish-covid-19-tracing-app-nears-1-million-downloads-in-24-hours/story-Y62oV7I28nKw0Xv6QYtGVP.html
08-07-2020||World||French PM says any new coronavirus lockdown would be targeted||New French Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Wednesday that any new lockdown will be targeted, and not imposed nationwide, if there is a major new coronavirus outbreak.The previous French government enforced a strict nationwide lockdown from mid-March to May 11 to try to curb the spread of COVID-19, and some restrictions on public gatherings are still in place.“We must be ready for a second wave, but we would not proceed to a general lockdown like in March, as that has terrible economic and human consequences. Any new lockdown would be targeted,” Castex told BFM television.Castex, who was a civil servant and used to be an adviser to former President Nicolas Sarkozy, was appointed prime minister on Friday. He has put together a new team for the remaining two years of centrist President Emmanuel Macron’s mandate.Castex appointed some ministers on Monday. He said he would complete the formation of his government with the nomination of junior ministers next week.He also said that talks with unions and employers about Macron’s wide-ranging pension reforms - which were halted during the lockdown - would resume before July 20.He said the delay was not necessarily a bad thing.“Sometimes, when you lose two or three months, that is actually time won ... we need to reopen the dialogue,” he said.Castex confirmed his government would commit 7.5 billion euros to raise the wages of hospital workers but said he would resist union calls to boost that to 9 billion, saying that state finances are under stress because of the coronavirus crisis.(Reporting by Geert De Clercq and Richard Lough; Editing by Alison Williams and Timothy Heritage)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-pm-says-any-new-coronavirus-lockdown-would-be-targeted/story-yZvsnPOICfw7NsHqMj9wsJ.html
08-07-2020||World||China calls US invite to nuclear talks a ploy to derail them||A senior Chinese arms control official called US pressure to join nuclear arms talks with Russia an American ploy to avoid signing a new deal, and said China would gladly participate if the US would agree to parity among all three nations.“I can assure you that if the US says that they are ready to come down to the Chinese level, China will be happy to participate the next day,” Fu Cong, the director general of the Foreign Ministry’s arms control department, said Wednesday. “But actually, we know that that’s not going to happen.”Fu spoke to journalists in Beijing after the US pointedly noted the Chinese absence at talks with Russia in Vienna two weeks ago on extending or replacing NEW Start, a 2010 arms reduction treaty that expires in Feburary.The pact is between the US and Russia, long the world’s major nuclear powers. The Trump administration wants China, as a rising military power, to join.Fu called that demand unrealistic because China has a much smaller nuclear arsenal than the other two. By inviting China to join, the US is creating a pretext to walk away from the talks without replacing the treaty, he said.“The real purpose is to get rid of all the restrictions and have a free hand in seeking military superiority over any adversary, real or imagined,” he said of US intentions.US negotiator Marshall Billingslea told reporters after the talks in Vienna that any new agreement must subject China to restrictions. He expressed hopes that others in the international community would pressure China to join the talks in the future.“A three-way nuclear arms control deal, in our view, has the best chance of avoiding an incredibly destabilizing three-way nuclear arms race,” he said.Fu said the US and Russia should agree to reduce their arsenals first, and then China and others can join nuclear arms reduction efforts.New START imposes limits on the number of US and Russian long-range nuclear warheads and launchers. It can be extended by five years by mutual consent, which is what Russia is proposing to do.The treaty is the last nuclear arms agreement between the two nations, after the Trump administration scrapped an intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty last year. That pact was also criticized because it did not cover China.Fu said that US missile defense systems in Asia, and its talk of deploying medium-range missiles in the region too, pose a strategic threat to China.He wouldn’t comment on China’s nuclear weapons plans, but said it should not come as a surprise to anyone that China feels a need to improve its military capabilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-calls-us-invite-to-nuclear-talks-a-ploy-to-derail-them/story-etI5DhlqGENcSoqXAdIc9O.html
08-07-2020||World||Kulbhushan Jadhav refused to seek review of his death sentence, says Pakistan||Pakistan has offered India a second consular access to Kulbushan Jadhav, the former Indian Navy officer who is on a death row. He was arrested on charges of espionage in Balochistan in March 2016 and sentenced to death by a military court a year later.“In the first round, he met his mother and wife and now we have offered to let him meet his father and wife,” Additional Attorney General Ahmed Irfan said in a press conference on Wednesday.Irfan jointly held the press conference with Director-General of South Asia and SAARC at the Pakistan Foreign Office, Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri. They told the media that Pakistan enacted the International Court of Justice Review and Reconsideration Ordinance, 2020 in May this year which allows review petitions within a certain period of time.But the officials said that Jadhav has refused to file a review petition against the death sentence awarded to him. Last July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Pakistan to provide consular access to Jadhav and review his death sentence.“The petitions can be filed before the Islamabad High Court,” explained Irfan, adding that in this case, it can be filed by Jadhav himself, an appointed representative or a consular official of the Indian high commission.“On June 17 we invited Jadhav to file a petition for the reconsideration of his conviction and offered him legal representation but he refused to file the petition and instead preferred to follow up on his pending mercy petition,” said Irfan.He said the government had also repeatedly written to the Indian high commission to file the petition and initiate the process for a review before the deadline.“Pakistan is fully cognizant of its international obligations and committed to implementing the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit,” he said expressing hope that India will follow due legal course and cooperate with courts in Pakistan to give effect to the ICJ judgement.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. In May 2017, New Delhi petitioned the ICJ, which stayed Jadhav’s execution. In its ruling on July 17, the ICJ said its stay of the death sentence should continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kulbhushan-jadhav-refused-to-seek-review-of-his-death-sentence-says-pakistan/story-1ixjESzuiG5WviNwJFb6mO.html
08-07-2020||World||US withdrawal from WHO over claims of China influence to take effect July 2021, says UN||The United States will leave the World Health Organization (WHO) on July 6, 2021, the United Nations said on Tuesday, after receiving notification of the decision by President Donald Trump, who has accused the agency of becoming a puppet for China during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump, who announced the decision over a month ago, has to give one-year notice of the US withdrawal from the Geneva-based body and pay all Washington’s dues under a 1948 joint resolution of the US Congress. The United States currently owes the WHO more than $200 million in assessed contributions, according to the WHO website.After more than 70 years of membership, the United States moved to quit the WHO amid escalating tensions with China over the coronavirus pandemic. The virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The WHO has denied assertions by Trump that it promoted Chinese “disinformation” about the virus.US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi described Trump’s official withdrawal as “an act of true senselessness as WHO coordinates the global fight against COVID-19.”“With millions of lives at risk, the President is crippling the international effort to defeat the virus,” the Democratic leader posted on Twitter.So far there have been nearly 12 million cases of the coronavirus and more than 540,000 known deaths worldwide, according to a Reuters tally, with about 25% of both cases and deaths in the United States.Trump’s decision could be overturned before it takes effect if he is defeated by his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, in a November election. Trump had halted funding for the 194-member organization in April, then in a May 18 letter gave the WHO 30 days to commit to reforms. He announced the United States would quit less than two weeks later.Vice President Mike Pence, asked in a Fox News Channel interview whether it was the right time to break with the WHO, said: “It’s absolutely the right time.”“The World Health Organization let the world down ... There have to be consequences to this,” Pence said.The WHO is an independent international body that works with the United Nations. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said that the WHO is “absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against COVID-19.”“The Secretary-General ... is in the process of verifying with the World Health Organization whether all the conditions for such withdrawal are met,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Tuesday.Since taking office, Trump has also quit the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. cultural agency, a global accord to tackle climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. He has also cut funding for the U.N. population fund and the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees.

08-07-2020||World||Scientists develop ‘catch and kill’ air filter, claim it can kill coronavirus||Scientists have designed a “catch and kill” air filter which they say can trap the novel coronavirus and neutralise it instantly, an invention that may reduce the spread of Covid-19 in closed spaces such as schools, hospitals and health care facilities, as well as public transit environments like airplanes. According to the study, published in the journal Materials Today Physics, the device killed 99.8 per cent of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in a single pass through its filter. It said the device, made from commercially available nickel foam heated to 200 degrees Celsius, also killed 99.9 per cent of the spores of the deadly bacterium Bacillus anthracis which causes the anthrax disease.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  “This filter could be useful in airports and in airplanes, in office buildings, schools, and cruise ships to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Zhifeng Ren, a co-author of the study from the University of Houston (UH) in the US. “Its ability to help control the spread of the virus could be very useful for society,” Ren added. The researchers said they are also developing a desk-top model for the device which is capable of purifying the air in an office worker’s immediate surroundings. “Schools, transit systems, hospitals, airplanes, office buildings, other health care facilities and public settings would be first in line to receive the devices,” said Garrett K. Peel of Medistar, a Houston-based medical real estate development firm which partnered with UH for developing the device.According to the scientists, since the virus can remain in the air for about three hours, a filter that could remove it quickly was a viable plan, and with businesses reopening across the world, they believe controlling the spread in air conditioned spaces was urgent.Click here for complete coronavirus cases The study noted that the novel coronavirus cannot survive temperatures above 70 degrees Celsius, so by making the filter temperature far hotter -- about 200 degree Celsius, the researchers said they were able to kill the virus almost instantly. Ren said the nickel foam met several key requirements. “It is porous, allowing the flow of air, and electrically conductive, which allowed it to be heated. It is also flexible,” the researchers noted in a statement. But they added that nickel foam also had low resistivity, making it difficult to raise the temperature high enough to quickly kill the virus. The researchers said they solved this problem by folding the foam, connecting multiple compartments with electrical wires to increase the resistance high enough to raise the temperature as high as 250 degrees Celsius. By making the filter electrically heated, rather than heating it from an external source, they said the the amount of heat that escaped from the filter is minimised, allowing air conditioning to function with very low strain. When the scientists built and tested a prototype for the relationship between voltage/current and temperature, they said it satisfies the requirements for conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and could kill the coronavirus. “This novel biodefense indoor air protection technology offers the first-in-line prevention against environmentally mediated transmission of airborne SARS-CoV-2, and will be on the forefront of technologies available to combat the current pandemic and any future airborne biothreats in indoor environments,” said Faisal Cheema, another co-author of the study from UH. The researchers have called for a phased roll-out of the device, “beginning with high-priority venues, where essential workers are at elevated risk of exposure.” They believe the novel device will both improve safety for frontline workers in essential industries and allow nonessential workers to return to public work spaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-develop-catch-and-kill-air-filter-claim-it-can-kill-coronavirus/story-Y5WTKth3p5bb0Zd1mZwc1I.html
08-07-2020||World||Analysts in Beijing link Doklam to Galwan, say India aggressor in both cases||The June 15 violent clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley could be linked to the 2017 Doklam standoff, which was resolved through talks despite Indian troops remaining in territory claimed by China for 73 days, experts and local state media In China said. The experts suggest that China lost face in Doklam and was waiting for an opportunity to get back. In 2017, Indian troops had crossed over to Doklam (Donglang in Chinese) - a territory disputed between Bhutan and China - to prevent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from building a road in the area as it could impact India’s strategic interests. New Delhi has historically supported Thimphu’s claim and said it was interceding on the latter’s behalf.Linking it to the 2017 Doklam standoff, Beijing-controlled state media has said the current tension in eastern Ladakh was triggered after the Indian Army crossed over to Chinese side to illegally build structures.India insists that the Chinese were the transgressors in Galwan in Eastern Ladakh.There is no official acknowledgment of it but the possibility of a link between the two standoffs has been making the rounds of state media, military websites and among Chinese analysts.Not said in as many words but the message from Chinese analysts is this: The PLA would not allow a new serious standoff, like in Doklam, in eastern Ladakh where it has better infrastructure, to end without a fight even if it sustained casualties in the process. China has admitted but is yet to reveal the PLA’s casualty figures but India lost 20 soldiers in the violent brawl between border troops on the night of June 15.“After all, China is stronger than India, with advantages in all aspects and a higher GDP than India. Last time (Doklam), we had already put up with one step and lost face. China has blood in its veins and is definitely going to do something,” Shanghai-based military expert Ni Lexiong told HT.A television programme broadcast on national broadcaster CCTV on July 6, and then published on its English channel CGTN’s YouTube handle directly, links the two recent most crises between India and China.With undated photographs and satellite imagery, it claimed that Indian border troops crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to the Chinese side.The host of the programme asks the two Chinese analysts about the “...timing of this incident coincides with the third anniversary of the Donglang incident, on June 18, 2017, when it was also the time when the Indian border troops unilaterally crossed the China-India border to obstruct our personnel who were working within our Line of Control, operating normally. From Donglang to the Galwan Valley, in your analysis, what does India want?”To be sure, this line of argument is also contrary to international perception, where Beijing is clearly viewed as the aggressor. One of the guest analysts at the programme, Ruan Zongze from the China Institute of International Studies, had this to say: “First of all, from Donglang to the Galwan Valley to today’s (current) developments, it shows that Indian side’s illegal cross-border violations were not an isolated incident. Three years ago, and precisely in June, border troops on the Indian side also illegally crossed into the Chinese side of the border,” Ruan said.“The boundary of the Donglang incident was clearly demarcated in 1890 and has since been confirmed by successive Indian governments, without any issue, no controversy, but India still took the provocative action of crossing the border. So this time, I think it’s a repeat of the same old trick,” Ruan said.This again seems to be an overstatement if not an outright lie - India hasn’t accepted that Doklam is part of China. However, the prevailing view in Beijing seems to be to paint India as the aggressor. Beijing-based military expert Song Zhongping said: “This time, like the Donglang crisis, India provoked China on the western border in an attempt to change the status quo and create trouble. This time India’s intentions are too obvious, the means are too extreme.”Talking to the nationalistic tabloid Global Times, Hu Zhiyong from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences had spoken on similar lines as early as May 18.“...that the Galwan Valley is not like Doklam because it is in the Aksai Chin region in southern Xinjiang of China, where the Chinese military has an advantage and mature infrastructure. So, if India escalates the friction, the Indian military force could pay a heavy price”.Ni, the Shanghai-based military expert quoted earlier, said the perception about the 2017 standoff in China is that Beijing backed down.Ni said: “There is not a lot of coverage in the country on the Doklam incident because we were the ones who backed down, I was thinking if that is the case, we are pretty furious, if we cannot build roads, then why India can build roads over there (Galwan Valley) now?”“Then when the officers and soldiers on our side saw it, they thought we were building the road (in Doklam) and you would not let us, so how can you build it? It is not equal, it is not fair, so people just go over there and stir up things,” Ni said.Not everyone, however, agrees to the Doklam link.Ketian Vivian Zhang, a China expert, who has written on how China uses coercion in face of national security issues, at George Mason University said if the core reason was about teaching India a lesson it would have made more sense for China to do it earlier.“I personally do not think the recent events date back to Doklam or took place because of Doklam. As I said before, the trend of increased Chinese militarised patrol and presence along the border has started since 2006, way before Doklam,” she said.An article in the Communist Party-run current affairs website Utopia in June, however, clearly indicated retaliation.Quoted by Hemant Adlakha, a professor of Chinese at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi in the Indian Defence Review, the article “...blamed Indian arrogance for its continuously provocative behaviour along the LAC. Irked and annoyed by India’s unrelenting belligerence in recent years, in particular in what happened in Doklam three years ago, the Chinese or the PLA it seems were waiting for an opportunity to ‘outpunch’ and humiliate India.”“To permanently resolve Indian belligerent attitude against China and ensure security along China’s western border, the time has now come for China to go for a decisive offensive against India and recover all Chinese territory under the Indian occupation, including southern Tibet,” the article added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/analysts-in-beijing-link-doklam-to-galwan-say-india-aggressor-in-both-cases/story-4x8cUUWwtXwBQO6naLum5L.html
08-07-2020||World||UK’s Sunak focuses on jobs with $2.5 billion for young workers||Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is set to unveil a 2 billion-pound ($2.5 billion) program to pay the wages of more than 200,000 young workers as he tries to pull the UK economy out of the deepest slump in centuries.It will be the centerpiece of the government’s three-point plan to protect, support and create jobs, the Treasury said in a statement late on Tuesday.“Young people bear the brunt of most economic crises, but they are at particular risk this time because they work in the sectors disproportionately hit by the pandemic,” Sunak said. “We also know that youth unemployment has a long-term impact on jobs and wages and we don’t want to see that happen to this generation.”With the UK immersed in possibly its deepest recession in 300 years, the chancellor will on Wednesday set out a package of measures to help the economy recover from more than three months of lockdown. While Sunak has made protecting jobs the core of his plan, he has repeatedly conceded he won’t be able to protect every role as he unwinds the unprecedented government aid that is funding the wages of more than 12 million workers.Sunak will also announce a stamp duty holiday for homes costing up to 500,000 pounds in an effort to revive the housing market, according to The Sun newspaper, while the Financial Times has reported he is considering a temporary cut to value added tax to boost the hospitality industry.“We do not comment on speculation about tax changes,” the Treasury said in a statement.‘Build, Build, Build’The chancellor plans to conduct a wider spending review and outline a further package of stimulus measures in the fall.Over the past week, the Treasury has outlined more than 4 billion pounds of measures to promote jobs, skills and energy efficiency. They include:In addition, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has brought forward 5 billion pounds of infrastructure spending on schools, hospitals and roads, pledging the UK will “build, build, build” to emerge from the crisis. The government also outlined a 1.6-billion pound bailout earlier this week to help struggling theaters and music venues, which have yet to be allowed to reopen.Meanwhile, jobless claims have more than doubled to almost three million and economists say the unemployment rate could reach double figures from 3.9% currently. Those predictions are informing Sunak’s decisions as he tries to preserve jobs. The impact of the outbreak on the economy so far has been stark: Economic output shrank a record 20.4% in April, and the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates Sunak’s efforts to support businesses and workers through the crisis will cost more than 130 billion pounds. They have already pushed the national debt above the size of the country’s gross domestic product for the first time since the 1960s.The measures to be outlined on Wednesday were billed by the Treasury as the biggest package to tackle youth unemployment in decades. Under the so-called Kickstart Scheme, the government will pay the wages of 16 to 24 year-olds who are claiming benefits while they undertake six-month placements. The state will pay the workers at the level of the national minimum wage for 25 hours a week, with employers able to top them up.The program will open for applications next month, with the first placements starting in the fall, according to the Treasury. It’s due to run until Dec. 2021, with the option to extend it.The Resolution Foundation, a London-based think tank, welcomed the measure, saying it could help around 350,000 young people into work -- but stressed it needs to be delivered quickly to be effective. Meanwhile, the Trades Union Congress said it was a “good first step” to prevent a spike in youth unemployment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-sunak-focuses-on-jobs-with-2-5-billion-for-young-workers/story-ilTp7PXSy3X3Z05FoZ8JXO.html
08-07-2020||World||US airlines move toward federal loans as Covid-19 surge threatens demand, jobs||The largest US air carriers have all signed letters of intent on federal loans to help them weather the novel coronavirus, with United Airlines warning employees on Tuesday that a surge in outbreaks was hitting bookings, threatening a travel rebound and jobs.United employees should expect to receive as soon as this week notices about potential furloughs effective Oct. 1, the airline said in a regulatory filing. It expects travel demand to remain depressed until a widely accepted Covid-19 treatment or vaccine is found, with no straight line to an industry recovery.US airline shares closed 5% lower on Tuesday, with United down 7.6%.While travel had picked up in some areas over the past two months from pandemic-driven lows in April, United has seen reservations for travel within the coming month slide after New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said they would require people arriving from hot-spot states to quarantine for 14 days.The slump was most pronounced at United’s Newark hub, where near-term net bookings were just about 16% of year-ago levels as of July 1. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said the bookings trend was likely much broader than the New York area. Andrew Nocella, United’s chief commercial officer, told employees at a virtual town hall meeting on Tuesday that its network would be slightly more impacted than other US domestic airlines, sources said after the meeting.It is among US airlines encouraging employees to accept voluntary departure packages to help prevent tens of thousands of job losses in the fall but said not enough workers have signed up ahead of a July 15 deadline to apply.US airlines have drastically reduced their flight capacity and rushed to shore up capital while warning that tens of thousands of jobs could be at risk as the industry braces for a slow recovery.United sees domestic load factors at around 50% in July versus around 80% normally, with international loads around 30%, and will continue to adjust its capacity based on demand.Delta Air Lines said last week it may scale back the number of flights it had planned for August. United and Delta were among US carriers - along with Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines - that the US Treasury Department said on Tuesday had signed letters regarding the terms of a $25 billion loan package under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.Last week, the department said it had agreed on the terms for government loans under the CARES Act with five other airlines including American Airlines.US airlines have already received $25 billion in payroll aid under the CARES Act to protect jobs through September and have until Sept. 30 to decide whether to take the loan, which would include the issue of warrants and restrictions on executive compensation and share buybacks. US unions representing aviation workers have separately asked lawmakers to extend the payroll aid package through March as Congress considers a new round of spending to address coronavirus-related issues and jobs.

08-07-2020||World||Japan battered by more heavy rain, floods, nearly 60 dead||Pounding rain that already caused deadly floods in southern Japan was moving northeast Wednesday, battering large areas of Japan’s main island, swelling more rivers, triggering mudslides and destroying houses and roads. At least 58 people have died in several days of flooding.By Wednesday morning, parts of Nagano and Gifu in central Japan were flooded by massive downpours.Footage on NHK television showed swollen water in the Hida River gouging into the embankment, destroying a national highway along the river. In another central Japanese city of Gero, river water rose to just below the bridge above it.In a mountainous town of Takayama, several houses were hit by a mudslide, with uprooted trees and other debris scattered around. It was not immediately known what happened to their residents.Across the country, about 3.6 million people were advised to evacuate, although evacuation is not mandatory and the number of people who actually took shelter was not provided.As of Wednesday morning, the death toll from the heavy rains starting over the weekend had risen to 58, most of them from the hardest-hit Kumamoto prefecture. Four others were found in Fukuoka, another prefecture on Kyushu, Japan’s third-largest island.Though the rains were causing fresh flooding threats in central Japan, flooding was still affecting the southern region. And search and rescue operations continued in Kumamoto, where 14 people are still missing.Tens of thousands of army troops, police and other rescue workers mobilized from around the country to assist, and the rescue operations have been hampered by the rains, flooding, mudslides and disrupted communications.Japan is at high risk of heavy rain in early summer when wet and warm air from the East China Sea flows into a seasonal rain front above the country. In July 2018, more than 200 people, about half of them in Hiroshima, died from heavy rain and flooding in southwestern Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-battered-by-more-heavy-rain-floods-nearly-60-dead/story-ipfkq7SxlSuxUnGeCsMTAN.html
08-07-2020||World||AirAsia’s future in ‘significant doubt,’ Ernst & Young warns||AirAsia Group Bhd.’s ability to continue as a going concern may be in “significant doubt” because of the impact the coronavirus is having on the indebted carrier, auditor Ernst & Young said.The airline’s current liabilities already exceeded its current assets by 1.84 billion ringgit ($430 million) at the end of 2019, a year when it posted a 283 million ringgit net loss, Ernst & Young said in a statement to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange Wednesday. The financial performance and cash flow have now been further hit by virus-related travel restrictions.The slump in air travel and the carrier’s financial performance “indicate existence of material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” Ernst & Young said in its unqualified audit opinion statement.Covid-19 plunged the aviation industry globally into crisis as border controls and health concerns vaporized demand for air travel. AirAsia on Monday reported a record quarterly loss of 803.8 million ringgit. It wasn’t until late March and the end of the quarter that the budget airline suspended flights.“This is by far the biggest challenge we have faced since we began in 2001,” AirAsia’s Chief Executive Officer Tony Fernandes said in a statement Monday.He said the carrier is in talks for joint-ventures and collaborations that may result in additional investment, and it has also applied for bank loans and is weighing proposals to raise capital.Last month, South Korean conglomerate SK Group said it was reviewing a proposal to buy a small stake in the airline. In May, AirAsia sent a memo to Malaysian banks seeking to borrow 1 billion ringgit, people familiar with the matter said at the time.AirAsia said in an exchange filing Wednesday that Ernst & Young’s statement and a decline in shareholder equity triggered the criteria for a so-called Practice Note 17, which applies to financially distressed companies. However, the airline won’t be classified as PN17 as the Malaysian exchange suspended application of the status from April through June next year as part of relief measures in light of the coronavirus pandemic.AirAsia’s shares were suspended from trading in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday. They will resume trading at 2:30 p.m. local time.AirAsia needs at least 2 billion ringgit this year to stay afloat, according to K. Ajith, an aviation analyst at UOB Kay Hian Pte in Singapore.“There’s not a lot of options, and the best one could be the government stepping in but seeking a rights offering by the company in exchange,” he said.Despite the warnings, there are signs of improvement with the gradual lifting of restrictions on interstate travel and domestic tourism activities in the countries where AirAsia and its units operate, Ernst & Young said.The airline’s recovery depends on government policies on travel, discussions with financial institutions and investors and its ability to address concerns of its liabilities, the auditor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airasia-s-future-in-significant-doubt-ernst-young-warns/story-O90f2NP1qtvVASNKjVOZrI.html

The man, New Zealand’s latest new case of Covid-19 announced on Wednesday, escaped through a fenced area from an isolation facility about 6.50pm on Tuesday, the New Zealand Herald reported. He has been sent to a quarantine facility after he was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Wednesday. However, the man was asymptomatic and did not appear to have come into close or casual contact with anyone, the report said.The man, whose identity was not immediately known, came from New Delhi on July 3, it added.Health Minister Chris Hipkins has slammed the man’s actions as “selfish” and says he will face charges, the report said.But he wouldn’t describe the episode as a failure of the government’s processes, and even though those processes will now be reviewed, he said if anyone should apologise it was the man who broke the law.Hipkins said the man appeared to have made a spur of the moment decision and dashed through a gap where fencing was being replaced.A security guard was observing the area but confused the man with contractors working on the fencing. The alarm was raised within minutes but security were unable to find the man.Hipkins said the man may have spent 20 minutes in the supermarket on Victoria St West, and he returned of his own volition 70 minutes after leaving, the report added.He will be charged and now face up to a six-month jail sentence or a $4000 fine, the report added.After the man’s positive test result came on Wednesday, the supermarket staff are now self-isolating and will also be tested for the virus, the Stuff reported. ”CCTV footage from within the supermarket has confirmed there was no close contact between the man and any staff or customers during his time there,” head of managed isolation and quarantine Air Commodore Darryn Webb said. There are now 23 active Covid-19 cases in New Zealand, all in managed isolation or quarantine, and 1187 confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-returnee-tests-covid-19-positive-in-new-zealand-escapes-isolation-to-go-shopping-report/story-cNZS9etmxFOWC2C84LxZMI.html
08-07-2020||World||Boeing has settled almost all Lion Air crash-death claims||Boeing Co. said it settled 90% of the wrongful death claims filed in a U.S. court over the 2018 crash of a 737 Max jet operated by Lion Air.Claims relating to 171 of the 189 people on board Lion Air Flight JT 610 have been settled, Boeing said Tuesday in a Chicago federal court filing. The company didn’t say how much it paid the families or estates of the passengers and crew members killed in the crash.Of the resolved cases, five were partially settled because they involved more than one claim per person killed or involved claims represented by more than one law firm, Chicago-based Boeing said. The company said it is optimistic that the remaining cases will be resolved.The crash occurred over the Java Sea in October 2018 and was followed five months later by another 737 Max crash in Ethiopia that killed 157 people. The disasters led to lawsuits alleging the jets were unsafe and had a faulty software system. The 737 fleet has been grounded, Boeing sales have plunged and the U.S. government is investigating the aircraft’s flight-control system.“There are some remaining cases with extraordinary losses, including kids completely orphaned who lost both parents,” said Sanjiv Singh, a lawyer representing families of some victims. “It remains to be seen whether we can bring Boeing to the table on these cases.”Singh said he is prepared to go to court, including in the U.S., to settle those remaining cases.A year ago, Boeing said it would offer $100 million to support the families of victims and communities of those affected by the crashes.“Boeing has been working diligently to settle these cases through a mediation process,” Peter Pedraza, a company spokesman, said in an email. “We are pleased to have made significant progress in recent months in resolving cases brought by the victims’ families on terms that we believe fairly compensate them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-has-settled-almost-all-lion-air-crash-death-claims/story-I0tjnCvjeOXJEhwe5MkinN.html
08-07-2020||World||Covid-19: Texas passes 10,000 confirmed in single day||Texas surpassed 10,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day Tuesday for the first time, crossing a sobering milestone rarely seen since the pandemic first hit the US in March.The record high of 10,028 new cases in Texas served as another alarming new measure of the swift resurgence of Covid-19 nationwide and the failures of the country’s response. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas aggressively began one of America’s fastest reopenings in May but has begun reversing course in recent weeks, ordering bars closed and mandating face coverings.New York and Florida are the only other states to record more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. New York hit that grim total back in April, when New York City hospitals were overwhelmed and hundreds of people were dying every day. Florida topped 10,000 confirmed cases last week.The record mark in Texas partly reflects a lag in testing results from the Fourth of July weekend, when newly reported cases were far below what Texas has seen in recent weeks. But Abbott said the numbers should still be “an alarm bell for everybody” who is skeptical about whether the virus is a threat.“We have rapid spread of Covid-19 in the state of Texas right now,” Abbott told San Antonio television station KENS.Later in the interview, Abbott was noncommittal about whether he would attend his own party’s convention next week in Houston, which the Texas GOP has remained bent on holding even as the mayor, doctors and businesses pressure the party to cancel. Houston has emerged as one of the nation’s hot zones in the pandemic. However, Republican activists, some of whom have called the fears overblown, have resolved to press forward with the indoor three-day convention.Texas surged past 8,000 statewide hospitalizations for the first time over the long holiday weekend — a more than quadruple increase on the past month. On Tuesday, the number of hospitalizations soared past 9,000. Texas also set a new high for deaths in a single day with 60.Mayors in some of the biggest cities in the state and US — including Austin, San Antonio and Houston — have warned that hospitals could soon become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Along the Texas-Mexico border, some cities imposed curfew orders in hopes of cutting down on large parties or social gatherings as cases have skyrocketed.“Many of us are running at capacity and have created new wards,” said Michael Mann, the chief executive officer at McAllen Medical Center, which on Tuesday had more than 130 coronavirus patients taking up more than half of the facility’s beds. “The physical space is obviously limited, and most of the hospitals are running out of that pretty quickly.”The record count was reported on a day that also saw the State Fair of Texas canceled for the the first time since World War II. Fair organizers said the event, which draws more than a million visitors to Dallas each fall, was not feasible during the pandemic.It also came as President Donald Trump leaned on governors to reopen schools this fall, arguing that some are keeping schools closed not because of the risks from the coronavirus pandemic but for political reasons. Texas education officials announced Tuesday that face coverings will be mandatory for students older than 10 years old and that school districts must offer on-campus learning to any family that wants their child in a classroom.Deaths remain lower in Texas compared to other big states. As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed that at least 2,715 people have died due to Covid-19. But fatalities have climbed in recent days, and in addition to an alarming acceleration in new cases in Texas, the seven-day infection rate has climbed to 13.5%.The number of infections is likely far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-texas-passes-10-000-confirmed-in-single-day/story-CtXLC9t0sAtN3dU0IStcQI.html
08-07-2020||World||Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg disappoint once again||Facebook Inc. still doesn’t get it.A widely anticipated meeting on Tuesday between the social media giant and the civil rights groups behind the recent Facebook ad boycott — including the Anti-Defamation League, NAACP and Color of Change — did not go well. The New York Times reported CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg met for about an hour on a video-conference call, but offered little in terms of concessions related to their policies for managing content on their social networks.A negative response came swiftly. “It was abundantly clear in our meeting today that Mark Zuckerberg and the Facebook team is not yet ready to address the vitriolic hate on their platform,” the groups said in a statement. “Instead of actually responding to the demands of dozens of the platform’s largest advertisers that have joined the #StopHateForProfit ad boycott during the month of July, Facebook wants us to accept the same old rhetoric, repackaged as a fresh response.”The representatives said Facebook offered to address just one of the groups’ 10 demands — the company was willing to create a position focused on promoting civil rights — but it didn’t promise to do so at the asked-for C-suite level. Otherwise, the company did not give an inch for the other nine demands, according to the groups.Frankly, Facebook’s inaction is not a surprise. The company has gone to this “hunkering down” playbook many times in the past. The old aphorism that says incentives often drive behavior seems to hold true for this tech giant. And on a pure dollars-and-cents level, the company is incentivized to do as little as possible.We all know the worst types of content — such as hate speech, misinformation and false conspiracies, along with the outrage surrounding them — tend to be more viral and generate more page-views for social media firms. The upside for Facebook in elevating such engaging content is obvious, but the downside to society as a whole is vast — from mental-health issues to giving rise to scientifically discredited  ideas such as the anti-vaxer movement. The brains of millions go down these poisonous rabbit holes. Given Facebook’s recent stock performance, Zuckerberg may feel even less pressure now. After a brief decline late last month, amid the frantic coverage of advertiser pledges to pull ads from Facebook’s platforms, the shares are now back near all-time highs again. At the end of it all, the boycott was mainly about headline risk, not significant sales risk for Facebook. Last week, I argued Facebook should act on the back of a sea-change in perception and beliefs after the recent wave of protests over racial injustice, adding the true risk for the company was the prospect of future political blow-back, not a near-term revenue hit. That view still stands.The strange thing is, meeting the civil rights groups’ demands isn’t such a big lift for a company with Facebook’s resources. Most of them are simply common sense. Following the meeting Tuesday, the civil rights groups reiterated them. Here’s a brief selection:Provide audit of and refund to advertisers whose ads were shown next to content that was later removed for violations of terms of service. Isn’t that just good customer service? Wouldn’t that assuage Facebook’s advertisers worried about brand safety placement, giving them confidence Facebook will take content moderation more seriously?Stop recommending or otherwise amplifying groups or content from groups associated with hate, misinformation or conspiracies to users. Not a big ask.Enable individuals facing severe hate and harassment to connect with a live Facebook employee. That’s just a question of being willing to spend some money for something worthwhile.Unfortunately, it looks like Facebook will keep disappointing its critics. Last week, Zuckerberg told his employees that advertisers will eventually return and they will not change their policies under duress, according to The Information. “I tend to think that if someone goes out there and threatens you to do something, that actually kind of puts you in a box where in some ways it’s even harder to do what they want because now it looks like you’re capitulating,” the executive reportedly said.For now, he may feel a sense of vindication. But instead of focusing on how it looks and establishing bad precedent, perhaps Zuckerberg should instead reassess his thinking and come to terms to this reality: The moral fabric of our society is fraying amid the disinformation propagated on his platform.There may be a ray of light, however, small. Facebook said it will release its independent civil rights audit report on Wednesday after a two-year review of its policies and practices. Sandberg explained in a blog post the company has heeded some of the recommendations from the report already, but won’t make all the changes they asked for.There is still room for real action. Let’s hope Facebook decides to do the right thing.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

08-07-2020||World||US, South Korean officials discuss North Korea strategy as Pyongyang rejects talks||The US point man for North Korea met with South Korean officials in Seoul on Wednesday for talks, overshadowed by Pyongyang’s insistence that it has no intention of returning to denuclearisation negotiations any time soon.Stephen Biegun, who led working-level negotiations with the North Koreans and now has broader responsibility as US Deputy Secretary of State, met briefly with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha before holding longer meetings with Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young and chief nuclear negotiator Lee Do-hoon.Talks covered a range of issues, including coronavirus responses and ongoing negotiations over military cost-sharing, but North Korea dominated the agenda, Seoul officials said.In a brief conversation, Kang told Biegun he had come at an important time for political developments and also after South Korean President Moon Jae-in recently reshuffled some of his senior North Korea policy aides.After meeting with Cho, Biegun said the United States is fully engaged in seeking peace on the Korean peninsula, would continue to cooperate closely with South Korea, and is “looking forward” to making progress on the issue this year.Biegun is likely to meet with Suh Hoon, Moon’s new national security advisor who, as spy chief, was instrumental in facilitating summits between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a Seoul official said.Talks with Pyongyang have since stalled, and North Korean officials say the country has no intention to sit down with the United States.Trump said on Tuesday he is open to another meeting with Kim and thinks it might be helpful, Voice of America reported, citing a transcript of an interview Trump gave to Atlanta, Georgia-based Gray Television, due to be aired on Sunday.Kim has been maintaining a low profile in recent months, making far fewer public appearances than usual, according to analysts who monitor his movements. On Wednesday, North Korean state media reported Kim had marked the anniversary of the death of his grandfather, North Korea’s founding leader Kim Il Sung, by visiting his mausoleum at Pyongyang’s Kumsusan Palace of the Sun.NORTH KOREA NOT ENGAGING  Moon’s call for a new Trump-Kim summit and Biegun’s visit had sparked speculation of a last-ditch effort to try to revive North Korea talks ahead of the US presidential election in November.But Biegun has previously played down the likelihood of another in-person summit between Trump and Kim, saying the coronavirus pandemic made arranging such an event unlikely before the election.Upon arrival in South Korea on Tuesday, Biegun and the entire US delegation, as well as the American military air crew who piloted their aircraft, underwent tests for Covid-19 at the US military base in South Korea where they landed. After the tests came back negative, the delegation continued on to Seoul.Besides the coronavirus challenges, North Korea’s strident rejections of new talks also means Biegun’s visit is more likely to focus on coordination between the two allies, rather than seizing some opening for diplomacy, said John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul.“I don’t see signals from North Korea that they are looking for engagement,” he said.Coordination between the two long-time allies is critical now, said Duyeon Kim, a senior advisor at the International Crisis Group, a Belgium-based independent non-profit organisation.“The allies should get on the same page about upcoming defence drills, how their working group can support inter-Korean projects while enforcing existing sanctions, and how to jointly respond if Pyongyang escalates or tests more weapons,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-south-korean-officials-discuss-north-korea-strategy-as-pyongyang-rejects-talks/story-aFLSk2L7GYoiKInoKJLZxN.html
08-07-2020||World||China converts Hong Kong hotel into new national security office||China opened its new national security office in Hong Kong on Wednesday, turning a hotel near a city-centre park that has been one of the most popular venues for pro-democracy protests into its new headquarters.The office, in the bustling shopping and commercial district of Causeway Bay, near Victoria Park, will oversee the Hong Kong government’s enforcement of the sweeping national security legislation that China imposed on the city last week.The law empowers the office to take enforcement action beyond existing city laws in the most serious cases. The legislation allows agents to take suspects across the border for trials in Communist Party-controlled courts and specifies special privileges for its agents, including that Hong Kong authorities cannot inspect their vehicles.The newly appointed chief of the office, Zheng Yanxiong, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and Luo Huining, the head of China’s Liaison Office in the city - Beijing’s top representative office - attended the opening ceremony at the former Metropark Hotel, which was popular with tourists for its harbour views.Luo said the office was “the gatekeeper of national security” and people who loved China and Hong Kong welcomed it.“Those with ulterior motives and who are anti-China and seek to destabilize Hong Kong have not only stigmatized the office, but also smeared the legal system and rule of law in the Chinese mainland in an attempt to stir up unnecessary worries and fears among Hong Kong residents,” Luo said. Security was tight around the hotel, with tall barriers raised and numerous police on duty nearby.‘LEGITIMATE RIGHTS’The law has pushed China’s freest city onto a more authoritarian path and drawn condemnation from some Western governments, lawyers and rights groups.It punishes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. Police have arrested at least 10 people, including a 15-year-old, under it for suspected threats to China’s national security. Critics fear it will crush coveted freedoms in the Chinese-ruled city, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of sometimes violent protests that plunged the former British colony into its biggest crisis in decades.Zheng said the office would enforce the law strictly “without infringing on the legitimate rights and interests of any individual or organisation”.A Communist Party cadre prominent during a 2011 clampdown on land rights protesters in a south China village, 57-year-old Zheng most recently served as secretary general of the Communist Party committee of Guangdong province, bordering Hong Kong.Leaked footage during the 2011 dispute showed him berating villagers and calling foreign media “rotten”.Zheng has never held a post outside Guangdong and has extensive experience in propaganda, having worked at the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily in its southern regional bureau for four years. He was vice minister in charge of propaganda for Guangdong from 2013 to 2018.But in a reflection of the widespread unease over the legislation, major U.S. internet companies including Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Twitter and Zoom have announced they have suspended the processing of requests for user data from the Hong Kong authorities while they study it.Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok, which only operates outside China, said on Tuesday it would exit the Hong Kong market within days. Its departure means Hong Kong users, like those in mainland China, will be cut off.The United States has begun removing Hong Kong’s special status in U.S. law as Washington no longer deems the global financial hub sufficiently autonomous from mainland China.U.S. President Donald Trump’s top advisers weighed proposals to undermine the Hong Kong currency’s peg to the U.S. dollar, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter, although the idea did not appear to gain traction.

The study, an excerpt of which was published in science journal, ‘Nature’, suggests that immune responses, rather than the virus itself, are largely responsible for death in Covid-19 patients.“Numerous studies have suggested that the immune system contributes to the organ damage seen in some severe cases of Covid-19,” the paper read.The study was conducted by the experts at the University of Edinburgh, UK, wherein little correlation was found between levels of the virus and inflammation.The study was carried out by conducting detailed autopsies to map signs of Covid-19 in the body, along with sites of inflammation and injury.Also read: Over 6 months into Covid-19 crisis, 5 mysteries that still shroud coronavirusExperts and scientists are racing to arrive at the first potential vaccine against coronavirus.

08-07-2020||World||Mexico president heads to Washington for meeting with Trump||For his first foreign trip as president, Mexico’s Andrés Manuel López Obrador travels to Washington Tuesday to meet with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly taken shots at Mexico and Mexican migrants to rally his base.The visit, coming just four months before US elections, has many Mexicans cringing. Trump has insulted them, threatened crippling tariffs to strongarm Mexico into playing an uncomfortable role in US immigration policy and insisted they will pay for a border wall meant to keep migrants out of the USBut López Obrador has had a surprisingly warm relationship with Trump. He likes to point out that more recently Trump helped Mexico reach a deal with other oil-producing nations to cut production and aided Mexico in obtaining more ventilators to face the coronavirus pandemic. Both presidents talk about a blossoming friendship that seems to stem from their pursuit of unapologetically nationalist agendas.López Obrador hints at the real reason for the trip when he reels off US economic statistics — the size of the US pandemic stimulus package, the number of jobs the US got back in June. Mexico’s economy was in recession before the pandemic, has shed about 1 million jobs since and is forecast to contract this year by as much as 10%.“This helps us by being neighbors,” López Obrador said Tuesday, before departing. “This is about the economy, it’s about jobs, it’s about well-being.”By late Tuesday his flight had arrived in Dulles International Airport after a layover in Atlanta.There is no doubt Trump will try to use the visit to his advantage. The encounter will draw attention to a trade accord replacing one Trump said was a bad deal and will allow the president to bash former Vice President Joe Biden for voting in favor of the old North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump could stir his base with sharp words for Mexico or simply play up López Obrador’s desire to express his gratitude.In 2016, Trump, then a candidate for the presidency, visited López Obrador’s predecessor, an invitation for which President Enrique Peña Nieto was harshly criticized, inlcuding by López Obrador. Trump left that visit and flew to Arizona where he railed against immigrants.López Obrador, a pragmatist and nationalist above all, knows there is no more important ally than the behemoth to the north, especially as Mexico’s economy plunges deeper into recession. If Trump wins a second term, López Obrador could be calculating he’ll have a friend for the remaining four years of his administration. If the Democrats take office, he trusts they will respect the importance of the bilateral relationship and not hold a grudge.“Maybe he’s making the right bet and we don’t know it,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, associate professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government. She expects Trump to use the visit to rally his base, perhaps even reviving the claim that Mexico will pay for the border wall, a topic López Obrador repeatedly dodged Tuesday.“He’s conscious of what can happen,” she said. “It happened to Peña Nieto. It can easily happen to him.”López Obrador insists that he has no desire to be drawn into US domestic politics. He says he’s going to mark the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which took effect July 1.“There is no way (López Obrador) can spin this visit in his favor,” said Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.Payan said the trade accord doesn’t merit wading into US political waters. “The (trade) agreement is done, finished and in force,” he said. “There is no need to thank anyone. There is no need to express any kind of gratitude. There is no need for a pilgrimage.”That’s a decision Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apparently reached in deciding not to attend the meeting.On Monday, López Obrador added another reason.“If we have a good relationship with the United States government, we are going to avoid mistreatment” of Mexicans living in the US, López Obrador said. López Obrador has repeatedly raised the importance of the remittances sent home by migrants and praised them as heroes.Payan said immigration is always on the bilateral agenda, but he sees little chance for Mexico winning any concessions from Trump, whose administration continues to curtail legal and illegal immigration.“I think Trump is more interested in restricting access to the American labor market today more than ever,” Payan said.Mexico’s worrisome level of violence — 2019 saw the highest number of murders on record — could be an opening. López Obrador could ask for more US assistance in intelligence or tracking drug traffickers’ financial transactions. He says he won’t undermine Mexico’s sovereignty and has been a harsh critic of the Merida Initiative that brought US financial and material support to Mexico as his predecessors battled the cartels.For Trump, the visit is an opportunity to criticize his opponent for supporting NAFTA more than two decades ago, possibling helping garner votes in the Midwest states where workers blamed the old trade deal for prompting US companies to shift manufacturing to Mexico, where labor costs were lower.Trump said replacing the “disastrous NAFTA trade deal” was one of the biggest promises he made to his supporters in 2016. Trade was perhaps the single biggest reason he ran for president in the first place, Trump says.He is fond of saying that after NAFTA was created, the US lost one in four manufacturing jobs while asserting that the new deal will create nearly 100,000 new, high-paying American auto jobs, boost exports for US farmers and ranchers and increase trade with Mexico and Canada.Trump is correct that the United States has lost nearly 4 million factory jobs since that pact took effect in January 1994. But most economists attribute the losses more to the recessions of 2001 and 2007-2009, automation and low-cost competition from China.Biden has said he didn’t regret voting for NAFTA during his time in the Senate. “Fair trade is important,” Biden has said. “Not free trade. Fair trade. And I think that back in the time during the Clinton administration, it made sense at the moment.”From López Obrador’s perspective, a good relationship with whoever occupies the White House is Mexico’s best policy.“We’re going to offer our opinion, but we’re not planning for confrontation,” López Obrador said Tuesday. “We’re going to look to convince, we’re going to seek understanding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-president-heads-to-washington-for-meeting-with-trump/story-cc2aqh1qj5G95qpV8syROO.html
08-07-2020||World||HCQ for Covid-19 highly politicised in US, widely used in India: White House official||The use of hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients has become highly politicized in the US but it is used widely in India, a top White House official has said, asserting latest research showed the malaria drug is highly effective in early stages of Covid-19.“It’s the politicization of this medicine by the mainstream media and portions of the medical community that somehow made this a battle between President Trump and them and created this undue fear and hysteria over a drug, a medicine that has been used for over 60 years relatively safely and is regularly prescribed to pregnant women if they are going to a malaria zone,” White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro told reporters.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “The idea that this is a dangerous drug is just silly, but if you ask the American people based on the media’s coverage of it, that is kind of the state of play right now,” he said.Navarro said a day earlier four doctors at the Detroit Hospital System filed a request for emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine. The request was for three things.“One, for early treatment use in a hospital setting. Number two, treatment between a doctor and his patient in an outpatient setting. Three, not just as a therapeutic but also as a possible prophylaxis for preventative use,” he said.This request to the FDA comes on the heels of the publication of their study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases last week that showed an astonishing 50 percent reduction in the mortality rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine, Navarro said.“Give hydroxy a chance, and please don’t contribute to hydroxy hysteria because if it’s prescribed under the supervision of a doctor, the odds that it can harm you are way, way smaller than the odds that it can help you,” Navarro said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “This has become a highly politicized, but India uses this widely for prophylaxis. There is a number of studies which point to this actually working,” White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro told reporters.The official said if he were to show any kind of symptoms, he would first ask his doctor whether hydroxychloroquine is appropriate. “And then I wouldn’t hesitate to take it,” he said.He said if one looks at the 14-day arc of the virus from the beginning of symptoms, the first seven days are critical: when a person may have fever, dry cough, possibly a profound sense of fatigue.“At that point, your lungs are still intact, and the virus is not appreciably spread to the rest of your organs. Hydroxychloroquine, based on the science in articles like the one that originally appeared in 2005 in the Journal of Virology, works in a therapeutic way by raising the alkalinity of your cells which slows the replication of the virus and also can kill the virus,” he said.It also has an anti-inflammatory effect, which is why it is used for rheumatoid arthritis, and the drug can therefore also help manage what is called the cytokine storm, he said.The latest request to the FDA also comes on the heels of two decisions by the FDA over the last several months to shut down hydroxychloroquine.“The first was what is called a black box warning, the second was a withdrawal of an EUA and what I can tell you as someone who works with the Health and Human Services Department and FEMA to manage the stockpiles of hydroxychloroquine the FDA decisions that they made which I think were precipitous and based on bad science had a tremendously negative effect on two things,” he noted.“One is the ability for American people to use this medicine to protect themselves and two, the ability for hospitals like the Detroit Hospital System to recruit patients for the kind of randomized blind clinical trials that everybody wants to settle once and for all the questions of efficacy and safety,” he added.FDA’s previous decision to reject the emergency use authorization, he said, was based on two types of studies. “One set of studies that were poorly designed and basically doomed to failure, another set of studies where if you look carefully at the data it is very clear that these were late treatment studies where the medicine would not work,” he added.Navarro said the Detroit doctors are bringing back to the FDA a clear case for early treatment.“If the results of the Detroit study are confirmed in later studies, President Trump was absolutely right that hydroxychloroquine can save lives and if in fact early treatment use can lead to a 50 percent reduction in mortality that is tens of thousands of American lives that are at stake by a phenomenon which I call hydroxy hysteria,” Navarro said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19-highly-politicised-in-us-widely-used-in-india-white-house-official/story-kLGI8mV7GVEXzpQWOc2cZP.html
08-07-2020||World||US tops three million known infections as coronavirus surges||The US coronavirus outbreak crossed a grim milestone of over 3 million confirmed cases on Tuesday as more states reported record numbers of new infections, and Florida faced an impending shortage of intensive care unit hospital beds.Authorities have reported alarming upswings of daily caseloads in roughly two dozen states over the past two weeks, a sign that efforts to control transmission of the novel coronavirus have failed in large swaths of the country.California, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas on Tuesday shattered their previous daily record highs for new cases. The biggest jumps occurred in Texas and California, the two largest US states, with more than 10,000 each. About 24 states have reported disturbingly high infection rates as a percentage of diagnostic tests conducted over the past week.In Texas alone, the number of hospitalized patients more than doubled in just two weeks. The trend has driven many more Americans to seek out COVID-19 screenings. The US Department of Health and Human Services said on Tuesday it was adding short-term “surge” testing sites in three metropolitan areas in Florida, Louisiana and Texas.In Houston, a line of more than 200 cars snaked around the United Memorial Medical Center as people waited hours in sweltering heat to get tested. Some had arrived the night before to secure a place in line at the drive-through site.“I got tested because my younger brother got positive,” said Fred Robles, 32, who spent the night in his car. “There’s so many people that need to get tested, there’s nothing you can do about it.”Dean Davis, 32, who lost his job due to the pandemic, said he arrived at the testing site at 3 a.m. Tuesday after he waited for hours on Monday but failed to make the cutoff.“I was like, let me get here at 3, maybe nobody will be here,” Davis said. “I got here, there was a line already.”In Florida, more than four dozen hospitals across 25 of 67 counties reported their intensive care units had reached full capacity, according to the state’s Agency for Health Care Administration. Only 17% of the total 6,010 adult ICU beds statewide were available on Tuesday, down from 20% three days earlier. Additional hospitalizations could strain healthcare systems in many areas, leading to an uptick in lives lost from the respiratory illness that has killed more than 131,000 Americans to date. At least 923 of those deaths were reported Tuesday, the biggest single-day toll since June 10 but still far fewer than the record 2,806 tallied back in April. A widely cited mortality model from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projected on Tuesday that US deaths would reach 208,000 by Nov. 1, with the outbreak expected to gain new momentum heading into the fall.A hoped-for summertime decline in transmission of the virus never materialized, the IHME said. “The US didn’t experience a true end of the first wave of the pandemic,” the IHME’s director, Dr. Christopher Murray, said in a statement. “This will not spare us from a second surge in the fall, which will hit particularly hard in states currently seeing high levels of infections.” ‘PRESSURE ON GOVERNORS’President Donald Trump, who has pushed for restarting the US economy and urged Americans to return to their normal routines, said on Tuesday he would lean on state governors to open schools in the fall.Speaking at the White House, Trump said some people wanted to keep schools closed for political reasons. “No way, so we’re very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools.”New COVID-19 infections are rising in 42 states, based on a Reuters analysis of the past two weeks. By Tuesday afternoon, the number of confirmed US cases had surpassed 3 million, affecting nearly one of every 100 Americans and a population roughly equal to Nevada’s.In Arizona, another hot spot, the rate of coronavirus tests coming back positive rose to 26% for the week ended July 5, leading two dozen states with positivity rates exceeding 5%. The World Heath Organization considers a rate over 5% to be troubling.The surge has forced authorities to backpedal on moves to reopen businesses, such as restaurants and bars, after mandatory lockdowns in March and April reduced economic activity to a virtual standstill and put millions of Americans out of work.The Texas state fair, which had been scheduled to open on Sept. 25, has been canceled for the first time since World War Two, organizers announced on Tuesday.In Ohio, Governor Mike DeWine said the state was ordering people in seven counties to wear face coverings in public starting Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tops-three-million-known-infections-as-coronavirus-surges/story-sEqkWXe8oWuMGJcVSx612M.html
08-07-2020||World||Policy change on international students is misguided, say US universities and lawmakers||Several Congressman and top educational institutions decried the policy change that will require international students who are in the United States with an F-1 visa to take at least one in-person course or else face the prospect of being deported.But the the State Department asserted that many international students who had planned to study this fall in the US may still have the opportunity to do so.The State Department’s statement comes a day after the new guideline created panic among international students, the largest number of whom come from China and India.Congressman Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, and Congresswoman Kathleen Rice, chairwoman of the Border Security, Facilitation, and Operations Subcommittee, said in a joint statement that the new policy will damage the economy, harm US institutions, and do nothing to improve America’s safety or security.Also read: Donald Trump is wrong, yet again | HT Editorial“There is no apparent legitimate reason for the (Trump) administration’s inflexibility toward international students attending colleges and universities that adopt ‘online-only’ policies – the Administration seems to just want them to leave,” the two lawmakers said.International students contribute billions of dollars to the US economy and barring them from our country will deprive Americans of badly needed income. “We cannot allow President Trump to continue destroying jobs and cause needless suffering just to satisfy his anti-immigrant base. We oppose this reckless policy and the lasting harm it will cause to universities and communities across the country,” they said.Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne expressed concern that the decision will create more uncertainty and complexity for international students.“Our international students must be able to continue making progress toward completing their degrees, and as a university we intend to support them in doing so. We will be working with our peers and national associations to understand how best to accomplish that in the context of these new rules, as well as to urge the Administration to rethink its position,” he said.The State Department, which issues visas to international students, however said the decision is temporary. “This will allow a mixture of both in-person and some online coursework to meet the requirements for nonimmigrant student status,” it said.This temporary accommodation provides greater flexibility for nonimmigrant students to continue their education in the United States, while also allowing for proper social distancing on open and operating campuses across America, the State Department said.“International students will still have to obtain the appropriate visa and may still be subject to other visa processing or travel restrictions due to COVID-19. Students should check with the local US embassy or consulate for information specific to their country,” it said.In a statement, the Embassy of India Student Hub encouraged students to monitor their university’s official channels for university/program specific information and to remain in contact with their university DSOs for additional questions.“We will issue updates in the coming days as we receive more clarity on this broadcast message,” it said.Congresswoman Debbie Dengell urged the Department of Homeland Security to review its decision.“Removing these students due to circumstances beyond their control is senseless and concerning. There does not appear to be any public benefit to the US, it will harm the quality of education students receive because of the many logistical challenges, while not in the classroom many remain on campus and in the community contributing to educations and cultural experiences in many other ways, and many have already signed leases and paid tuition as well,” she said.Among all the uncertainty, it’s disturbing that the federal government would initiate removal proceedings for international students especially given it is a reversal of an earlier decision taken by the agency at the on-set of the pandemic, she said.“Online courses are safe and sensible ways for universities to protect their students while continuing to provide a quality education while scientists study the best way to ensure students can learn in a safe environment,” the Congresswoman said.“With the high probability that the coronavirus pandemic will continue to make distance learning the predominant mode of instruction at colleges across the country, the rule change means that most of the estimated 1.1 million international students will be forced out of the country in September,” Chancellor Felix V Matis Rodriguez of the City University of New York said.In a statement, he said that this misguided policy change also threatens to hurt higher education at a time when the nation’s universities are working hard to adjust to the dual health and economic crises caused by the pandemic.“We are once again disappointed that our country’s leadership continues to restrict and reduce opportunities for those who seek them in the United States,” he said adding that he has instructed his administration to explore and pursue measures that would help these students remain in the country and continue their education at CUNY.

08-07-2020||World||Over 6 months into Covid-19 crisis, 5 mysteries that still shroud coronavirus||More than half of the year has already passed and the coronavirus pandemic does not seem to be slowing down with the global tally crossing 11 million recently. More than 50 percent of the patients ( more than 6 million) across the globe have recovered from the deadly contagion while over 5 lakh people have succumbed to death. With over 7 lakh patients, India stands at the third spot after the US and Brazil. The virus which first broke out in China’s Wuhan last year is yet to see a potential vaccine and treatment options and has many mysteries associated with it that need to be demystified. In its latest entry, science journal ‘Nature’ calls for a pressing need to unearth answers to five mysteries linked to coronavirus. So far, science has managed to figure out how the virus “enters and hijacks cells, how some people fight it off and how it eventually kills others. They have identified drugs that benefit the sickest patients, and many more potential treatments are in the works. They have developed nearly 200 potential vaccines — the first of which could be proved effective by the end of the year,” the journal read.However, the journal sheds light on some of the key questions that researchers still don’t have answers to with respect to the disease. These include the following:1. Why do people respond so differently?It is a well-known fact that children and the elderly, especially those with comorbidities, are more susceptible to the virus and experience the severity of the disease, however, it still needs to be understood what makes people respond differently to the virus. 2. What’s the nature of immunity and how long does it last?Immunologists and experts have been trying to determine what immunity to coronavirus disease look like and how long it might last. “Studies have found that levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remain high for a few weeks after infection, but then typically begin to wane,” the journal entry titled, ‘Six months of coronavirus: the mysteries scientists are still racing to solve,’ read.Also read: Masks, sanitisers out of essentials’ list3. Has the virus developed any worrying mutations?Much speculation is around the possible mutation of the virus as it travelled across the continent after first taking shape in China last year. 4. How well will a vaccine work?A growing body of experts and scientists believe that the Covid-19 vaccine would not be for the masses as most people end up recovering on their own from the contagion. The vaccine may target the vulnerable lot of the society, like the elderly and the children and those with co-morbidities. But how effective will it be against the virus is still being assessed. 5. What is the origin of the virus?This remains the million-dollar question. From bats to pangolins, much speculation has stemmed around the theory of the genesis of the virus that was birthed in China. “A comprehensive analysis of more than 1,200 coronaviruses sampled from bats in China also points to horseshoe bats in Yunnan as the probable origin of the new coronavirus,” the paper stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-6-months-into-covid-19-crisis-5-mysteries-that-still-shroud-coronavirus/story-k3eJQKiB9mpnfv8uNGkzlI.html
08-07-2020||World||US probing allegations TikTok violated children’s privacy: Report||The Federal Trade Commission and the US Justice Department are looking into allegations that popular app TikTok failed to live up to a 2019 agreement aimed at protecting children’s privacy, according to two people interviewed by the agencies.The development is the latest bump in the road for the short video company, which is popular with teens. TikTok has seen scrutiny, including from the national security-focused Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, rise sharply because of its Chinese parent corporation.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the United States is “certainly looking at” banning TikTok, suggesting it shared information with the Chinese government, a charge it denied.A staffer in a Massachusetts tech policy group and another source said they took part in separate conference calls with FTC and Justice Department officials to discuss accusations that TikTok had failed to live up to an agreement announced in February 2019.The Center for Digital Democracy, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and others in May asked the FTC look into their allegations TikTok failed to delete videos and personal information about users age 13 and younger as it had agreed to do, among other violations.A TikTok spokesman said they take “safety seriously for all our users,” adding that in the United States they “accommodate users under 13 in a limited app experience that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for a younger audience.”Officials from both the FTC, which reached the original consent agreement with TikTok, and Justice Department, which often files court documents for the FTC, met via video with representatives of the groups to discuss the matter, said David Monahan, a campaign manager with the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.“I got the sense from our conversation that they are looking into the assertions that we raised in our complaint,” Monahan said.A second person, speaking privately, confirmed that advocates had met with officials from the two agencies to discuss concerns TikTok violated the consent decree.The FTC declined to comment. The Justice Department had no immediate comment.TikTok has grown increasing popular among US teenagers and allows users to create short videos. About 60% of TikTok’s 26.5 million monthly active users in the United States are aged 16 to 24, the company said last year.US lawmakers have also raised national security concerns over TikTok’s handling of user data, saying they were worried about Chinese laws requiring domestic companies support and cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party.TikTok, owned by parent company ByteDance, is one of several China-based firms that have had to navigate heightened US-China tensions over trade, technology and the COVID-19 pandemic.Under intense US regulatory scrutiny, it has poached Disney’s Kevin Mayer to be its chief executive and is trying to project a more global image, with offices in California, Singapore and elsewhere.

08-07-2020||World||Proxy wrote test for Trump||US President Donald Trump had paid someone else to take a college admission test for him and was admitted to the elite Wharton Business School on the basis of the proxy’s high score, the US president’s estranged niece has claimed in a tell-all book. In the book Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man, Mary L Trump also wrote that her aunt and Trump’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, had been dismissive about his run for the White House, according to a report in The New York Times on Tuesday.Trump had often cited his admission to Wharton as proof of his intelligence. “I went to the Wharton School of Business,” he said at a Phoenix rally in 2015. “I’m, like, a really smart person.”The book is due for release next week. The Trump family had tried to block its publication through a lawsuit filed by the president’s younger brother Robert Trump, citing a confidentiality agreement from 20 years ago. A court did block the book’s release, as sought, but an appellate court overturned it, clearing its release.Mary Trump, 55, is the daughter of the US president’s elder brother Fred Trump Jr., who died at the age of 42. She has long been estranged from the president.She writes that Trump’s upbringing in one of the wealthiest real estate families of New York gave him a set of “twisted behaviours”, including “cheating as a way of life”. “He’s a clown - this will never happen,” Mary Trump quoted her aunt Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired federal judge, as saying about his presidential run. She also wrote, according to NYT, that her aunt was wary of Trump’s support among evangelicals. “The only time Donald went to church was when the cameras were there,” she quoted her aunt as saying. “ He has no principles.

We will continue to seek reciprocity in our relationship,” Pompeo tweeted on Tuesday.Beijing has continued systematically to obstruct travel to the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas by US diplomats and other officials, journalists, and tourists, while Chinese officials and other citizens enjoy far greater access to the United States, he said in a statement.As such, Pompeo said he is announcing visa restrictions on Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party officials determined to be “substantially involved in the formulation or execution of policies related to access for foreigners to Tibetan areas,” pursuant to the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018.Access to Tibetan areas is increasingly vital to regional stability, given the Chinese human rights abuses there, as well as Beijing’s failure to prevent environmental degradation near the headwaters of Asia’s major rivers, he said.Pompeo said the US will continue to work to advance the sustainable economic development, environmental conservation, and humanitarian conditions of Tibetan communities within China and abroad.“We also remain committed to supporting meaningful autonomy for Tibetans, respect for their fundamental and unalienable human rights, and the preservation of their unique religious, cultural, and linguistic identity. In the spirit of true reciprocity, we will work closely with the US Congress to ensure US citizens have full access to all areas of the People’s Republic of China, including the TAR and other Tibetan areas,” Pompeo said.The State Department funding for the Tibetan issues for the fiscal year 2021 beginning October 1 has been proposed to be $17 million and $1 million for the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, according to the budget papers which is now making its way through the Congressional approval process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-restricts-visas-on-chinese-officials-over-tibet/story-Ko95E68juoNMXTpdFiDcjM.html

08-07-2020||World||‘Perfect storm of catastrophes’: Mary Trump’s book offers devastating portrayal of president||President Donald Trump’s niece offered a devastating portrayal of him in a book that credits a “perfect storm of catastrophes” for exposing the president at his worst.Mary L. Trump, a psychologist, writes that the coronavirus pandemic, the possibility of an economic depression and deepening social divides have brought out the “worst effects” of Donald Trump’s pathologies, which were less evident when the country had a stable economy and the lack of serious crises.Those factors, along with “Donald’s penchant for division, and uncertainty about our country’s future have created a perfect storm of catastophes that no one is less equipped than my uncle to manage,” she writes.The president’s brother Robert tried to bar publication of the book. Early copies of the book, slated for publication next week, became available on Tuesday. It is titled: “Too Much and Never Enough, How My Family Created The World’s Most Dangerous Man.”A ruling briefly blocking its publication was lifted last week by a New York state appellate judge.Mary Trump is the daughter of Fred Trump Jr., the president’s elder brother, who died in 1981. She has a doctorate in psychology.Robert Trump had argued in legal papers that Mary Trump was subject to a 20-year-old agreement between family members that no one would publish accounts involving the core family members without their approval.Simon & Schuster said it did not know about any alleged family agreement until a few weeks ago and was not a part of any deal. It said that 75,000 first-run editions had already been sent to bookstores.In the book, Mary Trump writes that current challenges have weakened the president’s usual tools for shielding himself from blame.“His ability to control unfavorable situations by lying, spinning, and obfuscating has diminished to the point of impotence in the midst of the tragedies we are currently facing,” she said.“His egregious and arguably intentional mishandling of the current catastrophe has led to a level of pushback and scrutiny that he’s never experienced before, increasing his belligerence and need for petty revenge as he withholds vital funding, personal protective equipment, and ventilators that your tax dollars have paid for from states whose governors don’t kiss his ass sufficiently,” Mary Trump wrote.The White House declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/perfect-storm-of-catastrophes-mary-trump-s-book-offers-devastating-portrayal-of-president/story-vP7QyODZZHTzZbOsoj4dMO.html

However, detailed guidelines would be issued by the CM on Thursday; he told the media in Bhopal on Wednesday evening.According to the state government’s official release, while reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state Chouhan said, “Earlier, the Covid-19 growth rate in the state was 1.72% which increased to 2.01%. Wearing of masks and physical distancing must be strictly ensured in all districts. A public advisory should be issued in all border districts. Necessary restrictions should be imposed once a week in all districts.”As per the release, in districts like Barwani, Morena and other bordering districts the viral infection was on the rise due to the spread of the disease in other states across the border. “In this connection, the chief minister directed chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains and director general of police (DGP) Vivek Johri to prepare a mechanism in this regard and issue a public advisory,” the release read.In the meeting additional chief secretary (ACS), health department Mohd Suleman informed the CM that the 15-day ‘Kill Corona Campaign’ launched from July 1 had given good results so far in the state. Earlier, the testing capacity in the state was 6,000 tests per day, which touched 12,104 due to the campaign.“Samples taken under the Kill Corona Campaign have a positivity rate of 2.2%, which is a good sign,” he said.The senior IAS officer said, “The situation in Indore is constantly improving as the positivity rate of the disease has steadily decreased. Earlier this rate was up to 11%, which has now come down to 2.12%. There are currently 875 active cases in Indore and 3,871 patients have recovered and returned home. The death rate in Indore has reduced to less than 1%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-growth-rate-has-gone-up-due-to-cases-from-border-districts-shivraj-singh-chouhan/story-srYktWQz1NVifbBsHCVxsL.html

Official sources had said the status of ongoing infrastructure projects along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), including the Ladakh region, figured prominently in the Tuesday’s meeting.

The total death toll stood at 827 with 23 people dying due to the infection on Wednesday.Kolkata has around 25 containment zones where the lockdown will be imposed and the adjoining districts of Howrah and North 24 Parganas have 56 and 95 such zones each. Kolkata registered a spike of 366 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday taking the total number of cases in the city to 8,046 till date. ALSO READ | CM Mamata scraps list of South 24 Parganas containment zones, wants it redoneSince Wednesday morning people started scurrying to local shops and markets to purchase daily essential items. “I don’t want to take the risk given the experience we had when lockdown was first imposed. What if the supply runs out? I purchased rice, atta, a few kilos of potato, sugar and cooking oil among other items. They will not rot,” said Susmita Biswas, a housewife at Anandapur in east Kolkata.Out of the 25 containment zones in Kolkata, only five were in the slum areas while housing complexes, mixed residential areas and multiple premises comprised the rest. Local shopkeepers said that the residents almost stripped the shelves and bought whatever they could to store in their houses. Queues could be seen outside super markets during the day.“Usually I get around 50 customers every day. But on Wednesday I received double and by evening several items such as noodles and biscuits had almost vanished,” said Ratan Pramanik, a shop keeper in Sinthee, in north Kolkata.On Wednesday, Banerjee announced that the lockdown would be enforced for seven days after which the situation would be analyzed. If the situation improves, areas which register a decline in Covid-19 cases would be removed from the containment zone list.The chief minister was, however, visibly peeved with the containment zone list of South 24 Parganas, another adjoining district of Kolkata. The chief minister said the zones had been marked indiscriminately and scrapped the list, asking officials to review it. An order issued by the state home secretary on Tuesday said that all government and private offices will remain closed, there would be a complete ban on non-essential activities, congregations would be strictly prohibited, no transport would be allowed and markets would be shut down in these containment areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panic-buying-returns-in-kolkata-as-city-braces-for-fresh-lockdown-in-25-zones/story-K8huwmiQCEiL39wND3dOAJ.html

Wednesday’s number of new Covid-19 cases is the second highest single-day spike recorded so far that has pushed the number of active cases to 91,065, according to the state health department.Out of the news cases, 1,347 were from Mumbai that took its tally to 87,856. The number of active cases in Mumbai is 23,543. On Tuesday, the city recorded 785 cases, the lowest in the last 56 days. Maharashtra recorded the highest single day spike on Saturday with 7,074 cases. The highest death toll in a day was also reported on Saturday with 295 casualties. Maharashtra crossed the two lakh mark in 17 weeks since the first Covid-19 case was reported on March 9. There were 198 casualties on Wednesday taking the death toll in the state to 9,448, the health department said. Sixty-two of the deaths were in Mumbai where the death toll has gone up to 5,064.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.After the high of 7,074 cases on Saturday, the state reported relatively lower numbers of new cases in the last three days. On July 5, July 6 and July 7, it reported 6,555, 5,368 and 5,134 cases respectively. However, the number of fresh cases is still high.Health experts said that decline in new cases will have significance only if it sustains for 10-14 days. “Though, it is a good sign, but three day period actually has no significance. In case of such a pandemic, we will have to monitor the trend for over a period of seven to ten days and if it continues to reduce for 14 days then we will be in a position to say that it is a very good sign,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state.In the last eight days (since July 1), the state recorded 48,965 as against 302 cases in March, 10,196 cases in April, 57,157 cases in May and 1,02,172 cases in June. On an average, Maharashtra is adding 6,120 new cases of Covid-19 every day.The state has recently decided to form a task force of expert doctors in all the districts, to control the situation.With 9,448 deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded 4.22%. It is the second highest in the country after Gujarat where CFR is 5.26% with 1977 deaths (37,550 cases) till Tuesday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Maharashtra still has the highest number of deaths across states in the country.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that they are focusing on reducing CFR and for this they have decided to increase daily number of tests in the state. “We have decided to conduct more testing so that more people can be traced and CFR as well as positive rate against total testing can be reduced and be brought under 10%,” Tope said.Currently, the positive rate against total tests is 18.77% as 2,23,724 tests were found positive out of total 11,91,549 sample tested so far.He said that the state is doing more test than the target of 140 per day against per million of population in each district set by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Currently, 47,072 people have been kept in institutional quarantine and 6,38,762 people have been put under home quarantine across the state. The health minister said the existing institutional quarantine facilities in metro cities need to be augmented considering aggressive tracing slum areas. On Monday, the state government issued a notification allowing hotels, lodges and guest houses to operate from Wednesday, but at 33% of their capacity. It has also issued guidelines for strict compliance with measures to contain the spread of coronavirus.Dine-in restaurants, however, will remain to be shut and operate only for takeaways as the government has not taken any decision yet. Restaurants at hotels and guest houses will be available only for the resident guests, although the government has pressed for room services and takeaways. Swimming pools, gymnasiums, playing areas, gaming arcades and gatherings of more than 15 people at these hotels will not be allowed, the notification issued by chief secretary Sanjay Kumar stated.On Tuesday, the state government also extended the timings of shops and markets by two hours across the state. The earlier order issued on June 29 had restricted shops to remain open till 5pm from 9 am to avoid crowding at market places in cities and rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-tally-reaches-2-23-724-with-second-highest-spike-of-6-603-cases/story-b3gglxRjEzU0Mdyt4mKfmJ.html

Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said one cannot expect anything from Pakistan. “We have to put our faith in the Indian government. It must go flat out to ensure legal rights are granted to Kulbhushan Jadhav,” he said.“They (Government of India) should move heaven and earth, they should make applications in the ICJ, the matter has not ended. They should create an adverse public opinion globally that how can a man who is defenceless not be allowed to exercise these rights,” he added.Singhvi hoped that the government will take steps in the next few weeks rather than waiting for Pakistan to make amends. He was asked about Pakistani media reports that Jadhav refused to file an appeal in the Islamabad High Court against his death sentence.India on Wednesday called as “farce” Pakistan’s claim that Kulbhushan Jadhav, on a death row in an alleged espionage case, has refused to file an appeal against his sentence. Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said Jadhav has clearly been coerced to refuse to file a review in his case, and termed it as a “brazen attempt” to scuttle even the inadequate remedy available to him.“Pakistan’s claim that Jadhav, who is incarcerated in Pakistan’s custody, has refused to initiate review petition is a continuation of the farce that has been in play for the last four years,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-legal-rights-to-kulbhushan-jadhav-govt-should-move-icj-congress/story-a2Q9Q9O4iTpQMrruZbhUVL.html
08-07-2020||India||DLF brings down small portion of Noida mall’s roof||Realty major DLF on Wednesday said it has brought down a small portion of the roof of its shopping mall in Noida that got damaged due to thunderstorm and adverse weather conditions last month. The clarification came after a video went viral on social media that showed a part of the roof of ‘DLF Mall of India’ collapsing. DLF said the reopening of the 2 million sq ft mall was not linked to this repair work. The mall will be opened soon after ensuring that all the SOPs (standard operating procedures) are followed to ensure social distancing because of the coronavirus pandemic. “We had commenced planned enhancement works in a part of The Mall of India, Noida, when the lockdown was suddenly implemented. During this time, a small portion, admeasuring about 650 square metres only, or just under 3 per cent of total roof area was in the process of being prepared for these enhancement works,” DLF spokesperson said in a statement. The work, however, could not get started due to the COVID-19 lockdown. “The freak thunderstorm and extreme weather conditions that hit the city of Noida in June adversely impacted this portion of the roof in its vulnerable state,” the spokesperson said. The company decided “to bring down that entire portion of the roof admeasuring about 650 sq metres and rebuild it completely to the originally intended enhanced standards”, the spokesperson said. The reopening of The DLF Mall of India was not and is not linked to these enhancement works in any manner, the company said. The opening of the mall is directly related to carrying out of all coronavirus-related works in order to ensure safe experience for customers, it added. “We are hopeful of completing these activities soon and shall look forward to announcing the opening date in the near future. The enhancement works shall go on parallelly in a safe and planned manner,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dlf-brings-down-small-portion-of-noida-mall-s-roof/story-MvOq7zLchXBy5OeGVhcNhP.html
08-07-2020||India||It’s a farce: MEA on Pak claim that Kulbhushan Jadhav refused to file review petition||India on Wednesday said Pakistan’s claim that Indian death-row convict Kulbhushan Jadhav refused to file a review petition against his sentence is a continuation of the “farce” that has been in play for the last four years and that Islamabad is only seeking to create an “illusion of remedy” in the case. Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said Jadhav has “clearly been coerced” to refuse to file a review petition, and termed Pakistan’s claim a “brazen attempt” to scuttle even the inadequate remedy available to him.He said India will do its utmost to protect Jadhav and ensure his safe return to India, asserting that it would consider “all appropriate options”.Earlier, Pakistan said Jadhav refused to file an appeal in the Islamabad High Court against his conviction by a military court despite being offered the option.Jadhav, a retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. Weeks later, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.In July last year, the Hague-based ICJ ruled that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.The MEA spokesperson said Pakistan is attempting to create a “mirage” of compliance with the ICJ judgment, adding the country has refused to hand over any relevant document, including the FIR (first information report), evidence and the court order in the case to India. “Pakistan’s claim that Jadhav, who is incarcerated in Pakistan’s custody, has refused to initiate review petition is a continuation of the farce that has been in play for the last four years,” Srivastava said, responding to media queries on the issue. “Jadhav has been sentenced to execution through a farcical trial. He remains under custody of Pakistan’s military. He has clearly been coerced to refuse to file a review in his case,” the MEA spokesperson said. He said India sought “unimpeded access” to Jadhav to discuss the remedies available to him under an ordinance, adding Pakistan is only seeking to create an “illusion of remedy”.“In a brazen attempt to scuttle even the inadequate remedy under the ordinance, Pakistan has obviously coerced Jadhav to forego his rights to seek an implementation of the judgment of the International Court of Justice,” he said.On May 20, Pakistan passed an ordinance to allow for the high court to review the sentence awarded by their military courts. “The ICJ has already held that Pakistan is in egregious violation of international law. Government will do its utmost to protect Jadhav and ensure his safe return to India. To that end, it would consider all appropriate options,” Srivastava said. He said India has repeatedly asked to allow a lawyer from outside Pakistan to appear for Jadhav in any review and reconsideration proceedings, but Pakistan denied it. “Since 2017, when Military Court carried out a farcical trial, Pakistan has refused to hand over any relevant document, including FIR, evidence, court order, etc in the case to India. Clearly, Pakistan is attempting to create a mirage of compliance with the ICJ judgment,” the MEA spokesperson said.He said Pakistan has maintained that its laws allowed for effective review and reconsideration.“Now, after almost a year, they have made a U-turn and issued an ordinance to ostensibly provide for some sort of review. We have already expressed our serious concerns at the content of the ordinance and how it violates the ICJ judgment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-s-a-farce-mea-on-pak-claim-that-kulbhushan-jadhav-refused-to-file-review-petition/story-6Mv3CrMLz6J7dRI8EIGDVN.html

He said, “The PSOs are being arrested.”Former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah condemned the killing of the BJP leader.“Sorry to hear about the murderous terror attack on the BJP functionaries and their father in Bandipore earlier this evening. I condemn the attack. My condolences to their families in this time of grief. Sadly the violent targeting of mainstream political workers continues unabated,” tweeted Omar soon after the attack.Bari, 28, was the known face of BJP in Bandipore district and had contested 2014 assembly election as an independent candidate.

08-07-2020||India||UK envoy who named daughter ‘India’ presents credentials to Prez Kovind||The United Kingdom’s new high commissioner to India, Philip Barton, on Wednesday gave us a glimpse into how he prepared before presenting his credentials to President Ram Nath Kovind during a virtual ceremony.In a short video which he posted on his Twitter handle, Barton begins speaking with a ‘Namaste’ and goes on to explain that it is an exciting day for him as he takes up his new assignment. Introducing himself as the new British high commissioner designate to India, he goes on to describe the process of presenting his credentials to the head of state and what it literally translates into.Letters of credentials are the letters signed by the Queen of England – the head of state of the United Kingdom addressed to the President of India asking him and the state of India to give credence (comes from a French word) to what the new designate says while discharging his official duties. The letters also urge the President to believe that the diplomat speaks on behalf of the United Kingdom during his stay in the country.Barton gives us a peep at the original copies of the letter duly signed by Queen Elizabeth-II and addressed to President Kovind. The ceremony, which had to be carried out virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic, was nevertheless an important one for Indo-British relations. WATCH | Before presenting credentials to President Kovind , UK envoy records a video explainerEarlier today, I recorded this video to share a sneak peek into how I was getting ready to present my credentials to the President of India. pic.twitter.com/oJ9OSNLXSMBarton’s connections with India go back a long way. His new assignment is definitely not his first brush with the country. “We often speak of the ‘living bridge’ of people, ideas and institutions that tie the UK and India together. I, too, am a part of that bridge,” he says. He goes on to elaborate that his mother happened to be born in Shimla and Barton was posted in national capital Delhi in the 1990s. He met his wife, Amanda, when both of them lived and worked in the country. They named their daughter ‘India’ – “not knowing I would return one day as high commissioner”.Barton’s arrival in the country and the presentation of his credentials was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which broke out earlier this year. He succeeded Dominic Asquith, who served as high commissioner from April 2016 to January this year.“The UK-India relationship is remarkable and we share an unparalleled breadth and depth of connection. There is a deep commitment across the British government, industry and civil society to develop that relationship even further,” Barton said in a statement.He identified several key areas – developing the trade and economic partnership following the Britain’s exit from the European Union, tackling global challenges of climate change and green recovery, acting together as a force for good in the world, and working closely to keep both countries safe and secure.Earlier, Barton also served as the UK’s high commissioner to Pakistan during 2014-16 and as acting chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee during 2016-17, acknowledged he had arrived in India at an “extraordinarily difficult time”.Barton joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1986 and has previously served as the Director General (consular and security) in London and as deputy ambassador in Washington. Before arriving in New Delhi last month, he helped the UK government adapt its long-term planning to the Covid-19 pandemic.With Barton’s arrival, Jan Thompson, who served as acting high commissioner from February to June, has returned to her role as deputy high commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-high-commissioner-presents-credentials-to-president-gives-us-a-sneak-peek-as-he-preps/story-EJJeUAN1XAJot7JbibHmwO.html

A couple of his accomplices have been shot down while a few others have been arrested over the last few days. Vikas himself is said to have given the police a slip in the nearby district of Faridabad, where he was hiding with some associates. Ankur, Shravan and Kartikey alias Prabhat were arrested in a joint operation by Uttar Pradesh STF and a local crime branch team. The arrests were made by the team after a brief exchange of fire while raiding a house around Tuesday midnight in Faridabad’s Kheli Pul area, where the gangster is reported to have stayed for a while, said Haryana police.Later, CCTV footage showed a man resembling Dubey near a Faridabad hotel. He did not check in when a staff member insisted on an identity card with a clear photograph.In another operation on Wednesday, a team of UP special task force picked up the wanted gangsters’ brother-in-law Gyanendra Nigam and his son from Madhya Pradesh’s Shahdol district. Nigam claims to have snapped ties with Dubey 15-years ago after he entered the world of crime, however, a police official said that he used to look after accounts and properties of Vikas Dubey.”Hunt for gangster Vikas Dubey intensifies: All the latest updatesTalking to local media persons before being taken to Kanpur by the UP STF, Nigam said he had no connection with his sister Richa and brother-in-law Vikas.In other related operations, a close aide of Dubey named Amar Dubey was shot dead by the police in UP’s Hamirpur after he failed to cross over to Madhya Pradesh.

In a statement issued by ministry of external affairs on Wednesday evening, India has stated that Jadhav has clearly been coerced to refuse to file a review in his case, and termed it as a “brazen attempt” to scuttle even the inadequate remedy available to him.Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of “espionage and terrorism” in April 2017 following which India had moved the International Court of Justice (ICJ) seeking a stay on his death sentence.Also read: Pakistan coerced Kulbushan Jadhav to refuse case review, says IndiaHere is the full statement issued by MEA on the issue:“We have been pursuing through diplomatic channels full and effective implementation of the ICJ judgment in the case of Shri Kulbushan Jadhav. The media statement made by Pakistan today in the case seeks to mask its continuing reticence to implement ICJ judgment in letter and spirit.Pakistan’s claim that Shri Jadhav, who is incarcerated in Pakistan’s custody, has refused to initiate review petition is a continuation of the farce that has been in play for the last four years. Shri Jadhav has been sentenced to execution through a farcical trial. He remains under custody of Pakistan’s military. He has clearly been coerced to refuse to file a review in his case. India sought unimpeded access to Shri Jadhav to discuss his remedies under the Ordinance. In a brazen attempt to scuttle even the inadequate remedy under the Ordinance, Pakistan has obviously coerced Shri Jadhav to forego his rights to seek an implementation of the judgment of the ICJ.Pakistan has on 20 May 2020 passed an Ordinance to allow for the High Court to review the sentence awarded by their military court. They have all along maintained that their laws allowed for effective review and reconsideration while we have protested it all along. Now, after almost a year, they have made a u-turn and issued an Ordinance to ostensibly provide for some sort of review. We have already expressed our serious concerns at the content of the Ordinance and how it violates the ICJ judgment. Pakistan is only seeking to create an illusion of remedy.Despite our repeated requests, Pakistan continues to deny India free and unimpeded access to Shri Jadhav. India has repeatedly asked to allow a lawyer from outside Pakistan to appear for Shri Jadhav in any review and reconsideration proceedings. Pakistan has denied it. Since 2017, when Military Court carried out a farcical trial, Pakistan has refused to hand over any relevant document, including FIR, evidence, court order, etc in the case to India. Clearly, Pakistan is attempting to create a mirage of compliance with the ICJ judgment.ICJ has already held that Pakistan is in egregious violation of international law. Government will do its utmost to protect Shri Jadhav and ensure his safe return to India. To that end, it would consider all appropriate options.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-denying-kulbhushan-jadhav-inadequate-remedy-says-mea-read-full-statement-here/story-SgJchKgJzVU5vOdCjxtIPN.html

08-07-2020||India||Indian, Chinese militaries to carry out verification of disengagement process in eastern Ladakh||Indian and Chinese armies are expected to carry out a joint verification to assess the implementation of the disengagement process once the dismantling of temporary infrastructure and withdrawal of troops by China are completed in the friction points in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday. They said the two militaries are set to hold extensive talks on finalising modalities for restoring normalcy and bringing back peace and tranquillity in the region after the verification of the disengagement exercise is completed. The mutual disengagement of troops from the standoff points has been undertaken as a measure to ease the situation in the region and the larger focus would be to ensure the total restoration of status quo ante in all areas of the region, they said. As per the mutual understanding, neither side will carry out any patrolling in the friction points till modalities for restoration of peace and tranquillity are thrashed out. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held “a frank and in-depth exchange of views” on Sunday to de-escalate tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The Chinese military began pulling back of troops from a number of friction points from Monday morning. The Chinese military has already withdrawn troops from Galwan Valley and Hot Springs, while the pull back is likely to be over in Gogra on Thursday. Military sources said Indian Army will continue to maintain its aggressive posturing along the Line of Actual Control till the Chinese side cuts down on its significant build up in its rear bases along the LAC, the de-facto border between India and China. Both sides have brought in thousands of additional troops and weaponry including tanks and artillery guns to their rear bases as part of a mega build up following the face-off that began on May 5. “There is a trust factor now. We will not lower our guard at all,” said a senior military official on the condition of anonymity. The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in the bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last eight weeks. The tension escalated manifold after the Galwan Valley clash. Both sides have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks in the last few weeks to ease tension in the region. However, there was no visible sign of any end to the standoff till Sunday evening. Sources said the breakthrough was achieved at the Doval-Wang meeting. On June 30, the Indian and Chinese armies held the third round of Lt General-level talks during which both sides agreed on an “expeditious, phased and step wise” de-escalation as a “priority” to end the standoff. In the talks on June 22, the two sides arrived at a “mutual consensus” to “disengage” from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh. The first round of the Lt General talks was held on June 6 during which both sides finalised an agreement to disengage gradually from all the standoff points beginning with Galwan Valley. However, the situation deteriorated following the Galwan Valley clashes as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC. On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise visit to Ladakh during which he said the era of expansionism is over and that the history is proof that “expansionists” have either lost or perished, in comments which were seen as a clear message to China that India is not going to back off and would deal with the situation with a firm hand. Tensions had escalated in eastern Ladakh around two months back after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-militaries-to-carry-out-verification-of-disengagement-process-in-eastern-ladakh/story-qDecV9U1AWybvlOy89HqaN.html
08-07-2020||India||After biggest spike of 749 Covid-19 cases in Bihar, lockdown imposed from July 10||After a relaxation of more than a month, restrictions will once again be imposed in the state capital of Patna from July 10 for a week after the state reported 749 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday. In all, Patna has a total of 1,351 Covid-19 cases till date.Patna district magistrate, Kumar Ravi, issued an order on Wednesday in this regard under “The Bihar Epidemic Diseases, Covid-19 Regulations, 2020” after the crisis management group of the state government authorized district officials to impose restrictions after assessing the local situation. According to the order, the state capital will be under lockdown from July 10 till July 16.The order effectively means that all offices of the Central government, its autonomous/subordinates offices and public offices (with the exception of defence, central armed police forces, treasury, public utilities, disaster management, power generation, etc.) will remain closed during the period.In addition to this, offices of the state government/union territory governments, their autonomous bodies, corporations, etc., (with exceptions of police, home guards, disaster administration, treasury, electricity, sanitation) as well as commercial and private establishments will also remain shut.All places of worship will remain closed during the period and no religious congregation will be allowed.However, for the convenience of people, different shops including ration shops (under PDS) dealing with food, groceries, fruits and vegetables, dairy and milk booths, meat and vegetables, fish will remain open between 6 am and 10 am and 4 pm to 7 pm.In order to minimize the movement of people, the authorities will encourage and facilitate home delivery to restrict the movement of individuals outside their homes.The order exempts banks, insurance offices and ATMS, telecommunications, delivery of all kinds of goods including food, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment through e-commerce, petrol pumps, LPG, and gas retail and storage outlets, power generation, transmission and distribution units and services, capital and debt market services, electronic and print media from lockdown.Also exempted are cold storages, ware housing services, private security services, and industrial establishments hospitality services, etc.The DM’s order said that the step was initiated following an alarming surge in Covid-19 positive cases in the district of Patna in the last three weeks wherein the positivity rate has also been considerably high.Elsewhere in Bihar, the West Champaran administration imposed lockdown from July 9 from 7 am till 5 pm but allowed shops to function from 11 am till 5.30 pm.Similarly, lockdown has been enforced by the Bhagalpur administration in the urban areas besides Sultanganj, Kahalgaon and Naugachhia. The administration said that the lockdown would be enforced from 6 am on Thursday (July 9) till midnight on Monday (July 13). In Bettiah, the lockdown will continue till further orders.Incidentally, Patna has so far reported 1,351 Covid-19 positive cases and the death of 12 people. So far 641 people have recovered from the virus. Bhagalpur has reported 693 cases of which 472 people have recovered. The district reported 50 new cases on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-biggest-spike-of-749-covid-19-cases-in-bihar-lockdown-imposed-from-july-10/story-4P36Qog7VFRxxMTGJF7UTN.html
08-07-2020||India||China’s pullback in Ladakh’s Pangong Finger Area to test disengagement||With disengagement between the Indian and Chinese armies making measurable progress in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra, the focus of reducing tensions in eastern Ladakh has shifted to the sensitive Finger Area near Pangong Tso, where the Indian Army has observed a marginal thinning of troops, vehicles and removal of structures from a key spur over the last 24 hours, people familiar with the developments said on Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.Some Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) elements have retreated from Finger 4 but it can’t by any stretch be seen as disengagement, said one of the officials cited above. The Finger Area refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking Pangong lake.Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger Four overlooking Indian deployments, the army would patrol right up to Finger Eight that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers Four and Eight are 8 km apart.“The Finger Area will now be at the centre of the step-wise disengagement process, which is underway at friction points in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra. Temporary buffer zones between rival troops have been created there. The Finger Area will be the hardest part of disengagement,” said a second official.The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger Eight, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger Four where the PLA has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes, observation posts and tented camps over the last two months.The army has begun a rigorous verification process to monitor the withdrawal of the PLA from Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra, where 4 km buffer zones between troops have come up, as reported by Hindustan Times on Wednesday.While the PLA has withdrawn up to 2 km from Patrolling Point 14 (Galwan Valley) and PP-15 (Hot Springs) over the last three days, a similar retreat is expected to be completed at PP-17 (Gogra) within a 24-hour time frame (Thursday), said a third official. The Indian Army is pulling back proportionately in these areas. This is based on an understanding on June 30 by top Indian and Chinese commanders on a phased de-escalation of the ongoing border conflict.Military experts said the Finger Area will test the disengagement process.“Disengagement appears to be making reasonable progress in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra. The Finger Area will now be the focal point of the disengagement process and will be a true test of China’s commitment and sincerity to resolve the situation,” said former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd).The disengagement effort involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the complex plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides. It also entails the phased withdrawal of weapons and equipment to a mutually agreed distance, and finally the restoration of status quo ante (the situation as it existed in early April).The army is keeping a close watch on the ongoing pull back by the PLA. The creation of buffer zones will temporarily restrict the patrolling activities of both armies in the region. While some experts saw this as a necessary step, others cautioned that the temporary curtailing of patrolling rights should not become a long-term feature undermining Indian presence and control, as reported by HT on Wednesday.Disengagement during a 2014 border standoff at Chumar in Ladakh involved a temporary ban on Indian and Chinese soldiers patrolling disputed areas.The army is keeping a strict vigil along the contested border in the Depsang sector where a 2013 Chinese intrusion blocked the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes, including the ones leading to PPs-10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13.The military buildup in Indian and Chinese depth areas hasn’t thinned, with both sides keeping their guard up. The deployment of thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence weapons continues in the region.The disengagement process, a precursor to any kind of de-escalation of the border conflict, started under the terms mutually agreed to at the June 30 meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region. This understanding, in turn, was the result of earlier efforts not paying dividends.It also followed a two-hour video conference between India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and China’s foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official statements by both countries on Monday.A limited military disengagement in the same friction areas — Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra — was initiated last month after the commanders reached an understanding on reducing tensions during their first meeting on June 6. But the Galwan Valley skirmish on June 15 dashed disengagement hopes. The clash left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead.The corps commander-ranked officers then met on June 22 when they hammered out a consensus on disengaging from friction points. However, it neither enabled any disengagement on the ground nor led to the thinning of the military build-up, leading to their third meeting on June 30.At the June 30 meeting, the Indian side reiterated its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from friction points along the LAC and sought the restoration of status quo ante in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang plains, apart from emphasising the need for thinning the military buildup in the region. The first part of this process is underway at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-pullback-in-ladakh-s-pangong-finger-areas-to-test-disengagement/story-oRUELqABgocgUMbLkbPWFM.html

08-07-2020||India||Nepal objects to road-repair work near border in Bihar’s Sitamarhi, leaves officials surprised||The Nepal authorities have raised the border issue with Bihar again. This time, they have forced the state road construction department (RCD) to stall repair and strengthening of the northernmost stretch of Sitamarhi-Bhittamore Road near the border in Sursand block of Sitmarhi district, officials said on Wednesday.A senior officer of the department, who was not willing to be named, said that the work has been stopped a few days ago after Nepal officials objected to the widening of road in its 1.10km stretch, close to the border, which is about 125 km north from the state capital, Patna. He said the matter has been referred to the state home department for resolution.The RCD official said the objection from Nepal came as a ‘shock and surprise’ as there was a clearly demarcated border between the two countries at the spot and check posts of both the countries had been working on either side of the no-man’s land for decades.“We were carrying out repair and strengthening down south of the international pillars and beyond the no-man’s land. The state government never faced any objection for any construction work earlier,” said the official, who rushed to the spot immediately after Nepal officials objected to the work, claiming that the area fell under territorial command as per survey records.Rajnath Singh reviews ongoing infra projects along border regionsConfirming the development, additional chief secretary, home, Amir Subhani said the state government was closely watching the developments on the border with Nepal. “We are trying to find out the solution at the earliest. We are in touch with the Central government also,” said Subhani.This is the second instance of Nepali authorities raising their objections to construction work being done by the Bihar government near the border.A fortnight ago, Nepal government officials had stalled the fortification work on an embankment of Lal Bakeya river in Dhaka block of East Champaran district in the Indian territory near the no-man’s land. They are now threatening to pull down a part of the embankment.Subhani said the border issue with Nepal relating to East Champaran was yet to be resolved.Sharad Pawar recalls visits by Nehru, Chavan to border post-1962 warThe Sitamarhi-Bhittamore road is important for religious reasons as it connects Janakpur, which houses a 200-year-old Janki Temple with Sithamarhi—considered to be the birth place of Goddess Sita.Earlier in June, Nepal Armed Police had shot dead a Bihari youth and injured three others following an altercation.PM Oli doesn’t budge an inch in Nepal standoff, party stares at a possible splitThe relationship between India and Nepal has come under strain after Nepal’s Parliament approved a new political map, claiming its territorial command over key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura of Uttarakhand in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-objects-to-road-repair-work-near-border-in-bihar-s-sitamarhi-leaves-officials-surprised/story-s8KUdbMawvMw3eCMO52tjM.html
08-07-2020||India||‘It is 10% here’: Bengal CM on corruption complaints over Amphan relief||Stung by the opposition complaints of nepotism and corruption over distribution of money in Amphan relief, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said the issue was being blown out of proportion, alleging that the rate of corruption in other states was at 90 percent. The chief minister gave no statistic or proof for the charge made against other states. “In other states, the rate of corruption is at 90 per cent. It is 10 per cent here. Our administration is taking strict action,” Banerjee said at Wednesday’s press conference at Nabanna, the state secretariat.It is alleged that the compensation of Rs 20,000 went to numerous people who suffered no loss during the Cyclone. It is also alleged that multiple members from the same families got Rs 20,000 each. CM Banerjee has asked district administrations to review the payments and take back the money. As a cautionary measure, some bank accounts are also being frozen. “The opposition is blowing it [issue] up and staging agitation every day. The irregularities took place only in a small fraction of places. Good work was done in the rest of the areas. Corruption is rampant in other parties. When the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was in power every panchayat in Bengal was involved in corruption,” Banerjee said. According to official estimates, 28.6 lakh houses were damaged by the Cyclone and the state suffered a loss of Rs 28,560 crore. The chief minister announced an initial relief fund of Rs 6,250 crore. Part of this money is being given to villagers to repair homes. On June 2, Banerjee said the government had transferred funds to the bank accounts of nearly five lakh people.The CPI(M) reacted sharply, saying corruption has been institutionalised by the TMC.“The government is submerged in corruption. We saw looting in the name of distribution of free ration during the lockdown. The same goes for compensation for repairing houses. Banerjee is in no position to talk about fighting corruption. If the CPI(M) was so corrupt then how come the inquiry commissions she ordered after coming to power couldn’t find anything,” said Sujan Chakraborty, CPI(M) legislator from Jadavpur and leader of the Left parties in the Assembly.The BJP was quick to jump into the fray and accused the chief minister of lying over the issue. “Relief for Amphan-affected people was looted in Bengal. Free ration sent by the Centre never reached the people. The chief minister is lying,” said BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha.The BJP has turned the alleged relief corruption into a raging issue prior to the 2021 assembly polls. The party’s state president Dilip Ghosh on Sunday launched a website where people who have been deprived can lodge complaints. Countering it, the TMC accused the BJP of indulging in the same nepotism in several parts in North 24 Parganas district.The TMC on Sunday issued show-cause notice to more than 200 panchayat-level workers and leaders in the Nandigram area of East Midnapore district and suspended 25 of them. More than 50 of these people have returned the compensation. Similar actions are being taken by the party in other districts but the opposition has called it an eyewash.“If the chief minister is so brave why isn’t she filing FIRs against those involved in this corruption. Let police complaints be lodged against our party workers too if they are involved,” said the BJP state president.Ghosh alleged that the suspensions are an eyewash and the people will be taken back into the party fold after some time.The CPI (M) questioned why the state government was not acting against those involved in corruption.“Why is the party and not the administration taking action? This is public money,” said CPI(M) politburo member Md Salim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-is-10-here-bengal-cm-on-corruption-complaints-over-amphan-relief/story-g3TzKN7Htngnx6zM8Vnp5M.html

However, he received a rude shock when the corpse lying in a body bag beside the freshly dug grave turned out to be someone else’s.Khan later found out that his deceased sister was cremated by the family of Kusumlata, another Covid-19 victim whose body had been accidentally swapped with Anjum’s by staff at the AIIMS here where both women had been admitted and subsequently died.A doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said there has been a lapse on the part of the staff as they did not carry out the proper process of establishing the identity before handing over the bodies to the families. “On the basis of the initial report, administrative action has been taken against two staff members from the mortuary. One has been terminated while another was suspended. Further, a committee has been set up for carrying out a detailed probe into the incident,” a senior doctor at AIIMS said.Khan said his sister, a resident of Bareilly, was suffering from jaundice and he brought her to the AIIMS on July 4. Anjum was admitted at the emergency ward of the hospital and within two hours, the doctors declared her Covid-19 positive. They admitted her to the Covid-19 ward at the Trauma Centre, he said. Anjum’s husband had died seven months ago. She is survived by her three children. “Late on Monday night, I received a call that my sister had died. The next day, at around 8 am, we reached the hospital and asked the doctors if we could take the body back to Bareilly, but they refused. They gave us four PPE kits and asked to go to ITO graveyard to book a place,” Khan said. Accordingly, the body was taken to the cemetery at ITO, a dedicated graveyard for burying those who die due to Covid-19. Before the body was lowered in the grave, he opened the body bag to see his sister’s face one last time. “When I saw the face, I realised it was not my sister. It was one Kusumlata from Ghaziabad. Her name was mentioned on the body,” he said. The AIIMS staff was also present during the burial. When Khan told them that the body was not his sister’s, the hospital staff left with Kusumlata’s body and said they would be back. “We kept waiting at the graveyard till 4 p.m., but nobody turned up. We called them several times, but they kept giving us excuses. Finally, we reached the Trauma Centre and called police,” Khan said. “The doctors informed us that the family members of Kusumlata had cremated my sister’s body at the Punjabi Bagh crematorium,” he said, adding that he had called his niece and nephew from Bareilly so that they could see their mother’s face one last time. Khan said he has lodged a complaint at Safdarjung Enclave police station regarding the incident.A senior police officer said, “We have received the complaint and are looking into the matter.” Despite repeated attempts, Kusumlata’s family could not be reached. A senior doctor at the AIIMS said the hospital has ordered an enquiry into the matter. One staff member has been terminated from service while another has been suspended. “Both the bodies along with two other bodies were transported together for cremation and burial. There has been a lapse on the part of the staff as they did not carry out the proper process of establishing the identity before handing over the bodies,” the doctor added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-victim-cremated-by-another-s-family-as-2-bodies-swapped-at-aiims/story-2GL05Vzj2I8DIAeGCkICkL.html

How can he lob the ball into the Centre’s court saying airports come under the Union Government? Our investigation is on and we will bring out the truth,” said the minister in Delhi. “The Centre has definite information that it was not a one- off incident.”The Customs department had seized 30 kg gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates to the country’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. Swapna Suresh, who was working as the operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT Ministry, who is now alleged to be a key player in the racket had gone underground after the seizure. Later the CM had transferred his principal secretary M Sivasankar who was close to Suresh and declared that he was ready for any probe into the smuggling“Our investigation is on. We will also bring to light those who helped smugglers. We will get into the bottom of the racket. The main accused was given a plum posting when she was mired in another cheating case. Often she was treated more than a high-ranking diplomat and after her role came to light now the CM says he has no idea how she got the job,” said Muraleedharan.The junior minister in the MEA who also hails from Kerala has often clashed with chief minister Vijayan over a range of issues, most recently over the evacuation of expatriates from west Asian countries. When asked about a CBI probe, Muraleedharan said the request will have to come from either the state government or the court. He said the consignment came to the airport on Friday and it was opened on Sunday in the presence of consulate officials. He said it was wrong to call it a diplomatic baggage because it came in the name of a person, not an official consignment. He also said customs has sought the MEA permission to quiz some officials of the consulate and the government will decide after talking to competent authority in the UAE.Vijayan who has also come under fire from the opposition wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday seeking a coordinated investigation by central agencies into the case because of its serious implication of undermining the country’s economy.“It is requested that an effective and coordinated investigation into this incident by all central agencies concerned is the need of the hour. The scope of the probe should cover all aspects from the source to the end utilization ,” teh letter said.Meanwhile, amid a clamour by the opposition for Vijayan’s resignation, Kerala’s industry minister E P Jayarajan hurriedly called a press briefing and said there was a move to discredit the popularity of the CM and the state’s ongoing fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.“Kerala is on top of the world. Opposition parties are worried over the popularity of the state government. That is why they are raking up issues to target the government,” said Jayarajan. He said the CM has made it clear the state was ready for any probe. He said such incidents will not affect the all-out war against the virus and people will see through the designs of opposition parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-get-to-the-bottom-of-gold-smuggling-racket-says-junior-foreign-minister/story-XrVN7yUii9iBiskJf0LSNP.html

08-07-2020||India||Kerala adds 301 fresh Covid-19 cases, highest surge since outbreak began||With 301 fresh coronavirus patients, the Covid-19 curve peaked in Kerala on Wednesday and the situation turned serious in some areas of state capital Thiruvananthapuram and port city Kochi. In the coastal hamlet of Poonthura on the outskirts of the capital, 119 people were found positive after 600 people were tested for the disease. After the situation turned really grim, police commandos were deployed in the area to ensure a complete lockdown. Though the latest incident gave ample indication of community spread, health officials put up a brave front saying the situation was under control. With 301 new cases, the Covid-19 tally went up to 6,195—out of this 2,605 are under treatment and 3,561 patients have recovered. The state has reported 29 deaths so far. Out of the 301 new cases, 99 are expatriates, 95 came from other states and 90 people contracted the virus from primary contacts, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office.After a big spurt in cases, the government had imposed a triple lockdown in Thiruvananthapuram to avert possible community spread. The situation turned serious in the state capital after the source of infection in many cases could not be traced. In the first week of May, the state was on the verge of flattening the coronavirus curve but positive cases increased after the return of expatriates and those stranded in other states. Despite criticism that it lags behind other states in tests, Kerala has got the least mortality and among the highest recovery rates in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-adds-301-fresh-covid-19-cases-highest-surge-since-outbreak-began/story-AXBaeqOfNGFRXQgR8aPyHM.html
08-07-2020||India||Here’s why high recovery rate is key to India’s Covid containment strategy despite big daily spikes||The Union government on Wednesday highlighted that India’s rate of recovery of Covid-19 patients continues to increase amid a recent trend of record rise in daily cases of fresh coronavirus infections. The recovery rate on Wednesday has touched 61.53% with a total of 4,56,830 patients having been cured of the disease leaving 2,64,944 active cases under medical supervision.22,752 fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported over the last 24 hours on Wednesday, taking the national virus caseload to 7,42,417, including 20,642 casualties recorded so far due to the disease. 482 of these coronavirus patients had died over the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry data released earlier today.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had on Tuesday pointed out that the success of government’s containment strategy was evidenced in the low mortality per million and low number of infections per million.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIndia’s mortality rate is 15 per million of its population compared to 405 deaths per million for the US, 315 per million for Brazil, 73 per million for Russia and 332 per million for Peru, among the five worst affected countries by coronavirus according to current data published on Worldometers.com.The health minister had credited country’s relative success on these parameters to “pro-active, pre-emptive and graded” approach, which he said had helped in slowing the growth of the disease and left a significant number of unoccupied beds in the Covid health infrastructure.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The government further elaborated on the strategy on Wednesday and said the territories in India with high case load were turning their focus on early identification and effective clinical management of positive cases to ensure that recovery/million is more than active cases/million.“This shows that while the total number of positive cases might be high, the recoveries are fast catching up, thereby keeping the active cases low. This has also ensured that Covid healthcare facilities are not under pressure and are not stretched. India has 315.8 recovered cases per million while the active cases per million in the country are at a low level of 186.3,” a government statement said on Wednesday.The government added that substantial increase in testing with the deployment of RT-PCR tests, Rapid Antigen Tests have helped in early identification of the cases along with deployment of several mobile apps to keep track of high risk population and the involvement of the community and health volunteers on the ground enabling effective surveillance.According to the ICMR, a cumulative total of 1,04,73,771 samples have been tested up to July 7 with 2,62,679 samples being tested on Tuesday. In measures taken to further reduce Covid mortality, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi, India’s premier medical hospital, has started a tele-consultation guidance facility for State doctors on clinical management of coronavirus patients.The initiative by the ministry of health has roped in specialist doctors from AIIMS to provide expert guidance and knowledge support to doctors manning ICUs in State hospitals through tele/video consultation.In the first session of this routine exercise to be conducted twice every week on Tuesdays and Fridays, ten hospitals have been selected, including nine from Mumbai (Maharashtra) and one from Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/here-s-why-high-recovery-rate-is-key-to-india-s-covid-containment-strategy-despite-big-daily-spikes/story-2dmNgA52v5WvBaugjKzJON.html
08-07-2020||India||Bombay HC warns action against negligent officials for shirking responsibility during pandemic||Mumbai: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has taken the negligent and errant government officials to task for shirking their duties amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and warned of initiating criminal proceedings against them in a bid to cleanse the administrative system. It also cautioned private hospital authorities and directed them to make adequate beds available for Covid-19 patients amid an imminent spike in the viral outbreak in Aurangabad.The court made the observation while hearing a suo motu (on its own motion) public interest litigation (PIL) on Tuesday.The court took a strong exception and cited that its July 3 order is being flouted by public servants, who are callous in discharging their duties amid the pandemic.A two-member division bench, comprising Justices TV Nalawade and SD Kulkarni, while hearing the report of advocate Rajendra Deshmukh, a senior counsel appointed as the amicus curiae, was informed that despite the court’s order in the June 3 hearing, many public servants are still playing truant for their Covid-19 duties.Earlier, the court had demanded the details of the action taken against errant officials by the Aurangabad administration. Public prosecutor DR Kale submitted the action taken report before the court on Tuesday.The PIL was filed after concerns were raised about the spike of Covid-19 positive cases and a lack of coordination between various authorities in the Aurangabad region.Kale submitted before the court that Aurangabad civic areas would enforce nine-day lockdown restrictions from Friday (July 10) and all necessary steps would be taken to contain the spread of the viral outbreak.The court observed that though show-cause notices were sent to private hospitals, their replies are still awaited.It warned that Covid-19 positive cases would spike during the lockdown restrictions because of aggressive contact tracing and more hospital beds would be required to treat the fresh cases.The court directed the Aurangabad administration to take criminal action against those private hospitals that are not complying with its orders to make beds available for Covid-19 patients.It also cautioned errant public servants and warned of criminal proceedings against those, who remain recalcitrant, in a bid to clean up the administrative machinery. The court will hear the PIL next on July 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-criminal-action-against-govt-officials-shirking-covid-19-duty-hc/story-YXlNfZDwiDm1m505YbF9fN.html
08-07-2020||India||Bombay HC reprieve for 62 textile units from Malegaon||Mumbai: The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday gave relief to 62 textile units in Malegaon and allowed them to operate while staying notices issued by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) authorities on May 18 to these factories that manufacture yarn for grey clothes.A two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Riyaz Chagla, also restrained the regional offices of MPCB from taking any coercive steps against the textile units such as disconnection of electricity, water, and other basic amenities.Earlier, MPCB authorities had issued the notices on the ground that the 62 units were located in the non-conforming zones. They set a pre-condition for these factories to operate.The factories’ owners were directed to submit adequacy reports either from Nagpur-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) or Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay and a no-objection certificate (NoC) from a city engineer of Malegaon municipal corporation with a recommendation to operate the industry at their present location.The unit owners moved the HC contending that the notices were illegal, arbitrary, and oppressive.Their counsel, advocate Manoj Harit, claimed that they had not violated any of the conditions and prayed before the court to grant them the consent to operate.Harit said the issuance of the show-cause notices and that, too, by giving only 15 days for reply amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak reflected a mechanical approach. “Getting reports from NEERI or IIT-Bombay within such a short span of time during this pandemic is impossible,” he argued while praying for a stay order before the court.Advocate RV Govilkar, who represented MPCB, opposed the prayer for a stay order.He submitted that the notices were issued in compliance with the principles of natural justice and it is for the petitioners to respond to the show-cause notices and satisfy the statutory authority about the fulfilment of conditions for grant of consent to operate.He submitted that the petition was premature, as no decision was taken by the authority pursuant to the May 18 notices.The bench found merit in the petitioners’ argument.It said MPCB authorities have the powers to direct closure or regulate the operation of an industry under section 33A of the Water Act and Section 31A of the Air Act, but these powers are subject to provisions of the respective Acts and the authority would have to follow other provisions of the Acts before invoking them.“It is not an unguided power to be exercised outside the scope of the provisions of the two Acts,” the court said.Besides, the judges noted that the Malegaon civic body authorities had not yet submitted its reply regarding verification of the industrial units within the non-conforming zone.“… a prima facie view can be taken that the impugned show-cause notices have been issued without jurisdiction and that, too, hastily,” said the bench while staying the MPCB notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-reprieve-for-62-textile-units-from-malegaon/story-mwEWQ6a2VMPTuBMH3oKbzM.html

Later, Nigam was acquitted in both the cases.”“After acquittal, Nigam shifted to Budhar in Shahdol 15 years ago and started business of selling cattle feed and coal,” said Shukla.Another police officer who did not want to be named said, “Gyanendra Nigam used to look after accounts and properties of Vikash Dubey.”Talking to local media persons before being taken to Kanpur by the UP STF Nigam said he had no connection with his sister Richa and brother-in-law Vikas.Nigam claimed that he had parted way with Vikas Dubey after the latter entered the world of crime. “I snapped all ties with him 15 years ago. I don’t know why UP STF has picked my son and myself,” said Nigam. After the incident in UP in which 8 policemen were killed, Madhya Pradesh police has been put on alert. Checking has been intensified in MP-UP border areas in Vindhya and Chambal regions, said Chanchal Shekhar, Inspector General of Police, Rewa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-stf-picks-up-gangster-vikas-dubey-s-brother-in-law-and-nephew-from-mp/story-5cronytEt0ukJcFVIU93YI.html
08-07-2020||India||‘Insidious hate’: Congress cites motive behind probe in Gandhi family linked trusts||The Congress has hit out at the Centre claiming the part and its leadership will “not be intimidated” by the “cowardly acts” and a blind “witch-hunt by a panicked” Modi government while responding to Centre’s decision to set up an inter-ministerial panel to probe funding of three entities linked to the Gandhi family, including the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. The party statement was an echo of Rahul Gandhi’s tweet, posted around the same time. “Mr Modi believes the world is like him. He thinks every one has a price or can be intimidated. He will never understand that those who fight for the truth have no price and cannot be intimidated,” the tweet read.Though Gandhi didn’t mention it, the timing of his tweet, which came within hours of the announcement of the probe, indicated he might be referring to the same development.The government had earlier in the day constituted a team to coordinate a probe into the alleged violation of various laws including the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) by three trusts associated with the Nehru-Gandhi family -- the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust and the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust.Home Ministry sets up panel to coordinate probe into 3 Gandhi family trustsThe RGF had come in sharp focus in the past few days owing to allegations by the ruling party that the foundation had received funds from the Chinese embassy in what it claimed could possibly be a quid-pro-quo for the Congress taking care of Beijing’s interests including in trade with India.The BJP had also claimed that the RGF, which is chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, had received public funds from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) during the UPA-1’s regime, between 2004 and 2009, apart from several other state owned entities.The Congress party reacted to the probe through a counter attack on the Central government alleging its decision was driven by an “insidious hate” of the Congress leadership and a need to distract from the alleged failures on the front of India’s security, territorial integrity, the handling of Covid 19 crisis and the economy.“The wild and insidious hatred of the BJP of Congress leadership unfolds every day in an embarrassing and uglier fashion. Facing a barrage of questions on (i) blatant compromise of India’s security interests and territorial integrity, (ii) a shocking mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis which continues to devour lives and livelihood on a daily basis and (iii) unable to arrest the economic recession wreaking havoc on the life of every Indian citizen; a desperate Modi-Shah Government has fallen back on a devious hounding of those exposing its ineptitude by ordering a wholly vicious and vengeful investigation of the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust and the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, “ said an official statement signed by AICC spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala.Earlier, senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi had accused the Centre of being biased against some institutions while protecting others associated with the BJP, like the RSS. The statement released by Surjewala said that the entities to be probed had always stood out for their humanitarian work and distinguished services. “The humanitarian work and distinguished service provided by these charitable organisations has always stood out and will withstand any vengeful and roving enquiry. Every day, a new conspiracy is crafted by the delusional BJP leadership so as to spread disinformation, distraction and diversion to bury the apparent incompetence and complete failure of the Modi Government,” the statement said. The probe under the PMLA is likely to deal with aspects related to money laundering while the investigation under the FCRA will likely look at acceptance and utilisation of foreign contributions.Congress also reiterated its allegations that the BJP leadership had deep-rooted connections with the Communist Party of China and that Chinese firms had made large donations to the PM CARES fund, set up recently to accept donations to fight unforeseen crises like the Coronavirus pandemic.“Will the Modi Government hold an enquiry into the donations worth hundreds of crores received from Chinese entities into the PM-Cares fund?” the Congress asked.The party also wanted to know if the Narendra Modi led government was willing to probe funding of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Vivekananda Foundation, The India Foundation and the Overseas Friends of BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insidious-hate-congress-cites-motive-behind-probe-in-gandhi-family-linked-trusts/story-KpR0XBr2sfpTkjaK6KOkyK.html
08-07-2020||India||Andhra launches mobile Covid-19 sample collection centres, Aadhaar must||As part of stepping up testing for Covid-19 in the wake of fast spreading of the virus, the Andhra Pradesh government has introduced mobile sample collection centres to collect the samples of people suffering from symptoms of the disease.State nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Arja Sreekanth said the state medical and health department has acquired 20 mobile sample collection centres, which would be increased by another 50 shortly to meet the growing demand for testing as the situation gets grimmer with the rising number of Covid-19 cases.He said each mobile centre would have 10 counters, so that samples of 10 persons could be collected at a time. Those undergoing tests would have to furnish all their particulars, including mobile numbers, Aadhar numbers, addresses and their present health conditions.“The sample collection will be done within 10 minutes and sent to the laboratories for testing. The test results would be sent to the people on their respective mobiles in the shortest possible time,” Sreekanth said.Once the details of the person who gives his sample are uploaded in the system, they would be forwarded to the local Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM), a health department worker, who would not only keep a surveillance on the movement of the person but also monitor his health status from time to time.The mobile sample collection vans would be sent to various places like bus stands, railway stations, airports and inter-state borders so that samples from people coming from other states and countries would be collected.“This will also help the authorities do contact tracing and prevent community spread of the virus,” the nodal officer said.What is more, these mobile vans would be sent to all the containment zones to collect samples from people in the area.“They don’t have to go to the laboratories for testing, since the sample collection is done within their colony,” he said.Once the test results were declared, the health department authorities would monitor the people who test positive.“Depending on the intensity of the disease and the co-morbid conditions, the authorities would decide on whether such patients should be sent to the hospital or the government quarantine centres or allow them to be home quarantined. If they want to be self-quarantined, the local ANM would regularly monitor their health status,” Sreekanth said.Andhra Pradesh was among the top three states in the country in conducting the highest number of tests per million population.As of Wednesday, the state has tested 10,77,733 samples, at the rate of 20,182 tests per million population.In all, the state reported 22,259 positive cases for Covid-19 with a positivity rate of 2.07 per cent and 263 deaths with a mortality rate of 1.19 per cent. The national average for testing is 7551 per million, while the average positivity rate is 7.09 per cent and mortality rate is 2.78 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-launches-mobile-covid-19-sample-collection-centres-aadhaar-must/story-mIkKbJyqrySRsOKROO6RFN.html

The chief minister said the zones had been marked indiscriminately and scrapped the list. Lockdown will be announced in these containment zones from 5 pm on Thursday.South 24 Parganas is located right next to Kolkata and many parts of the district are considered almost a part of the capital city. “What is this? They seem to have added one community ward after another without doing any survey. Who has done this? This will not do. Prepare a fresh list,” Banerjee said at a press conference at Nabanna, the state secretariat. The press conference was aired live on several television channels and Facebook.Though Banerjee is known for pulling up officials in public, this is the first time she expressed her dissatisfaction with a Covid-19 related decision taken by the police and bureaucrats. Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha who was present at the news briefing was asked by Banerjee to redraw the list. “I did not say anything about containment zones in Kolkata. But in South 24 Parganas it seems they did nothing but copy the addresses from the voters’ list. You go through the list right now.

Sumit’s mother told police that she had a doubt on Man Singh, who lives in her neighbourhood in Lahar. When police arrested Man Singh, he confessed to have committed the crime.”“Man Singh said he proposed to Sumit’s mother last week but she not only refused but also insulted him. To take revenge on the woman, Man Singh abducted Sumit and strangulated him to death. Man Singh threw the body in a well,” said Bais.The police were later able to recover the child’s body from the well.The accused was produced before the court on Wednesday and sent to police custody on remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalker-kills-woman-s-8-year-old-child-dumps-body-in-well-arrested/story-kngu6DWYetOUKNt4Fwb6jL.html
08-07-2020||India||Fake babas giving bad name to genuine spiritual leaders: Supreme Court||Fake babas and their illegal activities are giving a bad name to genuine spiritual leaders, the Supreme Court (SC) observed on Wednesday while directing the Central government to suggest measures to tackle these bogus personalities, who are fooling their gullible disciples and the public at large.An SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde, was hearing a plea seeking action against various ashrams run by fake spiritual gurus, who have allegedly confined inmates, particularly women, in unhygienic living conditions, amid fears of the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.“There is a lot of money involved and criminal activities are happening. See what can be done? This kind of practice gives a bad name to everyone,” CJI Bobde told solicitor-general (S-G), Tushar Mehta, the Central government’s second senior-most law officer.The petitioner, Dumpala Ramreddy, was asked by the apex court to provide S-G Mehta with a copy of the petition in a bid to help him suggest solutions to deal with the growing menace.Reddy had approached the top court in April, alleging that his daughter is confined to Adhyatmika Vidyalaya Ashram at Rohini in Delhi founded by Veerendra Dev Dixit, who is currently on the run after being accused of rape.Reddy submitted that both the Central and state governments were not taking any action against fake babas and were allowing such illegal ashrams to mushroom and on most occasions from unauthorised premises.“Considering the urgent prevailing situation due to spreading of Covid-19 in the country, particularly in places where social distancing is not maintained … the petitioner prays for the intervention of this court for the rescue of the women/persons in the ashrams,” the plea stated.The petitioner also sought guidelines to be laid down to govern establishments and the functioning of such ashrams and to close down those run by history sheeters.He also cited a list released by the apex body of sages, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, declaring 17 babas, including Dixit, Asaram Bapu, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, and Radhe Maa as fake spiritual personalities and cautioning the public against them.Reddy contended that 17 such ashrams are still operational and thousands of gullible disciples are staying in them.“If this man (Reddy) says Akhada has declared that there are 17 ashrams that are fake, it raises serious questions,” the bench remarked.Reddy sought the evacuation of inmates from the ashrams at the earliest because of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.“The authorities are not verifying the facilities available in the ashrams and they are in poor condition.

08-07-2020||India||SC committee asks Assam to submit report on illegal construction in Kaziranga animal corridor||A Supreme Court-constituted central empowered committee (CEC) has directed the chief wildlife warden of Assam to submit a report on alleged illegal construction in an animal corridor close to the Kaziranga National Park (KNP) and the tiger reserve in violation of the apex court’s order.The letter issued on Tuesday by Amarnatha Shetty, the member-secretary of CEC, to MK Yadava, chief wildlife warden, Assam, was in response to a complaint filed in June by environmental activist Rohit Choudhury against the construction in Kanchanjuri animal corridor of KNP, which is renowned for one-horned rhinos.“It is requested that a factual report on the complaint made, specifically on the alleged violation of the SC order dated April 12, 2019, may please be sent to the CEC at the earliest,” Shetty’s letter read.In its order, the SC had banned all mining-related activities along the KNP area and a catchment area of rivers/streams/rivulets originating in the tribal-dominated Karbi Anglong hills and flowing into the national park and the tiger reserve.“No new construction shall be permitted on private lands, which form part of the nine identified animal corridors,” the SC order had stipulated.The complaint by Choudhury alleged “blatant violations” of the apex court’s ruling in connivance with the Assam government, resulting in contempt of court and orders should be issued to demolish the construction and connectivity of the animal corridor restored at the earliest.“A powerful and influential person is involved in undertaking the construction of a huge building with an approach road within the critical Kanchanjuri animal corridor, one of the nine identified corridors of KNP and tiger reserve,” the complaint read.“These nine corridors are a lifeline for the wildlife of Kaziranga, particularly the long-ranging species such as Indian Elephant, tiger among other forms of wildlife,” it added.Choudhury alleged that since the ongoing construction can be easily seen from the national highway running close to KNP, the illegal activity is going on in connivance with the area’s forest, civil and police administrations.The complainant mentioned that though the matter was brought to the notice of the state’s chief secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna in June, no action was taken to stop the illegal construction.“If the destruction of notified animal corridors continues in this manner then it is a matter of time that all the corridors will be destroyed and blocked and Kaziranga tiger reserve and its wildlife will be completely isolated from Karbi Anglong hills, which are a lifeline to the beleaguered animals during the annual floods,” it said.Choudhury urged the CEC to intervene and recommend contempt of court proceedings against all violators of the SC ruling, including government officials.Yadava and other forest department officials didn’t respond to the CEC’s move, despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-committee-asks-assam-to-submit-report-on-illegal-construction-in-kaziranga-animal-corridor/story-C2cy3YizQRDgRgm8PYyq7N.html

With the help of the global data, the researchers developed a dynamic epidemiological model for projected coronavirus infections.ALSO READ | Scientists develop ‘catch and kill’ air filter, claim it can kill coronavirusAdding a note of caution, the researchers said that the projections for the spread of the disease are very sensitive to assumed testing of samples, behavioural, and policy responses, and they should be interpreted as indicators of potential risk and not a precise forecast of future cases in several countries.Aggressive testing by nations and reductions in contacts in response to risk perception will significantly reduce future Covid-19 cases while laxer response, negligence and normalisation of risks can lead to outbreaks which could overwhelm existing health infrastructure of countries..By making additional assumptions on future testing and responses, the researchers said the model can inform future trajectories of the disease.“We have explored a few projections out to spring 2021 that exclude vaccine and treatment availability,” the MIT researchers said.Projections under three scenarios were taken into account as part of the study: 1. Using the current country-specific testing rates and response functions moving forward.2. If enhanced testing -- of 0.1 per cent a day -- is adopted on July 1.3. If sensitivity of contact rate to perceived risk is set to 8, leaving testing at current levels.The first two scenarios project a very large burden of new coronavirus cases by the latter half of 2020, with hundreds of millions of cases concentrated in a few countries estimated to have insufficient responses given the high risks, primarily India, but also Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the United States.The United States currently leads the world with the highest concentration of Covid-19 cases and a record number of deaths. India, however, is not too far behind, occupying the third spot, preceded only by Brazil. Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, India on Tuesday said the total number of coronavirus infections and fatalities per million population in the country are among the lowest in the world.ALSO READ | India’s Covid-19 tally again jumps by over 22,000 cases, close to 7.5 lakh“Our model simulates the progression and spread of Covid-19, including how people interact, how many get sick, how many get tested, how many are hospitalized, how many die -- and how people change their behaviour in response to the risk they perceive,” Rahmandad, one of the researchers said.“We then use a wide range of data to estimate the parameters of the model -- say, what fraction of infections are asymptomatic, and how contagious the virus is -- to give the best match to the real world data,” they said.On the flip side, the magnitude of the Covid-19 pandemic is widely underreported, the researchers have warned.They estimated that Covid-19 cases and deaths as of June 18 are, respectively, 11.8 and 1.48 times higher than official reports across the 84 nations considered for the study.The authors also cautioned that despite the increasing numbers no country is remotely close to establishing herd immunity to combat the virus.“Actual coronavirus cases are far greater than official reports suggest, the majority of people remain susceptible. Waiting for herd immunity is not a viable path out of the current pandemic,” Rahmandad said. On Wednesday, India reported a spike of 22,752 Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the country’s coronavirus tally to 7,42,417, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-see-2-87-lakh-covid-19-cases-per-day-by-winter-of-2021-mit-study/story-2AMY2H1kSOragvPqJNiueK.html

A special court in Mumbai had on June 8 authorised the ED to confiscate the assets. Nirav Modi was declared a fugitive economic offenders by the same court on December 5 last year.  “The ED has attached the properties worth Rs. 329.66 crore under the FEO Act, 2018 which now stands confiscated to central government,” it said. The agency till now has attached assets worth Rs 2,348 crore of Nirav Modi under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

In that event, there was a gathering of more than 100 people and the chief minister had participated in the programme without a mask, which made people worry about his health condition in the present Covid-19 pandemic, Mallanna said.He reminded that even at the previous event of Haritha Haram (the tree plantation programme) on June 25 in which more than 100 people took part, KCR had participated without wearing a face mask.“This has caused a lot of concern, as the number of Covid-19 cases has been increasing exponentially. Adding to this, the news reports that more than 30 persons at Pragati Bhavan (KCR’s official bungalow) have contracted the virus, have aggravated our concern,” he said.Stating that as a citizen of the state he was worried about the health condition of KCR, Mallanna said the state administration had miserably failed to provide information to the people about the health status and the whereabouts of the chief minister. He appealed to the high court to issue an appropriate writ or direction to the government to disclose the details about the chief minister.Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee working president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy on Wednesday tweeted that the state government should issue a health bulletin to allay the apprehensions of the people about the chief minister.Reddy said there was an administrative crisis as the head of the state himself was missing in action amid a raging pandemic. “The chief minister has been confined to his farmhouse for the last 10 days and there are apprehensions about his health in the wake of growing intensity of Covid-19. It is a crime to keep his health condition a secret,” he said.The PCC working president said there was none to take care of the state in the absence of the chief minister. “If KCR is not in a position to administer the state, he should entrust his responsibilities to any other leader – it could be his son K T Rama Rao or senior ministers T Harish Rao or Eatala Rajender,” he suggested.Reddy demanded that Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan should intervene in the administration and review its functioning.The ruling TRS leaders have not yet responded to the Congress leader’s demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-cm-not-seen-for-10-days-plea-in-high-court-about-his-health/story-ghqidlMDBM6zDW0LrSlY3H.html

Ganjam reported three deaths, and one each was recorded from Kendrapara, Khurda and Rayagada districts, as the overall toll rose to 48 in the state.In Ganjam district, which has reported over 2,800 Covid-19 positive cases so far, a man (56), a senior citizen (64), and a woman (50) died of the viral outbreak. Both the senior citizen and the women had a comorbid condition such as diabetes.In Rayagada district, a Covid-19 patient (50) suffering from the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), died. While in Kendrapara district, a diabetic Covid-19 patient (55) has died.In Bhubaneswar, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patient, who had tested Covid-19, however, succumbed to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), doctors said.So far, 13 such deaths – Covid-19 positive patients succumbing to comorbid conditions -- have been reported in Odisha.Of the 48 deaths recorded in the state, a 27-year-old youth from Ganjam district is the youngest to date. He worked as a science teacher, but volunteered as a frontline worker battling the pandemic at a quarantine centre in the district’s Kabisuryanagar block.He showed Covid-19 symptoms and was admitted to a Covid-19 care centre at Aska before he was shifted to SUM Hospital in Bhubaneswar, where he died on July 3, even before his test result was made available.However, the hospital authorities did not hand over his body to his family members since they suspected him of being infected by SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19.His parents couldn’t bear the tragic death of their son and died by suicide at his native village.While an 80-year-old man, who was suffering from COPD, is the oldest person in Odisha to die of Covid-19 so far.Most of the Covid-19 victims in the state are in the age group between 35 and 73 years.Dr. Rashmi Ranjan Satpathy, joint director of public health, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), Odisha, at least 1.4 million people in the state are at risk because of their comorbid conditions.“So far about 60 lakh people above the age of 30 have been screened for NCDs such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer of whom 10-15% of them have been found to be suffering from these diseases. Odisha’s 1.4 million population is in the high-risk category,” he said.In July, Odisha has been reporting a spike in both Covid-19 positive cases and deaths.Of the total 10,624 cases recorded so far, 31% of them have been reported in July alone.Similarly, of the 48 deaths, 45% have been recorded in July. Bhubaneswar, which recorded its single-day highest spike of 46 Covid-19 positive cases, has sealed its two Regional Transport Offices (RTO), an information technology (IT) major’s business process outsourcing (BPO) unit, a godown of a courier company and two branches of a private bank.Saptagiri Ulaka, the Congress member of Parliament (MP) from Koraput, said the bid to ban on the Ganjam-Khurda inter-district movement for 24 hours on Wednesday is a thoughtless knee-jerk reaction. “If the situation demands, the state government should declare complete shutdown of Odisha rather than changing rules every now and then, which is aggravating people’s problems,” the MP tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-records-highest-single-day-surge-of-covid-deaths/story-mqr3CCN81hx6xIFWYMPa7L.html

The hospital has said the goof-up was a result of case papers of the two patients getting mixed up,” the official said.In a statement, the family from Kopri said the hospital on July 3 had informed them that their 67-year-old relative had succumbed to the infection and the body was handed over to them in a sealed bag as per Covid-19 protocol, following which the last rites were performed.The family of the sexagenarian were shocked when they got a call from the newly inaugurated 1,000-bed hospital on Monday stating that their loved one was alive and was being treated in the ICU, the statement read.Their joy, however, was short-lived when their kin also died of the infection late on Tuesday night, a senior civic official said.Meanwhile, chief of the BJP’s Thane city unit and MLC Niranjan Davkhare came down heavily on the TMC administration for the lapses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-hospital-mix-up-causes-family-to-cremate-kin-twice/story-EvgOvqZ298lwcS4jPILhqI.html

08-07-2020||India||‘RGF has nothing to add or fear’: Congress responds to probe, alleges Centre protecting holy cows||The Congress party has alleged that the Centre’s decision to set up an inter-ministerial panel to coordinate a probe into three foundations linked to the Gandhi family was biased and that the government treated several entities such as the Vivekananda Foundation and the RSS as ‘holy cows’. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi added that the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation-- one of the three foundations to be probed for alleged financial misconduct—had “nothing to add” or “fear”.The Congress’ response on Wednesday afternoon was preceded in the day by the Union home ministry’s decision to set up an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate investigations into allegations of illegality against Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust and Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust. All three entities have been accused of violating money laundering act, Income Tax Act and foreign contribution act.“The Rajiv Gandhi Foundation has nothing to add, nothing to fear because you have all the ‘yantra and tantra’ at your disposal and you can ask every question in every inquiry and we are here to answer as law abiding persons,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said on Wednesday.Home Ministry sets up panel to coordinate probe into 3 Gandhi family trustsCongress president Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson of RGF, which is also co-managed by former Prime Minister and senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, his sister and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and senior party leader P Chidambaram—all trustees of RGF.Sonia Gandhi is also the chairperson of Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust while overseeing the work of Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust.RGF was recently in the line of fire by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while it traded barbs with the Congress on the issue of recent Chinese incursions in the Ladakh sector and face off with Indian Army that led to deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of casualties in the Chinese army.BJP president JP Nadda had alleged that the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) had donated money to the RGF in the past and accused Congress of diverting public money into a “family-run” foundation. He had also alleged that several state owned firms had donated money to RGF during the UPA rule between 2005-2006 and 2007-2008.The Congress had then questioned funding of several organizations it claimed were either linked to the BJP or patronized by the party. Singhvi reiterated that allegation on Wednesday while claiming that there were two laws in the country; one for the opposition and the other for those associated with the ruling party.“But you (the government) need to be exposed fully because you don’t even ask these questions of many holy cows. You are harassing each opposition segment individual and institutional. But your blue-eyed sanctified holy cows Vivekananda Foundation, India Foundation, Friends of BJP and the RSS don’t get to be asked such questions. Whose favourite blue eyed boys and girls are these? Whose special arc of protection they have? Please dare to ask them also and share those with the country,” Singhvi asked.The inquiry into the three funds mentioned above will be led by the special director of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and will also include officials of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rgf-has-nothing-to-add-or-fear-congress-responds-to-probe-alleges-centre-protecting-holy-cows/story-kWPvTkXwWKlwYhcHZZY5nJ.html
08-07-2020||India||India may see 2.87 lakh Covid-19 cases a day by winter 2021: MIT study||India may record about 2.87 lakh projected cases of the novel coronavirus per day by the end of winter 2021 in the absence of a Covid-19 vaccine or drug interventions, according to a modelling study by the researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Using data for 84 countries with reliable testing data -- spanning 4.75 billion people -- the researchers developed a dynamic epidemiological model. in a preprint paper, MIT professors Hazhir Rahmandad and John Sterman, and PhD candidate Tse Yang Lim, noted that the top ten countries by projected daily infection rates at the end of winter 2021 are India with 2.87 lakh infections per day, followed by the US, South Africa, Iran, Indonesia, the UK, Nigeria, Turkey, France, and Germany. However, they noted that the projections are highly sensitive to assumed testing, behavioural, and policy responses, and as such they should be interpreted as indicators of potential risk and not precise predictions of future cases. The researchers added that more rigorous testing and reductions in contacts in response to risk perception will significantly reduce future cases while laxer response and normalisation of risks can lead to overwhelming breakouts. By making additional assumptions on future testing and responses, the researchers said the model can inform future trajectories. “We explore a few projections out to spring 2021 that exclude vaccine and treatment availability,” said the researchers. The researchers considered projections under three scenarios: 1. Using the current country-specific testing rates and response functions moving forward, 2. If enhanced testing -- of 0.1 per cent a day -- is adopted on July 1, and 3. If sensitivity of contact rate to perceived risk is set to 8, leaving testing at current levels. The first two scenarios project a very large burden of new cases in the fall 2020, with hundreds of millions of cases concentrated in a few countries estimated to have insufficient responses given perceived risks, primarily India, but also Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the US. “Our model simulates the progression and spread of Covid-19, including how people interact, how many get sick, how many get tested, how many are hospitalized, how many die -- and how people change their behaviour in response to the risk they perceive,” Rahmandad said. “We then use a wide range of data to estimate the parameters of the model -- say, what fraction of infections are asymptomatic, and how contagious the virus is -- to give the best match to the real world data,” they said. The model revealed several important insights. Most fundamentally, the magnitude of the epidemic is widely underreported, the researchers said. They estimate that cases and deaths through June 18 are, respectively, 11.8 and 1.48 times higher than official reports across the 84 nations considered. Despite these elevated numbers, the authors note that no country is remotely close to establishing herd immunity, they said. “While actual cases are far greater than official reports suggest, the majority of people remain susceptible. Waiting for herd immunity is not a viable path out of the current pandemic,” Rahmandad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-may-see-2-87-lakh-covid-19-cases-a-day-by-winter-2021-mit-study/story-65pQSrzCWmcJA3V4svlmpN.html

The Congress had also asked why the government wasn’t probing organisations linked to the BJP and its leaders.Rahul Gandhi picked up from where his party had left it. Without referring to the government decision announced a few hours earlier, the Congress leader tweeted: “Mr Modi believes the world is like him. He thinks every one has a price or can be intimidated. He will never understand that those who fight for the truth have no price and cannot be intimidated.”Mr Modi believes the world is like him. He thinks every one has a price or can be intimidated. He will never understand that those who fight for the truth have no price and cannot be intimidated.The tweet by Gandhi comes shortly after Congress called Centre’s decision to set up an inter-ministerial panel to coordinate a probe into three foundations linked to the Gandhi family biased. The Union home ministry on Wednesday announced decision to set up an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate investigations into allegations of illegality against Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust and Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust. All three entities have been accused of violating money laundering act, Income Tax Act and foreign contribution act.While special director of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) will head the committee, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will also be part of the committee, a home ministry spokesperson said. The allegations against RGF were levelled by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda last month amid the ongoing war of words with the Opposition over the Ladakh face-off.The BJP chief had said that the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) donated money to RGF. He said “one family’s hunger for wealth” hurt the nation, and also accused the Congress of committing a “brazen fraud” by diverting public money into a “family-run foundation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mr-modi-thinks-rahul-gandhi-attacks-pm-says-those-who-fight-for-truth-have-no-price/story-W8kRCfoFotBRgGkogiqwHI.html

The building was shut down for sanitization towards the end of June.“I am directed to inform you that as soon as the central administrative building is sanitized, normal activities including the release of salary shall immediately be undertaken,” said the notice signed by Asha Mukherjee, acting registrar of Visva Bharati.The university issued the notice only after Sudipta Bhattacharyya; president of the Visva Bharati University Faculty Association lodged a RTI on July 5 over the delay in salary for the month of June.Two heads of two separate departments, however, said that the administrative building had to be shut down in June-end after two employees in the accounts department were detected with fever.“I don’t know whether they tested positive for Covid-19 but the building was shut down around June 29 as a precautionary measure. We were told that it would open after a few days, around two weeks from June 29 and after proper santisation,” said one of the assistant professors, on conditions of anonymity.The university authorities, however, remained tightlipped on the letter issued on July 7. While acting registrar Asha Mukherjee said she was not authorized to speak to the media and only the spokesperson would speak, the spokesperson of Visva Bharati didn’t respond to multiple calls and messages throughout the day.Usually employees receive their salaries and pension by the end of every month. There are more than 3,500 people who receive salaries and pension including employees, faculties, security personnel and pensioners among others“But this time we haven’t received our salary. We have not been told either as to when we will receive it. We were just told that we will get our salaries after the central administrative building reopens after proper sanitization,” said another assistant professor.In February, the university authorities had issued a notice that salary could be delayed due to paucity of funds. Later, the union human resource development (HRD) ministry sought an explanation from the management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-covid-19-scare-in-accounts-section-salary-delayed-for-staff-at-visva-bharati/story-IL9aXrAZMCoBVgRis9eI0L.html

08-07-2020||India||Cabinet approves rental housing scheme for migrants, govt to spend Rs 600 crore||An affordable rental housing scheme for migrants who went back to their home states during the lockdown has been approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday, officials aware of the development said.The Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) scheme under the ministry of housing and urban affairs will be a sub-scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) with an estimated expenditure of around Rs 600 crore. The scheme aims to cover nearly 3 lakh beneficiaries initially.“Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in massive reverse migration of workers and urban poor in the country who come from rural areas or small towns for seeking better employment opportunities in urban areas. Usually, these migrants live in slums, informal/unauthorized colonies or peri-urban areas to save rental charges. They spend a lot of time on roads by walking/ cycling to workplaces, risking their lives to cut on the expenses,” the official said.“A large part of workforce in manufacturing industries, service providers in hospitality, health, domestic/commercial establishments, and construction or other sectors, labourers, students etc who come from rural areas or small towns seeking better opportunities will be the target beneficiary under ARHCs,” the official added.The ARHC scheme will have a two-pronged approach; first, existing vacant government funded housing complexes will be converted into ARHCs through a concession agreement for 25 years.According to internal ministry data, there are 1.2 lakh such government houses available built under the erstwhile UPA- led scheme Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), NDA government led PMAY and housing schemes of the state governments. Of these Maharashtra has the maximum number of accommodations available at 35,000 and Delhi 30,000 houses.“Concessionaire will make the complexes livable by repair/retrofit and maintenance of rooms and filling up infrastructure gaps like water, sewer/ septage, sanitation, roads etc. States/UTs will select concessionaire through transparent bidding. Complexes will revert to Urban Local Bodies after 25 years to restart the next cycle earlier or to run on their own,” the official said.Secondly, special incentives like use permission, 50% additional Floor Area Ratio or Floor Space Index, concessional loan at priority sector lending rates, tax reliefs at par with affordable housing among others will be offered to private and public entities to develop ARHCs on their own available vacant land for 25 years.“ARHCs will create a new ecosystem in urban areas making housing available at affordable rent close to places of work and will cut down unnecessary travel, congestion and pollution,” the proposal for the scheme said, Hindustan Times has reviewed the note.“The investment under ARHCs is expected to create new job opportunities. Government funded vacant housing stock will be converted into ARHCs for economically productive use. The scheme would create a conducive environment for entities to develop AHRCs on their own vacant land which will enable new investment opportunities and promote entrepreneurship in rental housing sector,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-approves-rental-housing-scheme-for-migrants-govt-to-spend-rs-600-crore/story-Waf7MhRD7Lq8t74oNmcC6J.html

08-07-2020||India||‘Preparations for Bihar assembly elections on time’: CEO||The Election Commission is preparing to hold assembly elections in Bihar on schedule amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “In 2015, the election was announced on September 9. So, we still have time. It is July only,” said Bihar chief electoral officer (CEO) HR Srinivasan.Bihar is the only state that will go to polls this year in the midst of the pandemic. The state will also witness an election for eight Bihar Legislative Council seats for graduates and teachers’ constituencies. So far, no decision has been taken on them. The seats had fallen vacant in May.The CEO categorically said that all preparations are going on to hold the polls this year as per the schedule. “It is the Election Commission that has to take a call,” he added.Also read: Time not right for polls in Bihar, says Tejashwi YadavHe said that last month a meeting was held with all various political parties of the state on the mode of campaigning during the election amid the pandemic situation as it demands social distancing.“Whatever suggestions came during the meeting with the political parties have been conveyed to the EC,” he added.Chief election commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora had earlier said in an interview that all instructions and procedures regarding elections would be suitably modified to ensure smooth functioning during the pandemic and keeping the disaster management guidelines in mind.“There is no plan so far to defer Bihar elections,” he had said.The CEO had also said that the electronic voting machines (EVMs) and Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPATs) had reached all the districts and the training of returning officers (ROs) would get underway from Thursday.“The state-level training of master trainers concludes Wednesday. We are doing everything as per the schedule,” he added.On whether any request had been received for delaying or postponing elections, Srinivasan said it had come from some individuals but not from any political party. “We have forwarded the suggestions received from individuals to the EC,” he added.Though the Assembly election in Bihar is due in October-November this year, main political parties have already got their outreach programmes going through video conferencing and other available technological tools to reach out to the masses.Regarding the elections for the eight seats of the Bihar Legislative Council, Srinivasan said the state government’s request regarding it had been forwarded to the EC.Sources in the EC, however, said that holding elections in the state would be a big test for more reasons than one amid the pandemic. “Election is, after all, a mass contact programme and in a state like Bihar - with high population density and illiteracy - maintaining social distancing and avoiding personal contact programmes would be a big challenge. Therefore, the number of booths might be significantly increased and other measures will be adopted to reduce the chances of contact at polling booths,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/preparations-for-bihar-assembly-elections-on-time-ceo/story-UbuMh79XarDnjMNx7VO9WP.html

Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday that China had withdrawn up to 1.5 km from friction areas in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra, and the Indian Army also pulled back proportionately. A minor thinning of PLA soldiers has been noticed at the sensitive Finger Area near Pangong Tso.“I welcome the disengagement and pull back by Chinese troops. Will some one tell us the place from which the Chinese troops disengaged and the place in which they are now,” Chidambaram asked on Twitter.The early steps in disengagement came into effect soon after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councilor Wang Yi over video call on Sunday. Doval and Wang’s conversation is learnt to have focused on “full and enduring restoration of peace and tranquillity” along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).This was the first contact between the Special Representatives since the border stand-off between the two sides began in May.Launching a broadside, the Congress veteran asked what is the position of the two armies at the contested LAC and if any one of them has moved from one side of the LAC to the other. “Similarly which is the place from which Indian troops disengaged? Did any troops — Chinese or Indian — move from one side of the LAC to the other?” asked Chidambaram.In another follow up tweet, the leader indicated there is scant information available about the goings on in Ladakh forcing the Indian people to go on a “treasure hunt” to find out what happened on June 15. “Answers to these questions are necessary because the Indian people are on a Treasure Hunt to find out what happened on June 15 and where,” said Chidambaram. I welcome the disengagement and pull back by Chinese troops. Will some one tell us the place from which the Chinese troops disengaged and the place in which they are now.The PLA has withdrawn up to 2km from Patrolling Point 15 (Hot Springs) and a similar retreat is expected to be completed at PP-17 (Gogra) by Wednesday evening, with the Indian Army pulling back proportionately. This is based on an understanding reached last week by top Indian and Chinese military commanders on a phased de-escalation of the ongoing border conflict in Ladakh.The two armies, officials say, have already created a 4km buffer zone in Galwan Valley, the site of a deadly clash which left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead on June 15.The creation of buffer zones will temporarily restrict the patrolling activities of both armies in the region. Satellite images on Tuesday appeared to confirm the PLA pullback from Galwan Valley. “The images clearly indicate that the PLA has moved back in Galwan Valley. It’s a positive step but constant verification and strict vigil are a must,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations. Bhatia reviewed the images for HT.Before the PLA occupied vantage positions on Finger Four in early May, Indian Army soldiers would patrol right up to Finger Eight, which New Delhi considers to be its territory. The new Chinese positions have restricted the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers Four and Eight are 8km apart.The military buildup in Indian and Chinese depth areas, however, hasn’t thinned, with both sides keeping their guard up. The deployment of thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence weapons continues in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-on-treasure-hunt-to-find-what-happened-in-galwan-chidambaram/story-6yaPAv8uIJp44z4S4jwpYI.html
08-07-2020||India||Congress should learn from the Jan Sangh on how to be an Opposition: BJP general secy||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday slammed the Congress and its former president Rahul Gandhi, for doing “disservice” to the nation by asking questions “irresponsibly” on the border stand-off with China, instead of joining forces with the government.A day after the Congress demanded to know why status quo ante was not insisted upon and the lack of mention about the territorial sovereignty of eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley in the Union Ministry of External Affairs’ (MEA) statement; the BJP hit back at its rival.The saffron party said that the Congress should learn from it how to be a responsible opposition.“The opposition is only an example of how irresponsible it (Congress) is. They should learn from Bhartiya Jan Sangh and the BJP, who during the successive wars that the country had fought in 1948, 1962, 1965, and 1971 and how we had behaved as opposition and not the enemy of the government. We, in no way, gave direct or indirect strength to enemy countries. Today, when the [Narendra] Modi has given the world a model in leadership, instead of participating, they are doing a disservice to the nation,” said Murlidhar Rao, general secretary, BJP.The BJP and the Congress have been sparring over the government’s response to the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic as well as the stand-off with China along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.The Congress has been asking the government to be transparent on the territorial transgressions by China and the violent face-off between Indian and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops at Galwan Valley on June 15 that had left 20 Indian soldiers dead.The BJP has accused the Congress of lowering the morale of the soldiers by their comments.To a separate question on Gandhi’s comment about the state of the economy and how MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) are struggling in the aftermath of an economic slowdown, Rao said the government has been proactive in identifying the challenges and addressing those.On Wednesday, Gandhi had tweeted: “Small & medium enterprises stand destroyed. Large companies are under severe stress. Banks are in distress. I had stated months ago that an economic tsunami was coming and was ridiculed by the BJP and the media for warning the country about the truth.”Retorting to Wayanad Member of Parliament’s (MP) tweet, Rao said, “The blind cannot be shown the light... During and after the Covid-19 crisis, the government has been doing its bit. Congress leaders, especially Rahul Gandhi, should look into their history, and learn what was their (party’s) role during a crisis. He (Gandhi) is trying to present himself as a wise man, but people have refused to accept him. If we accept his arguments, we will also be rejected. By accepting him as a leader, the Congress is decimated.”Rao said because of the pandemic, supply chains have been disrupted and this has led to problems in every sector. “The PM is motivating people to become the market for the manufacturing sector. He (Gandhi) cannot understand the science and subtlety (of it)”.He also denied that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) probe into the financial dealings of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) is politically motivated. “RGF is in the public domain. It has various aspects related to FCRA, 2010, (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act), income-tax audit, etc. The Modi government believes in transparency, we are committed to it. So it’s natural to initiate a probe into it. No foundations are private, and the investigations are in the public interest. If it was political, would we have waited six years?” he asked.The MHA had set up an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate investigations into allegations against the foundation and the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust of violating the legal provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, the Income-Tax (I-T) Act, 1961, and the FCRA, 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-should-learn-from-the-jan-sangh-on-how-to-be-an-opposition-bjp-general-secy/story-SmEqwH5sDQvEavYkR0FmnO.html

So, being a movie buff, I love Hindi films and became an actor to live cinema for real,” he said. With films like ‘Uri,’ ‘Batla House,’ ‘Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year’ along with TV shows like ‘Powder’ and ‘Everest,’ Manish has been working across mediums but cinema remains his first love. “TV has reservations where as in films and OTT actors get to fly. A lot can be done with the stories on these two mediums whereas TV works on fix rules. Also, at the same time all three mediums have their set audience and reach. As an actor you have to be in full command on the character else our audience is too smart to understand that the actor lost the connect,” said Manish over the phone.Acting became passion for him when he went to study BA Honors in English at the Kirori Mal College, DU. Telling about his early days, he said, “My college in Delhi is the best place to be for any youngster as it gives clear vision of what you are and what you can become. While studying, I become part of College Theatre Society as I was also a member of Amateur Theatre Group in my school. Acting gave me an instant kick. I knew this is what I love doing and wanted to do if I got the right opportunities.” Manish left Delhi in 1995 and moved to Mumbai to pursue his dream of becoming an actor. In 2003, he debuted with film, ‘Rules: Pyaar Ka Superhit Formula.’ Talking about his journey of playing Jogi in his debut film to portraying Shekhawat in ‘Aarya’, he said, “It has been a rewarding journey and with each character I have lived cinema. My character was all alive in director Ram Madhavni’s head and this is what he made us believe too. We all were living our characters. Like, I was living Shekhawat all the time during the shoot —what he thinks, how he will react and that fear needs to come across whenever the character is on the screen. When I heard the story, I knew it was different yet it was in the league of what is happening around so that’s the reason why each character is so real.” Manish shot for one of his film in Lucknow of late, “The city is the land of yummy food and ghazals, I have shot many a times there. But when I shot for ‘Batla House’, I got a chance to experience the beauty of city closely and what a place it is, so rich in culture and archaeology that you are left all amazed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/in-films-and-ott-actors-get-to-fly/story-Sod6yzV2fUxGw34pNUEzRM.html
08-07-2020||India||New UK high commissioner Philip Barton presents credentials to president||Philip Barton, the UK’s new high commissioner to India, presented his credentials to President Ram Nath Kovind during a virtual ceremony on Wednesday.Barton’s arrival in India and the presentation of his credentials was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. He succeeded Dominic Asquith, who served as high commissioner from April 2016 to January this year.“The UK-India relationship is remarkable and we share an unparalleled breadth and depth of connection. There is a deep commitment across the British government, industry and civil society to grow that relationship even further,” Barton said in a statement.He identified several focus areas – developing the trade and economic partnership following the UK’s exit from the European Union, tackling the global challenges of climate change and green recovery, acting together as a force for good in the world, and working closely to keep both countries safe and secure.Barton, who also served as the UK’s high commissioner to Pakistan during 2014-16 and as acting chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee during 2016-17, acknowledged he had arrived in India at an “extraordinarily difficult time”.“Coronavirus is without precedent in modern times, but it has also brought out the importance of the modern partnership between the UK and India: from our excellent collaboration in developing and manufacturing a vaccine for global distribution, to securing essential medical supplies for health workers, to our joint determination to ‘build back better’ from this crisis,” he said.Barton also pointed to his family’s roots in India. “We often speak of the ‘living bridge’ of people, ideas and institutions that tie the UK and India together. I, too, am part of that bridge. My mother was born in Shimla and I was posted here in Delhi in the 1990s. I met my wife, Amanda, when we both lived and worked here and we named our daughter ‘India’ – not knowing I would return one day as high commissioner,” he said.Barton joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1986 and has previously served as the Director General (consular and security) in London and as deputy ambassador in Washington. Before arriving in New Delhi last month, he helped the UK government adapt its long-term planning to the Covid-19 pandemic.Jan Thompson, who served as acting high commissioner from February to June, has returned to her role as deputy high commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-uk-high-commissioner-philip-barton-presents-credentials-to-president/story-YNGyCUM0lR30sY6OsEt03O.html

It will also contribute to strengthen the broader partnership between the two countries.SAGE will contribute towards achieving the goals of the US government’s Asia Enhancing Growth and Development through Energy (Asia EDGE) initiative, a primary pillar of the US administration’s Indo-Pacific vision in South Asia, and the US-India Strategic Energy Partnership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/usaid-mnre-announce-new-partnership-to-expand-clean-energy-development/story-iaCs3VMrG80nc7B0o17kHK.html

It’s a dig at Centre||No migrant labour left West Bengal because the state government cares for its people, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said during an event on Wednesday. “Show me any state that gives 100% free ration for a year,” she said. The chief minister took a dig at the ruling party at the Centre and said that it didn’t come to any aid when its South Kolkata president and his mother tested positive for coronavirus recently. “The BJP office didn’t help even when he asked. I took the initiative and got them admitted to the hospital,” the chief minister said.  No migrant labour left West Bengal. Why? Because we care for people.

Swasthya Sathi is giving 100 percent help to people,” she said. On Saturday, Banerjee tweeted saying the state government has implemented a robust economic strategy to tackle the Covid-19 crisis and the devastation caused by super cyclone Amphan. “Proof lies in West Bengal’s unemployment rate for the month of June 2020 which stands at 6.5%, far better than that of India at 11%, UP at 9.6% & Haryana at 33.6%, as per CMIE,” her tweet read.

Another JMM lawmaker also tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday evening and is undergoing treatment in Dhanbad.With the discovery of two cases in lawmakers, the threat of pandemic looms large in the minds of many others including MLAs and senior state government officials who came in contact with these two lawmakers. Of late, the duo had, reportedly, also met chief minister Soren.Also read: Karnataka, Telangana could be country’s new Covid-19 hotspots“Samples of the minister and his wife were tested on Truenat machine at Ranchi’s Sadar Hospital.

08-07-2020||India||PM Oli doesn’t budge an inch in Nepal standoff, party stares at a possible split||A meeting of the Nepal Communist Party’s standing committee scheduled to meet on Wednesday was deferred at the last minute, dimming hopes that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his rival faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal might be able to reconcile their differences soon. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, a former prime minister better known by his nom de guerre Prachanda, wants PM Oli to step down, insisting that his continuation is detrimental to Nepal’s interests.PM Oli and Prachanda, who are co-chairs of the communist party, met on Tuesday afternoon to find some meeting ground. PM Oli, who has dug in his heels, refused to give up either his party post or the PM office.The only forward movement at the end of the two-hour-long meeting was that the two leaders agreed to go ahead with the standing committee meeting on Wednesday. This was interpreted to imply that PM Oli was ready to face the 44-member standing committee, possibly with a resolution. Nearly 30 of them want him to go.People familiar with the developments, however, told Hindustan Times that PM Oli is determined to hold on to power and has warned that if he is pushed to the wall, he could split the Nepal Communist Party formed in 2018 by unifying Nepal’s two leftist parties, Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre).That is one eventuality China, which has backed PM Oli, wants to avoid. Over the last week or so, Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi has held one-on-one meetings with NCP leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal - two former prime ministers who are backing Prachanda - apart from President Bidhya Devi Bhandari to figure a way out to keep PM Oli in the saddle, and the party united.The meetings have sparked a huge row in Nepal seen as interference by China in its internal affairs. The Chinese embassy was upfront about its interest in the political standoff in Nepal. This week, the embassy confirmed envoy Hou Yanqi’s meetings with political leaders and said China wanted the Nepal Communist Party leaders to resolve their differences and stay united.The buzz in Nepal’s political circles is that Beijing might not be averse to letting PM Oli go if it does not end up splitting the country’s communist party.But the wily Oli, a Kathmandu watcher said, is determined to brazen it out. Oli, who started his second term as prime minister in February 2018, has managed to stay in power for over 850 days, a record of sorts in a country that has been politically unstable for years. The last prime minister to have had a longer tenure was 25 years ago; Girija Prasad Koirala of the Nepali Congress who was PM from May 1991 to November 1994.NCP leaders who back PM Oli despite the criticism about his governance record, said his rivals were making too much of the standing committee meetings. Any adverse resolution of the standing committee would have to be vetted by the 400-member central committee of the party. “But PM Oli (who is the co-chairman) would need to sign off on the resolution. If he doesn’t, it doesn’t really matter what the numbers in the standing committee are,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-oli-doesn-t-budge-an-inch-in-nepal-standoff-party-stares-at-a-possible-split/story-mtqLZqAci4a2I807PGmhaO.html
08-07-2020||India||Bounty on criminal wanted in killing of 8 cops in UP raised to Rs 5 lakh||The bounty on notorious criminal Vikas Dubey, who has been missing since Friday after allegedly killing eight policemen in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur, has been increased to Rs 5 lakh. It is the fourth time the reward has been increased for giving information about Dubey in the past six days.At first, IG Kanpur Mohit Agarwal announced a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head, which was gradually increased to Rs 1 lakh by ADG Kanpur Zone JN Singh on Sunday and Rs 2.5 lakh by UP DGP HC Awasthy on Tuesday. The UP home department further recommended increasing the reward to Rs 5 lakh.The Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) on Wednesday killed an aide of Dubey in Hamirpur and arrested another following an encounter in Kanpur for their alleged role in last week’s Bikru ambush that led to killing of eight policemen, who had gone to arrest the gangster. “Amar Dubey, who carried a reward of Rs 25,000, was killed in an encounter in Maudaha village in Hamirpur district,” STF IG Amitabh Yash told PTI.In a separate encounter, hours after Amar Dubey was gunned down, Shyamu Bajpai, another associate of Vikas Dubey, was arrested in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur.According to sources, Amar Dubey was involved in the security of Vikas Dubey and travelled with him wherever he went while Bajpai too was close to the gangster.About the delay in the arrest of Vikas Dubey, the IG said, “He is a hardened criminal and was used to hiding so it is taking time but we will surely nab him. We have started getting success.” Vikas Dubey’s close relative Shama, neighbour Suresh Verma and domestic help Rekha and her husband Dayashankar Agnihotri, a key member of Dubey’s gang, were arrested by police.On Tuesday, all 68 personnel of the Chaubeypur Police Station were shunted to the reserve police lines amid doubts over their professional integrity. The announcement was made soon after police transferred Anand Deo, DIG STF, who till recently was the Senior Superintendent of Police in Kanpur. Deo was the Kanpur SSP in March when Deputy Superintendent of Police Devendra Mishra purportedly wrote a damning letter, which surfaced on the social media after he was killed in the Bikru ambush.The unverified letter to the then Kanpur SSP alleged that Chaubeypur station officer Vinay Tiwari had watered down an FIR lodged against the gangster. It suggested that Tiwari and Dubey were close. However, police said there is no record of the purported letter, which is undated and carries no serial number. Deo also said that the signature on it does not match that of the slain officer. But police said they will still investigate the letter.

08-07-2020||India||Home Ministry sets up panel to coordinate probe into 3 Gandhi family trusts||The Union home ministry has set up an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate investigations into allegations against Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust and Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust of violating the legal provisions of money laundering act, Income Tax Act and foreign contribution act.Confirming it, a home ministry spokesperson said that Special Director of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) will head the committee. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will also be part of the committee.While former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and P Chidambaram are trustees of RGF, which was set up in June 1991. Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson of RGF and Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust. She has also been overseeing the work of Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust.The allegations against RGF were levelled by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda last month amid the ongoing war of words with the Opposition over the Ladakh face-off. In a series of tweets, Nadda said that the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) donated money to RGF. He said “one family’s hunger for wealth” hurt the nation, and also accused the Congress of committing a “brazen fraud” by diverting public money into a “family-run foundation”.Nadda also posted images of lists of donors to RGF for the years 2007-2008 and 2005-2006 to back his claim. The list included several state-owned companies, including the State Bank of India and GAIL, and ministries including the ministry of home affairs and the ministry of health.“PMNRF, meant to help people in distress, was donating money to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation in UPA years. Who sat on the PMNRF board? Smt. Sonia Gandhi. Who chairs RGF? Smt. Sonia Gandhi. Totally reprehensible, disregarding ethics, processes and not bothering about transparency,” Nadda tweeted.Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had alleged that RGF pushed for a free trade agreement between India and China, leading to a huge trade deficit skewed in favour of Beijing.In its response, the Congress said the BJP was engaging in diversionary tactics, questioned it on visits and exchanges between the BJP and the Communist Party of China (CPC) over the past decade, and alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared a “strange bonhomie” with China even as the borders were insecure.PMNRF was set up in 1948 by India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, entirely with public contributions. It does not get any budgetary support. PMNRF resources are utilised primarily to give relief to families of those killed in natural calamities, and to victims of major accidents and riots, according to its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-ministry-sets-up-panel-to-coordinate-probe-into-3-gandhi-family-trusts/story-KpJkxlJqXIUUhLVwzvq2oN.html
08-07-2020||India||Ban on dog meat by Nagaland govt sparks debate||Following the Nagaland government’s order to ban the trading of dogs and also the sale of both ‘cooked and uncooked’ dog-meat, a debate has emerged as to whether the order passed by the state government is democratic or not.While regarded as a welcome move, battle-lines were also drawn as the state government’s decision also received criticism in equal measure, largely on the grounds of infringement on people’s dietary practices.While pet lovers welcomed the decision saying that the Nagas can survive without dog meat, others viewed it as “nonsensical” which would only drive the dog-meat trade underground like “the failed Nagaland Liquor Prohibition Act”.With dog meat being culture-specific for many Naga tribes, a Naga scholar who preferred to remain unnamed held the ban as a violation of one’s traditional rights.On the other hand, some felt that the decision has been taken in a hasty manner by the government without wider consultation.“There should have been a discussion by the state government because living in a democratic country like India, people should have had the opportunity to debate and discuss why there is a need to ban,” Gugu Haralu, a peace activist while speaking to ANI.“I am a pet lover and so I don’t take dog meat. However, the government should have wider consultation in a democratic way. But they hastily took the decision,” she added.Many people also raised concerns on social media saying, “Cruelty to animals is bad. There have to be ethical norms in place but outsiders policing and coercing the diet of native and indigenous people is problematic.”While banning of commercial imports is acceptable, a netizen viewed that the ban on the sale of dog meat is an exploitation of the indigenous dietary habit. “This is a sensitive issue. But as for me, I can’t just think of killing dogs which are like our family members for meat. It is too painful to think of it for me,” Yaimi Jagoi said.The Nagaland government took the decision on July 3 to decree bans the commercial import-trading of dogs and also the sale of both ‘cooked and uncooked’ dog-meat in a state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-dog-meat-by-nagaland-govt-sparks-debate/story-ehCro581dAN4vW9CX0wVkK.html

He has posted the same message in Portuguese, the official language of Brazil. My friend President @jairbolsonaro, my prayers and best wishes for your speedy recovery.Bolsonaro said he tested positive for the new coronavirus on Tuesday after months of downplaying its severity while deaths mounted rapidly inside the country.The Brazilian President said he is confident that he will swiftly recover from the new coronavirus thanks to treatment with hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug that has not been proven effective against Covid-19.Bolsonaro told reporters that he underwent a lung X-ray on Monday after experiencing fever, muscle aches and malaise. As of Tuesday, his fever had subsided, he said, and he attributed the improvement to hydroxychloroquine.In April, he had thanked PM Modi for easing restrictions on export of hydroxychloroquine. Bolsonaro compared the move to Lord Hanuman and Sanjeevani booti (herb) in the epic Ramayana.“Just as Lord Hanuman brought the holy medicine from the Himalayas to save the life of Lord Rama’s brother Laksmana, and Jesus healed those who were sick and restored the sight of Bartimeu, India and Brazil will overcome this global crisis,” President Bolronaro had said in a letter to Prime Minister Modi.India is the largest manufacturer and exporter of hydroxychloroquine in the world.Bolsonaro was in the country this January to be chief guest at India’s Republic Day celebrations.Brazil, the world’s sixth-biggest nation, with more than 210 million people, is one of the outbreak’s most lethal hot spots. More than 65,000 Brazilians have died from Covid-19, and over 1.5 million have been infected.Both numbers are the world’s second-highest totals, behind those of the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-wishes-speedy-recovery-for-brazil-president-bolsonaro-down-with-covid-19/story-OMOjT1PCBYCl3iDe0qF3EN.html

She was allegedly attacked from behind with a cycle chain, but she managed to shrug off the attacker and raise an alarm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-serial-chain-killer-sentenced-to-death-for-raping-killing-schoolgirl/story-eunpVa3QBMD4w9DLswzCpI.html

08-07-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 tally again jumps by over 22,000 cases, close to 7.5 lakh||India saw its Covid-19 tally jump by another 22,752 in the last 24 hours to reach 7,42,417. According to the Union health ministry data at 8 am, the number of active cases in the country are 2,64,994 and 4,56,830 patients have been cured or discharged.The total number of fatalities has now reached 20,642 after 482 people died in the last 24 hours, the health ministry data showed.The government, however, said on Tuesday that the total number of coronavirus infections and fatalities per million population in the country are among the lowest in the world.The health ministry said that India’s recovered cases per million population is more than active Covid-19 cases per million. It credited the states and Union Territories for early identification and effective management of the coronavirus cases.Among the worst-affected states, Delhi accounts for the highest 3497.1 recovered cases per million as against 1242.9 active cases per million, followed by Maharashtra having 869.5 recovered cases per million as against 661.6 active cases per million, according to health ministry. Tamil Nadu has 753.0 recovered cases per million as against 529.8 active cases per million, while the respective numbers for Haryana are 480.9 and 140.4.Telangana and Karnataka have contributed majorly to the alarming rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country, according to HT’s analysis of 20 worst-hit states in India. HT’s analysis focused on three parametres - high growth rate, high positivity rate, and at least one large urban centre which sees a significant concentration of cases - to identify regions that are exhibiting signs that they may become the next hotspots.Both the states have highest growth rate of cases and high positivity rates.With 25,733 Covid-19 cases as of Tuesday, Telangana has reported 1,219 new cases every day on average over the last two weeks. Karnataka, with 25,317 cases, has reported the fastest growth of cases in the country. In the last two weeks, it reported 1,137 new cases every day against 260 in the two weeks before that.The Centre, meanwhile, removed masks and sanitisers from the purview of the Essential Commodities Act on Tuesday, citing the absence of reports of shortages of such items from anywhere in the country.The items were brought under the purview of this law in March when demand for them outstripped supply, with an eye on capping prices.Since late March, companies have significantly increased production of sanitisers. The emergence of two- and three-ply cloth masks as adequate protection has also played a role in ensuing adequate supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-again-jumps-by-over-22-000-cases-close-to-7-5-lakh/story-gzVZ8n4dhjabySByRB0IYM.html

After rescuing it from the storage space of a scooter, where locals saw it hiding during the night walk, we started clicking pictures of the snake and to our surprise, we saw that it had two different colours bilaterally on its body. We then realised something is different about this snake and informed senior officials,” said Joshi.Also read: Uttarakhand govt to appoint over 700 doctors to boost health infrastructureWhen contacted, experts from Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) said it was a spectacled cobra with a rare genetic disorder called partial leucism.Abhijit Das, scientist and herpetologist at Wildlife Institute of India said even though the snake is widely distributed in this region, it is rare to find a snake with such a genetic disorder.“The phenomenon that was recorded is called partial leucism, that is kind of an aberration or congenital defect. There are various kinds of colouration, like albinism, where the snake is completely white including the eyes, but in this case, it is partial leucism. Only half the body of the snake is leucistic,” said Das.He further informed that leucistic snakes have a body completely white in colour or there are patches of white and black.“Spectacled cobras usually found in Uttarakhand are jet black in colour, but in this case, there is a symmetry with half the body being black and white. This is a rare genetic deformity,” added Das.Spectacled cobras, part of the big four venomous snakes of the country, have a widespread distribution across the country except in north-eastern parts, informed experts.Moving towards the eastern landscapes of the country from the northern region, the colour of spectacled cobra changes from black to brown (found in Odisha, Southern India) to yellowish brown (in parts of West Bengal).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-forest-officials-rescue-spectacled-cobra-with-rare-genetic-features/story-eQi2XV97SdyFOlLkKE9HkO.html

He said Amar Dubey along with Vikas Dubey was on run after the shootout and the state police were making efforts to arrest him.Amar was hiding in Artara village.According to the police, Amar was the brother of Atul Dubey who was killed in the July 3 gun fight. He got married on June 29, just four days before the shootout in Bikru village in rural Kanpur. He was among the group of people who fired at the police team from the house of Vikas Dubey.Incidentally, the STF sleuths gunned down Amar only few hours after Vikas Dubey gave them a slip when they raided a hotel near Badarpur border in Haryana’s Faridabad on Tuesday night.A senior police official privy of the development said the CCTV footage suggested that a man resembling Vikas Dubey along with two men had stayed in the hotel and left few hours before the STF, with help of Faridabad crime branch, raided there.He said three suspects were later picked up from Faridabad whose identity cards were used to book the hotel room.

Dubey is involved in the killing of eight policemen in Kanpur and has been on the run since the incident last Thursday.“The aide Amar Dubey was co-accused in the Kanpur incident and was killed on Wednesday morning,” UP Additional Director General of Police, Law and Order, Prashant Kumar said. He further said that UP Special Task Force (STF) gunned him down in coordination with the local police unit in Hamirpur. There was a reward of Rs 25,000 on him, Kumar added.A police inspector and a constable of the STF were injured in the gun fight.Hamirpur Superintendent of Police (SP) Shlok Kumar said that an automatic weapon and a bag was recovered from Amar Dubey’s possession. “Forensic team is on their way to the encounter site, further investigation is underway,” he added.The Uttar Pradesh Police had said on Tuesday that 40 teams and the STF were hunting for dreaded gangster Vikas Dubey. The state police chief added that the force will not rest until Dubey is nabbed.Uttarakhand police headquarters alarmed its personnel in the state, especially in the border districts, to be on alert after the latest lead on whereabouts of Dubey. The dreaded criminal was allegedly seen in a car with his men in Bijnor on Monday night, a senior police officer requesting anonymity said.The sensational and barbaric execution of policemen in Bikru village in Kanpur rural is also in focus for exposing moles in the state police force who actively tipped off Dubey hours before the police raid and led their own colleagues into a deadly trap laid by the gangster.After the investigation, all the staff members of Kanpur’s Chaubeypur police station, comprising 68 police personnel, were transferred on Tuesday.Anant Deo Tewari, who had earlier worked as Kanpur SSP, was among them. Tewari was transferred from his present post of DIG STF after a controversial letter of slain Dy SP Devendra Mishra surfaced. In the letter, Mishra had sought action against SO of Chaubeypur police station, Kanpur, Vinay Tewari but Anant Deo Tewari had allegedly ignored the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-gangster-vikas-dubey-s-close-aide-amar-dubey-shot-dead-in-police-encounter/story-qUvP8ZkRDk5sYsAVrXNQ1L.html
08-07-2020||India||4km buffers at three key points as troops pull back from Ladakh clash site||The Indian Army has begun a rigourous verification process to monitor the withdrawal of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh even as a complicated disengagement plan moved forward in Hot Springs and Gogra, where the two armies are working to create a 4km buffer zone between troops within a 24-hour time frame, four officials familiar with the developments said on Tuesday evening.The PLA has withdrawn up to 2km from Patrolling Point 15 (Hot Springs) and a similar retreat is expected to be completed at PP-17 (Gogra) by Wednesday evening, with the Indian Army pulling back proportionately. This is based on an understanding reached last week by top Indian and Chinese military commanders on a phased de-escalation of the ongoing border conflict in the Ladakh theatre, said one of the officials cited above, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The two armies have already created a 4km buffer zone in Galwan Valley, the site of a deadly clash which left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead on June 15, said a second official.The creation of buffer zones will temporarily restrict the patrolling activities of both armies in the region. While some experts saw this as a necessary step, others cautioned that the temporary curtailing of patrolling rights should not become a long-term feature undermining Indian presence and control.Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday that the PLA had withdrawn up to 1.5 km from friction areas in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra, and the Indian Army also pulled back proportionately. A minor thinning of PLA soldiers has been noticed at the sensitive Finger Area near Pangong Tso.Satellite images on Tuesday appeared to confirm the PLA pullback from Galwan Valley. “The images clearly indicate that the PLA has moved back in Galwan Valley. It’s a positive step but constant verification and strict vigil are a must,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations. Bhatia reviewed the images for HT. The disengagement effort involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the complex plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides. It also entails the phased withdrawal of weapons and equipment to a mutually agreed distance, and finally the restoration of status quo ante (the situation as it existed in early April).“The army is keeping a close watch on the ongoing pull back by the PLA. It’s extremely critical to verify and reverify every stage of the disengagement process to avoid surprises,” said the second official, who asked not to be identified.The verification process launched by the army involves unmanned aerial vehicles, other aerial means of surveillance and satellite imagery of the areas, said a third official.The Indian Air Force (IAF) is already projecting its capabilities of carrying out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions in Ladakh, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters, and multi-mission choppers getting airborne for demanding night-time missions from a forward airbase in the area, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.On the creation of buffer zones, and the curtailment of patrolling, experts had a mixed response.“The zones of separation will eliminate the possibility of violent face-offs. It’s best to avoid any form of contact between rival troops. A moratorium on patrolling the areas by both sides till things stabilise should help,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).Disengagement during a 2014 border standoff at Chumar in Ladakh involved a temporary ban on Indian and Chinese soldiers patrolling disputed areas.Satisfactory progress of disengagement in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra could set the stage for reducing tensions in the Finger Area and also turn the focus on the Depsang plains where the PLA’s forward presence is hindering the Indian Army’s patrolling patterns, said Hooda.But others sounded a more cautionary note, emphasising that India must be able to — after the agreed period — exercise its patrolling rights again. A senior official said India must never lose track of China’s “salami slicing” tactics to slowly grab territory. “Salami slicing” refers to a string of small, clandestine operations meant to achieve a larger goal that would be difficult to accomplish in one go. He said, “We have to ensure that the buffer zones do not become a new status quo. These can only be a temporary measure to facilitate the disengagement process to restore status quo ante. The army will fully exercise patrolling rights in the area once that happens.”Before the PLA occupied vantage positions on Finger Four in early May, Indian Army soldiers would patrol right up to Finger Eight, which New Delhi considers to be its territory. The new Chinese positions have restricted the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers Four and Eight are 8km apart.The army is also keeping a strict vigil along the contested border in the Depsang sector where a 2013 Chinese intrusion blocked the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes, including the ones leading to Patrol Points 10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13, a fourth official said.The military buildup in Indian and Chinese depth areas, however, hasn’t thinned, with both sides keeping their guard up. The deployment of thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence weapons continues in the region.The disengagement process, a precursor to any kind of de-escalation of the border conflict, has started under the terms mutually agreed to at the June 30 meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region. This understanding, in turn, was the result of earlier efforts not paying dividends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4km-buffers-at-three-key-points-as-troops-pull-back/story-Wu5bKqvGGf6DkD9QJpsmgK.html
08-07-2020||India||SC extends deadline to give women permanent posting||The Centre on Tuesday received one month to implement the Supreme Court’s path-breaking decision to grant a permanent commission to women Army officers serving under the Short Service Commission (SSC). An order by the top court passed on February 17 had ended the gender disparity that stood in the way of women SSC officers being denied a permanent commission their male counterparts were entitled to. The Centre agreed to grant a permanent commission to women in 10 non-combat streams and was directed by the apex court to complete the process in three months.The deadline expired in May. The extension ordered by the court will be valid for a month starting on Tuesday. Citing the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, the Centre moved an application before the Supreme Court to extend the deadline expiring in May by six months. Senior advocate R Balasubramanian, appearing for the ministry of defence, told a bench comprising justices DY Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra that the government was is in an advanced stage of implementing the court’s order. The process couldn’t be completed because of the lockdown that caused all government offices to be close abruptly, the lawyer said.“On account of lack of staff, closure of hospitals, including Army hospital and non-availability of other requirements necessary to comply with the directions of the Supreme Court, it was very difficult to continue with the process of consideration of women officers for grant of permanent commission…..In view of the corona pandemic and the ensuing lockdown coupled with exigencies of service, the applicant has not been able to complete the same and requires more time to complete the entire process,” the Centre said in its petition.The women SSC officers were represented in the virtual court proceeding by their lawyers Meenakshi Lekhi and Meenakshi Arora. Opposing the application, the counsel argued that an attempt is being made by Centre to dilute the Supreme Court judgment to delay its implementation.The bench took note of the fact that the Centre had commenced efforts to implement the court order and could not foresee the lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Recording this submission in its order, the bench said, “We extend the time for compliance by one more month.” The court kept the matter pending in order to pursue implementation of its direction.Under the Supreme Court’s February order, women SSC officers who are serving and who had approached the court but retired during the pendency of proceedings were eligible for a permanent commission. It was in 2006 that the Army extended SSC to women recruits allowing them a short stint of 10 years, extendable up to 14 years, to work with the army’s non-combat streams. In 2010, the Delhi high court, ruling on a batch of petitions filed by women SSC officers, directed Centre to grant them a permanent commission. Challenging this order, the Centre approached the apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-extends-deadline-to-give-women-permanent-posting/story-mudjiVt2P7zdg7zXVSgohK.html
08-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||International travellers are quarantined in a hotel. Security is tight; there are guards around. The guards smoke; they share a cigarette lighter. And a city and a state in Australia, a country that has done pretty well in managing the coronavirus disease, shut down again as cases spike, catching health officials by surprise.The city is, of course, Melbourne, and the state, Victoria, and this is a true story that’s playing out right now.By the third week of April, Australia seemed to have things under control. According to data on worldometers.info, the country saw 13 new Covid-19 cases on April 20. Like its neighbour New Zealand, it seemed to have crushed the pandemic. It stayed that way for almost two months, enough time for people to start believing that it was over. On June 5, Australia registered just five new cases of the disease.Then the numbers started rising again. On July 3, the country saw 254 new cases. On July 6, it saw 137. And most of the cases were from Victoria (on July 3, for instance, the state accounted for 191 of the 254 new cases). In contrast to Indian policymakers who remain averse to the term “community transmission” despite the thousands of new cases every day in some states, Victoria has suggested that there could well be community transmission in what can only be termed a second wave — not just in the state, but in the country. Australia had kicked Covid-19, till, one day, it hadn’t. In this case, it is suspected that the cigarette lighter was responsible for the flare-up of infections, but this is what makes the coronavirus disease so dangerous. It is almost as if it were alive (the jury is still out on that one when it comes to viruses, actually) and thinking, lulling people and countries into a false sense of security, and then striking. The fact that it is highly infective means that a strike immediately results in a cluster, like it has in Melbourne. And that’s in a city that saw off the first wave.India never did.For those of us in India, the words said by Anthony Fauci, NIAID director and the man shaping the US’s health policy response to the pandemic, in a widely aired interview with National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins on Monday, are apt, although they were in reference to the resurgence of cases in the US: “We are still knee-deep in the first wave.”Fauci went on to explain how the US almost doubled the number of daily new cases in a week-and-a-half by opening up again too fast. Last week, Fauci told senators that the US could see 100,000 new cases a day if it did not clamp down on flare-ups and fresh outbreaks. The US saw around 47,000 new cases on July 6.India had 22,310 new Covid-19 cases on July 6. The number of cases has continued to rise — the five-day average has not shown a dip so far — with new infection hot spots emerging to offset improvements shown by older hot spots. If the US is any indication — it is larger than India in geographical area and is therefore a good benchmark on how the disease will travel — this is how the pandemic will play out in India. For instance, Telangana, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka are all states we should be worrying about right now (see page 5).Here again, India could learn from the US example when it comes to the response. The New York Times reports that there is a “new testing crisis” in states and cities that have seen a spike in cases. “Testing in the United States has not kept pace with other countries....,” NYT said on July 7. This, in a country that has tested 11.5% of its population. India has tested less than 1%. But experts are of the view that India can raise testing manifold (see page 4).This column suggested a target of 50 million tests by August 15. That’s achievable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-s59jXD8nTXg5eZSDGEKHVK.html
08-07-2020||India||Ventilator supplier rebuts allegations of poor quality||Two days after former Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted that sub-standard ventilators were being procured from a private supplier under the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund distributed to hospitals, the company rebutted the allegation on Tuesday, saying it was an attempt to sabotage indigenous efforts in the battle against Covid-19.Professor Diwakar Vaish, the owner of AgVa Healthcare, which has manufactured the ventilators, told news agency ANI, “We have not made the ventilator overnight. We have been in the market for three years. We have developed this step by step. This ventilator has all parameters that a normal ventilator has...Our ventilators are five to ten times cheaper than normal ventilators. A normal ventilator costs ₹10-20 lakh. Our ventilator is just ₹1.5 lakh. In this, international vendor nexus is very strong.”“Just like when Indian military equipment was indigenised, there was a lot of negative reviews. The same thing is happening here. What a ₹10 lakh ventilator does, ours is doing for ₹1.5 lakh. Will international associations, international vendors accept this? That is why they are trying to sabotage,” he added.Gandhi, in a tweet on July 5, accused the Narendra Modi government of “putting Indian lives at risk” and “ensuring that public money is used to buy sub-standard products”. “PMCares opacity is: 1. Putting Indian lives at risk. 2. Ensuring public money is used to buy sub-standard products,” he had tweeted based on a news article that alleged AgVa ventilators “fudged” software in their product and hide poor performance.Vaish said, “Rahul Gandhi is not a doctor. He is an intelligent man. He should have done due diligence before making such allegations. He should have consulted doctors. I am ready to give a detailed demonstration in the hospital on any patient.”He said that doctors need to be given a demonstration of the ventilators following which the devices could be used properly. He also said that if third party installations were faulty and were done without keeping AgVa in the loop, it could result in faulty readings, which he suspected was the case in some hospitals.The central government ordered 10,000 of the firm’s Covid-19 model ventilators from AgVa Healthcare as part of India’s response to the pandemic.The company used to make about 50-100 ventilators a month, but with support from Maruti Suzuki India, Invest India, the national investment facilitation agency, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited and Bharat Electronics Limited, it now has a production capacity of between 5,000 and 10,000 ventilators.The Union health ministry said in a statement that the Make in India ventilators supplied to states and union territories by the ministry of health and family welfare were meant for intensive care units. Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar, dean of JJ Hospital, said ventilators manufactured by Delhi-based AgVa healthcare, are still lying unused at the hospital. “We have no role to play as those machines were donated by a local politician. When we observed that the machines weren’t functioning properly, we informed them to take it away,” he said. The hospital has decided not to accept any ventilator from the manufacturer without testing. “The company wants to exchange and provide better machines but we will not accept it without testing on patients,” he added. “The machines that were provided to us had the mode for non invasive ventilation. We did not face any problems, except for in a few machines — maybe 10 — that had some defects and were sent back to the manufacturer,” said a doctor from Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital, on condition of anonymity. The hospital on Monday had increased its ventilator beds using several of the ventilators provided by the central government||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ventilator-supplier-rebuts-allegations-of-poor-quality/story-cnqqswnEwflcsLQAvIRuDL.html
08-07-2020||India||Foreign pupils a big revenue source for US economy||The US government’s latest order on foreign students in the country — if their colleges are offering only online courses, they can no longer stay in the US — will adversely affect many Indian students. According to the 2019 Open Doors Report on the International Education Exchange, there were over one million international students in the US in the academic year 2018-19. India has the second largest share in number of international students in the US after China. Chinese and Indian students account for more than half of international students in the US. The number of Indian students in the US crossed 200,000 for the first time in 2018-19. This number was less than a 100,000 in 2012-13, the earliest period for which data is available at the Institute of International Education’s (IIE) website, which publishes the Open Doors reports. (See Chart 1) According to data from the US government, the number of active students from India in the US was 194,556 in January 2020.While India is an important source of international students in the US, the profile of Indian students is different from the rest of the international students in the US. More than 80% of Indian students are enrolled in graduate programmes or Optional Practical Training, which allows student visa holders to work for a year. Only 12 % of Indian students were enrolled in under graduate programmes in the US. This share is at least 45% for students from countries excluding India. (See Chart 2) International students, including those from India, are a major source of revenue for the US economy. According to NAFSA: Association of International Educators, a Washington based non-profit working on international students and exchange, international students brought $ 41 billion in revenue and supported around 460000 jobs across various sectors in the US.A survey of educational institutions by IIE in November 2019 had found that issues related to the visa application process or delays and denials of visa were the top reason for drops in new enrolment in the fall of 2019. The survey also found that academic institutions in the US were concerned about slowing growth of students from Asia, especially China and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-pupils-a-big-revenue-source/story-6QrsW9RyS8CydSG96Yge1O.html

08-07-2020||India||JeM operative held in Pulwama attack case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday said it has arrested a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) operative for allegedly harbouring and providing logistical support to the perpetrators of the February 2019 attack that left 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel dead in Jammu & Kashmir’s Pulwama and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.In a statement, NIA said Bilal Ahmed Kuchey, the accused, allegedly harboured the perpetrators at his residence and provided them with high-end mobile phones to communicate with their Pakistan-based handlers and to record Adil Ahmed Dar’s video before he rammed an explosive-laden car into a CRPF vehicle. JeM released the video after the attack to claim responsibility for it. The attack prompted India to carry out an airstrike on a JeM camp in Pakistan’s Balakot. Kuchey, a resident of Pulwama’s Hajibal, is the seventh person to be arrested for the attack.In the statement, NIA spokesperson Sonia Narang called Kuchey a terror associate. “The main perpetrators in the case stayed in his house and he further introduced them to other OGWs [overground workers] who provided safe houses during their stay and planning of the attack.” Narang added the perpetrators used the high-end phones for giving final touches to the planning and execution of the attack besides communicating with Pakistan-based JeM leadership as well as among themselves. NIA last week arrested Mohammad Iqbal Rather for allegedly facilitating Muhammad Umar Farooq’s movement. Farooq, a key conspirator in the Pulwama case, infiltrated into Jammu & Kashmir in April 2018 and was killed in an encounter on March 29, 2019.The others arrested in the case in February and March include Shakir Bashir Magrey, Mohammad Abbas Rather, Waiz-ul-Islam, Insha Jan, her father, Tariq Ahmad Shah.Pakistani terrorist – Mohammad Umar Farooq (killed in encounter on March 29, 2019 along with IED expert Kamran) were given the responsibility to execute the attack while JeM’s area commander Mudassir Khan (killed on March 11, 2019) supervised the overall planning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jem-operative-held-in-pulwama-attack-case/story-GHTBxPm4UxJGuVzDO0WarI.html
08-07-2020||India||First woman moves Supreme Court over triple talaq law||A Kerala lawyer has moved the Supreme Court against a law that criminalises the practice of granting instant divorce becoming the first Muslim woman to do so since Parliament passed the legislation in 2019. Noorbeena Rasheed on July 6 challenged the Protection of Rights on Marriage Act, which provides for a three-year punishment for talaq-e-biddat, a practise also referred to as Triple Talaq, which is practised among a small section of Muslims in the country. “The protection of women cannot be achieved by incarceration of husbands,” her petition stated.Issuing a notice to the Centre, a bench of three justices led by N V Ramana on Monday admitted Rasheed’s petition, which will be heard with nine similar pleas challenging the law’s validity. The other petitioners include organisations like Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Muslim Advocates Association, and two individuals. The petitions have called the law disproportionate as well as excessive and stringent and sought that the court hold it unconstitutional. A date for hearing these petitions has not been listed as yet. The law was passed in July 2019 after intense debates in both the lower and upper houses of the Parliament, with opposition parties stating that the law targeted the Muslim community even as the centre asserted that the law would help achieve gender justice for Muslim women. Rasheed’s petition questions provisions of the law including one which allows relatives of the women to file complaints. The petition stated that this provision could potentially destroy marital relationships in case of false complaint. “This provision is highly detrimental not only to the wife but also to the marital relationship.”Her petition also sought clarification from the Centre on the assessment that underlies incarcerating Muslim men for divorcing women. “Welfare-oriented legislation would promote amicable resolution of matrimonial disputes rather than criminalise marital discord, particularly criminalisation of only one community…the intent behind the Act is not abolition of triple talaq [instant divorce] but punishment of Muslim husbands,” her petition said.Rasheed’s lawyer, Zulfikar Ali, said they want to highlight how the law will be detrimental to the interests of Muslim women, which it seeks to protect.” He added Rasheed is also the national general secretary of the Indian Union Women’s League, which he described as the country’s largest Muslim women organisation affiliated to the Kerala-based Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). IUML has three members in Parliament’s lower House, or Lok Sabha.In August 2017, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court had declared the practice of talaq-e-biddat (a heretical form of divorce based on a husband pronouncing divorce thrice in quick succession) as unconstitutional. The practice is banned in most Muslim countries including Pakistan.The verdict came on a petition of five Muslim women, including lead petitioner Shayara Bano, who were abandoned after their husbands pronounced instant divorce.The Centre initially issued an ordinance after the verdict to criminalise the practice of triple talaq for the want of majority in Parliament’s upper house, or Rajya Sabha, before bringing the law.The law makes the practice a cognisable offence. An offence of such a nature allows the police to carry out arrests without a warrant. Serious crimes such as theft, rape, and murder are also cognisable offences.In its petition, Jamiat-Ulama-I-Hind has said there are graver offences like rioting and bribery under the Indian Penal Code for which there is a lesser punishment than instant divorce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1st-woman-moves-sc-over-triple-talaq-law/story-GDNz12PC0SSXEXNrNZWm0O.html
08-07-2020||India||ED files fraud case against GVK group||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday filed a money laundering case against GVK Group, its chairman, G V K Reddy, his son, G V Sanjay Reddy, and others for alleged irregularities worth over Rs 800 crore in the Mumbai airport development, officials familiar with the matter said. The group also runs the airport.ED’s probe into the case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is based on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) First Information Report (FIR) registered on June 27. The FIR named 13 people including the Reddys, the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), and companies that were given contracts at the airport. CBI searched the group’s premises in Mumbai and Hyderabad last week.The officials said ED, which has powers to attach properties during investigations, will examine the accounts of the companies and their transfer of funds to ascertain the alleged money laundering.A GVK spokesperson said they have not received any notice from ED and did not offer further comments.In a statement last week, MIAL said it was surprised to note CBI has registered a case against the company. “MIAL would have provided every assistance had the agency sought explanation or any document even if a preliminary enquiry had been initiated. MIAL is a transparent and responsible corporate entity which is committed to cooperate with the agency in its investigation to arrive at the truth.”MIAL is a joint public-private partnership venture between the Airports Authority of India (AAI), GVK Group, and foreign entities (LIKE). The GVK Group has a 50.5% stake in MIAL, and AAI 26%.AAI entered into operation, management, and development agreement (OMDA) in April 2006 for the airport’s modernisation, up gradation, operation and maintenance as part of the joint venture. MIAL was to share 38.7% of its revenue as an annual fee with AAI as per the agreement. “The essence of agreement was to create a world class facility and at the same time protecting the interests of government of India, promoters and passengers,” said the FIR. “Despite there being a clear cut understanding in the OMDA, the promoters of GVK group in MIAL, in connivance with their executives and the unknown officials of AAI resorted to siphoning of funds fraudulently adopting various modus operandi.”MIAL allegedly got into fake work contracts during 2017-18 with at least nine companies on the pretext of real estate development. It allegedly transferred funds to them. These projects have never been executed on the ground and the transactions were only on paper. Using this modus operandi, Rs 310 crore have been fraudulently siphoned off and caused losses to AAI. The GVK Group also allegedly from 2012 onwards used Rs 395 crore MIAL surplus to finance its other companies.CBI has alleged the group’s promoters also allegedly embezzled funds by inflating MIAL expenditure. The FIR alleges the group connived with the (Reddy?) family members, relatives, and employees they assigned premium retail areas of the airport at exorbitantly low rates and thereby reduced MIAL’s revenue from rentals and sales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-files-fraud-case-against-gvk-group/story-sgqdIq1dwkdtfguBJdcDpO.html
08-07-2020||India||SC for virtual hearing in Maratha reservation case||The Supreme Court indicated on Tuesday that it was open to holding daily hearings over video in a case relating to the Maharashtra law for Maratha community quotas, refusing calls by lawyers to begin some in-court since the virtual medium is inadequate for the elaborate legal discussions that need to be made in a matter that involves interpretation of the Constitution. In-court hearings have been suspended since the Covid-19 outbreak began to grow, moving to videoconferencing where lawyers connect with judges over an application called VIDYO. The process has been fraught with technical complications such as dropped links as well as posed difficulties among lawyers and judges being able to discuss matters among themselves.On Tuesday, the petitioners challenging a Maharashtra law introducing quota for Maratha community people in education and jobs, as well as the state government told the court that the case required physical hearings because of the elaborate nature of arguments. “The case involves 15 petitions, the judgment of the Bombay High Court which is under challenge runs into 500 pages. The state has filed a counter affidavit which is over 1500 pages. There are several books, reports and documents that need to be referred which is possible only in a physical court setting,” said senior advocate Shyam Divan, representing the petitioners. To this, the bench, led by justice LN Rao, said: “Expecting an immediate hearing in the case and that too, judges assembling physically in the current situation (of Covid-19) might not be possible.” The court fixed the matter for July 15 and asked the petitioners and state government to submit a short note of their submissions. Based on this, the Court is likely to consider passing interim orders on whether the Act requires to be stayed till there is a final decision on its validity.The matter relates to a Maharashtra law that introduced 12 per cent reservation for Maratha community in education and 13 per cent quota in appointment to public service jobs in the state. The law in question – Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act 2018 -- was introduced with the purpose of extending reservation benefits to the Maratha community. This law originally provided 16 per cent reservation to Marathas in state admissions and jobs. This law was challenged before the Bombay High Court which upheld the validity of the law but reduced it to 12 per cent in admissions and 13 per cent in jobs. Accordingly, the state government amended the law.The petitions have challenged the law on the ground that it breaches the 50 per cent reservation threshold prescribed in the landmark Indra Sawhney judgment of 1992. But the state argued that its law is based on a scientific study conducted by the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission which found extraordinary conditions prevailing among Maratha families which required special provisions for their upliftment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-for-virtual-hearing-in-maratha-reservation-case/story-p2abzR6H4LsLsg8nr7CP3H.html
08-07-2020||India||I&B proposes to bring OTT content under its purview||The Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry has proposed bringing under its purview the contents being streamed on several over-the-top (OTT) platforms, said a top ministry official on Tuesday.At present, OTT platforms that are digitally streamed falls under the domain of the Ministry of Information and Technology (IT). “OTT being a digital platform will fall under the purview of the Ministry of IT but now we are proposing a decision that the content should fall within the purview of I&B ministry,” said Amit Khare, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Secretary. “There is a need for convergence of various ministries (in this regard), particularly in the ways changes are happening, (it) is extremely necessary,” he said..Khare said that regulatory regimes in India have been developed as per the platforms and the country has no regulations as of now for the emerging media like OTT players.Out of “five different media -- print, radio, TV, films and OTT -- four of them have certain kinds of regulatory practices and one is unregulated”, he said, adding that currently a film released on OTT is not covered under the Central Board of Film Certification as it not exhibited as a film there.He also stressed on the need to have a level-playing field but added that this does not mean that all would be brought under a “very heavy regulatory structure”. Recently during the lockdown, several OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, ATLBalaji have witnessed a huge jump in their subscription.As movie halls are also closed due to lockdown, several production houses have released their movie directly on OTT, bypassing theatrical releases.The I&B ministry has in the past favoured self-regulation mechanisms. The ministry could consider a similar mechanism for OTT platforms, a person familiar with the developments said.While talking about the convergence, he said telecom and media & entertainment should be on equal footing in terms of adjusted gross revenue (AGR).”What happens to AGR in telecom has to be applicable in the M&E sector. We cannot have two different rates of AGR for the telecom sector and M&E sector for DTH providers. So there is a need for convergence,” the secretary said according to PTI. The focus of the government in the last few years has been on “less regulation but more effective regulation”.

08-07-2020||India||India’s 1st private jet terminal to open in Delhi this month||India’s first general aviation terminal for private jets is set to become operational in New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, according to officials familiar with the matter. The facility promises faster turnaround of business jets and chartered planes, shielding them from the clutter of general passenger terminals, where they now compete for taxiing slots with commercial flights.Delhi International Airport Limited, which operates Indira Gandhi International Airport, said it is working towards the commissioning of the terminal soon to support the movement of passengers flying on chartered flights from the airport. “It is the first such independent facility at any Indian airport to handle general aviation passengers. While the new terminal will be commissioned as an interim facility it will be equipped with state-of-the-art features and facilities including world class passenger lounges, retail, food and beverage [outlets] etc.,” DIAL said in a statement in response to queries from HT.An official from the airport said the terminal may be operational as early as by the end of July. It is meant to be replaced by a larger facility in the future.“The terminal has been designed in such a manner that it will have parking space for a maximum 65 jets of all sizes...The terminal also has the capacity to handle a maximum of 150 business jet movements a day. The average movement capacity of the terminal is 75 jets per day. This makes it a general aviation terminal with the highest capacity in entire south Asia,” said a second Delhi airport official who requested anonymity.The terminal has been built at a cost of Rs.150 crore over one-and-a-half years by Bird ExecuJet Airport Services Private Limited, a joint venture between Bird Group and ExecuJet Aviation Group, an international business aviation company based at Zurich Airport in Switzerland.A spokesperson for the company said construction work commenced on January 1, 2019. “In between, we faced a Supreme Court ban on construction activities owing to pollution in Delhi for three months. Then lockdown [for the coronavirus disease pandemic] also hampered our work. However, we have been able to complete the project by June 2020,” it said.The terminal will also be able to handle Boeing 767 business jets and any Boeing 777 with a VIP configuration, the second official cited above said. Before the national lockdown was first imposed in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease, around 1,300 scheduled flights operated from Delhi airport every day and an additional 40-50 small non-scheduled chartered or private planes also landed at and take off from the airport daily. While private aircraft will still have to compete for take-off and landing slots with commercial flights, a Delhi airport official said that the new terminal will cut time , “because runway 29/11 -- the largest in Delhi -- is closer to the new terminal, and this will make taxiing time of these private aircraft significantly shorter”. He added that the shorter distance between the terminal building and flight boarding point will also make the process of boarding quicker and less cumbersome.Several VIPs prefer to travel in private jets and all their aircraft movements take place from Terminal 1, which has been operating beyond its capacity and is currently undergoing expansion, the airport official cited above said.Kanika Tekriwal, CEO and founder, JetSetGo Aviation, one of the firms that offers private jet services at Delhi airport, said the charges for hiring a private jet vary, depending upon size of aircraft and length of trip. “They start at Rs 80,000 per hour for an eight seater turbo-prop and go all the way to Rs 5-6 lakh per hour for a 16-seater jet. Added to which there are airport and other landing charges,” she said.Kapil Kaul, CEO and director of CAPA South Asia, an aviation advisory and research firm, said he expects an international standard general aviation terminal in Delhi to help increase corporate jet penetration in India.“However, given the challenging economic conditions post-Covid, we may see a serious short-term impact till the recovery is visible. The demand for corporate jets since last few years has remained almost stagnant,” Kaul said.During the lockdown, the number of daily non-scheduled flights remained between 8-10 flights a day -- mostly medical emergencies; at present, it is around 20-30 movements a day, and of these at least 40% are for medical emergencies, a third official at the airport said.The general aviation terminal has not been without its share of legal tangles.This February, Mark Martin, chief executive officer of Dubai-based aviation firm Martin Consulting, which was executing the general aviation terminal project until February 2019, when the contract was terminated, filed a police complaint for criminal as well as civil proceedings against officials of DIAL and Bird ExecuJet alleging “theft and unlawful use of Martin Consulting’s work and intellectual property”.Martin Consulting had been engaged by Bird ExecuJet in 2017 to develop the design and prepare a study on the general aviation project, Martin said. The following year, after the location of the project changed, it was appointed to carry out demolition of existing structures on the site and design and construct the facility, he said. Bird ExecuJet disputed the version, saying Martin Consulting had been engaged by it as a project management consultant to prepare a study on the general aviation project. And its contract was terminated because it was unable to deliver on its contractual obligations, the company said.Deputy commissioner of police (Delhi airport) Rajeev Ranjan said a probe was started on the complaint by Martin, but had to be stopped because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is again being taken up,” Ranjan said.When contacted, Martin said “changes made by GMR Group-led DIAL on the original drawings and design by Martin Consulting are in violation of copyright laws. Changes made by them on the original drawings and design by Martin Consulting also emerge as a safety violation keeping landside access to the terminal in view. We have also notified the ministry of civil aviation on the matter along with the Airports Authority of India.”In response, Bird ExecuJet said it had replied to a legal notice sent by Martin, clearly stating that under the terms of the contract with Martin Consulting, all deliverables were work for hire and all intellectual property rights for the work belonged to Bird ExecuJet.“Bird ExecuJet is the rightful owner of all such work under the terms of the contract and copyright laws. Under the contract, payment was to be made to Mark Martin upon production of documents. Failure to substantiate the expenses with documentary proof has led to non-payment of the dues he claims from us,” said the company in a statement.Martin has filed two cases. While in the first case, the National Company Law Tribunal has not issued any notice to BirdExecuJet, in the second case, a local court has granted no stay in favour of Martin Consulting, Bird ExecuJet said.Police have also not registered any first information report against Bird ExecuJet.In its response to queries from HT, a DIAL spokesperson said: “DIAL has no contractual relationship with Martin Consulting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-1st-pvt-jet-terminal-to-open-in-delhi-this-month/story-iikJ0WNm3ouGfpqQNkC2CN.html
08-07-2020||India||Masks, sanitisers out of essentials’ list||The Centre has removed masks and sanitisers from the purview of the Essential Commodities Act, citing the absence of reports of shortages of such items from anywhere in the country. The items were brought under the purview of this law in March when demand for them outstripped supply, with an eye on capping prices. Masks and sanitisers remain the first line of defence to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease.“There are no adverse reports with respect to price or availability to continue (to treat) face masks and hand sanitisers as essential commodities,” a Union consumer affairs ministry order said last week.Since late March companies have significantly increased production of sanitisers and several have also entered these businesses. The emergence of two- and three-play cloth masks as adequate protection (as opposed to the N95 masks that people thought were the only protection in March) has also played a role in ensuing adequate supply.Officials allayed fears that the move may lead to a spike in prices citing their adequate supply. “Usually retail prices go up when there is more demand than supply. A few months ago, there was a shortage of these items, which is why they were brought under the Act... Now there is indigenous manufacturing also of these items. We are comfortably placed, and experts reviewing the matter did not find the need to continue the restrictions,” said an official in the pharmaceuticals department , who asked not to be named.Officials said the supply of personal protection equipment, including masks, and hand sanitisers, has now been streamlined at hospitals too.“There was a shortage a few months ago but now these are readily available, and even the prices have come down,” said a person associated with Max Healthcare, which runs a chain of hospitals.The production and supply of masks and hand sanitisers were regulated as per the law and various states put price caps on them. Hoarding of any item declared as an essential commodity is an offence under the Act and can lead to imprisonment of up to seven years.A second official in the pharmaceuticals department said a frequent review of these items in all states and Union Territories showed that supply is enough to meet demand. “Therefore, no shortage is anticipated. The government will continue to monitor the prices of these commodities under regular channels.”The Directorate General of Foreign Trade on March 20 banned exports of masks, textile raw material used for making them, and ventilators in view of the pandemic. The order denotifying masks and sanitisers as essential items will have no bearing on the export ban, the second official said. That means they can’t be exported.On June 29, the restricted export of PPE kits was allowed by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade. A monthly quota of five million PPE for Covid-19 units has been fixed, for issuance of export licences.Abhishek Aggrawal, an analyst with commodities trading firm Comtrade, said that if supply is equal to or more than demand, then there is no legal justification for treating any item as essential. “The original notification declaring these items as essential was till June-end.”“Even after four months of the pandemic, we are still not getting adequate number of sanitisers in our hospitals and clinics. With this new rule, the essential materials will once again be sold at a higher price, which will add to to the ongoing the crisis and patient bills. Unless these items are easily available in chemist stores at reasonable rates, its removal from the list of essential items is not the right step,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president, Association of Medical Consultants, Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/masks-sanitisers-out-of-essentials-list/story-e7fnY0y9MvGf35mGASnArL.html
08-07-2020||India||Finance panel focus on raising health spending to 2.1% of GDP||As India battles the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, fifteenth finance commission chairman NK Singh on Tuesday said the commission was working towards a financing model to raise federal public-health spending to about 2.1% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP)  over the next five years.The NK Singh-led finance commission for the first time will devote an entire chapter on public health financing when it submits its final report, which is under preparation , he said.On Tuesday, Singh led a brainstorming session on the country’s health sector and the current Covid-19 pandemic with officials from the World Bank, the Niti Aayog, health economists and sectoral experts.India’s overall health spending has consistently lagged global averages, leading to poor health outcomes. The total expenditure on health by the Centre and states for 2019-20 was Rs 2.6 lakh crore, or just 1.29% of GDP, according to official data. This includes salaries, gross budgetary support and transfers to states under programmes such as the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. Of the total expenditure, the Centre’s share is 25%.By comparision, the UK spends 9.6% of its GDP on health, according to the OECD.“The public sector has an inescapable obligation towards health. The private sector alone cannot fulfil it. Of course, there will be public-private partnerships. Over the next five years, the Centre alone should be able to spend at least 2.1% of GDP on health. Let’s see,” Singh said.Singh said the current and next fiscal years would see some strain in resources due to the pandemic.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has already indicated raising the Centre’s spending on health, Singh said, adding: “Health has witnessed historic neglect and the Planning Commission did no good, although there was some repairing.”The Constitution, through Article 280 to 281, provides for a unique mechanism in finance commissions for division of taxes and revenues vertically — between the Centre and states, and horizontally— among all states, based on their levels of development, prosperity and regional needs.Singh said the new public health financing model for the country would include financial incentives and grants to states for a “couple of sectoral items”. “Let’s say, if a state provides for X as public health infrastructure, then it will qualify for Y incentive.” Health facilities have to be demand-driven, he said.These “items” could include infrastructure such as “infectious disease facility in every district etc”, Singh said.The Singh-led finance commission has already submitted its first report to the government for the 2020-21 period. It then got an extension till October 30 to submit its final report covering financial years 2021-22 to 2025-26 (April-March).Singh, a former politician and bureaucrat, said the Covid-19 pandemic had “strengthened” the country’s public health capacity, referring to India’s Covid-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Package approved by the Cabinet on April 22 for Rs 15,000 crores. Singh has already tasked a high-level group under All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria to make a set of recommendations, which would be part of the commission’s views on overhauling the health sector. Tuesday’s discussions saw participation of all members of the commission, the World Bank’s country director Junaid Ahmad, Guleria of AIIMS, VK Paul, member of Niti Aayog and Indu Bhushan, the CEO of Ayushman Bharat...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finance-panel-focus-on-raising-health-spending/story-sMKIz8QM0Y5Yr0hL1BuGsJ.html
08-07-2020||India||Walk-ins may be key step as India looks to step up testing||The civic agency in Mumbai allowed on Tuesday people to get tested for Covid-19 without needing a doctor’s prescription, making it the first city in the country to allow walk-in tests – a step experts say is crucial to adequately scale up a process that alone could hold the key to beating back the outbreak. India has till now carried out a little over 10 million tests but will need to ramp up this process significantly by setting a bar as high as 50 million tests by August 15, which would give authorities a far more adequate insight into how the virus may have spread in a population of over 1.3 billion people so that each of the infected can then be traced and isolated. According to experts in public health, industry and regulations, the country has the capacity to carry out a million tests a day but will need administrative will from across the states. “We are not testing enough. We (India) have enough tests – we can make two million tests per week just in Mylabs and now there are multiple other companies making testing kits in India, but we’re just not testing more,” said Adar Poonawalla, CEO and owner of the Pune-based Serum Institute of India, which is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume.Mylabs is India’s first local manufacturer of the gold standard RT-PCR tests for Covid-19, and Serum Institute has helped it increase its capacity. India, which has the third highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world after US and Brazil, has done 7,661 tests per million people, which is less than 0.8% of its population. In comparison, the US has tested 11% of its population, Russia 16%, and the UK, 15%, according to data compiled by Worldometers.Recent headway in efforts to ramp up testing have come from tools such as the rapid antigen kits (one of those used is the Standard Q from a South Korean company) and equipment-makers are pushing for more innovation to make testing devices that are easier to operate.One such device was launched on Tuesday by Pune-based Mylabs, which unveiled India’s first fully-automated bench-top system designed to automate the process of testing using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method.“This machine can perform 400 tests a day with a single person operating it, which will help address any potential demand-supply gaps of highly skilled technicians for testing, thus saving us manpower and time and helping the country open up by testing faster, more efficiently and on a large scale,” said Poonawalla. On-demand testingAs much as equipment and resources, India needs to allow walk-in tests, say experts. “The number of tests being done is not at all adequate. Given India’s population, we must do one million tests a day to diagnose and isolate the infected and it can be done only by making testing available on demand. Since rapid scale-up may not be possible using RT-PCR tests, antigen testing should be deployed at scale at point-of-care to increase community testing till the positivity rate falls below at least 2-3%,” said JVR Prasada Rao, former health secretary and a former UN special envoy for HIV/AIDS.Poonawalla echoed the suggestion: “The government has to allow testing for asymptomatic people also because that is the only way we’ll know how many cases there are. People may ask, ‘Will it create panic?’, but there is no panic in knowing cases. We have to worry about deaths and treat the sick early so that they don’t die. To do that, you need to isolate and treat people who tested positive.”China, which has 83,565 Covid-19 cases and a population comparable to India, has done 62,814 tests per million of its population , covering roughly 6% of its population. Its main strategy to stop infection has been focused mass testing and isolation in hard-hit cities and provinces, including Beijing, Mudanjiang city in Heilongjiang province, and Wuhan city in Hubei province.“Testing is the only way to diagnose an infected person and stop further transmission. I am alarmed at the mishandling of the pandemic. Where are the labs to test and give results within an acceptable time frame? I am told test samples are piled up in labs in Andhra Pradesh and delays are huge. If results come after five days, the infection has already spread, so a lot must go into the strategy besides numbers. They have messed it up in a big, big way,” said K Sujatha Rao, former health secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare.“An antigen test is helpful in diagnosing the infection, like the ELISA test for HIV, which can be sent for confirmation trough RT-PCR. So having a point-of-care test like the antigen test can help scale up, which is what is being done in some states now,” said Rao.Flattened peak Increased testing leads to an initial spike in cases, followed by a plateau and then a steady fall as the sick get isolated and their close contacts are quarantined. “Low testing leads to high positivity rate, which is an indicator for need to ramp up testing. Since the pandemic is spreading in multiple waves in India, the focus areas should be on increasing testing in hot spots and merging hot spots, such as Andhra and Karnataka. Infections are fortunately limited in India, so ramping up testing in affected areas to test everyone and their contacts will make a difference, as it has in Delhi, were the peak has plateaued considerably,” said CK Mishra, former secretary with the ministries of health and environment. With increased testing, positivity in Delhi fell from a weekly average peak of 30.4% in mid June to a weekly average of 10.4% on Tuesday. “Testing alone is not enough, the contacts must also be traced and quarantined to stop transmission,” added Mishra. That’s the second T and the I of the classic Test, Trace, Isolate, Treat approach. “The plateauing in Delhi indicates adequate testing and containment, and this will sustain for a while before the numbers gradually hopefully begin to fall in early to mid-August, provided there are no slip-ups,” said Randeep Guleria, director, All India of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi on Tuesday.  Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi, which together account for 60% cases in India, have per million testing numbers of 9,295, 18,185 and 33,178 respectively. Maharashtra has done the least tests, and has the highest positivity rate of 22%. Telangana, with second lowest testing after Bihar, has positivity rate of 27.6%, which is three times the average national positivity rate of 9.43%.Standardising numbersIndia now has 1,115 labs equipped and approved for testing for Covid-19, which include 793 in the government sector and 322 in the private sector. That apart, states have begun using antigen-based tests that give results at point of care within 30 minutes. But, increasing testing is not just about approving labs and kits, say experts.“It’s also about ensuring quality of test kits, logistics in terms of supply to states, standardization of the testing protocols, and setting a minimum range that ought to be done. For example, you can’t have arbitrariness, where Telangana has tested 3,284 per million while Delhi has done 33,000 per million. There is no clarity or uniformity of approach,” said Rao.Flattening the curve by testing even asymptomatic people can accelerate opening up with the new-normal safeguards like masks and social distancing. “How can governments, companies and economies open up if companies are not allowed to test its staff so that they feel and know they are in a safe environment? That can happen only with more testing,” said Poonawalla.“We we must test more and should not worry about having more cases. Epidemiologists predict up to 50% of the world’s population will have Covid over the next few years, but that’s nothing to worry about because a very, very, very small percentage of that will have critical illness,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/walk-ins-may-be-key-step-as-india-looks-to-step-up-testing/story-Ry8mD2mmmhaf5Enn58khFP.html
08-07-2020||India||Concerns over drugs: DCGI warns against overpricing, shortage||After receiving several complaints of drug shortages, India’s drugs controller on Tuesday directed state authorities to ensure there is no black marketing or over-pricing of the antiviral drug remdesivir that it has allowed under emergency use authorization for severely ill patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The drugs controller acted on a complaint by Local Circles, an independent community engagement and social media platform, which pointed to the problem of dugs shortage because of alleged black-marketing.In a letter to state drug controllers, Drugs Controller General of India VG Somani said: “… this office has received a letter from M/s Local Circles, through ministry of health, raising concerns regarding black marketing and over pricing of the drug Remdesivir by certain unscrupulous persons.”He added: “ In view of the above, you are requested to instruct your enforcement officials to keep strict vigil on the matter to prevent black-marketing and sale of the drug Remdesivir injection above maximum retail price.”The state drugs authorities have been asked to take strict action against people who are found to be fleecing patients, and to stop its sale immediately if anyone is found to be selling it above the maximum retail price.Over the past few days, people and hospitals have been finding it hard to procure the drug. “In our hospital we are well-stocked because we had procured it in bulk initially. However, the drug is in short supply in market and many hospitals have also approached us recently to buy some doses from us. The medicine is not sold in our Out Patient Department pharmacy but is given directly to admitted patients,” said a person in a prominent private hospital in Delhi, who did not wish to be named.On Monday, Sachin Taparia, chairman and CEO, Local Circles, wrote to the authorities, saying, “… over the last 72 hours, many posts and comments were received from citizens across India… about the black marketing of the drug Remdesivir.”The complaint said a vial that costs about Rs.5,500 was being sold for anywhere between ₹15,000 and 60,000. “…various medical shops have been telling buyers that the medicine is in short supply but can be made available if they are ready to pay a premium…,” he complained. On June 1, the central drugs controller had permitted US pharma company Gilead Sciences Inc., which has the patent for it, to import and market remdesivir in India under emergency use authorization. The emergency authorisation allows products to be used for treatment without full data on their safety and efficacy, which has to be still submitted as trials continue. Written informed consent needs to be taken from those to be given the medicine.The drugs controller has granted permission for manufacturing and sale of the drug to three Indian companies-- Cipla Limited, Hetero Drugs Limited, and Mylan Laboratories Limited so far.On June 14, the health ministry added the drug as part of investigational therapies given to severely ill Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerns-over-drugs-dcgi-warns-against-overpricing-shortage/story-if8P1qIH3dYXB9iw8p23pJ.html
08-07-2020||India||Villages in Odisha hit by superspreaders||As the total number of Covid-19 cases crossed 10,000 in Odisha on Tuesday with sample positivity rate going past 10, the role of super-spreaders has the state government concerned.On Tuesday, Sundargarh district reported 51 cases, of which 49 were infected by a 66-year-old auto driver who had returned from Jharkhand last month. Officials said the man with acute respiratory illness had arrived on June 16 and stayed at the Rourkela Steel Plant. Though he was supposed to be in home quarantine, he had met several people before he passed away on June 3.However, they did not share details as to how a man, who should have been in home quarantine, ended up being a super spreader that turned Rourkela into a Covid hot spot and containment area by July 9.In Bargarh, a 76-year-old retired teacher who was a money lender turned his village Katapali into a hot spot. He died of Covid-19 on June 18, but he had infected 105 persons by then. A diabetic, he was undergoing treatment at a private hospital when he tested positive on June 16.“He infected his wife, son and granddaughter. Others in the village might also have contracted the virus from him...The administration has appealed to the villagers of Katapali not to venture out of their houses and follow the guidelines,” said Bargarh district collector Jyotiranjan Pradhan.Like Katapali, in the southern district of Rayagada, a three-member family of migrant workers that returned from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu last month ended up infecting at least 90 people. The family -- a man, his wife and their daughter - had returned to their village Bijaypur and had stayed in institutional-quarantine for 14 days. During their home quarantine for seven days, the family allegedly did not adhere to prescribed norms and came in contact with several people in the village. “Rayagada did not have any Covid cases for a long time, and then iit had 90,” said Rayagada district collector Pramod Kumar Behera.In Hatisalapada village of Baolangir, at least 39 positive cases have been detected so far after a couple of migrant workers flouted home quarantine guidelines. “As they went around meeting people, the infection spread. We were forced to announce the area as a containment zone,” said Bolangir district collector Arindam Dakua.Similarly, in western Odisha district of Jharsuguda district, a super-spreader family returning from Gurugram ended up infecting 17 persons through birthday and wedding parties and turned the Brajarajnagar OMP area into a hot spot, said district collector Saroj Samal.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said Odisha would follow a decentralised Covid-management strategy based on the suggestions received from district collectors, SPs and others. “At present, different departments, district administrators and senior officials of the government have been entrusted with specific responsibilities towards the management of Covid-19 in the state. We will take random feedback on special parameters from those admitted in Covid Care Centres and Covid hospitals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villages-in-odisha-hit-by-superspreaders/story-CzUQoo2nLGrEGEkjXIMBFM.html
08-07-2020||India||MPs demand online House panel meeting||Days before a parliamentary panel is due to discuss India’s preparedness to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic and similar outbreaks likely in the future, lawmakers have renewed demands for meeting online without being physically present.Science and technology committee chairman Jairam Ramesh, who will head the discussions, has written to Rajya Sabha chairman N. Venkaiah Naidu seeking his approval for panel members to meet online.“Many members of the committee have expressed their inability to attend this meeting because of travel restrictions, quarantine and other constrains. I am doubtful if we can muster up a quorum,” Ramesh wrote and reminded him on Twitter, “Where there is will, there is skill!”Parliament authorities have spent long hours to work out how to conduct such meetings online, but to no avail, as depositions and discussions are wrapped in layers of secrecy. Lawmakers say that just approval from Naidu and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla is required for respective panels under the two Houses to take the process online amid the pandemic.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MP Dayanidhi Maran too wrote to Anand Sharma, chairman of the panel on home affairs, making a similar request.“With different states having different guidelines and travel advisories, quarantine regulations, standard operating procedures on entry/return, it becomes very complicated for members to attend the committee meetings,” he wrote to Sharma.He expressed concern that to Delhi would mean “exposing myself to the Covid virus” and how it would severely affect his parliamentary duties in his constituency.His party colleague Tiruchi Siva has written to civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri, asking him to ensure that airlines keep the middle seats empty to avoid contact between passengers. Airports are maintaining “and implementing with seriousness and sincerity all hygienic precautions like thermal scanning, sanitizing and maintaining social distance of passengers till boarding,” yet “many flights are flying with full capacity leaving not enough required space between adjacent passengers,” he wrote.He expressed concern that during air travel to Delhi from Chennai, which takes up to three hours, an asymptomatic passenger may be on the flight, leaving open the chance for “the spread of the virus easily and faster” onboard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-demand-online-house-panel-meeting/story-m56I3n6UXkkpuXBKsLyYdN.html
08-07-2020||India||Karnataka, Telangana could be country’s new Covid-19 hotspots||Telangana and Karnataka seem set to become the next hotspots in the country, with the highest growth rate of cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and high positivity rates, according to HT’s analysis. Three factors — high growth rate of cases, high positivity rate, and at least one large urban centre which sees a significant concentration of cases — are common to Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi, the clear hotspots in the country so far, accounting for nearly 60% of all Covid-19 cases. HT analysed data from the 20 worst-hit states in the country on these three parameters to identify regions that are exhibiting signs that they may become the next Covid-19 hotspots.A handful of states come into focus — Telangana, Karnataka, Gujarat, Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Among them, Telangana and Karnataka stand out.TELANGANAWith 25,733 Covid-19 cases as of Tuesday, Telangana is the sixth worst-hit state in the country after Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.Over the past two weeks, the state has seen one of the fastest growing outbreaks in the country. Telangana reported 1,219 new cases every day on average over the last two weeks. In the two weeks before that, this number was just 352. This increase in new cases is reflected in the state’s doubling rate, which is defined as the average period it takes for a twofold rise, of 9.5 days — the second worst in the country after Karnataka (Chart 1). In fact, cases in the state are growing twice the rate they are across India (doubling rate of 20.4 days). The state also fares the worst in the country in terms of the percentage of tests coming back positive with a positivity rate of 27.6%. This is nearly three times the national average in the same period — 9.8%. All positivity rates cited here are trailing averages for the week.The positivity rate is particularly significant keeping in mind that the state has the second-worst testing rate in the country. It has tested only 3,284 samples for every million residents against the national average of 7,661. Only Bihar, with 2,210 tests per million, has fared worse (Chart 2).With 20,535 Covid-19 cases and 1,419 deaths, Hyderabad has been the clear epicentre of the outbreak in the state (Chart 3A). The city is responsible for four out of every five cases reported across Telangana. Nearly 70% of all cases in Hyderabad have been reported in just the last two weeks, a statistic that highlights the abrupt rise in cases. KARNATAKAKarnataka has reported the fastest growth of cases in the country right now, and with 25,317 confirmed cases as of Tuesday, it is as the seventh worst-hit state in the country in terms of total cases. The state has a doubling rate of 8.5 days — the worst among the states analysed (Chart 1). Cases in the state have seen a massive spike particularly over the past 10 days. In the last two weeks, Karnataka reported 1,137 new cases every day as opposed to just 260 in the two weeks before that.While Telangana has the highest positivity rate in the country, it is followed by Maharashtra (22%), Tamil Nadu (12%), Delhi (11%) and Gujarat (9.7). Karnataka is on the fifth spot with a positivity rate of 9.4%. With 10,978 tests conducted for every million residents, the state has fared much better than the national average of 7,661 tests per million (Chart 2).But with 10,561 total Covid-19 cases till Tuesday, Bengaluru remains responsible for two out of every five cases in Karnataka (Chart 3B). It is by far the biggest epicentre in the state with Kalburgi on the second spot with one-tenth the caseload of Bengaluru — 1,699 cases.OTHER KEY FINDINGSCases in Assam and Andhra Pradesh are growing significantly faster than the national average. To be sure, the two states have performed relatively well in terms of testing. Andhra Pradesh has conducted 19,798 tests per million while Assam has, 13,741, both significantly above the national average. The two states also have a low positivity rate — Andhra Pradesh has a rate of 4.3% and Assam 6.5%.Though the doubling rate in Gujarat (fourth highest cases in the country) is more than 35 days, the high positivity rate in the state (9.7%) remains a cause of concern. This is particularly important if we take into account the relatively low number (7,100 tests a day over the past week, compared to 33,000 in Tamil Nadu, 27,000 in Maharashtra and 20,000 in Delhi in the same time period) of daily tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/k-taka-t-gana-could-be-country-s-new-hot-spots/story-4jfH1xpKMBuZXCh3RhUHyL.html
08-07-2020||India||Rahul slams Centre over LAC stand-off||New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday sought to corner the government over the India-China de-escalation in Ladakh, asking why status quo ante was not insisted upon and why territorial sovereignty of the Galwan Valley does not find mention in the foreign ministry’s statement.“National interest is paramount. Government of India’s duty is to protect it. Then, why has Status Quo Ante not been insisted on? Why is China allowed to justify the murder of 20 unarmed jawans in our territory? Why is there no mention of the territorial sovereignty of Galwan valley?” he asked in tweet.Gandhi has been critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government on the India-China border standoff, and his twitter attack escalated after 20 Indian soldiers died in clashes with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on June 15.While the Congress has been asking the government to be transparent on transgressions by China, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has accused the opposition party of politicising the issue and demoralising the armed forces.Gandhi’s tweet came a day after India and China started disengagement process in the Galwan Valley.He shared the statements put out by the Indian and Chinese foreign ministries after the talks between China’s foreign minister Wang Yi and National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval.Gandhi highlighted how the Chinese foreign ministry in its statement made a mention of the Galwan Valley, but the Indian side did not do so.Doval and Wang, who are special representatives for boundary talks between the two countries, held a telephonic conversation on Sunday during which they agreed on an expeditious withdrawal of troops. The two also said that a complete disengagement at the earliest was necessary for full restoration of peace in border areas and both sides should not allow differences to become disputes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-slams-centre-over-lac-stand-off/story-m58hLxVIuytK5ILzYLedBI.html

08-07-2020||India||Kerala CM’s principal secretary shifted over ‘fraud’||Seven years after a Kerala chief minister’s office was roiled by a fraud in which one of the main accused was a well-connected woman, the current chief minister’s office has been embroiled in a similar case. Swapna Suresh, a senior information technology consultant to the Kerala government was fired on Monday, a day after her role in the smuggling of gold through diplomatic channels came to light with the seizure of 30 kg of gold from the UAE, ostensibly being sent to its consulate in the state capital. Suresh, whose work experience includes stints at the UAE consulate, Air India, and the UAE airport, is fluent in Arabic, and has connections in high places, is allegedly the brain behind the scheme, and is on the run.An embrassed chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan transferred his principal secretary M Sivasankar, who was close to Suresh. “The CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar has been transferred with immediate effect and his charge has been entrusted with Mir Mohammad IAS,” a brief statement from the CM’s office said.In 2013, then CM Oomen Chandy’s office was similarly embarrassed in the so-called solar fraud; back then, it was a woman named Saritha Nair who was one of the main perpetrators of the fraud and it was alleged that she was connected with people in the CMO. On Tuesday, opposition parties sought a central agency probe into the gold smuggling incident. They said the CM was aware of Suresh’s appointment and that she was given key responsibilities. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala of the Congress wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the case.But the CM played down the controversy. “She was hired by a placement agency. And (the) customs (department) also made it clear nobody called from the CM’s office to bail her out. Some people are creating a smoke screen to portray the government in bad light,” he said. The customs department seized gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates to the country’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday after securing permission from the ministry of external affairs. Suresh, who was working as the operational manager of Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT Ministry, went into hiding after the seizure, following which the customs department raided her flat in the state capital. Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the consulate, was arrested by customs. After his arrest, he reportedly disclosed the role of Suresh. A statement issued by the UAE embassy said the mission in Thiruvananthapuram and its diplomatic staff had no role in the matter. The statement said the embassy “condemns the attempted misuse of diplomatic channels by an individual engaged in smuggling activity” and “firmly rejected such acts”.“The UAE looks forward to fully cooperating with Indian customs authorities to thoroughly investigate this matter and urges stringent legal action against those involved,” the statement added.People familiar with developments, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the diplomatic bag apparently had the required authorisation, including documentation regarding its contents and a tamper-proof seal.Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, authorities in the receiving state cannot open a diplomatic bag even if they have suspicions about its contents. The bag can only be opened in the presence of officials or diplomats of the sending state. This was done in the case of the UAE’s diplomatic bag after receiving the required permission, the people said.Media reports suggest that the customs department was on he lookout after a gang arrested for allegedly trying to extort money from a popular actress spoke of a a gold smuggling operation in which a well-connected woman was involved. Hindustan Times couldn’t immediately ascertain whether Suresh and Sarith had used the diplomatic bag to smuggle gold previously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-s-principal-secy-shifted-over-fraud/story-IOYiTmY1CsC61FeSq1XZ8N.html
08-07-2020||India||Rajnath Singh reviews ongoing infra projects along border regions||New Delhi: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday carried out an extensive review of India’s ongoing infrastructure projects in border areas, including the Ladakh sector, where military tensions between India and China have surged during the last two months.“The state of forward connectivity was reviewed and the consistent need of boosting the ongoing projects and to expedite the construction of strategic roads, bridges and tunnels in the border areas was discussed,” the defence ministry said in a statement.Some of these strategic roads and bridges, being constructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), are coming up along the country’s border with China and are scattered across Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.India is working on two key roads near the China border in eastern Ladakh to provide connectivity to an important forward area that the military calls Sub-Sector North (SSN), as reported by Hindustan Times on June 9.The first is the strategic Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi road that provides connectivity to the country’s northern-most outpost, Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO). The second road being built from Sasoma to Saser La could eventually provide an alternative route to DBO near the Karakoram pass.The ministry said that swift snow clearance works by BRO “ensured rapid and early movement of troops and logistics to forward areas.” It executed such works on 149 roads (a total length of 3,965 kilometres) in Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.“The BRO has worked incessantly even during the restrictions imposed due to Covid-19 without affecting the progress of various projects. Despite unprecedented snowfall breaking a 60-year record, all strategic passes and roads were cleared this year for traffic about one month before their average yearly opening dates,” the statement said. The BRO has executed 30% more works in the financial year 2019-20 as compared to 2018-19, it added, highlighting how India’s focus on border projects continues to grow.Trials have also been carried out successfully for indigenously produced modular bridges in collaboration with Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Limited under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative. “This will revolutionize the bridge-laying capabilities in forward areas,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-reviews-ongoing-infra-projects-along-border-regionsheadline/story-02Z0SUqXy4zS1OlCLHyekL.html
08-07-2020||India||LAC stand-off figures in India-US talks||The India-China border standoff figured in the India-US foreign office consultations on Tuesday, people familiar with developments said, with the two sides agreeing to work closely on all challenges and to support each other’s objectives.The US decision not to allow foreign students to remain in the country if all their classes are moved online because of the Covid-19 crisis, which is expected to affect tens of thousands of Indians, also figured in the virtual meeting and the American side said it would try to mitigate the impact, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to work for a free and open Indo-Pacific, and agreed to strengthen their health partnership, including work on pharmaceuticals and vaccine development against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic.The statements issued by both sides after the virtual foreign office consultations between foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and US under secretary of state for political affairs David Hale made no mention of the border standoff or China, though the people cited above pointed to several references in the readouts that were an apparent reference to Beijing’s role in the region.The Indian readout said Shringla and Hale exchanged views on a “number of regional and global issues of shared interest”, while the US statement said they “agreed to consult closely on all challenges and endeavour to support each other’s objectives”.The US statement added the discussions “included ongoing threats to the rules-based international order” and that the two sides will remain in “close contact on regional and international issues of mutual concern”.The consultations were held against the backdrop of India and China agreeing on some de-escalation and disengagement measures at key friction points in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control over the weekend. The steps were aimed at easing tensions created by the two-month standoff and a violent clash on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and caused unspecified Chinese casualties.The US is one of the global partners that India has briefed about the standoff and American officials have spoken of the threat posed by China and its provocations and disturbing behaviour.On Monday, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said in an interview that the US is “not going to stand by and let China...take the reins in terms of being the most powerful, dominant force, whether it’s in that region or over here”.Meadows added, “Our military might stands strong and will continue to stand strong, whether it’s in relationship to a conflict between India and China or anywhere else.”During Tuesday’s consultations, the Indian side raised the decision by US immigration authorities not to allow non-immigrant students on F-1 and M-1 visas attending schools operating entirely online to remain in the country.One of the people cited above said, “The US side took note [of the issue] and said they will keep the best interests of students in mind and will try and mitigate the impact. Detailed implementation guidelines for the measure are yet to come out.”A growing number of US universities are shifting their classes online because of the pandemic and tens of thousands of Indian students face the possibility of losing their valid immigration status. India is second only to China as a source of foreign students in the US and some 200,000 Indian students are currently enrolled in American educational institutions.The two sides “reaffirmed their commitment to work towards ensuring a free, open, inclusive, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific” and also agreed to deepen cooperation in the United Nations, especially during India’s membership of the Security Council for 2021-22, the Indian readout said.The US statement said Hale and Shringla “affirmed the US and Indian visions of a free and open Indo-Pacific” and agreed to work with other partners in the region to “bring these visions to reality”.The two sides discussed ways to enhance mutually beneficial trade and people-to-people ties, including through visa facilitation for students and professionals. They also discussed cooperation on a range of international issues and developed concrete steps to strengthen the bilateral comprehensive global strategic partnership, the US readout said without giving details.Both sides further agreed to move forward the bilateral agenda through a range of mechanisms such as the 2+2 ministerial dialogue that India will host this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-stand-off-figures-in-india-us-talks/story-UMcStKp0gQZVIBIPCDSD1J.html
08-07-2020||India||Only way to stand up to Beijing is to impose costs: US||The United States has taken note of the de-escalation efforts at the India-China border, but remains leery of China’s “aggressive behavior” against minorities at home, neighbours in the region and in cyberspace generally, it said, adding that “imposing costs” on Beijing was the only way to stop it.There has been a calibrated sharpening of US remarks on the India-China conflict, with the White House setting the tone last week when the spokesperson said President Donald Trump believed that China’s “aggressive stance” on the border with India fit a pattern of “Chinese aggression” around the world.The US state department took much the same line on Monday shortly after news broke of the Chinese moving troops back from Patrolling Point 14, site of deadly clashes last month in which 20 Indian and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops were killed on June 15.A state department spokesperson told Hindustan Times the United States supported a peaceful resolution of the situation, as stated many times before, but, as secretary of state Mike Pompeo has said on many occasions, “what is so disturbing is the emergence of a clear pattern of Beijing acting increasingly aggressively, both domestically and abroad”.From the Taiwan Strait to Xinjiang, from the South China Sea to the Himalayas, from cyberspace to international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the spokesperson said “we are dealing with a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that seeks to repress its own people and bully its neighbors”.The official added: “The only way to stop these provocations is by standing up to Beijing and imposing costs on its bad behavior.”It was not immediately clear if the “standing up to Beijing” and “costs” were a reference to the Indian ban on 59 mainly Chinese mobile phone apps that secretary Pompeo welcomed last week. Backing the ban, he had said these apps could sometimes “serve as appendages of the CCP’s surveillance state”“India’s Clean App approach will boost India’s sovereignty,” he had added.The spokesperson did not explain the “costs”, but in recent days, the United States has announced the end of export of controlled defence equipment to Hong Kong over the new Chinese national security law that western powers have said is violative of China’s international commitments. And Trump has signed into law a bill that sought to impose sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the repression of Uighur minorities.The president and allies in Congress have also talked about holding China accountable for the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by billing it for the damages caused to the US economy.Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri state, moved a resolution in March that sought to hold China “accountable” for the pandemic and “design a mechanism for delivering compensation from the Government of the People’s Republic of China to all affected nations for the harm caused by its decision to hide the emergence and spread of COVID–19 during the initial weeks of the outbreak”.Missouri has already filed a lawsuit against China for damages.Support for India in its recent border confrontation with China has been growing. In a TV interview recently, a Republican senator who is a close ally of President Trump denounced China’s aggression on the border with India to illustrate the growing threat the Asian giant poses to the United States and its allies and partners around the world. “The Chinese Communist Party is certainly using the pandemic to try to assert claims and take very aggressive action against almost all of its neighbors,” Tom Cotton had said, adding, “high up in the Himalayas, China has essentially invaded India, an ally of ours. And they have killed 20 Indian soldiers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-way-to-stand-up-to-beijing-is-to-impose-costs-us/story-y1Fcpb37mRSetmKfgZNukI.html
08-07-2020||India||Indian patrol rights in focus amid LAC disengagement||As a part of the disengagement process, agreed upon by both the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), a 4km buffer zone is being created at key friction points in eastern Ladakh, according to officials involved in the decision-making process. For a period of three to four weeks, there will be no patrolling by either of the armies in these buffer zones, said one of the officials.Experts have said this halt in Indian patrolling — a result of Chinese transgressions and now extended temporarily within the framework of the understanding — in areas where it used to patrol before the Chinese build-up and incursion, is meant to avoid a face-off between soldiers and smoothen the process of both disengagement and de-escalation.But it has also given rise to concerns about whether India will be able to return to patrolling up to points it used to early April; whether a “new status quo” is getting institutionalised, and whether this will impact India’s territorial claims.Strategic analyst Brahma Chellaney said that mutual troop withdrawal from areas India normally patrolled, as well as the setting up of buffer zones, creates a “new status quo, even if a temporary one”.“However, since this new status quo suits China, it could seek to enforce it indefinitely until a settlement is reached, thus depriving India of its patrolling rights. This is a risk,” he said.Till the current tensions started in early May, the Indian Army patrolled right up to its definition of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) — marked either by geographical features or so-called Patrolling Points (in the absence of natural features) scattered across the contested border. Chinese soldiers, too, patrolled up to China’s perception of where its territory lies. This resulted in transgressions by the armies into what both sides consider their area. But this did not involve areas that have traditionally not been disputed, including Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra as there was a somewhat common perception of the LAC. Former Northern Army commander, Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), said, “There has been no dispute about the alignment of the LAC in the three sectors.” This got reflected in patrolling patterns. For instance, in Pangong-Tso, before the PLA occupied vantage positions on Finger Four in early May, Indian Army soldiers would patrol right up to Finger Eight, which New Delhi considers to be its territory, said multiple serving and retired army officers who know the region. Fingers Four and Eight are 8km apart.But what changed between April-May and now is that the new Chinese positions have restricted the scope of Indian patrols in these areas. The Chinese build-up in the Depsang sector, too, has brought Indian patrolling activity under pressure there.The buffer zones now being created as part of the disengagement process will restrict the scope of the Indian Army patrolling up to PP-14 (Galwan Valley), PP-15 (Hot Springs) and PP-17 (Gogra) temporarily. The ongoing disengagement effort between rival troops is expected to be replicated in Pangang Tso, where the withdrawal of Chinese troops from the Finger Area -- a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range that overlooks the lake -- is a top concern for the Indian Army. The PLA has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes, tented camps and observation posts (confirmed by satellite imagery) between Fingers Four and Eight, and getting it to pull down those structures and move back to its original positions at Finger Eight will be the toughest part of the disengagement process, officials said.A minor thinning of PLA soldiers was noticed at Finger 4 on Monday but the army doesn’t count it as any form of withdrawal. Hooda said the focus would shift to the Finger Area after step-wise disengagement in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra.Commodore (retired) C Uday Bhaskar, director of the Society for Policy Studies, too expressed concerns about the current framework. The new patrolling protocols and the creation of buffer zones is a “new and slippery formulation”, he said. “Since 1993, India and China were operating within the track of an LAC — with each side having their own version — and a claim line up to which patrolling was carried out periodically. In creating a buffer zone and agreeing to no patrolling, the possibility of new pockets of no-man’s land increases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-patrol-rights-in-focus-amid-lac-disengagement/story-GQeZLLM5dW1NvGCY5bLNWK.html
08-07-2020||India||‘5.03 lakh stranded Indians brought back through Vande Bharat Mission’||The Centre on Tuesday informed the Madras High Court that 5,03,990 lakh Indians stranded in 137 countries have been brought back to the country through Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) in less than two months. Tamil Nadu is the fourth state that received a large number of its residents through the mission, it said. “Kerala received the largest number of stranded Indians (94,085), followed by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, Additional Solicitor General of India R Sankaranarayanan said. The largest number of stranded Indians returned by VBM flights are from UAE (57,305), followed by Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and USA. From Nepal 91,193 people returned through land border check posts, he added. In the fourth phase of the mission 218 more flights are scheduled to India from various countries, of which more than 25 will be landing in Tamil Nadu, he said. Sankaranarayanan made the submissions in response to the PIL moved by DMK, alleging that the Tamil Nadu government was refusing clearance to such mission flights in the state. When the plea came up for hearing,senior counsel P Wilson submitted that earlier the problem was of the state government refusing clearance. Now since the state has made it clear that it has no objection to such flights, the Centre has to find a solution to bring back 25,939 residents of the state, who are still stuck in various countries, he said. “We will require at least 146 more flights for the 25,939 to return to India,” Wilson said. Moreover, such stranded persons who need financial assistance must be provided such help from the funds available in the Indian Community Welfare Funds, which has so far not been provided, he said. To this Sankaranarayanan said less number of flights to Tamil Nadu does not mean that residents of the state are not retuning. Such flights do not necessarily land in Tamil Nadu. They are landing in different states and are then travelling back to the state, he said. Recording the submissions, a division bench of Justice M M Sundresh and Justice R Hemalatha directed the centre to get instructions as to the plan for return of 25,939 residents of the state and inform the court by July 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-03-lakh-stranded-indians-brought-back-through-vande-bharat-mission/story-VMMecpOrb600m8dUj5ghBI.html

During the all- party meeting with the PM, I had said the (present) issue needs to be solved through diplomatic channels and we need to create international pressure on China,” he said.“I read in newspapers that following dialogue through diplomatic channels, soldiers from both sides were pulled back. If it is so, then it is good,” Pawar added.To a question about Modi’s visit to Ladakh after the clashes between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Galwan valley, Pawar said that in 1962, China defeated India in war. “But (then prime minister) Nehru had gone there. Even Yashwantrao Chavan, who was defence minister, too had gone to the China border and boosted the morale of the forces.“When there is a conflict situation between two nations and forces are involved, the country’s leadership has to ensure that the morale of the forces is boosted. I am not surprised that he (Modi) went there,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-recalls-visits-by-nehru-chavan-to-border-post-1962-war/story-XxQZJrjbLj4ShtF9svh9iM.html
08-07-2020||India||CBSE cuts syllabus to cover academic losses||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Tuesday announced that it has rationalised by almost a third, the syllabuses of classes 9 to 12 , to make up for the academic loss that happened due to the Covid-enforced shutdown. The Union human resource development (HRD) ministry asked the board to revise the curriculum.HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ Tuesday made the announcement on Twitter saying. “Looking at the extraordinary situation prevailing in the country and the world, CBSE was advised to revise the curriculum and reduce the course load for the students of classes 9 to 12. Considering the importance of learning achievement, it has been decided to rationalise syllabus up to 30% by retaining the core concepts.”Another board, the Council for the Indian Schools Certificate Examination revised its syllabus for the same classes last week, but only marginally. Pokhriyal said that the ministry received 1,500 suggestions from educationists on the reduction of syllabus for students for the academic session 2020-21. “The changes made in the syllabi have been finalised by the respective Course Committees with the approval of the Curriculum Committee and Governing Body of the Board,” the HRD ministry said in a statement. Schools across the country have been physically shut since March in view of the lockdown enforced to contain the Covid-19 pandemic and classes have moved online. According to the guidelines issued on easing on the lockdown by the ministry of home affairs, schools will continue to remain closed physically till July 31, although it is very likely that this will be extended. In a statement issued on Tuesday, CBSE’s Director (Academics) Joseph Emmanuel said, “The Heads of Schools and teachers may ensure that the topics that have been reduced are also explained to the students to the extent required to connect different topics.”Both principals and teachers said that it is a relief for them to have a revised curriculum from the CBSE. Amita Wattal, principal of Springdales School in Pusa Road, said, “Finally, the schools have something concrete to focus on. The schools were waiting for the revised syllabus from the CBSE. However, it will take some time to analyse and see what has been kept and what has been removed from the curriculum.”Ashima Aggarwal, a chemistry teacher at Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said: “Syllabus reduction in class 11 and 12 is appropriate and as per the requirement. All important topics which are required for building the basics of chemistry are still present in the syllabus. The topics reduced are not asked frequently in the competitive exams.”Tania Joshi, principal of Indian School, said that the reduction in curriculum was necessary. “It’s really a relief for the children specially for those in board classes. There was a lot of apprehension among students and parents about the curriculum.”Tanvir Aeijaz, an associate professor of Political Science at Delhi University’s Ramjas College, said that the CBSE could have compressed some important topics like citizenship, federalism and secularism instead of deleting them completely. “Removing topics does not do any good to the knowledge of students.They could have compressed the topics and at least introduced them in the syllabus. There is a connection between school education and higher education. Deletion of topics denies students their right to pick their future choice and limits their knowledge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-cuts-syllabus-to-cover-academic-losses/story-Ao5JUpxkMoKockimsSshcO.html
08-07-2020||Editorials||Setting an August 15 target | HT Editorial||There is both good and bad news on the Covid-19 front. The bad news is that new hotspots are emerging, once again showing that there is no room for complacency, and India’s size and heterogeneity means that success in one state in reducing the growth rate of cases, positivity rate, and the fatality rate can co-exist with an increase in the same parameters in another state. As this newspaper reported on Wednesday, Telangana and Karnataka have now emerged as key areas of concern. Karnataka’s doubling rate is 8.5 days (which means cases are doubling in the shortest period of time in any state) and Telangana’s doubling rate is 9.5 days — when the national average is 20.4 days. Telangana’s positivity rate is 27.6% (which means that out of 100 tests, over 27 are being tested positive), even as the national average is 9.8%. The good news comes from Mumbai, which has finally allowed walk-in testing. Testing protocols have evolved over the last three months, but it has remained contingent on getting a doctor’s prescription. This has constrained the ability of many to get tested, even though it is now universally and scientifically proven that testing, and more testing, is the only way to trace the infected, isolate and treat them, and ensure that the chain of transmission is broken. India’s testing rate has improved — but remains abysmally low at 0.8% of the population (7,661 tests per million people), compared to the United States which has tested 11% of its population or Russia which has tested 16% or China which has tested 6% of its population. Mumbai finally offers a model where anyone who wishes to get tested can do so. There is no way to offset the bad news — the emergence of new hotspots and the continued spread of the infection — without building on the good news — ramping up testing while easing testing protocols. A regular column on Covid-19 in this newspaper, on Tuesday, offered a target — 50 million tests by August 15. India has already done over 10 million tests, but to achieve this target, it will mean a little over a million tests every day. Ensure that testing infrastructure — through both RT-PCR tests and rapid antigen tests — is adequate, and relax requirements to get tested. Instead of setting up artificial and unattainable targets for vaccine development, the Centre would do well to have a new testing target. This will be the most productive Independence Day gift in times of a pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/setting-an-august-15-target/story-dgQazNQKwue9aVC570uDgJ.html
08-07-2020||Editorials||CBSE’s decision to rationalise syllabus is welcome | HT Editorial||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)’s decision, on Tuesday, to rationalise 30% of the syllabus for classes nine to 12 is welcome. Directed by the Union ministry of human resource development (HRD), this move is on account of the Covid-19-induced lockdown that forced schools to shut and shift classes online. The pandemic forced rigid educational institutions to adapt rapidly, to precarious circumstances. It pulled students out of schools for extended periods (schools will not open before July 31). It created a learning imbalance, as students have unequal access to online learning. CBSE’s move will lift a burden off the shoulders of students and teachers in the immediate term, allowing them to pay more attention on the quality of learning, rather than the quantum of course work. It will also ease the strain on teachers who have been scrambling to ensure course completion, exam schedules and virtual class attendance. Other boards must now follow suit and reduce the syllabus too. However, CBSE has either entirely deleted chapters or removed some topics such as democratic rights, federalism, citizenship, gender, religion, nationalism, and secularism from the curriculum. These issues form the bedrock of democratic societies and students need to learn about these. To be sure, these deletions are a part of an overall reduction in the syllabus and to suggest that there is a political subtext to it would be a leap without full evidence. But, perhaps, a condensed version on critical themes can be formulated to ensure that students pick up the basics, without getting overburdened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/cbse-s-decision-to-rationalise-syllabus-is-welcome/story-NoWVdTAOfk67Pe5NfYqJ9K.html
