The Union minister of human resource development (HRD), Ramesh Pokhriyal, tweeted the guidelines that recommend that students in non-terminal semesters should be promoted to the next semester based on internal assessments and their previous performance. But those in final semesters will receive their degrees only after appearing for online or in-person written exams. The Centre’s and UGC’s decision has led to disillusionment and resentment among students. The decision is regressive; it exposes the deep-rooted conservatism and orthodoxy of India’s education administrators and their apathy to the problems young people face. The recommendations have come amid forceful opposition by student bodies across the country. The disruption caused by Covid-19 has united a cross-section of students who are demanding that the proposed final semester exams be cancelled. Classes have been suspended, study materials have been inaccessible, and e-learning is still nascent. If students have not received a normal education this semester, what are they being tested on? The government’s justification is that degrees cannot be handed out without conducting “final” assessments of students. But India’s universities do not have final exams. The semester system replaced the annual system and each semester is an equal and independent unit. If the public health crisis justifies promoting second-semester students to the third semester without their being asked to take a traditional written exam, the same must apply to a final semester student. Why are they being held to a different standard? It is not set in stone that degrees may be awarded to students only when they clear a written exam. This is an archaic and orthodox approach. Some of the finest universities around the world award degrees to their students after conducting rigorous internal assessments -- assignments, term papers, theses, and even open book exams are legitimate tests of calibre. On the contrary, the assessments used in Indian colleges perpetuate a rote-learning based education that is far from perfect. In the face of the Covid-19 challenge, some universities have innovated: The Ambedkar University conducted its evaluation through internal assessments. The National Law University, Delhi, has combined internal assessments and online open-book exams, but with 48 hours being allowed for submissions, unlike the three hours that Delhi University is giving its students. The Centre is being unnfair towards students by excluding their opinion. Students have made their voices heard on social media; some have even gone to court to challenge the government’s decision. Students are key stakeholders of this system and must be treated as such. After Delhi University’s online mock tests this week were marred by several glitches, the administration denied any problems with their online testing infrastructure and blamed the poor Internet connectivity of the students. Even if that were the case, clearly the system is not ready. We are in the middle of a pandemic that has thrown the world off course. The economy is comatose and a disproportionate number of fresh graduates are going to remain unemployed for the foreseeable future. This is already causing tremendous anxiety. The added stress and toll of full-fledged exams are unnecessary and avoidable. Puritanical standards of what it takes to be a graduate in India must be substituted by a more humane and rational approach in the current circumstances.Akshay Marathe is spokesperson, Aam Aadmi Party, and a final-year law student at Delhi University Thew views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/full-fledged-college-and-university-exams-are-unnecessary-and-avoidable/story-Vk6tPnUBiFLRSAJv0K3ivN.html
07-07-2020||News||What the pandemic has taught us | Opinion||The Covid-19 pandemic has taught India several painful lessons. The first is that we can no longer continue with the ruthless exploitation of nature. The climate crisis, erratic weather phenomena, pollution of air, land and ocean have pushed the country, and the world, to a dangerous brink. Unless this is reversed immediately, we are in for serious trouble by the end of the century. It is extraordinary that the lockdown period has led to nature regenerating. We saw blue skies again after many decades, pollution levels dropped, and several species of animals, birds and insects staged a comeback. We must try and ensure that these positive developments are sustained so that we do not revert to the old normal, but adopt a new normal vis-à-vis nature. The second lesson is that India needs a drastic restructuring of its developmental plans which involves allocating at least 3% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each to health and education. If the country does not strengthen these sectors, all plans of becoming a world-class power are doomed to fail. It has been a national failure that we have not done so since Independence. It is also clear that in a vast federal country such as India, a crisis like this demands close cooperation between the Centre and the states, regardless of which political party is in power. Health is a state subject, and in the final analysis, it is the states and the Union territories that have to deal with the crisis on the ground. This is an area where cooperative federalism rather than confrontational federalism is required. Third, despite efforts of leaders such as the United States (US) President Donald Trump to trash the concept of globalisation, the fact remains that international collaboration in crises like this is essential. This applies to the quest for a vaccine as well as the availability of medicines and personal protective equipment. As our ancient concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) tells us, in the final analysis, no nation, howsoever great, can be an island unto itself. The human race will ultimately sink or swim together. We have some of the best scientists and researchers in the world, and several of India’s laboratories are working overtime to find a vaccine against the coronavirus. Here again, cooperation with the laboratories in other countries will be of great value. I led the Indian delegation to the World Health Organization (WHO) general conference on several occasions as health minister. In its building in Geneva, there is a beautiful Nataraja image that I presented to the then director-general Dr H Mahler when he visited Delhi to celebrate the eradication of smallpox worldwide. Despite WHO coming in for criticism recently, I feel we must continue to cooperate with it fully and take advantage of its organisational expertise.The fourth lesson is that the intolerable sufferings of millions of migrant workers due to the sudden lockdown, and the lack of preparedness for their welfare, will remain a matter of deep shame to the nation. This teaches us that there has to be a safety net for the most vulnerable sections of society — the one-quarter of India’s population that still lives below the poverty line. Apart from other measures, an assured minimum income credited directly into their accounts is the only way to achieve this. This is the least that India can do as a nation. This can be achieved with the restructuring of India’s financial planning and reorienting its monetary policy. Fifth, the virus has forced us to revisit family relationships and to extend support and affection, particularly to the elderly. Reports of increased domestic violence during the lockdown are disturbing. This is the opposite of what is needed. Existing laws need to be strictly enforced because any improper behaviour towards women, children or the elderly is unacceptable and against the tenets of Indian culture. The Covid-19 crisis has also impelled us to change personal lifestyles in a manner that unnecessary expenditure on luxury items has been minimised. That some of us can afford to spend on these is no justification for avoidable expenditure. The vulgar and grossly over-the-top engagement and wedding ceremonies, along with hugely wasteful banquets and receptions, should be restricted by law by designating a limited guest list, say, 50 people. With millions not getting one square meal a day, it is nothing short of criminal to waste so much money on so few. Finally, the virus has taught us the benefits of silence and solitude so that we can look into ourselves and explore the deeper recesses of our consciousness. We are so involved in superficial activities that we seldom get time to look within. In the ultimate analysis, it is our inner consciousness that will express itself in our actions and relationships. If we can find deep within ourselves the divine light that is the core of our beings, this will uplift not only each individual but society at large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-the-pandemic-has-taught-us-opinion/story-WQGz3IAvJ1Q0CQEdV0yAWL.html
07-07-2020||Chandigarh||HC restrains Haryana from effecting promotion of principals||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday restrained the Haryana government from effecting promotion of teachers to the posts of principal. The high court bench of Justice AG Masih said that promotion, if any, without reframing of the seniority list as per the Supreme Court direction would be subject to the outcome of the present case. It also directed that further promotion be not made till reframing of the such seniority list in case the factual position is as projected by the petitioners.The three promotions effected in January and February this year were challenged by 10 teachers who had told the court that there is a direction by the apex court in 2018 with regard to the reframing of the seniority list within a period of three months. However, without complying with the orders, government has effected three promotions and is not revising the seniority list of lecturers. Petitioners have been approaching the respondents authorities by way of representation and personal meetings on various dates. However, the requests of the petitioners remained as a dead letter, they claimed. The court has fixed next date of hearing for September 22. STAY ON RECOVERY OF EXCESS AMOUNT PAID FROM EX-HC JUDGE’S PENSION The Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed the recovery of excess payment being effected by State bank of India from former high court judge Justice SK Jain.The high court bench of Justice SN Satyanarayana has sought response from the bank, Haryana government and high court administration by September 9. The court acted on the plea of Jain, who was elevated in March 1992 as HC judge from a judicial officer and transferred to Allahabad high court. He retired in 1995. He had raised a dispute about computing his 10-year service period and disposing of that matter in 2015, the Supreme Court had said that whatever amount already paid to him would not be recovered. However, in May 2020, the bank started recovery of ₹3.26 lakh paid as excess fixed medical allowance with monthly pension from 2006 to February 2020. He had told the court that bank has acted in violation of the SC order and effected recovery of first instalment without intimating him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-restrains-haryana-from-effecting-promotion-of-principals/story-mFK3YnxSq59fJmjxlHGc6L.html
07-07-2020||Gurugram||Nuh Police seizes cannabis worth ₹1 crore from a vegetable truck||The Nuh Police, on Tuesday, seized 823 kilograms of cannabis (locally known as ganja), worth ₹1 crore in the international market, from a moving vegetable truck in Pinagwan, Nuh. According to the police, there has been a spurt in drug smuggling since lockdown and the police so far have recovered drugs worth ₹2 crore in the last three months across the district.According to the police, the cannabis was being transported in a truck from Odisha and was on its way to Alwar in Rajasthan. Truck driver Sahil, a resident of Rajasthan, has been arrested and is presently being interrogated by the police.During interrogation, he allegedly told the police that he has been working as a driver with a transport company for the last two years. Three months ago, he came in contact with some people of his village who used to sell ganja and used to smuggle it to states such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. They lured him to smuggle it from Odisha to different parts of Rajasthan, by promising him ₹40,000 per trip.Last week, he was given advance of ₹20,000 and was asked to drive a vegetable truck, with cannabis hidden in it, to Alwar. He was told to deliver the consignment to a drug peddler in Alwar, after which he would drive back the empty truck to another location in Nuh, from where he would load spices.“The contraband substance was to be handed over to a peddler in Alwar but the crime investigation agency (CIA) team intercepted the truck at Pinagwan after receiving a tip-off, The police recovered the cannabis from 26 sacks. There were two drivers out of which one fled from the spot,” Narender Bijarnia, the superintendent of police, Nuh, said.An FIR has been registered at the Pinagwan police station under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and the accused have been remanded to judicial custody, the police said.Bijarnia said, “We have adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards drug trafficking in the district. The main reason behind the spurt in the drug peddling cases is the rise in demand. After the relaxations in the lockdown norms, the demand has increased and therefore drug peddlers are more active nowadays. However, crime units and police teams are working very hard to nab the peddlers and the middlemen involved in the trade.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nuh-police-seizes-cannabis-worth-1-crore-from-a-vegetable-truck/story-YEdtxyLCG0DVbtWEYLiB8K.html
07-07-2020||Gurugram||Realtors welcome moratorium on payments, want rebate on stamp duty||Realtors based in Gurugram on Tuesday said that the decision of the Haryana government to grant a moratorium on payment of fees related to change of land use (CLU), licence renewal fees and other interest payments is a positive step that will give a breather to the real estate industry, which has been hit hard during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. To boost the confidence of buyers, the developers want the stamp duty on registration of properties to be reduced for the interim period. Further, a one-time settlement for previous dues of external development charges (EDC) or infrastructure development charges (IDC) can also help boost sales, said city-based realtors. The Haryana government on Monday had decided to consider the period from March 1 to September 30 as “zero period” during which there will be a moratorium on compliance rules and interest payments for all realty projects. A government spokesperson said that this moratorium shall apply to CLU, renewal of licences, the extension of CLU, fees payment and charges as per the Haryana Apartment Ownership Act, 1983. Presently, the registration fee for a property in the state is between 5 and 7% depending on the category of buyers. Parveen Jain, chairman, national real estate development corporation (Naredco), Haryana, said that the government has taken a positive step by announcing these measures as it would ease the pressure on builders to pay large amounts of money as fees. “It was becoming difficult for the developers to get bank guarantees for EDC. It is a good step that the government has agreed to change this condition. The government also needs to bring in more clarity regarding quarantine of labourers who wish to return to work,” he said. The realtors also said that they want the government to allow them to cancel a registered agreement to sell a property after the allottee has repeatedly defaulted on payments. “The decision announced on Monday will give some space to the real estate companies to survive through tough times. The money which can be paid to the government later can now be utilised to complete projects. If the government lessens registration fees then more buyers will come forward to buy properties,” said Prashant Solomon, spokesperson, The Confederation of Real Estate Developer’s Association of India (CREDAI), NCR and Haryana. The developers of affordable housing also welcomed the government decision but want the government to consider a revision in the rate fixed for this category. “The rate for affordable housing was fixed in 2013 and it has remained the same at ₹4,000 for the last seven years. Meanwhile, the prices of construction material and labour have multiplied during this period and affordable projects have become commercially unviable,” said Surender Singh, director, GLS Developers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/realtors-welcome-moratorium-on-payments-want-rebate-on-stamp-duty/story-AcXZZu0hMaOlxpkOBxVJ5L.html
07-07-2020||Gurugram||MCG hires two ambulances to ferry Covid-19 victims for last rites||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has hired two ambulances to transport the bodies of Covid-19 patients to crematoriums and burial grounds, officials said on Tuesday. As per MCG officials, these ambulances were hired from a private firm, after multiple complaints were received about the shortage of ambulances for ferrying bodies for cremation/burial.Civic body officials said they too have witnessed cases first-hand, where hospitals refused to transport Covid-19 bodies, or did so only after charging a hefty sum from the Covid victim’s relatives.Officials said that from now onwards, all Covid-19 bodies will be transported in MCG ambulances, free of cost. Prior to the hiring of these two vehicles, the civic body had no ambulances. “Quick burial or cremation of Covid-19 bodies is extremely vital as it limits the chances of spread of the infection. In many instances, we ourselves witnessed private hospitals refusing to take Covid-19 bodies to the crematorium or burial grounds. In a few instances, we also received complaints from relatives of the deceased that they had to pay as much as ₹40,000 to the hospital staff to get bodies transported. Hence, we hired our own ambulances to put an end to this alleged exploitation,” a senior MCG official said.Till June 8, Gurugram had recorded four Covid-19 fatalities. Almost a month later, on Tuesday, the number of people who had succumbed to the virus stands at 102.“We have hired these ambulances to ensure the spread of infection is minimised and there is no delay in transporting Covid-19 bodies to the nearest crematorium or burial ground. We are undertaking all measures across the city to limit the spread of Covid-19,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.The health branch of the MCG will oversee the operations of the two ambulances. Officials from the MCG’s health department said that last week, after the ambulances were hired, a communication was sent to all private and public hospitals in the city directing them to inform the MCG immediately in case of a coronavirus-related fatality, so that their ambulances could immediately be sent to the hospital to transport the body to the nearest crematorium or burial ground.The MCG has seven crematoriums in the city located at Sukhrali Village near Atul Kataria Chowk, Tigra Village, Palam Vihar, Sector 32, DLF Phase 3 and Madan Puri. The crematorium at Madan Puri is LPG-equipped. On the directions of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the MCG is in the process of making all the remaining crematoriums CNG-equipped by the end of this month.In addition to its crematoriums, the MCG has also earmarked three grounds for the burial of people who succumb to Covid-19. These are located in Sector 58 Power House, Ghata village, and Badshahpur village.MCG has also formed a seven-member team — five medical officers and two junior engineers — who are responsible for cremating or burying all Covid-19 bodies.Officials said that after a body is transported, the ambulance is thoroughly disinfected with isopropyl alcohol hydrochloride upon returning to the MCG’s health branch office in Sector 39, where the vehicles are stationed. In addition, to ensure there is no contact with the driver or co-passenger, each ambulance has been divided into two compartments separating the space where the body is kept from the rest of the vehicle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-hires-two-ambulances-to-ferry-covid-19-victims-for-last-rites/story-u10BIRoh4ttEbE8i53xl3N.html

The PIL also claimed that as many lawyers do not own a private vehicle, it becomes difficult for them to commute to the court. Only government employees and essential service providers are currently allowed to travel by locals after services resumed last month.A division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice MS Karnik, while hearing the PIL filed by Chirag Chanani and other lawyers through videoconferencing, was informed by advocates Shyam Dewani and Bhoomi Katira that their client sought a declaration that services rendered by lawyers are essential services. The plea sought to direct the state and Centre, through the railways, to include lawyers in the list of essential service providers who are permitted to travel by suburban local trains.While making submissions, Dewani said that lawyers were restricted from commuting by special local trains and were not included in the circular issued by the divisional railway manager, enumerating the categories of essential services staff who can be permitted to board the trains.Dewani also submitted that though the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court considered services provided by lawyers as essential, lawyers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region were deprived of the right to travel.Referring to the petition, Dewani said that as the courts started functioning since last month, the lawyers who are residing in the suburbs go through tremendous inconvenience to travel to the courts and their offices located in south Mumbai.The petition further added, “This problem is faced by hundreds of lawyers who do not have their own vehicles and are not in the bus zone or are required to change three-four buses to reach court, which is also a problem as time constraint for legal profession are of utmost importance.”In the light of these submissions, Dewani sought directions from the court to allow lawyers to board the special local trains by declaring them essential staff.After hearing the submissions, the bench issued notices to the respondent authorities and directed them to clarify their positions through affidavits in reply and posted the case for further hearing after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-lawyers-travel-on-trains-hc-asks-state-govt-to-respond/story-5OgIogSsBGSGARxCvpA8YK.html

Officials of the stamps and registration department said that only 3,000 such registrations were done across the district in the months of May and June this year as compared to 24,000 done in the corresponding period last year -- a decline of whopping 88%. The officials attributed the drastic fall in registrations to fear of infection, restrictions on movement and closure of government offices, among others. The registration of property resumed in the district on May 4, after a gap of almost 40 days when the nationwide lockdown was implemented on March 25 to prevent the Covid-19 spread. “In May and June, total 3,000 registrations were executed, which is almost 88% less than registrations that took place in the two months in 2019,” said SK Tripathi, assistant inspector general, UP stamps and registration department, Gautam Budh Nagar.The department, however, hopes that the revenue loss of these months will be compensated once the pandemic gets over and the movement becomes normal.According to the officials, the department earned Rs10 crore and Rs 50 crore revenue from the registrations in May and June, respectively. The department charges 5% as stamp fee for a registration of properties that include flat or plot, said the officials.It hopes to earn Rs 80 crore in July as the number of registrations is rising. “When things were normal, our department used to earn from Rs150 crore to Rs180 crore revenue in a month. We hope that in January next year, registration will rise exponentially when the pandemic fear goes away,” said Tripathi.Meanwhile, real estate developers said that there is a sense of fear among property buyers due to coronavirus pandemic. “Even government offices are not functioning normally. We hope once the pandemic is over, real estate market will witness better days and registration also pick up,” said Prashant Tiwari, president of Western UP wing of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), a developers’ group.In 2018-19, the department earned Rs 1,880 crore revenue from the registrations. However, in 2019-20, it earned Rs 1,856 crore. As per the estimates done by the Noida authority, there are at least 30,000 flats, which are ready for registrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/property-registrations-witness-a-drastic-fall-in-noida-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-C7UYfHV5lHVCKfJcuROPKO.html

We have made it clear that hazardous bio-medical waste should be collected properly, and should be handed over to another agency that then treats it scientifically. Residents should cooperate with us in handling this waste. If it is not being done in any society then it may be because of non-cooperation by residents,” said Narendra Bhooshan chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.Residents, however, alleged that bio-medical waste from households from where Covid -19 cases were reported and the other occupants are under home quarantine was not being collected separately. “At least 15 positive cases were detected in our society after which the administration sealed our block. However, the waste collection staff collected waste from other houses in the same bag they used for collecting waste such as masks, gloves, and other waste from the patients’ houses. This is shocking and we had even complained to the Greater Noida authority officials asking them to collect waste from households with Covid-19 cases separately, but nothing has happened so far,” said Harinder Bhati, former residents’ welfare association president of Sector Beta1.The authority also does not have any record of data on bio-medical waste collected from residential areas daily.City residents said that there is no separate system to collect hazardous waste multi-storey housing societies as well. “I have not seen any difference in collection and handling of the hazardous medical waste being produced amid the pandemic. The worker who collects waste from our flat also collects waste from the patient’s house and in the same bag. I do not think this is the right way to handle waste as it can expose so many people to risk,” said Sunil Sachdeva, a resident of Cherry County society, sector Tech Zone4 in Greater Noida West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-dedicated-mechanism-in-place-for-collection-of-bio-medical-waste-in-greater-noida-allege-residents/story-O7ZeKAfJyNmFmQmlKz436I.html

When the family approached the hospital on Sunday, the authorities informed that they could not find the patient.Meanwhile, another family from Kopri whose 67-year-old relative was tested positive and admitted at Global Hub Hospital was declared dead on July 3. However, they were later informed that the deceased is alive. The family were also allowed to meet him after wearing PPE kits.“We had completed the last rites of our father last week after a body was handed over to us. However, on Monday the hospital informed us that our father is alive. We visited the hospital on Tuesday, wearing PPE kits and we saw that our father is alive and he was undergoing treatment,” said his 42-year-old son.The Bharatiya Janata Party has now alleged that the body given to this family might be that of the 72-year-old Covid patient.Niranjan Dawkhare, member of legislative Council, Thane said, “We suspect that there could have been a mix up between these two patients, hence we have approached the Kapurbawdi police station to file a case of negligence. There are no tags given to the patient at the hospital nor does the hospital inform the relatives about the admitted patient’s condition. There needs to be transparency,” said Niranjan Davkhare, MLC, Thane.A probe has now been initiated by the civic commissioner. “The commissioner has ordered a three-member committee under IAS Ranjit Kumar on Tuesday,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation.Kumar said, “Our inquiry is still under process and we shall share details in our final report soon.”Anil Deshmukh, senior police inspector, Kapurbawdi police station, said, “We are close to completing the investigation and shall share the details on Wednesday after we have all the information in place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-member-team-to-find-missing-72-year-old-covid-patient/story-8wmhIs3bVfeFK5188ZIL7L.html
07-07-2020||Noida||Stay positive, don’t panic, advise people who beat Covid in Noida||Don’t panic, divert your mind, try and focus on the positive aspects of life — these are the three mantras that residents who battled and beat Covid-19 from Noida suggest, as the virus continues to spread rapidly in the district.Urging people to take precautions to stay safe, and to immediately get tested if they start showing symptoms, both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients who successfully beat Covid stated that the doctors will do their job. It is the mental health of patients that needs to be paid attention to.“When I tested positive and was admitted to the hospital on June 18, the only symptoms I had was a sore throat and some mild fever. I was scared to my core, while I was leaving for the hospital, where I was admitted for 10 days. I felt no discomfort, like breathlessness. While in the hospital, a feeling of panic gripped me every time I thought about my family,” said SS Shukla, 50, a government employee who lives in Noida. Recalling his experiences, Shukla insists that it was his spiritualism that helped him deal with panic and restlessness.“I pray that no one gets infected. But if you do get infected then turn to spiritualism. Try to look at the positive side of life. If you are not spiritual, then try to be practical. Know you cannot control the situation and fearing it will only make things worse. More than the virus, one has to deal with the fear that comes with it to win the battle,” Shukla says, adding that he only informed his parents in UP about the whole incident, after being discharged from the hospital.Another patient, who recently returned home after treatment, said that while his doctor helped him a lot and told him not to panic, it took some time for him to cope.“If infected, try to look at the positive side of life and be strong. The overall negativity surrounding Covid-19 — like there is no cure and you might end up dying — made me slip into a depression after I tested positive. My family even started consulting astrologers. I have been hospitalised earlier, but a Covid-ward is different. You see the staff covered in PPE kits and are allowed no visitors, which immediately makes you realise the gravity of the situation. I felt breathless day one but it improved soon. My understanding is that you will show signs of recovery only after getting rid of stress or fear. The doctors made me realise that this pandemic might get worse, but I am likely to become immune to it, once I get treated successfully,” said the resident.Recalling their restlessness and fear upon knowing that they had tested positive, another Noida family — who returned home on July 3 after being hospitalised for 21 days —said a positive outlook goes a long way in helping you beat the virus.“I believe that if you continue to panic, you will never recover. We were terrorised when we came to know that our entire family— my sister, my niece, mother, father and I — had all tested positive. We first went to the government hospital, but shifted to a private hospital in Delhi. While my niece was asymptomatic and seemed okay, everyone else was struggling and showing different symptoms of the virus. My parents suffered from breathlessness and were administered oxygen, I suffered from tastelessness for almost a week. This was all so depressing. But the doctors and staff helped us a lot in defeating the fear, the depression and the virus. You need to pull yourself out of anxiety to show signs of recovery. Try to look at the positive aspects of life, avoid everything that makes you negative. Above all don’t panic,” said another Noida resident who did not wanted to be named.He also pointed a t the lax attitude among a large number of people regarding Covid-19.“Now that we are back home and recovering from the constant fatigue, I see that a lot of people in our society are still not wearing masks. All it takes is a few precautions are a few precautions,” he adds.Noida has recorded 2,935 Covid cases – highest in the state – of which 1,121 are the active. At least 29 people had succumbed to the virus so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/stay-positive-don-t-panic-advise-people-who-beat-covid-in-noida/story-GWD8QJmL7qRosjPy2sAZvM.html

07-07-2020||Noida||Recovered police personnel to donate plasma in fight against Covid-19||Police personnel in Noida who had contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) earlier and have now made full recoveries will donate their plasma to help others fight off the infection.In the district, a total of 50 police personnel have tested positive for coronavirus so far. Of these, 30 police personnel have recovered and 19 are currently going treatment for the infection. On June 27, a 57-year-old police constable with comorbidities had succumbed to the deadly virus.“We have spoken to our recovered personnel and they are ready to donate their plasma which will be used for the convalescent plasma therapy. Based on the ICMR (Indian Medical Council of Medical Research) guidelines, plasma from a recovered patient can be used after 28 days for treating other patients. Personnel who have completed this period will start donating their plasma in a day or two,” Ankur Aggarwal, additional deputy commissioner of police (zone 2) and the nodal officer to handle Covid-related issues, said. The convalescent plasma therapy, which is still in the experimental stage, entails taking plasma carrying carry virus-fighting antibodies from cured Covid-19 patients and injecting them in the blood of active coronavirus patients to boost the immune system’s response to the infection. Three facilities in the district—Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI), and Sharda Hospital—are currently administering the therapy to Covid-19 patients.Among the front runners for plasma donation from Noida police is the 42-year-old station house officer (SHO) of Sector 49 police station, Dharmendra Kumar Sharma. Sharma has tested positive for the disease on May 12 and after being cured of the infection, he was discharged on May 22.“A total of nine personnel from our police station (Sector 49) had tested positive for Covid-19. We have all now recovered and have resumed our work. As soon as the 28-day period gets over, all police personnel will donate their plasma. Those who have completed the period will donate their plasma in a couple of days,” the SHO said. The first case of Covid-19 in the Noida police was reported on May 5 when a sub-inspector with Dial 112 had tested positive. Aggarwal said most of the newer cases in the force who have tested positive are asymptomatic and are undergoing treatment at various facilities including the new L1 facility set up at Sector 125.The police department’s resources have been stretched thin with nearly 30% of the force engaged with sealing work in over 300 containment zones in the district. The Noida police have also been actively taking action against violators of the lockdown and section 144 in the district. So far nearly 10,000 people have been booked for lockdown violations in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/recovered-police-personnel-to-donate-plasma-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-mqhYNurPah2XXaSbE0q8zM.html
07-07-2020||City||Modinagar factory fire: Toll rises to nine, SHO suspended||Ghaziabad The death count in the Modinagar factory fire incident went up to nine on Tuesday after a 40-year-old woman succumbed to injuries at a private hospital in Meerut on Tuesday. The police said that condition of one more woman is critical as the two had suffered more than 70% burns in the incident. The station house officer of Modinagar police station has been suspended on account of “lax supervision”, the police said.The fire had taken place at the illegal party pooper manufacturing factory at Bakharwa village in Modinagar town on Sunday evening. Eight people, including seven women, had died on Sunday in the incident and officials said that all the victims sustained about 100% burns.The cops identified the ninth deceased as Jago Devi who was one of the women who worked at the factory operated by prime suspect Nitin Chaudhary. Chaudhary was arrested by the police on Monday, while a hunt is on for other suspects, including Mohammad Waseem, who is stated to be a fireworks’ manufacturer from Farrukhnagar near Sahibabad and allegedly supplied raw material to Chaudhary for manufacturing of party poopers.“The ninth victim and one other woman, Laxmi Devi, were admitted at a private hospital in Meerut. Jago succumbed while Laxmi is still critical with over 70% burns. In connection with the incident, the senior superintendent of police on late Monday night suspended the station house officer of Modinagar police station on account of lax supervision,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural).“Many villagers told us that operation of the factory was in knowledge of the local police, but they showed laxity and did not inform senior officers. That is why the local police post in-charge was also suspended soon after the incident. A magisterial inquiry is going on, and I am also conducting another inquiry into the alleged laxity by the police. Once both the inquiries get complete, legal action will be decided,” Jadaun added.In connection with the incident, sub divisional magistrate of Loni and police officers on Tuesday afternoon conducted raids at different places in Farrukhnagar to nab Waseem and his other aides. Raids were also conducted at fireworks manufacturing units in Farrukhnagar, the police said.“Ever since the raids started on Tuesday afternoon, we have seized large quantities of chemicals and explosive material used for manufacturing fireworks, along with finished material, from Farrukhnagar. Till Tuesday evening, we had seized more than 200 quintals of such material. More checks are being conducted. Waseem and his aides are on the run, but they will be arrested as teams are tracking them,” said Keshav Kumar, assistant superintendent of police (Sahibabad).“Despite the ban on manufacturing and storage of conventional fireworks, the manufacturers here are still engaged in such activities. We also found party poopers at Farrukhnagar. Strict legal action will now be initiated against the erring persons,” Kumar added.The manufacturing of crackers in Farukknagar had completely stopped in October 2018 after the Supreme Court imposed a ban on the sale of non-green crackers in the wake of rising pollution levels in the national capital region.Meanwhile, the police on Tuesday evening said that they also arrested a fireworks’ manufacturer, Mohammad Saleem, who is a close aide of Mohammad Waseem. They both were supplying material from Farrukhnagar to the prime suspect at Modinagar, the police said.On Monday, the National Human Rights Commission had issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary and the director general of police (DGP) calling for a detailed report into the fire incident. The notice gave a four-week deadline for the filing of the report which should include “action taken against the factory owner and the delinquent officers/officials, status of the medical treatment being provided to the injured and relief/rehabilitation provided to the aggrieved by the state.”Soon after the tragedy, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the families of the deceased and sought a report from Ghaziabad officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/modinagar-factory-fire-toll-rises-to-nine-sho-suspended/story-GGz2vFuYsvZHjQ1MxVtAPL.html
07-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad gets nod for 15 more ambulances to ferry Covid-19 patients||Ghaziabad The health department has received an approval for 15 more ambulances for the district from the state government for ferrying Covid-19 patients to the dedicated Covid hospitals, officials said on Tuesday. The department is presently operating 14 ambulances for transporting such patients to different hospitals in the district.According to the figures issued by the state control room, Ghaziabad has the highest number of active cases at 1,251 till July 6 among all 75 districts in the state. The total positive cases stood at 2,283 and the numbers are rising since Unlock 1 was implemented from June 1.“After the surge in number of positive cases in June, we had to open up two L1 hospitals, one each at Niwari and Modinagar, which are on the outskirts of the city. So, ferrying patients are taking time for our 14 ambulances which are being used for Covid-19 duty. This is why we sought 15 more ambulances so that timely transfer of patients becomes possible. The state officials have given clearance and 15 ambulances operated under ‘102 service’ will be given to us shortly,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.At present, the patients are ferried to Covid hospitals through 12 ambulances under 102 service and two other advanced life-support ambulances.“There was proposal that we use the ‘108 service’ ambulances for Covid-19 patients. But we refused as these ambulances are exclusively meant for ferrying pregnant women and children,” Dr Gupta added.According to official records, the 102 service ambulances made about 40 to 50 trips per day for ferrying Covid patients in June, while the number of per day trips has gone up to about 90-100 in the current month.“This is because we have an average of 100 patients who are turning positive daily this July. For better management, we have also resorted to pooling of patients from a family or a locality in order to reduce number of trips. It takes us about two hours to reach a patient’s house in Indirapuram/Vaishali and ferry him/her to the L1 hospital at Niwari,” said an officer attached to the operation of ambulance service.At present, the district has five Covid hospitals in operation. These include three L1 category facilities -- ESIC Hospital at Sahibabad, Divyajyoti Hospital at Niwari and SRM Hospital at Modinagar -- one L2 hospital at Sanjay Nagar and one L3 hospital near old bus stand.“On average, an ambulance is running about 150 to 200km per day for ferrying Covid patients to hospitals. To reduce the burden, we have also stopped the home drop of patients who get discharged from hospitals,” the officer said.In the last week of June, the state government had issued directions that no ambulance will be provided to the patients for home drop after they get discharged from Covid hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-gets-nod-for-15-more-ambulances-to-ferry-covid-19-patients/story-oSKGr0WHm95jbNzrKPlTzH.html
07-07-2020||City||Despite SEBI ban, builders continue to offer assured returns scheme in Mohali||Even though the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in November 2018 declared that luring people to invest in residential and commercial projects in lieu of assured returns was “fraud and illegal”, several builders in Mohali district, especially in Zirakpur, are still offering the scheme in the absence of supervision.At present, there are around 10 builders in the district who offer the scheme of assured 10% to 12% per month returns on investment. SEBI’s guidelines deem these schemes illegal and warn investors against falling prey to them, encouraging them to report such incidents to the designated authority.After a rift developed among the partners of Chandigarh Citi Center (CCC), the biggest commercial property project in Zirakpur, it had come to light that they had been offering 12% monthly return to the investors. Later, the builders promised the investors physical possession of the properties and stopped paying them returns, after which the investors accused them of cheating and not fulfilling promises made at the time of investment.BUILDERS SAY SCHEME STOPPED DUE TO LOCKDOWNCCC managing director Tejpal Gupta said, “We are still giving what we promised them, but could not give them since past four months as we don’t have funds due to lockdown due to Covid-19.” On being questioned about the SEBI ban, he refused to comment on the issue.Another popular builder in Zirakpur, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Since we have promised it to the investors, we are trying to provide (returns), but for the past several months, we could not pay them due to financial crisis.”Pramod Kumar Sharma, general secretary, Aero Homes Residents Welfare Association, Zirakpur, said, “Our builder also cheated around 245 allottees in the name of assured returns. The project was launched in 2011 and he assured returns of 12% every month, but stopped after he offered possession of the incomplete project (which is incomplete). Now, the builder is absconding after more than 50 cases were registered against him.”A senior official of the Zirakpur civic body said, “It is a well-oiled nexus. Some builders launch the project, assure allottees they will be paid returns till they get possession, and without completing the project, take completion certificates in connivance with the MC officials and issue them to the allottees.”The chairperson of Punjab Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Navreet Singh Kang, said, “SEBI has banned [the practice] and RERA has no specific provision regarding allowing or not allowing it. Our Act specifically does not bar it and our violations are clearly defined in the Act.”Deputy general manager (DGM) of SEBI said, “We have not received any complaint yet, but once we do, action will be taken accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-sebi-ban-builders-continue-to-offer-assured-returns-scheme-in-mohali/story-rL8XT9NALfPNlZf2z8iqMK.html

The two employees, a permanent way inspector (PWI) Rajkumar Sharma and trackman Nagesh Sawant were run over while trying to cross the railway tracks. Railway officials believe that it was an error of judgment on the part of the railway employees. “They thought they were sitting adjacent to the railway tracks. As it was raining heavily and with low visibility, they could not judge that they were sitting on the tracks. The injured were taken to Bhabha Hospital,” said a Western Railway official.The motorman, Jeevan Kanojia, in his statement, said that he tried to alert the victims who were crossing the tracks by honking. “The local train was on the fast railway line and was running at the speed of 75-80 kmph. As it was raining heavily, I was constantly blowing the whistle. However, later, I saw them sitting on the tracks. I had applied emergency brakes too, but they continued sitting on the tracks. I alerted the guard of the train and immediately moved the injured to the hospital,” said Kanojia, in his statement.The Western Railway stated that both had head injuries and were declared dead at the hospital. “They had sustained severe head injuries. The unfortunate incident will be dealt as run over on duty and suitable compensation and other benefits will be provided to their families as per the law,” read a statement by Western Railway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-wr-staff-die-after-being-hit-by-train/story-mn1oupzwUCYFfDEpI76NVI.html

Resident doctors of the hospital also raised the issue of their pending salaries for two months and said they would consider mass resignations after July 10 if the dues were not cleared.The nursing staff had staged a protest on Tuesday morning, assembling in the hospital premises and suspending work for two hours in the morning. They had been staging a similar protest for the last few days.“We decided to call off our protest after assurance from the mayor to give us our pending salaries in a week. We will start our agitation if our demands are not met in the given time,” Alka Kaushik, a representative of Kasturba Hospital Nurses’ Union, said. She said nurses had been working without salaries since April and risking their lives in the time of the coronavirus pandemic. They were unable to pay for even basic facilities due to their financial problem, she said.“For how long we can keep working without salaries? The role of doctors and nurses along with paramedical staff becomes more important at a time when a pandemic is sweeping through the globe. They should pay us at the earliest,” Kaushik said.The 450-bedded Kasturba Hospital is a maternity and child specialty hospital of the north corporation located near Jama Masjid. The mayor said the nurses had ended their protest after assurances from the corporation.“All employees are being paid in a phased manner and salaries to nurses will be released in a week’s time. Revenue collection of the civic body has been drastically hit due to Covid-19. We are arranging funds and releasing salaries of our employees,” Prakash said. The mayor said every month, the corporation needs Rs 350 crore to pay its 58,000 employees.The nurses’ union found support from the doctors’ body of the hospital, who are also demanding payment of their pending salaries for two months. Dr Sunil Kumar, president of the Kasturba Hospital Resident Doctors Association, said salaries of May and June months are pending and should be cleared soon.“A compensation of Rs 1 crore has been announced on the death of corona warriors, which includes doctors and nurses, then why do authorities not pay salaries to these corona warriors on time while they are alive and serving. Our salaries are pending for two months and we will consider tendering mass resignations after July 10 if our dues are not cleared,” Kumar said. Last month, resident doctors of Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals had threatened mass resignations but took back their decision after the Supreme Court asked the civic body to pay their pending salaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pending-salaries-kasturba-nurses-call-off-strike-after-assurance-but-docs-threaten-mass-resignations/story-mV25UpZCedoNWPIvBUL2IL.html

07-07-2020||Delhi||HC asks DU for its final decision on holding exams||The Delhi high court Tuesday told the Delhi University to apprise the court on whether it would conduct examinations for final-year students after the court was informed that a high-level meeting was taking place in the wake of a notification issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) on conducting exams.On Monday, the UGC had brought out a notification asking universities and colleges to “compulsorily” hold final-year exams by the end of September 2020 on offline/online/blended mode.Justice Pratibha M Singh also directed the varsity to adhere to the examination schedule if the exams are going to be conducted and also issued a notice to the university on a plea by several students who sought cancellation of the examinations.The DU exams are scheduled to start from July 10 and the evaluation would be done by mid- September. About 2.45 lakh students would participate in the exams.On Monday, the court had asked DU to give a state-wise data of final-year students who will take the exams. It had also asked the UGC committee to give its report on conducting exams in universities across the country.At the outset of the hearing, the court was informed by professor Vinay Gupta, dean of examinations, that a high-level meeting of officials of the university, UGC and HRD ministry was underway. He said the meeting was being held to decide the further course of action on examinations in the wake of the notifications issued by the UGC and the ministry of home affairs (MHA). The MHA, in a letter to the Union higher education secretary, on Monday, permitted the conduct of examinations by universities and institutions across the country.“There is a possibility that we will have to postpone examinations. The meeting is still underway, the position would be clear only after two or three hours,” Gupta said. He said the date sheets have already been uploaded on the DU website.Terming it “unpredictable”, the court sought to know the reason for the postponement, if et al, the exams are called of. “Look at the state of students who will have to appear for the exams. There is no certainty,” the judge remarked.Prof Gupta told the court that the examination portal is robust and can allow 80,000 students at one time to take the exams. He said 2.45 lakh final-year students would be appearing for the examination of whom 59,000 students were from other states. He also said 4.86 lakh question papers have been downloaded and attempted in the last few days as a mock drill to check if the preparedness of DU. During the hearing, the judge sought to know as to whether more time would be granted to students in case there is a delay in downloading the paper due to poor connectivity or other issues. The time allotted for each exam is three hours, including the downloading of question paper and uploading of answer sheets. He also said a delay in emailing answer sheets cannot be allowed as it would give rise to malpractices. He also said that only in a few places such as Jammu and Kashmir, where the internet connectivity is low, would students be allowed a little more time.During the hearing, advocate Shivankar Sharma, the counsel appearing for another five students, told the court that many students from SAARC countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal were facing problems in downloading the question papers.After arguments on the preparedness of DU for conducting the exams, the court posted the matter for further hearing to July 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-asks-du-for-its-final-decision-on-holding-exams/story-2v7V9aBsEElWoaOhfGf8AJ.html

He started the hotel business using the money. But when the business incurred losses, he backtracked on his marriage promise, stopped all communications with the woman and never returned her money, police officers associate with the case said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the woman approached the Mehrauli police station on March 17 and filed a complaint of cheating against the man.“Identifying himself as a businessman in Vijayawada, Imran befriended the woman in 2018. They exchanged their phone numbers and started talking. After sometime, he proposed to her,” said DCP Thakur“Once he had her trust, Imran told her about his hotel business plan and tricked her into transferring around ₹34 lakh to him. But when his business failed, he started avoiding her calls. When the woman realised that she was cheated, she filed a case,” said an investigator.During the probe, the officer said the investigating team identified the suspect and his address through technical surveillance. A team went to Vijayawada and arrested Imran last week. No recovery has been made from Imran since he invested the money in the business, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/andhra-man-cheats-delhi-nurse-of-34-lakh-on-promise-of-marriage-held/story-gKgqDwxnEIjckhVCM7CAkN.html
07-07-2020||Delhi||Sisodia asks govt schools to involve guest teachers for online classes||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday asked all the 1,030 government schools in the city to employ the services of guest or contractual teachers “in the ongoing online teaching-learning process”. Around 20,000 guest teachers, employed in Delhi government schools contractually, were rendered jobless after their contracts lapsed in May.On July 2, Sisodia had announced that the guest teachers would be engaged in the online teaching process underway in all government schools amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In a letter to the Directorate of Education (DoE) on Tuesday, Sisodia said, “It has come to my notice that despite very clear instructions on July 2, 2020, many schools are not involving guest and contractual teachers in implementing the new teaching-learning plan. Our plan will not be effective unless all teachers, including guest and contractual teachers, who have had a direct role in taking classes with children in the pre-lockdown phase, are not involved once again.”Sisodia said that the new plan does not just involve sending worksheets or conducting online classes, but also staying connected with every child via regular follow-ups. “It’s possible only when all teachers of the schools take individual responsibility for a certain number of children. Therefore, all teachers must be engaged to ensure that all children take part in teaching-learning activities and to keep track of their well-being,” the education minister wrote.He directed the DoE to instruct all heads of schools (HoS) to take the services of the guest teachers. “Please instruct all the HoS to call all willing guest and contractual teachers who rendered their services before the summer vacation in May 2020 and continue employing their services in teaching-learning and any other function assigned to the school,” Sisodia said.The All India Guest Teachers Association welcomed the move. Shoeb Rana, a guest teacher at a government school in Sunder Nagri and a member of the association, said, “This is a big relief for the guest teachers since many schools were not calling them back to work citing the fact that there was no official confirmation by the government. The education minister’s letter has made things clear now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sisodia-asks-govt-schools-to-involve-guest-teachers-for-online-classes/story-8MKYIdHBI276GuvYEJVHhL.html

The industrialists said that the government can impose a ban on the import of finished products, but a ban on the import of raw material would be a bane for the industry.General secretary of Punjab Fabric Association, Bobby Jindal said, “The dyes are manufactured in India, but its raw material is imported from China. Similarly, the textile machinery and its parts are imported from China. The government has stopped the clearance of material that is stuck at ports. The textile and dyeing industry would not be able to survive if the imports of raw material are banned.”The industrialists rued that the jacket manufacturing sector and the hosiery industry in the industrial hub would also be badly affected if the imports are banned from China. President of Knitwear and Textile Club, Vinod Thapar said, “All the material for the hosiery industry including buttons, zips, etc are presently imported from China. Around 90% of the fabric used for manufacturing jackets and machinery is imported from China. If the imports are banned from China, then the Union government should provide a financial package to the industry for commencing manufacturing of these items in the country. Otherwise, the industry would collapse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-textile-industry-cautions-against-china-imports-ban/story-zjEuDteBDOxEm63DUkMm3K.html

The students on Tuesday expressed their dismay over the UGC’s latest guidelines.According to the guidelines issued by the UGC on Monday, universities are to conduct final year or end semester examinations in offline, online, or blended(offline and online) mode, by September.The members of the National Students Union of India (NSUI) started a chain hunger strike at Sector 35 to express their outrage against the decision and demanded that the UGC should not ask universities to conduct examinations amid the pandemic.While on hunger strike, Rahul Kumar, who was elected as vice-president of Panjab University Campus Students Council (PUCSC) last year, said, “The UGC should not put the students’ lives at risk by conducting examinations. We demand that examinations should be cancelled and students should be promoted based on the previous semester’s assessment.”Many other student organisations at PU have demanded the scrapping of examinations amid pandemic.PU’s Students For Society (SFS) said, “UGC has issued vague guidelines with no real assurance to students. No classes have been conducted since the lockdown was imposed and students have insufficient study material with them. We demand that examinations for all semesters should be cancelled unconditionally and equivalent credit should be given for assignments and other projects.”Another student organisation, Youth For Swaraj, also submitted a memorandum to the varsity and demanded that PU should follow the guidelines issued by the Punjab government instead of the UGC.FINAL DECISION YET TO BE ANNOUNCEDPU is yet to make an announcement regarding the examinations. The officials had earlier stated that they were waiting for the UGC’s new guidelines. It was also learnt that a meeting was held on Tuesday at the university but no decision was taken. However, an official said, “The university is preparing a plan for the implementation of the UGC guidelines keeping in mind the interest of the students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-students-express-dismay-over-ugc-s-decision-to-hold-final-exams/story-PPtpcko1azHrnEz5EOTUEN.html

Majority of them have deferred their plans of studying in the US this year.In its recent statement, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) warned that students who don’t comply with the new rules could be removed from the country.Students said though in-person teaching has better impact than online classes, finding colleges offering such modules in the time of Covid-19 pandemic would be nearly impossible.Reacting to the decision, a student from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology said the US authorities had earlier targeted work visas and now their moves were posing threats to students’ immigration. “It is unfair to threaten students to leave the country and declining visas over such hard conditions,” said Guarang Sharma, fourth year electrical engineering student. He has been preparing for his GRE exam to pursue higher studies in the US.Students pay exorbitant fee for international exposure in these colleges, thus only online classes won’t help them, he argued.Another student Amitesh, who is in the final year of BTech in computer sciences, said posing restrictions on student immigration is uncalled for.“Covid-19 outbreak has already dampened the aspirations of students hoping to get admissions in foreign colleges this year. There should not be any more restrictions on visas on based on the mode of classes being conducted in colleges,” he said.Disappointed to defer his education plans, Shaurya Gulati, a BTech final year student of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), Ludhiana, said, “To pursue my master’s degree in mechanical engineering, I had applied at the University of Michigan, USA in January this year and was so excited to be there for classes by September. But now the US government has decided they will not issue visas to students whose colleges are offering fully online courses.”Stating that decision would impact the dreams of thousands of students who were presently studying in America, Manpreet Singh said any international student in the US or entering the country for Fall-2020 must be enrolled in nine credits to get a legal stay here. “Most of the universities here are currently offering online classes and only fewer have in-person courses. As there are two more months before the session begins, students must enroll into the courses being offered in the offline mode,” said Singh, who is a PhD research scholar in mechanical engineering department of University of Maryland Baltimore County, USA.Another final year student of GNDEC Sidak Singh said, “I was planning to study in the US this year, but I have to drop the idea now. I feel dejected, but I have decided to come up with new innovations in machinery in India itself.”MOVE WON’T AFFECT PUNJAB MUCH: EXPERTSMeanwhile, immigration experts from the region believe that the US move will have less impact in Punjab.A Chandigarh-based immigration consultant said, “The extent of the decision’s impact will not be more in Punjab region as students here prefer Canada and Australia for studies and work rather than the US.”“Though a handful of students seek higher education in renowned US universities, they will now explore options in other countries,” opined Anuj Kalra, an immigration expert from Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-person-classes-or-no-visa-punjab-students-feel-dejected-as-us-modifies-rules-for-fall-session/story-avQwx7NnVC42Nb3c0K8YEK.html

He also demanded the government ensure that no student of any private school in the state was victimised solely because his parents were not able to afford the fee due to reduced income during Covid-19 pandemic. He said Punjab should compensate the private schools by submitting six months school fee of students in advance to them.Leading a dharna here, Badal said a large number of Punjabis came out in thousands over the SAD’s ‘Punjab Bachao’ call and displayed their seething anger against the Congress government and chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for leaving them in the lurch at the time of a pandemic. “People today hold the Congress government responsible for the hike fuel prices as well as increase of power tariff and other taxes because Congressmen have looted the state treasury through a series of scams be it the ₹5,600-crore liquor scam, the ₹4,000-crore seed scam or illegal mining or even the latest insurance scam,” he said.Badal thanked the people for coming out to show solidarity with the SAD and force the Congress government and the chief minister who is “busy making gimmickry videos while locked up in his farmhouse. “Today every village and town in the state has passed a vote of no-confidence against chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and the days of Congress government are numbered,” he said in Zirakpur in the presence of Derabassi legislator N K Sharma, who thanked him for the development of Mohali during the SAD-BJP tenure and disclosed how every work had come to a stop during the Congress rule.Senior leader and MP Balwinder Singh Bhundur said the people of Punjab had been left to their own fate amid the pandemic even as Congress leaders were resorting to open loot by indulging in manufacturing and bottling illicit liquor besides cross-border liquor smuggling.Senior party leader and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia, who was in Amritsar, said diesel is the costliest in Punjab as compared to neighbouring states. He demanded a central probe into the “embezzlement and wrongful distribution” of ration by the Congress government.In Jalandhar, the SAD organised protests at various places against the alleged anti-people policies of the government. Similar protests were organised in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar and Kapurthala districts. The SAD workers also staged a protest against the cancellation of blue cards and hike in fuel prices near the Mini Secretariat in Ludhiana. The workers formed a human chain to register their protest and raised slogans against the Congress government and submitted a memorandum to Ludhiana deputy commissioner.Akali Dal leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal said the Congress government has imposed various taxes on petrol and diesel and demanded that both the Centre and the Punjab government should reduce fuel prices.“The government has cancelled blue cards of the people living below the poverty line and there is a massive bungling in the distribution of ration,” said Grewal. Party’s district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon said they will keep raising the issues of public concern and force the government to cut taxes on fuel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-holds-statewide-protests-sukhbir-demands-cbi-probe-into-ration-embezzlement/story-SnAdhkcDKJs7JfSPihJxSP.html

The appointment of IAS and IPS officers is done with CM’s approval.”Pawar held a meeting with the Pune traders’ body and discussed various demands put forward by them.“During the meeting, there was a demand put forward for the decentralisation of trades on the outskirts of Pune after the Covid crisis. The traders have demanded that the state government provide 1,000 acres of land near Pune, saying the businesses which are currently centralised in Pune can be migrated to these places. I have told them that I will discuss this issue with state government,” said Pawar.Pawar said that his meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was related to issues of the state and clarified that there were no differences in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state.“There are no differences in the (MVA). The discussions with CM were related to issues that are before the state and there were no other issues,” Pawar clarified.Pawar also backed the CM over not venturing out in public, despite criticism by the opposition. “If a person with key responsibilities comes out, then people tend to gather and this is not expected in the current times,” said the NCP president.Asked if he is satisfied with the performance of CM, he said, “After taking the reins of the state, CM Thackeray had plans to work on several issues, but due to Covid-19, all the priorities got changed.

They also want the highway exit near Focal Point – closed by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) – to be opened. Balkar Sandhu, mayor, and MPS Kalra, adviser to NHAI for Punjab, visited Transport Nagar on Tuesday and deliberated over measures to ease traffic there.Opening of the cut on Link Road at the Transport Nagar entry point blocked by the police and administration has also been sought. Didar Singh, president, Ludhiana Goods Transport Association, said, “The truckers have to move through Samrala Chowk for entry to the highway and take a detour as the exit at Focal Point has been blocked. This also results in traffic jams and more consumption of fuel. As the entry point to Transport Nagar has also been blocked at Link Road, the truckers have to move till Samrala Chowk and take a u-turn to reach Transport Nagar. We have apprised the mayor of the problem and he has assured us of a solution. We have also sought repair of roads in the area.”Commenting on the matter, Kalra said that the NHAI was working to provide an entry and exit point near Sherpur Chowk and rules would have to be looked into to check if another entry point could be opened near Transport Nagar.Mayor Sandhu said, “I and MPS Kalra will take up the concerns of transporters with NHAI for providing relief to the transporters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/truckers-want-ease-of-traffic-movement-at-ludhiana-s-transport-nagar/story-tq16qpgCJptkTxpIvtQ4xL.html

Apart from this, two additional district and sessions judges were tested positive and are under treatment, it said.The reason for quarantine, the HC said was that some accused were produced in courts after their arrest and were subsequently tested positive for the disease. “The HC is functioning in a restrictive manner to prevent spread of the virus. However, due to constant representations from different quarters, the functioning is being increased. As a result, more staff is required which seems to be the reason for the outbreak in different offices of the HC. All preventive measures are being taken,” the official said. The official was referring to partial closure of seven sections at the HC after an employee’s husband was found positive for the virus on Tuesday.The high court is working in a restrictive manner since March 16. Similar is the condition in trial courts. However, a section of lawyers has constantly been demanding physical hearing of cases and increase in number of benches which take up cases through video conferencing so that more and more cases could be taken up.Physical hearing is yet to start in the high court as well as in trial courts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. The courts are mostly taking up only those cases where ‘urgency’ is required. In pending cases, lawyers have to file an application for listing in case of some urgency. However, a few categories such as bail petitions are being taken up without any prior permission for listing. The hearings in old cases listed in July have been deferred between August 1 and October 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/500-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-employees-relatives-quarantined-since-covid-19-outbreak/story-WfpIvO4b4dz75jvlbL7eIJ.html

Pointing to the latest statements from the Prime Minister on no intrusion having taken place in the region, he asked how the Chinese were now backing off without having entered Indian territory in the first place. “These are the kind of questions being raised by Rahul. Instead of answering them, the BJP-led government continues to be in denial even now,” he added.Reacting to Nadda’s criticism of Rahul for not attending a single meeting of the standing committee on defence, Amarinder questioned the relevance of this to the Galwan Valley stand-off. The committee does not take on-ground decisions relating to the battle field, he remarked, adding that it was not the standing committee which decided on sending soldiers to the borders with either no or inadequate arms and ammunition. Nor does it make policy decisions on conditions in which the soldiers should or should not open fire, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nadda-diverting-attention-from-failure-in-galwan-says-amarinder/story-2bBlhwUWdGSSe0xMatzQxI.html

For the last few days, Sikh youths have been tortured and harassed mentally in police stations. When asked about the reason behind, the cops said their mobile phones are being examined. They say these persons have shared posts on the social media.”“In the country, where accused of bomb blasts have reached parliament, you are not tolerating even this minor offence of the Sikhs. This is a deliberate attempt to harass Sikhs,” said the head of the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs.The jathedar had a few days ago asked the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to pursue the cases of pro-Khalistan operatives and provide them legal aid.Expressing concern over the Christianity expanding its base in Punjab, he said, “Followers of every religion have the right to spread their religion but doing so by giving bribes to the people is not fair. The Sikhs should be conscious of this.”The jathedar also raised the issue of slide in the number of Punjabis in government jobs. “This is happening because our religious leaders are fighting with each other. So, all the Sikhs should unite under the platform of Akal Takht Sahib.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sikhs-being-harassed-for-minor-offences-akal-takht-jathedar/story-Y7tySOAH9wyFOBgFMvoiZI.html

07-07-2020||Chandigarh||Sales dipping after end of odd-even rule, say Chandigarh shopkeepers||Shopkeepers in the city are reporting a dip in sales a week after the administration allowed shops in congested markets here to open without the odd-even rule set before.“Since all shops remain open now there is competition among shopkeepers to get more customers, because of which footfall is going down. Opening shops on all days and not on odd and even days is not bringing in more money. My sales are down 50%,” says Sanjeev Kumar, president of Patel Market in Sector 15. Earlier, the shopkeepers had sent numerous pleas to UT adviser Manoj Parida asking that the odd-even rule be removed. Expenses are piling up to add to the problem, says Narinder Singh, president of the Sector 19 Sadar Bazar. “After the odd-even rule we have been handed power bills and have to pay taxes, so things have not looked up for us. Around 20 shops rented out in Sadar Bazar have closed, and others will be shut down too if the government doesn’t provide any stimulus to traders.”Garments business hitJaswinder Nagpal, president of Shastri Market in Sector 22, says products are being marked down to attract more customers. “We kept a margin of around 15% to 20% but now we are happy if we make a 10% profit as we rarely get any customers. Most traders here sell garments but there is no demand as people choose to buy groceries. People stay home all day and many of them are also out of jobs, so buying new clothes isn’t a priority.”Meanwhile, Rajinder Singh, president of Manimajra Motor Market, remains hopeful of things improving soon. “It is important that all shops in the market stay open as different shops deal with different motor parts. The odd-even rule was causing customers some hassles. Business will pick up soon.”Echoing this sentiment, Charanjiv Singh, chairman of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, adds, “Not just in congested markets, all markets in the city have been hit in July as the number of Covid-19 cases are rising. With only a 25% demand in the market, shops must stay open while observing safety measures so that normalcy is restored in the markets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sales-dipping-after-end-of-odd-even-rule-say-chandigarh-shopkeepers/story-zPWKEcV2RpZCzdKydvnLVP.html

They are not allowed to touch the idols, enter the sanctum sanctorum, there is also no distribution of Prasad nor any kind of offerings to the deity are being allowed. Earlier, we used to apply tika or tie the holy thread on pilgrims’ wrists. But none of that is being done this time. Despite all these rules, the devotion by pilgrims is the same and that is the only thing matters, especially in such tough times,” he added.Deepak Semwal, the secretary of Gangotri Dham Committee said even though ritualistic prayers are not being offered this time, it is important to follow all the norms so that priests’ and locals remain safe.“For Gangotri, 15-16 priests are appointed every year before the portals of the shrine opens. These priests are the only ones allowed to perform prayers and other rituals for the next one year; so all the norms need to be strictly followed to keep the priests and the locals safe. If a priest gets infected then the whole ritual of offering prayers can get affected,” said Semwal.Pradeep Uniyal, priest at Yamunotri shrine, said that around four to five devotees are reaching the shrine on a daily basis.“Pilgrims who come to the shrine are only being allowed to worship from outside. No one is allowed to enter inside and there is no system of offering prayers inside the shrine this time,” Uniyal said.Harish Gaur, media in-charge of the Board, said that there is great enthusiasm among pilgrims for visiting the shrines and the organisation’s portal is constantly flooded with requests for generation of e-passes.The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board has also opened guest houses situated along the routes to the shrines so that pilgrims can stay at the nearest lodging facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/masks-sanitisation-no-prasad-char-dham-pilgrimage-in-times-of-covid-19/story-CfuqitdaPrO5eAokVVRm0M.html

07-07-2020||Chandigarh||Fee collection: Tell us how Covid-19 affected your income, with bank details: HC to parents||A section of parents, who had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking their impleadment in the dispute between parents and private schools over collection of fee, have been told by the court to file affidavits explaining how they suffered loss of income due to the Covid-19 situation. They have been asked to explain their income as per tax returns for the previous years, along with complete details of their bank accounts, fixed deposits and income from rent, etc.The parents had sought their impleadment in the petition by Independent Schools’ Association of Chandigarh, a body of 78-odd private schools in the city, which on June 22 had approached the court seeking quashing of the notification issued on June 3 under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The notification had directed educational institutions to collect only tuition fee from students till further orders.The parents filed the application for “impleadment as party to the petition” on the grounds that they were important stakeholders in the education of their children and were also aggrieved by the action of the schools in charging fee.PROVISION TO SHIFT FROM PVT TO GOVT SCHOOLSThe high court bench of justice Arvind Singh Sangwan has also asked principal secretary, department of education, UT, to file an affidavit regarding alternative arrangements, if any, made by the administration for the students, who want to leave private schools on account of their parents being unable to pay their school fee and to ensure that UT will get such students admitted in government schools. The court took note of the fact that similar arrangements had been made by the Haryana government. However, UT had not given any option to parents to withdraw their wards from private schools on account of their financial hardships, and no assurance was given that such students will be given admission in government schools in the city to ensure their right to education.Responding to the petition by schools, UT had submitted that schools can’t be allowed to feed on human misery, and UT’s notification was in response to the Covid-19 outbreak crippling the financial condition of parents. UT stated that the plea did not mention how much fee was collected by schools earlier or how many parents had already deposited the fee. Schools had also not mentioned any shortfall due to UT’s move. It further argued that majority of the schools had always propagated themselves as “smart schools”, and they did not have to spend anything extra for online classes in view of the fact that technology platforms like WhatsApp and Zoom were free and no special training was required to be imparted to teachers. The matter will now come up for further hearing on July 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fee-collection-tell-us-how-covid-19-affected-your-income-with-bank-details-hc-to-parents/story-x6UOcMyIFMlxofrWh8FJLM.html
07-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration reverts to 50% staff on rotation at UT secretariat||Only a month after it allowed 100% staff at the UT secretariat in Sector 9, the Chandigarh administration on Tuesday reintroduced rotational duties.Now, only 50% staff will be allowed at the secretariat on any given day. Employees have been asked to come to office on alternate days, and work from home on the remaining days.The decision comes after nine employees of the education department working in the additional deluxe building of the secretariat tested positive for Covid-19 in the past few days. The office of the education department was closed and staff was asked to work from home and stay in home quarantine.The administration has also been facing flak for its failure to ensure social distancing among its staff posted in the secretariat. Employees have complained that it is impossible to maintain social distance norms in the crowded office rooms.In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the administration on March 20 had mandated only 50% employees to attend office on rotational basis. However, on June 8, under the Centre’s Unlock plan, government departments were allowed to call 100% staff to office. As per the fresh order issued by the UT personnel department to all departmental heads in the secretariat: “In order to maintain social distancing to contain the spread of Covid-19, the officers/officials will attend the office of UT secretariat, alternatively on the dates (sic).”A monthly roster of duty for Group B, C and D staff has been prepared and circulated along with the order. The order specifies the dates on which different sets of officials will come, and others work from home.The officials working from home on a particularly day as per the roster have to be available on telephone and electronic means of communication at all times. They will have to attend office, if called for any exigency of work.RESTRICTIONS ON PUBLIC DEALING IN UT OFFICES ON THE CARDSThe UT administration is actively considering reducing and restricting public dealing hours in its offices. The decision will particularly impact offices such as the Registration and Licensing Authority (RLA), where a large number of people visit on a daily basis.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said: “Even though people have been asked to come after taking appointment, they throng the offices without it. A final decision on restricting public dealing hours will be taken on Wednesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-reverts-to-50-staff-on-rotation-at-ut-secretariat/story-XJ2MMvnxDNn1lPkqDFF1qK.html

The Serum Institute has currently joined hands with the university of Oxford in the UK and US-based firm Codagenix, to produce a vaccine for Covid-19.“Once the third phase is over we can give an update. Another Covid-19 vaccine candidate was rushed into the process and it was declared that the vaccine will come in earlier than anticipated, but we will make declarations only once the efficacy of the vaccine is ensured,” said Poonawalla.He also added that Serum Institute could not rush into production of vaccines which have multiple phases that need to be followed to determine the efficacy.Poonawalla was speaking at the launch of a testing machine manufactured by Mylab Discovery Solutions in Pune.The compact XL-lab-in-a-box can perform tests, including the one for Covid-19 test, which are otherwise conducted in laboratories. “The machine also seeks to minimise human intervention, thereby not only reducing human error, but also avoiding any exposure of technicians performing the procedure. The machine can test 32 samples and within one hour and prepare the PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-ready tube, which is further tested for the presence of the virus,” said Poonawalla.Mylab recently partnered with Serum institute to scale production of Covid-19 test kits which take between three-to-four hours to deliver the results.Although rapid antigen detection kits are used widely for instant results, the Rt-PCR tests are considered the standard when it comes to testing for any virus. The cost for the tests will remain at Rs 2,500 for each sample.Redraw testing guidelines: PoonawallaAdar Poonawalla called on the ICMR and the central government to come up with fresh guidelines for Covid-19 testing.“If I want to test my entire staff of 500 people, I cannot do that because of the current restrictions of testing only symptomatic people, or the need for a doctor’s prescription. Indian manufacturers have come up with multiple testing kits. Mylab alone can produce two million testing kits a week, but currently not even half of them are being used because of the demand which is only as per the current ICMR guidelines. It is true that we are not testing enough. Many companies are reporting multiple cases within their units, but they cannot conduct tests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-vaccine-by-year-end-but-not-rushing-in-serum-ceo-adar-poonawalla/story-2BuUywS7I4mHpJt2frmDlK.html

In March, the trial court in Kottayam had dismissed his discharge plea and he later moved the high court.While hearing his plea, the prosecution contended that there was strong evidence against him and he was moving petitions frequently to delay the trial. Later, justice V Shircy rejected his plea and directed him to stand trial in the case.Last month, the trial court had asked him to appear before it on July 1 but he failed, saying his house was in a containment zone in Jalandhar so he could not move out. Sister Anupama, one of the five nuns who staged a sit-in in Kochi seeking the bishop’s arrest, said she is happy with the latest development, adding she has full faith in the judicial system of the country.The case surfaced two years ago after a 43-year-old nun had complained to the police in Kottayam in central Kerala that Mulakkal had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab. But Mulakkal denied it saying he was implicated after he took action against her for financial irregularities in the convent.Later a special investigation team was formed and it arrested him in September 2018. After spending 40 days in jail, he was granted bail. He was removed from the post of the bishop later.The SIT had filed the charge sheet against him last year. There were many allegations that the accused took different tactics to delay the trial. The petitioner had also complained that some of the witnesses were threatened by the followers of Mulakkal. A special court is hearing the case in Kottayam. His counsel said he will move the Supreme Court soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kerala-hc-rejects-ex-bishop-mulakkal-s-plea-to-stay-trial-in-rape-case/story-WEaKAiQpba0H5HZrWF84bK.html

Therefore, districts which are receiving applications from farmers and others to adopt water saving measures cannot keep up with the demand.To popularise such schemes the government had announced subsidies on water conservation measures such as installing rain gun, setting up systems for drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, micro sprinkler, mini sprinkler and water pipeline.According to the soil and water conservation department, Punjab, the centre has 60 share in PMKSY and RKVY while RIDF-20 is sponsored by the state government under a National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development project.An official of the department said paddy was considered to be the most water consuming crop but the districts were struggling to provide benefit to farmers.Pleading anonymity, he said, “The Centre and state governments already had low budgets for implementation of the conservation schemes. For example, last year a district demanded Rs 1 crore after taking into account farmers’ demands, but it was sanctioned Rs 20 lakh. However this year, no district has received any funds.”Dharminder Sharma, chief conservator, soils, Punjab, said, “No scheme has been scrapped. Funds have just been deferred because of the Covid-19 situation. It’s just a delay,”Kahan Singh Pannu, secretary, agriculture department, said, “I am not aware of it. I will speak to officials concerned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-funds-for-water-conservation-as-demand-peaks-in-paddy-sowing-season/story-bZLDcREaQLIw6jeyYIXOdN.html

At least 400 workers at the plant have tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes the Covid-19 infection and seven have even succumbed to the infection till now.The factory, which is located 12km from Aurangabad, is still operational as the company management said all the necessary safety precautions at the manufacturing plant are being followed. However, unions demand a temporary closure of the plant to break the cycle of the spread of the infection.Bajaj Auto did not respond to HT’s queries about the demand for the temporary closure of the plant despite repeated attempts via the phone and email, until the time of going to print.The plant, which has approximately 8,000 workers and a total of 3,000 permanent workers, manufactures motorcycles and autorickshaws.“The number of Covid patients is on the rise at our company since last month. Work at the plant started work in mid-May. When the Unlock process started, workers who were coming to the factory also moved around the city and caught the infection. This in turn spread amongst other workers at the factory. In the beginning, there was not a single positive case at our company, but with restrictions eased, our workers held birthday programmes and participated in some social gatherings. It resulted in an increase in the number of Covid positive workers inside the plant,” said Bajirao Thengade, president of the Bajaj Auto workers’ union.As per the information given by Thegade, there are 11 departments at the plant and each department has workers who tested positive. In the motorcycle final assembly department there are 54 cases, motorcycle engine assembly has 62 cases, autorickshaw engine assembly has 36 cases, autorickshaw final assembly has 110 cases, tent shop has 29 cases, autorickshaw and four-wheeler final together has 28 cases, machine shop (two departments) has 33 positives and 23 cases respectively, among other departments.“Currently, there are 400 confirmed positive cases at our company. The company management has been providing all necessary help to the workers, taking safety precautions, but our demand is that they should find a solution to stop the spread of disease amongst the workers. Hence, we have asked the company management to close down the plant for eight to 10 days, so that the cycle breaks. We had a meeting with the management officials and conveyed our demands to them,” added Thengade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bajaj-auto-workers-union-demand-temporary-closure-of-waluj-plant-to-break-covid-cycle/story-pOMO7TNIIeRU9j6sSOPOKI.html

07-07-2020||Lucknow||Even on home turf Sonam Malik training hard for mission success||Sonam Malik jogs a few kilometers every morning from her home to the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Academy in Madina village (Sonepat) where her training partner Anshu Malik and coach Ajmer Malik wait as a matter of routine.A gruelling session lasting around three hours begins soon after as Sonam, Anshu and two male wrestlers in their weight category train on the muddy surface inside the academy.“You try and evolve different techniques when you compete with boys. This allows me to learn new techniques and it will benefit me when I face my rivals in the Asian Olympic Qualifiers next year,” said Sonam, who has beaten Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik twice in the 62kg category trials.Learning leg defense has been the main focus of the two-time World Cadet Championships gold-medallist Sonam and the best one to practice this technique is none other than World Championship bronze-medallist Anshu Malik, who had a 3-1 win record against former Pooja Dhanda in the trials here in February, mostly using leg defense.“We have been practicing together here, but still missing the national camp at Lucknow,” said Sonam, who aims to win a medal at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. “I wish to win an Olympic medal for my father Rajender, who always wanted to do something big in the sport. “Leg defense is what I need to perfect as I have seen most of the Asian wrestlers making most of this attack in their bouts.”For Sonam, things were on right track as she was getting good training at the Sports Authority of India centre here in Lucknow before the nationwide lockdown was announced due to the COVID-19.“It was really quite boring at the start of the lockdown as in absence of a rival or opponent I didn’t feel that kind of fire in me while training with a few young wrestlers at home. How long can you keep yourself motivated with only physical workouts, but as soon as unlock 1.0 came into effect I started rigorous training.”“I am now focused on my mission of qualifying for the Olympics. Uncertainty is there about the schedule of the event at Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) even when things are heading towards normalcy, and I am happy that the postponement of the qualifying event as well as Olympics has given me additional opportunity to get myself ready in a better manner,’ said Sonam, who has now been enjoying the Bollywood movies on TV at home.“During the lockdown, I watched Ajay Devgn starrer Golmaal Returns, and many more such films. Other than the physical training, watching films had been my routine now as I had no other option but to spend time at home with family members and close friends. Yes, got to eat so many home-cooked eatables like samosas.”Sonam, who had consecutive wins against Sakshi at two different trials in two months this year, knows that how much training is important for her mission Tokyo as the finalists in the qualifying events will get tickets for the Games. “It’s a situation where no one can do anything, expect staying calm and composed as you don’t know about the schedule of the qualifying event. Though I am at home, taking all precautions to maintain my food habit as a change in weight due to over-eating would make a big difference,” she said.Her father Rajender Malik, who acts as co-coach of her at all the trials and event, besides her coach Ajmer, said that staying confident for a ticket to Olympics while practicing in home conditions wasn’t easy. “I was so much worried about Sonam in the lockdown, but now it’s much relief to me as she is enjoying her training.”Rajender, who works as a store helper in a sugar mill in Gohana, said that winning a medal at Olympics has been the only dream of her daughter Sonam and his family. “It was God who brought Sonam back to the mat after she sustained injury in 2017 and kept away from sport for the six months, and I still believe that God would help her too in winning a medal at Olympics once this corona crisis is over.”Along with Sonam, four others Indian women wrestlers like Nirmala Devi (50 kg), Anshu Malik (57kg), Divya Kakran (68 kg) and Kiran (76 kg) would also be aiming for a ticket to the Tokyo Olympics at the Asian Qualifying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/even-on-home-turf-sonam-malik-training-hard-for-mission-success/story-HVQu1Br0qrhSqOsL6eCthI.html

07-07-2020||Lucknow||Why is Agra not descending from the Covid-19 peak?||‘Tero naash ho jaye corona, toone chhino Brijwasi se kachaudi aur jalebi ko dona’ (Let you be cursed corona for having snatched jalebi and kachaudi from Braj residents). Thus go the lyrics of a popular song in the Braj area in Mathura (in Agra division), which to a great extent indicate the careless attitude of the people of the region.Agra and region may be reeling under the attack of the Covid-19 pandemic but all the locals care about is their breakfast of jalebi and kachaudi. Even in containment zones, compliance of disease-prevention norms is neglected.In the unlock phase, the freedom to violate norms has become the order of the day in Agra city which has seen 88 deaths due to Covid-19 infection.Despite sweetmeat shops being allowed to open in the unlock phase, the rider attached to them is that no one be allowed to eat at these shops. They have to get the eatables packed and carry it back home. Those violating the norms are facing action but many shops in suburban areas and in the inner lanes easily serve customers who wish to eat right there.The logic food lovers gave for thronging the stalls of Agra’s famous chat and other delicacies is that freshly prepared eatables are hot and the heat kills the germs.“The awareness level in the city is not at the level required in a city which has the leading number of Covid-19 cases. Shops are asked only to pack eatables and not allow anyone to eat at the shop but those purchasing the packed item, walk a few steps and open it to have it standing in a group,” said Agra physician N K Singh.“Masks are a must when we interact but the reverse is seen. People have a mask on when they are alone but remove it once they are interacting with others. The whole purpose of a mask gets defeated. Social distancing, if considered, is simplest and the most effective weapon against Covid-19 spread but it is violated openly.“It is well established that virus spreads through droplets yet masks are not worn by many. Masks stops the droplets spreading through sneezing, coughing and while speaking, and the simple solution is wearing a mask and social distancing but even our leaders are seen violating social distancing when getting photographs clicked,” the doctor added, and asked for a strict penalty to be imposed on those violation norms.But it isn’t smooth sailing for these outlets selling the famous Braj breakfast of kachaudi and jalebi in Mathura and Aligarh, and bedain (another form of kachaudi) and jalebi in Agra.The famous Oma Kachaudi Wale at Holi Gate area in Mathura had submitted a memorandum to officials in Mathura to have shops opened for kachaudi and jalebi and are prepared to follow all unlock rules, provided shops are allowed to open at ‘proper’ breakfast timings.“We have met the city magistrate and are being assured that we will be allowed to open from 7 am which is perfect timing for having kachaudi. We are hopeful that those who relish the taste of our kachauris will return to savour their favourite breakfast,” said Oma Kachaudi Wale owner Triloki Nath Agarwal.Dauji Mishthan Bhandar (Agra) owner Jay Agarwal counts timing of opening and closing of shops as the major issue hitting sales. “We are allowed to open shops from 10 am to 8 pm. The bedain and jalebi are prepared early in the morning. If we open at 10 am, the time for breakfast has already passed,” said Agarwal.“The common man is not that inclined to take risks and this is reflected in our sales falling. We have three outlets in the city but we prepare breakfast only at Bhagwan Talkies and Nunhai. Our third outlet is in Kamla Nagar. The locality is a posh area where people are aware about safety precautions and prefer to give bedain and jalebi a miss for the sake of safety. Thus, we dropped the idea there,” Agarwal said.Bhagat Halwai (MG Road, Agra) owner Shishir Bhagat said that customer footfall is gradually increasing. “In the first 15 days after lockdown, we recorded only 15% sale but it increased to 40% after a fortnight. We do not allow anybody to eat at our shop and follow all guidelines, including wearing of aprons, head covers, and follow sanitisation procedures,” Bhagat said. The sales percentages he quoted were in comparison to pre-lockdown sales figures.“The fear of Covid-19 is fading steadily and now the administration should allow shops to close later, as the present timings of 10 am to 8 pm are not fit for summer. People usually like to move out of the house after 8 pm in summer. Further, permission should be granted to eat at shops with seating arrangements made being mindful of social distancing,” said Bhagat, who hopes for better business around Rakasha Bandhan, when shops sell ‘ghevar’ during the month of Sawan.Lokswar (a socio-cultural organisation) convenor Rajeev Gupta said, “There is much Covid-19-related fear because of which the sensible are not going out to have their favourite bedain and jalebi. There is a section which seems to be careless and is happy consuming the breakfast right at the shop, but strict action should be taken against them.“Largely, there is a lot of carelessness regarding social distancing and with markets open, violations are rampant. In Agra, Covid-19 has spread to rural areas too, but there too, masks are not a must for most villagers and such lapses are leading to the disease raging on,” Gupta said.In the last two days of June, there were about 600 marriages in Agra, and at these functions, food lovers far outnumbered those sensible enough to refuse to eat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-is-agra-not-descending-from-the-covid-19-peak/story-R0VqXyKPzeBaT4gndlDdFL.html

Many devotees on the Bihar-Jharkhand border and Giridih-Deoghar border were made to return on Monday after being denied permission to enter the religious town. Several devotees, who carried Gangajal from Sultanganj in Bihar were found offering the holy water at a pillar in Dumma on the Jharkhand-Bihar border after they were not allowed to cross the border.The administration tightened security measures after the Jharkhand high court last week denied permission for holding the annual month-long Shravani fair and opening of two temples at Deoghar and Dumka during the month of Shravan.“Devotees are turning up but there is no rush, as the message has been conveyed. Some devotees who came on Monday were not allowed to enter Deoghar,” said superintendent of police (SP) Piyush Pandey.He said they are in touch with the Bhagalpur SP, who is also making efforts to make devotees aware about the restrictions. “We are also making announcements on the Jharkhand-Bihar border, urging devotees to return, as they will not be allowed to enter Deoghar,” he said.Pandey said they have deployed security personnel at 12 entry points on the inter-state and the inter-district borders. “Five private vehicles carrying devotees were coming from Giridih district’s Bengabad area but they were made to return from the border,” he said.In the main temple premises, only priests were allowed to enter on Monday morning. Security personnel were also around the temple area.Meanwhile, Dumka administration has also sealed its border with West Bengal in a bid to stop the devotees to enter the town for offering prayers at the Basukinath temple.However, Deoghar and Dumka administrations offered virtual ‘darshan’ of Lord Shiva to devotees.Officials ensured live streaming of morning prayers and worship on both the administrations’ websites and various social media platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/devotees-made-to-return-from-deoghar-borders-on-day-1-of-shravan-rituals-stream-online/story-CQZOrfJrn2gx6mtzU1pJvK.html

07-07-2020||Delhi||Will it be safe to use public washrooms post Covid-19?||Most public washrooms can leave us with a very messy and unclean experience because of long crowded queues and dirty floors and sinks. The Covid-19 pandemic has made everyone prioritise hygiene and social distancing. People feel that using public washrooms can be unhygienic as most of them do not follow proper sanitation rules. From carrying own soaps to using tissues for touching handles, many of us have changed our ways for using a public washroom.Ruhamita Banerjee, a resident of Noida, believes that one should avoid the use of public washrooms as much as they can.“Using washrooms post Covid will be very difficult. I think products like urination devices which help women stand while urinating or disinfectant sprays will come in handy. However, I would personally try and avoid it as much as possible because we can never be sure about these things,” says Banerjee.Many have switched to carrying their own tissue papers and soap to workplace as hygiene is the major concern while using the office washroom. Aliya Kulsum, a resident of Jamia Nagar, who recently started travelling to her workplace, says, “The scenario is very different now. I cannot avoid using a washroom at my workplace but I try to take necessary precautions while using it. I always open the door using a tissue paper on the handle and I have started carrying my paper soap to avoid public soap dispensers.”Read: ‘Chasing the virus’: How Mumbai’s Dharavi beat back a pandemicPeople working at public washrooms are ensuring that full safety and precautions are taken for the general public with strict rules.Devesh Kumar Gupta, sanitary inspector, SDMC, ward number 63 Malviya Nagar, says, “We firstly sanitise the workers who come in the morning for their duties. The washrooms are sanitised properly and then washed before public use. Only two to three people are allowed inside the washroom and circles are made outside the washroom to ensure social distancing. No one is allowed to use the washroom without a mask. In case, someone is caught doing the same, there is a challan ranging from ₹100 to ₹1000. One worker is employed outside the washroom to make sure that all precautions are being taken.”Sanitary workers at various public washrooms are also following the safety protocol. “Spitting inside or outside the washroom is strictly prohibited. Even if the person is using the washroom, he is supposed to wear the mask all the time. We keep sanitising the washroom at regular intervals for safety purposes. We are also not allowed inside the washroom without gloves and mask and one person stands outside the washroom to sanitise the people who are coming to use it,” says Sachin Kumar, who is working as a sanitation worker near Malviya Nagar Market.Read: One metre or two? How social distancing affects Covid-19 riskExperts believe that there is nothing to fear about if proper precautions are taken. Diabetologist Dr Rachit Bhushan has shared tips and precautions that we can take while using public washrooms.“The precautions for using public washrooms are fairly similar to those that we would normally take. With Unlock 2.0, people have started travelling to their workplaces and it is important to take these precautions,” says Dr Bhushan.• Wash your hands: One should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and try not to touch the door on your way in or out. Instead, should use paper towels to open a door.• Carry your own sanitizer: It is very essential to carry your own bottle of sanitizer, even if it is available in the washrooms.• Avoid touching surfaces: Things like washing hands and touching as few surfaces as possible are considered standard hygienic practices and can help prevent contracting any sort of infection.• Close the lid before flushing: Make sure to close the lid of the toilet before flushing. If the toilet does not have a lid, we should keep our face away from the toilet while flushing and should exit as quickly as possible.• Social distancing: Standing in a queue with no social distancing may increase your risk of contracting the infection and then transmitting it to others. It is very important to maintain a distance while standing in a queue• Clean surfaces: One should use disinfecting wipes to clean any surfaces that small children may touch in a public washroom.

The state government, however, has not acted after that. Principal secretary (health) Uday Singh Kumawat did not respond to phone calls and text messages.A communique from Paras-HMRI, quoting its unit head Dr Ajay Singh said, “In total compliance with government orders, the hospital tries to save lives. As per government orders, any Covid case is immediately reported to the government. The Panchkula (Haryana) and Paras HEC Ranchi have been authorised to treat Covid patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pvt-hospitals-refusing-to-treat-covid-ve-staff-kin-ntpc-tells-bihar-govt/story-8lHBgvKNchLN5L1MPJ1r0H.html

Govt to issue detailed guidelines and SoP shortly. LG issues directions in high level meeting in Srinagar today,” Rohit Kansal, J&K’s spokesperson and principal secretary, tweeted late on Monday night.Very few tourists have visited the Union territory in the last year after Article 370 was revoked and the coronavirus pandemic broke.Authorities had banned the entry of foreign tourists into the region as a precautionary measure in view of the outbreak of coronavirus disease around the world.The district administration in Srinagar, which houses many of Kashmir’s prominent tourist places, ordered the closure of parks and gardens, including tourist places like Mughal Gardens, as a precautionary measure soon after the lockdown. The Srinagar Tulip Garden, one of the largest tulip gardens in Asia where over 1.3 million flowers grow, was also kept closed.Hotels, restaurants and community kitchens were also closed and there was a ban on home delivery of food. Tour operators and travel agencies were asked to share details of bookings of national as well as international air travel. They were asked to share details of all residents travelling outside India and planning to return to Srinagar through their agencies.The outbreak of disease and the subsequent measures put further burden on Kashmir’s tourism industry, which had been witnessing a downturn since August last year.Tourism nosedived last year after the government issued a travel advisory asking tourists and pilgrims to leave the Kashmir Valley, a few days before the central government revoked the special status under Article 370 and split the region into two Union territories on August 5.For months, restrictions remained in place with no internet as the region remained shut. Though the restrictions were later removed, low-speed internet was restored and the travel advisory revoked, there were hardly any tourists visiting the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jammu-and-kashmir-to-reopen-for-tourists-soon-officials/story-2394l3Eju1mPj3ZTdBs8eL.html

Their gesture was to ensure he did not get caught by the police,” he said.That was the first of many shocks for the Shukla family, he said. What is more, 25 policemen, all eyewitnesses to the killing, turned hostile one after another. In an apparent first, the investigating officer turned hostile in court. Dubey was acquitted.“Had they taken a stand then, what happened now at Bikru village could have been prevented. Their testimonies would have put Vikas Dubey in jail. Unfortunately, this did not happen,” he said.Manoj Shukla, who had pursued the case, met the then Kanpur Dehat district magistrate, the then special prosecuting officer (SPO) officers and police officials many a times during those days. “No help was extended at any stage,” Shukla alleged. The prosecution wing functions under the DM.But Manoj Shukla said he had immense faith in chief minister Yogi Adityanath and police officials who are now out to nab Vikas Dubey for killing eight policemen in cold blood. “The year 2001 was different and 2020 is different. This time, I am absolutely sure the police will get him,” he said.Additional director general, Kanpur, Jai Narayan Singh has sought all the documents related to the Santosh Shukla murder case, which is likely to be reopened. He has asked superintendent of police, Kanpur Dehat, Anurag Vats to look into Vikas Dubey’s old cases.

07-07-2020||City||Rift between Sena and NCP? Sharad Pawar visits Matoshree||Amid reports of differences between the two ruling partners in the state – Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – over the transfer of 10 IPS officers and the poaching of five Sena corporators by the latter, Sharad Pawar visited Matoshree on Monday evening to mediate on the issues. Shiv Sena insiders said the CM was upset over the two issues that created the differences and believed it would send a “wrong message” about the coalition government. Earlier in the day, Sena also decided to ditch its ruling partner for the Kalyan Panchayat Samiti and joined hands with former ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) . The BJP and Sena have shared the chairman post in the panchayat samiti for one-and-a-half years each. The Sena had four members, while the BJP had five members, and NCP had three members.“Earlier, there was an arrangement between us (Sena-NCP) since the MVA [Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi] government is in power. But the decision was changed later,” a Sena functionary from the Bhiwandi-Kalyan region said.Home minister Anil Deshmukh, too, was a part of the Monday evening meeting to clear the air over the transfers of the IPS officers, which was later stayed by the CM. Deshmukh is expected to meet Thackeray again on Tuesday over the issue, a senior functionary said. Sena leaders and ministers Subhash Desai and Eknath Shinde were also present at Matoshree.“Uddhav ji felt that poaching corporators was wrong. At least, the NCP should have brought the discontentment of the Sena corporators to the notice of the party chief. But Ajit Pawar chose to induct them. Such things give out a wrong message. Milind Narvekar has conveyed to Ajit Pawar on getting the corporators back to Sena,” said a Shiv Sena insider. This was the second meeting since Friday between Pawar and Thackeray to clear differences over the lack of coordination among the ruling allies.The CM already expressed his displeasure after Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh decided to transfer the 10 IPS officers. Though Singh has the transfer powers, the norm of consulting the CM was not followed, according to Sena insiders. The home department is with the NCP and Singh had kept home minister Anil Deshmukh in the loop. The transfer order was not only cancelled by the chief minister on Sunday but all the DCP’s were also asked to resume their previous postings immediately.“The chief minister has confined himself to his residence most of the times. This has led to communication gap between him and the other ministers. This needs to be resolved,” said a senior NCP minister.CM is also unhappy after five of his party corporators from Parner Nagar Panchayat in Ahmednagar district joined NCP in the presence of deputy CM Ajit Pawar. As per Sena insiders, Milind Narvekar, a close aide of Thackeray, spoke to Ajit Pawar on behalf of the CM to get the five corporators back in the Sena fold.There was a buzz that Ajit Pawar will also visit Matoshree. “It is unlikely that Ajit dada will go to Matoshree as Pawar saheb already visited the CM,” said a close aide of Ajit Pawar.Political experts opine that Thackeray’s style of functioning could become a bone of contention in the government. “The CM is trying to run the government the way he has been running his political party and this is the main reason for friction between the three parties. He is surrounded by a group of people and most of them are his family members. Also he has no previous experience of running a government . He doesn’t want do consult people in his cabinet ,” Prakash Bal, political expert, said, adding the government can be saved only by the NCP chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rift-between-sena-and-ncp-sharad-pawar-visits-matoshree/story-VKxXdK3Ix2QAlSo0SgjNCP.html

However, the respondents also highlighted that they feared contracting Covid-19 during the travel, flouting of protocols by fellow passengers and high air fares in the survey.The airline’s survey, which included Club Vistara members from all tier levels as well as non-members, revealed that more people (35%) will undertake travel for business instead of visiting friends, relatives 25%) or for leisure.Vistara highlighted that 57% of the Club Vistara elite (platinum and gold tier) members said they would fly in the next one month. The survey recorded that 68% respondents on the domestic sector and 74% on the international sector indicated that they are either likely to maintain the frequency of their business travel as they did in the previous year or take more flights, while the remaining said they will reduce the trips as compared to 2019.For leisure travel or visiting friends and relatives, 60% respondents said they will either maintain or increase the frequency in the domestic sector, while the same applied to 65% in the international sector - the rest are likely to reduce as against 2019.Officials at Vistara said 20% respondents planned to take their next flight to a destination outside of India. Singapore, United Kingdom and Dubai were most preferred on the list for international travel followed by the United States and Thailand.“Three of these five international destinations are already part of Vistara’s international network, which the airline plans to expand to other countries in and outside the continent as it inducts new narrow-body and wide-body aircraft,” said Vinod Kannan, chief technical officer, Vistara.A recent survey by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association of world’s airlines in 11 countries, including India, had revealed that while more than 50% air travellers said they would resume air travel only after waiting for at least six months, 95% respondents said that they would return to air travel in a year.Kapil Kaul,chief executive officer of Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) said, “As per CAPA research, we will see a gradual but slow recovery beginning from third quarter of the year in domestic sector but international sector will be seen possibly by December- subject to infection curve is flattened by September. CAPA expects continuing work from home leading later to a hybrid resumption.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/majority-fliers-likely-to-plan-their-travel-in-six-months-vistara-survey/story-ZiW8t893ApjK3oT78CCnLL.html

The pilots have requested to resort to measures undertaken by private airlines, such as cutting costs and mandatory leave without pay, to cope with the current situation.When HT contacted the airline, an Air India spokesperson said, “We would not like to comment on our internal matter.” In the letter, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), comprising Airbus (narrow body) pilots, and Indian Pilots’ Guild (IPG) comprising Boeing (wide body) pilots asked the airline to exempt class IV employees from the 10% cut on allowances as they are being affected more severely than other employees.‘..The financial burden must be fairly distributed between all employees based on their job functions and emoluments..’ the letter read.Air India currently has 1600 pilots. The pilots also asked Air India to follow private airlines in cutting costs and reducing staff from various departments at the backend that the pilots have termed as “non- relevant to the aviation business”. They pointed out that the airline has more than 1,600 staff members in its human resource and finance department for a fleet size of 125 aircraft.“This is nowhere in-line with market standards and since operations have been scaled back, their work has reduced drastically. It is prudent for Air India and MoCA [Ministry of Civil Aviation] to take cognisance of this excess manpower to trim costs as our aircraft stand under- utilised,” the letter read.They also suggested that since Air India is in financial distress, the employee strength should be brought at par with other market players through measures such as mandatory leave without pay till normal operations resume.“We request you to innovate and spare no efforts to secure the survival and financial health of the airline,” concluded the pilots.An Air India pilot said, “We are willing to take pay cuts as we want the management to deduct salaries according to the earnings of an employee (barring the class IV employees). The airline has majority of the employees in backend who not only dont report to office but are also not working. Moreover, at times when the airline is struggling to survive, there are departments that have outdoor expenses that run into crores, shouldn’t the airline cut down on such expenses in this phase? “A senior pilot of the airline said, “ We have a total of 125 aircaft of which half of them are not flying, then why do we need full strength of ground staff, engineers, pilots and cabin crew? Why is the airline paying all of us? Like other private airlines, Air India can also send employees on leave without pay for few days over and above the 10% cut that should be according to respective salary slabs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cut-costs-reduce-staff-pilots-to-air-india/story-zXqgVXkA1VFgZW3AyqzgVP.html

We will get clarity on the situation if there are more tests conducted and accordingly, solutions can be planned. No administration should hide the figures, as it will hamper the measures to handle the outbreak,” said the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader.He also asked the state government to pay attention to civic bodies that are financially weaker and in need of infrastructure and manpower.“Although the state has allotted funds to the municipal corporations, not all civic bodies are in a stable condition. The state should provide them with proper infrastructure and manpower, as the civic bodies are currently relying on private hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients,” said Fadnavis.When asked about the recent transfer orders of 10 deputy police commissioners which had been stayed by the chief minister’s office and the home minister, Fadnavis said, “Ideally, the decision related to transfer police personnel is taken by the home minister and the CM needs to be in the loop. However, in this case, it is evident that the chief minister was not aware of the police transfers. Hence the stay was announced at the eleventh hour.”Mumbai by police commissioner Param Bir Singh had recently transferred the police personnel within Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/need-more-testing-faster-results-devendra-fadnavis-in-thane/story-zd3Pe1Am8MMb34H7zorNhO.html

07-07-2020||Mumbai||Rs 630 crore spent on Covid-19, Mumbai civic corporation may have to rework budget||After spending more than Rs 630 crore on its fight against the Covid-19 outbreak, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) might have to rework on its 2020-21 budgetary allocations to meet any more expenses which are likely to incur while combating the virus spread. The civic body may, thus divert funds that were allocated for certain projects in the budget to meet Covid-related expenses.Currently, the country’s richest civic body is utilising money from the ₹850-crore contingency fund created for ‘unexpected expenditure’.“As of now, we have around Rs 220 crore of contingency funds left. A majority of the money was utilised for the creation of health facilities. If the need arises, we will start doing the internal exercise soon,” additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said.However, BMC said it has not decided how to raise more money if the contingency fund amount runs out to meet Covid-19 expenses. It informed that a decision will be taken in the coming days, if such a need arises.As per the civic body, in the past two months, the expenditure shot up drastically owing to the rising cases. Till April, the BMC spent around ₹100 crore, which surged to around Rs 480 crore by the first week of June. By the first week of July, it further surged to a total of Rs 630.Apart from the health infrastructure, the BMC spent on hotel bills for accommodation of frontline staff, recruitment of new staff on contract basis, food distribution, procuring medical equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, N95 masks, 3-ply masks, gloves, face shields, hydroxychloroquine, thermometers, body-bags, protective eye-wear, sanitisers etc. Some of these items were also received as donations in the form of corporate social responsibility (CSR) or from organisations. However, the exact quantum of the donated items is not yet known.Meanwhile, Congress corporator and leader of Opposition in the BMC, Ravi Raja, said, “We cannot comment on how the BMC can raise money for future Covid-19 expenses, considering it has not informed the elected representatives about the expenditures made yet. I have personally sought details from the officials, but they are not sharing it. We expect transparency over the expenses, and the information pertaining to it should be made available to elected representatives.”The BMC presented a budget of Rs 33,441.02 crore in February, of which ₹2 crore was allocated to upgrade the medical facilities at Kasturba Hospital. At the time, there was no Covid-19 outbreak in the city, and the capital expenditure was pegged at Rs 14,637 crore for financial year 2020-2021.A major allocation (Rs 1,600 crore) was made for the roads department, followed by the bridges department (Rs 799 crore). The civic body had to dip into its reserved funds of Rs 79,829 crore by withdrawing from it for infrastructure projects and has decided to draw out Rs 4,380 crore from it this year.The other major allocations were made for development plan 2034 (₹3,248 crore), health (₹4,260 crore) and education (₹2,944 crore). For the coastal road project, an allocation of around ₹2,000 crore was made, while for the proposed Goregaon-Mulund Link Road, the civic body reserved ₹300 crore. The budget made allocations worth ₹506 crore for the proposed Gargai Dam in Palghar district.In a first, the civic body also opened a tourism department and allocated funds worth ₹183 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/630-crore-spent-on-covid-19-mumbai-civic-corporation-may-have-to-rework-budget/story-BMFKN7B1D6C88sqVyyfVpM.html

07-07-2020||City||Maharashtra’s exchequer earns ₹16K-crore in June||After tax revenue losses of more than ₹45,000 crore between March and May owing to the Covid-19 lockdown, the state earned ₹16,000 crore in June, reducing the deficit to 20% from 40-50% of the target. The improvement is attributed to pending activities carried out in the real estate and commercial sectors, after they were opened up from late May.The state government had sustained a loss of ₹26,000 crore in March, ₹10,100 crore in April and around ₹12,000 crore in May against the estimated revenue from various sectors, including goods and services tax (GST), stamp duty and registration, excise on liquor, among others. Although the estimated monthly revenue from tax is ₹22,000 crore, it goes over ₹45,000 crore in March, as it is the last month of the financial year. The revenue was ₹10,261 crore and ₹11,000 crore in April and May, respectively. “The revenue for June was 20% less than the projected revenue for the month. The losses were less because of the relaxations of lockdown and mainly because piled up activities in various sectors were carried out in June. Many had purchased houses and vehicles, but registrations were stuck due to the sudden lockdown in March. These formalities were completed as soon as the offices opened. Similarly, the shops and establishment department cleared their inventory leading to GST payments. This may not be witnessed in of July unless more industrial-commercial activities are allowed immediately,” said an official from the finance department.The monthly bill of the mandatory expenses is around ₹20,000 crore, including salary, establishment cost, interest on loans and incidental expenditure. The state has borrowed more than ₹25,000 crore in April, May and June to meet the fixed expenditure owing to the drop in revenue. Besides the fixed expenditure, the spending on Covid-19 pandemic and relief package for Cyclone Nisarga-hit districts too contributed to high borrowings. The budgeted estimated annual borrowings were ₹56,697 crore.According to the officials, they have received most of the dues from the Centre towards devolution of Central taxes, grants and GST compensation. The state government has already initiated a 67% cut on spending on development and social schemes worth about ₹70,000 crore, which is the amount equivalent to the expected revenue losses. The budgetary estimates for the tax revenue receipts for 2020-21 were ₹2.73 lakh crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-s-exchequer-earns-16k-crore-in-june/story-ccQzAXaBjzMo6Aphsf5IiL.html
07-07-2020||City||Chembur tops Mumbai’s Covid-19 fatality rate||At 8.3%, M-West ward, which covers the city’s eastern suburb of Chembur with localities namely Mahul and Tilak Nagar, reported the highest Covid-19 fatality rate among all 24 administrative wards, according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data as of July 4. Fatality rate is the percentage of deaths due to Covid-19 compared to the total cases. The city’s average fatality rate is 5.5% and the state’s average is 4.3%.M-West ward has recorded 2,526 coronavirus cases and 212 deaths so far. It is followed by H-East ward, which covers areas of Bandra East and Khar, including chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s residence Matoshree. The ward has a fatality rate of 8.2%, with 3, 587 cases and 297 deaths. Fatality rate of Kurla-Sakinaka and Govandi Mankhurd wards is also high at 8.1% each. While Kurla has reported 4,257 cases and 349 deaths; Govandi-Mankhurd have recorded 3,273 Covid cases and 266 deaths. A fatality rate of 8% indicates eight deaths for every 100 cases in those wards. Other wards with high fatality rate are G-North (Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim) with 7.3%, K-East ward (Andheri and Jogeshwari) with 6.2%. G-North ward has recorded 379 deaths, the highest number of deaths, followed by K-East ward with 351 deaths. Meanwhile, areas with lower fatality rates are A ward (Churchgate-Nariman Point) with 2.5%, R-South ward (Kandivli) with 2.7% and T ward (Mulund) with 2.9%.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “A major cause for concern is the delay in reporting of symptoms to the health centres. The first 24 hours after the start of symptoms are critical and immediate medical attention has proved to be helpful. However, there are many cases where patients do not tell their family members or do not seek medical treatment in time which should not be the case.”Kakani said the ‘Save Lives’ strategy is in place to ensure a decrease in the overall fatality rate. “Firstly, categorisation of critical, moderate and mild patients is important. Treatment protocol includes more detailed monitoring and supervision of critical patients, including video surveillance by the head of the unit and head of the hospital. The protocol has been conveyed to all health units.”On June 30, BMC launched ‘Save Lives’ to reduce the fatality rate. BMC had noted that several deaths occurred between 1am and 5am, often when serious and critical patients disconnect oxygen support and leave their beds to go to the toilet. They end up straining themselves and collapse. As part of the Save Lives strategy, the civic body decided to keep a bedpan for every bed and a commode near every four beds and instructed all healthcare staff to cooperate with patients who want to use the toilet at night. Several other such measures were introduced as part of the strategy for all health centres.On Monday, Mumbai reported 1,200 cases, bringing the total case count to 85,724. The city saw 39 deaths, taking the toll to 4, 938. According to state’s data, a total of 57, 152 patients have been treated so far. The recovery rate is 67% and the doubling rate is 44 days. A total of 3.59 lakh tests have been done till Sunday. Meanwhile, Dharavi reported 11 new cases on Monday, taking the total to 2, 334.Meanwhile, CM Uddhav Thackeray will inaugurate 3,520 beds at Covid care centres on Tuesday. The CCCs are at Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg in Mulund, an initiative of CIDCO with a bed capacity of 1700; a 900-bed dedicated Corona Health Center (DCHC) at Dahisar East in collaboration with Mumbai Metro; a dedicated Corona Hospital at Dahisar West with 108 intensive care units (ICU) beds, a dedicated Corona Health Center (DCHC) at Mahalaxmi Race Course with 700 beds, and the second phase of the Covid health centre at Bandra-Kurla Complex, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, with 112 ICU beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chembur-tops-mumbai-s-covid-19-fatality-rate/story-wbD2XP1r0gNAT38WyNydmK.html
07-07-2020||City||Rebel SAD leader Dhindsa set to float new party today||More than a year after upping the ante against the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa is set to announce a new political outfit on Tuesday.The party is likely to be named ‘Shiromani Panthik Dal’, it is learnt.“Had Sukhbir (Badal) owned up the responsibility for the Akali Dal’s defeat in the 2017 election assembly polls and protected the Panth by punishing the guilty of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib, I would have not taken this step. For me, Panth and Punjabiat are the foremost. Under Sukhbir’s leadership, the SAD has forgotten its original agenda and lost its base. The Punjabis need a platform to save the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and other institutions,” said Dhindsa, who was in Patiala for joining of Congress leader Tajinderpal Singh Sandhu his camp.He said SAD patriarch and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in the know of every misdeed in the party and the SGPC, but he kept his eyes closed to protect Sukhbir.Dhindsa, who had quit all party posts in September 2018 in the wake of a revolt in the SAD, said the same mafia which was ruling the roost during the SAD-BJP regime by exploiting mining resources besides dominating the liquor trade etc, is flourishing under the Congress now. There is the need to replace both the Congress and the SAD to usher in a new era of development in Punjab, he added.Last week, Shiromani Akali Dal (Taksali) chief Brahmpura had offered Dhindsa to take over the party, but the latter declined to do so.“My fight is to liberate the SGPC from the clutches of wrong people. Everyone who saw the Badal family as a threat to the Panth should support us. The party workers will decide our future tie-ups,” said Dhindsa.He said that Badals have exploited the SGPC for their personal benefits. On the langar scam, he said there should be stringent punishment for misuse of the offerings of devotees by making forged bills.“The SGPC should dismiss all those guilty,” he said.On Khalistan, the Rajya Sabha MP said he did not support any such demand. “We will fight for rights of Punjabis, but will not go against the country,” he added.UNFOLDING OF REBELLION Sept 29, 2018: Dhindsa quits all party posts, including that of general secretary and member of the core committee, in the wake of a revolt against SAD leadership by veteran Akali leaders.Oct 19, 2019: The Rajya Sabha MP resigns as the leader of SAD in the Upper House of Parliament.Jan 3, 2020: His son and former Punjab minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa resigns as SAD legislative party leaderJan 12, 2020: SAD suspends Dhindsa, his son Parminder for anti-party activitiesFeb 3, 2020: SAD expels the father-son duo for rebellion against party||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rebel-sad-leader-dhindsa-set-to-float-new-party-today/story-P3nyVXAGvmkThL5s65FBnO.html
07-07-2020||City||One killed, 3 injured in firing as nihangs clash over dera control||One person was killed and three were injured in firing during a clash between two groups of nihangs over the possession of a dera at Baba Bakala town of the Amritsar district in the wee hours of Monday.Police said the clash took place at 3.30am when a group of 40 nihangs led by Ranjit Singh Rania attacked the Dera Nihang Ajit Singh Poohla and tried to take possession of it.The Rania faction has identified the deceased as Sukhraj Singh of Lohar village while the injured are Tejpal Singh and Satnam Singh of Baba Bakala town, and Harjit Singh of Basrawa village in Gurdaspur district.A police team, which was there at the dera, had a close shave in the firing, a senior official said, adding that 50 rounds were fired from both sides.“The police team had a close shave as firing was indiscriminate. Another team led by Baba Bakala deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Harkrishan Singh reached the spot and arrested 10 nihangs of the Rania group. Rania along with his supporters, all armed to the teeth, reached the dera and started firing. The dera men opened fire in retaliation,” superintendent of police (operations) Shailendra Singh said. Three rifles were recovered from them.Currently the dera, which was the residence of Ajit Poohla, is in the possession of Poohla’s octogenarian mother Surinder Kaur, sister Paramjit Kaur and her son Dilpreet Singh Dimpy.“A mob of nihangs raeched outside the dera and started indiscriminate firing. A team of police was also present in the dera apprehending the attack as we had already lodged a complaint against Rania. The police team also retaliated,” Dimpy said.About the dera men’s role in the firing, as claimed by the police, Dimpy said, “We have weapons, but we didn’t open fire as the police personnel were there for our protection.”He said, “Rania was a rival of Poohla and now he has been claiming to be his successor. Rania had once filed a complaint against Poohla for issuing him life threat. A property dispute between Rania and Poohla’s mother is already pending in a revenue court in Chandigarh.”Gurcharan Singh, a member of the Rania faction, said, “The dera belongs to Rania who is the successor of Poohla. Our nihangs had gone to the dera on Monday morning when those present inside the dera opened firing on us. No one from our side opened firing. Of the four of our nihangs injured in the firing, one succumbed due to excessive bleeding.”He alleged that police have not been taking action against those who opened fire in which one Nihang Sikh was killed.DSP Harkrishan said as per the initial reports, three persons were injured in the incident, but they have not got “any written information” from the health department in this regard.Rania claims himself to be the chief of Nihang Tarna Dal (Missal Bhai Taru Singh) after the death of Ajit Singh Poohla. The self-proclaimed leader of Tarna Dal, Poohla, was notorious for alleged brutal killing of family members of Sikh militants besides rape of women. In 2008, he was burnt alive in the Amritsar jail.The police have registered a case against Rania and his supporters under Sections 307 (murder attempt) 452 (house trespass), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of duty), 458 (housebreaking by night after preparation for hurt), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 188 (disobedience to order) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act.SP Shailendra said no one from the Rania group had lodged a complaint against the rival faction so far. “We haven’t received any information about the injured and the dead from any health official,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-killed-3-injured-in-firing-as-nihangs-clash-over-dera-control/story-Jw9oM8jrTcieJPKjP63uFJ.html
07-07-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana freezes dearness allowance at current rate for one year||Haryana government on Monday decided to freeze the dearness allowance (DA) of its employees and dearness relief (DR) of the pensioners at the current rates till July 2021.Though the state government will continue to pay DA and DR at the current rate of 17%, the employees and the pensioners will not be paid arrears of these allowances from January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. Confronting an acute financial crisis while battling Covid-19, freezing employees’ DA at the current rate that was due from January 1, 2020, is yet another desperate step of the Manohar Lal Khattar government to squeeze its expenditure. There are about 3.5 lakh employees across 38 departments, boards and corporations of the state . The salary bill of the employees is about Rs 1,870 crore per month and pension bill is about Rs 770 crore per month.Before the lockdown was imposed in March, Haryana was a revenue-surplus state. After that, the state has been struggling to meet the committed liabilities and releasing salary and pension in a staggered manner.The financial crisis has forced the government to impose a ban on the purchase of new vehicles, besides deferring all new recruitments for government jobs for a year. On Monday, the finance department sent a letter to the heads of department, divisions and deputy commissioners, informing them about the freezing of DA and DR at current rates. “In view of the crisis arising out of Covid-19, it has been decided that additional instalment of DA payable to Haryana government employees and dearness relief to Haryana government pensioners, due from January 1, 2020, will not be paid,” the department said.“However, DA and DR at the current rate of 17% will continue to be paid,” the finance department added. When the decision to release the future instalment of DA and DR due from July 1, 2021 is taken, the rates of DA and DR as effective from January 1, 2020, July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021 will be restored ‘prospectively’ and will be subsumed in the cumulative revised rate effective from July 1, 2021. After the Covid-19 outbreak, Haryana has been heavily relying on market borrowings. An official said the revenue shortfall in March was about Rs 2,400 crore and it went past Rs 4,100 crore in April. Such is the financial crisis that recently, chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora urged all administrative secretaries to explore austerity measures, saying the economy of the state was enduring an ‘enormous setback’ due to the lockdown and the state was facing an ‘unprecedented resource crunch’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-freezes-dearness-allowance-at-current-rate-for-one-year/story-A0pofy295aocIwoWWlhAJN.html

07-07-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana cabinet okays drafting of ordinance on pvt sector job quota||For the second time in the past five months, the Haryana cabinet on Monday deliberated on a piece of draft legislation to provide reservation in private-sector jobs and gave a go-ahead for drafting an ordinance in this regard after fresh vetting by the law secretary.The move to introduce reservation for local youth in private-sector jobs is on the lines of a law enacted by the YS Jaganmohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh, which has been challenged on the question of constitutional validity in the Andhra Pradesh high court.While the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), the coalition partner of the BJP in Haryana, had made a commitment to provide 75% quota in private-sector jobs to Haryana youth in its poll manifesto, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had sounded non-committal on the prospect of enacting a law to provide such reservation. Though Khattar has been emphatic that the government will go ahead with the proposed quota in private jobs, sources close to him say the proposed bill in this regard might be watered down to ensure there is no pressure on the industry.On February 7, the chief minister had made a reference to hiring unskilled workers by the industry, thus indicating that the proposed reservation could only be for the unskilled workers.“It will not be mandatory for the industry and enterprises to implement the quota. Also, if the industry is not able to get 75% workers from Haryana, they will be at liberty to hire from outside the state,” the CM had said in February. CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY ISSUEHaryana’s law secretary, while examining the draft bill sent for vetting by the cabinet on January 31, had raised objections on the constitutional validity of the proposed law.The issues primarily pertaining to Article 14 and 19 (1)(g) of the Constitution were deliberated upon by the cabinet on Monday and the draft was yet again sent to the law secretary for vetting. Article 14 pertained to equality before law and Article 19 (1)(g) provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.The proposed ordinance titled Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Ordinance, 2020, will provide 75% of the new employment to local candidates for jobs having salary less than Rs 50,000 per month in private companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms and partnership firms situated in the state.However, employers will have the option to recruit local candidates from one district to the extent of only 10%. The proposed law will also contain an exemption clause if suitable local candidates are not available for a particular category of industry. PASSAGE NOT TO BE SMOOTHEven after the proposed legislation receives the assent of the governor, it will have to be sent to the Presidential assent as the labour-related matters are in the concurrent list of the Constitution. “The Government of India may not be keen on the enactment of such a legislation,” said an official. The BJP government at the Centre has a very different view on the issue.In response to an unstarred question on whether the government proposes to formulate any scheme to implement reservation in appointment in private companies, the then Union minister of state for commerce and industry, CR Chaudhary, had told the Lok Sabha in March 2018 that a coordination committee for affirmative action for scheduled castes and tribes in the private sector was set up in 2016 by the department of industrial policy and promotion of the central government. In accordance with the decisions of the committee, apex industry associations — Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) — prepared a voluntary code of conduct for member companies centered on education, employability, entrepreneurship and employment to achieve inclusion. Former Union MoS for social justice and empowerment Vijay Sampla had in response to an unstarred question on whether the government intends to provide reservation in jobs to persons belonging to the SC/ST category in the private sector had told the Rajya Sabha in May 2016 that there was no such proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-cabinet-okays-drafting-of-ordinance-on-pvt-sector-job-quota/story-yJJlpIjoXdy8Yms6DBEisM.html

Ltd, and also issued an undertaking stating that they will not use the term “Iskcon” anywhere in its trade name or trade mark.The court also declared that Iskcon is a “well-known trademark”, which enjoys considerable protection under provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.Iskcon had moved HC permanent injunction against Iskcon Apparel Pvt Ltd from infringing its registered trade mark. Iskcon’s lawyers submitted that apart from being its abbreviated name, they have got the term “Iskcon” registered as a trademark and other marks containing “Iskcon” as one of their leading, essential, distinctive and prominent feature in respect of various goods or services.It was further submitted that there are more than 600 Iskcon temples, 65 eco-farm communities, 110 vegetarian restaurants all over the world, including in India. Its counsel added that the organisation has taken efforts and spent substantially on publicity and advertisement to promote and popularise the mark, “Iskcon”, and this fulfils all the requirements of a well-known trademark under the Trade Marks Act, 1999.Justice BP Colabawalla accepted the claims. “Since it is a coined trademark which is associated exclusively with the plaintiff, it undoubtedly deserves the highest degree of protection,” said the judge, adding that the material submitted by the petitioner body evidently showed that the mark Iskcon has acquired immense and long-standing reputation and goodwill throughout India and abroad, and therefore deserved to be declared a well-known trademark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/apparel-firm-tells-hc-it-will-not-use-iskcon-in-name-or-trademark/story-ffJnvPjRuWVjORBVqTxfHO.html

07-07-2020||Mumbai||Maha police death toll rises to 70; 43 from city||The number of personnel in the Mumbai Police who tested positive for Covid-19 continued to rise on Monday, with the total now at 2,975. Of the total cases, 535 personnel are currently undergoing treatment, while 2,397 have recovered. The number of fatalities in the city police force stands at 43, while the toll for the state police force has reached 70 after three more personnel from Mumbai, Thane and Amravati died.Among the new cases in the Mumbai Police, a senior inspector from Bandra police station and two assistant inspectors of the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) tested positive for Covid-19.According to Bandra police officers, the senior inspector’s driver had fever and tested positive for the virus, following which the senior inspector also got tested. His result arrived on Saturday. “The senior police inspector is asymptomatic and is in home quarantine,” said an officer.In another case, a 57-year-old police head constable’s son has complained to Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Twitter, alleging that his father, who is due for retirement in 10 months, contracted the virus due to negligence of the department. He also claimed that five other members of his family also got infected because of it. He said that though his father was aged above 55 and was exempted from duty, he was called on duty by the police station in-charge and deputed in containment zones.However, senior police officers denied the allegation stating that a departmental inquiry was already conducted into the case and the allegations are baseless. “The government resolution issued in June asked all government employees to come on duty at least once a week. The senior police inspector followed this and called the head constable to be on duty. The head constable was never assigned duty in any risky area. He is suspected to have contracted the virus from the building he was staying in which had infected people. The building has been sealed now. All rules were followed properly and the allegations are baseless. The police station in-charge did not flout any rule,” said Ravindra Patil, assistant commissioner of police (Kurla division), who conducted the inquiry in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-police-death-toll-rises-to-70-43-from-city/story-2jv0sTiieoJeUTfrwEwdJP.html
07-07-2020||Mumbai||HC allows termination of unborn child with defects, asks state to bring up child if born||The Bombay high court after permitting a couple to terminate a pregnancy in the 28th week due to defects in the child on a condition that they would take care of the child if it was born alive, has relaxed the condition and put the onus of taking care of the child on the government, if the couple was unable to do so or afford its treatment.The HC modified its order after the couple brought to the notice of the bench that an earlier order had asked the government to take care of children born with defects, if the parents did not want to take care of it or afford its expenses. A division bench of justice KK Tated and justice Milind Jadhav on June 30 had permitted a couple to medically terminate a 28-week pregnancy after the report from the medical board confirmed that the neurological anomalies would be a threat for the child after it was born, and hence the termination should be permitted. The petitioning couple through advocate Ruchita Padwal had said that despite the advanced stage of pregnancy they wanted to go for the termination, as it would cause mental agony and trauma for the mother after the child was born.Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan for the state submitted that as the medical board had given a nod for the termination, the state did not have any objection.After hearing the submission, the court had passed an order permitting the termination. The court had, however, put a condition that if the child survived after termination, the couple would have to take responsibility for the child.However, on July 3, Padwal approached the court again and submitted that the condition stipulated by the court in the June 30 order could not be complied with by the couple. She also drew the attention of the bench to an earlier order of justice AS Oka wherein he had put the onus of taking care of children born with defects after a termination procedure on the state government and hence the current order should be modified.After hearing the submissions, while speaking to minutes the court directed the deletion of the paragraph which put the responsibility of the child on the parents and said, “In case, if the child is born alive and if the petitioner and her husband are not willing or are not in a position to take responsibility of such a child then the state and its agencies will have to assume full responsibility for such a child.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-allows-termination-of-unborn-child-with-defects-asks-state-to-bring-up-child-if-born/story-m16LgXGbvgMdAowraIrbPP.html

A missing person complaint was filed by Kapurbawdi police on Monday, after the missing person’s family approached the police. The missing person, a Kalwa resident, requires a walker or support to walk.“We have filed a missing complaint after the relatives of the person approached us with their complaint on Monday evening. We have set out teams to search for the individual,” said Sanjay Nimbalkar, inspector, Kapurbawdi police station. According to the complaint, the authorities on Sunday informed the person’s family members that they could not find him. However, officials of the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) refused to comment on the matter.“My father-in-law tested positive on June 29 and was admitted to Global Hub Corona Hospital. All the other family members were quarantined. The next day we were told that he was feeling better, but we did not receive any calls from the hospital after that. Upon calling the reception, we were told that he was fine and they told us his bed number and floor. However, after a few days they started giving vague answers, following which we contacted a doctor who visits the hospital. The doctor said she could not find him in the hospital,” said his daughter-in-law.The family then approached a local resident organisation, Thane Matdata Jagran Abhiyaan. “After they approached us, we tried to get in touch with the authorities and the hospital. However, no one knew about the whereabouts of this patient. After getting permission, one family member was allowed to enter the hospital wearing PPE kits to search for the patient. They looked everywhere but he was nowhere to be found. This is when we approached the police station and filed a complaint,” said Chetana Dixit, secretary of the organisation.Global Hub Corona Hospital is a 1,024-bed facility which was recently inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/72-year-old-paralysed-covid-patient-goes-missing-from-hospital/story-YcBtVnDCNtVNNoanmE9NXN.html

07-07-2020||Mumbai||Mithibai College allows students to pay hiked fees in instalments||Mithibai College in Vile Parle has allowed some of its students to pay their fees in instalments after students and political parties raised complaints over a hike in fees despite orders from the University Grants Commission (UGC) and University of Mumbai (MU).On June 29, HT had reported that the college run by Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal (SVKM) charitable trust had hiked its fees for second- and third-year students. Following the announcement, student bodies of political parties such as Yuva Sena of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena and Student Islamic Organisation had taken the matter up with the management of the institute and the state Fee Regulatory Authority, respectively.While Mithibai College has increased the fees by up to 30%, students had sought an option to pay their fees in instalments as the income of their families had been affected owing to the lockdown. On Monday, students were informed that those with genuine reasons for inability to pay fees will be allowed to pay in parts. “Students have to write to the heads of their departments and the principal stating reasons if they are unable to pay their fees. The college will then verify the claim and approve it on a case-to-case basis,” said a third-year student on the condition of anonymity. “All decisions in the college are taken by the principal. I cannot comment on the same,” said Asoke Basak, chief executive officer of SVKM. Rajpal Hande, principal of the college, did not respond to calls and messages.The college had given a four-day window to students for making payments between June 27 and 30, which was later extended till July 6. However, students said that this was against the letter issued by UGC, the apex governing body of all higher educational institutes, on May 27 wherein it had asked all universities and colleges to be sympathetic towards students while asking them to pay tuition and other fees. Subsequently, MU instructed all colleges, including autonomous ones, to not hike fees for the academic year 2020-21 and allow students to pay fees in instalments. Meanwhile, Yuva Sena has written to state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant to issue a circular to all colleges and universities in the state to provide the option of part payment of fees and consider reduction of fees in view of the Covid-19 situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mithibai-college-allows-students-to-pay-hiked-fees-in-instalments/story-0atxgkM7AOk3kEsPU1V40L.html

On Monday, HUL which recently announced that it was rebranding its fairness cream ‘Fair & Lovely’ to ‘Glow & Lovely’ and the same product for men would be called ‘Glow & Handsome’ approached the HC seeking a limited ad-interim relief against the statements by Emami that it would take legal recourse as it claimed to have trademark rights over the rebranded name used by HUL.A bench of justice B P Colabawalla, while hearing the commercial intellectual property suit filed by HUL against Emami, was informed by advocate Hiren Kamod that HUL sought urgent hearing of the matter for the limited purpose that ‘the defendant (Emami) should give at least 7 clear days prior written notice to the plaintiff (HUL) before initiating any legal proceedings in any court or claiming any interim or ad-interim reliefs against the plaintiff as threatened in the statements issued/made on behalf of the defendant (Emami) against the plaintiff’s (HULs) use of the trade mark ‘Glow & Handsome’.Kamod submitted that HUL had adopted the trademark ‘Fair & Lovely’ in 1975 and in 2006 adopted the trademark ‘Fair & Lovely, Men’ which was later changed to ‘Men’s Fair & Lovely’. HUL acquired the requisite trademarks too.Kamod further stated that in September 2018 after thorough research in the Register of Trade Marks, HUL coined and adopted the trademarks ‘Glow & Lovely’ and ‘Glow & Handsome’. Multiclass applications for the same were filed with the Registrar of Trade Marks. After the Registrar raised an objection, HUL filed an appeal before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board. Kamod stated that the appeal is pending.In June 2020, Kamod submitted that another fresh set of applications were made by HUL with the Registrar of Trade Marks to register the trademark labels ‘Glow & Lovely’ and ‘Glow & Handsome’ in classes 3 and 5 on proposed to be used basis. Following this, HUL on July 2 announced its decision to rebrand ‘Fair & Lovely’ to ‘Glow & Lovely’ and the men’s skin care range to ‘Glow & Handsome’.Kamod stated that after the announcement was made, Emami issued statements threatening to adopt legal action against the plaintiff for violating the defendant’s alleged rights in its mark ‘Emami Glow and Handsome’. He further submitted that the statements issued by Emami are unjustifiable and groundless within the meaning of section 142 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and that their claim is false and misconceived.In light of these submissions, Kamod said HUL was seeking limited ad interim relief that Emami should issue them seven days prior notice for any legal proceedings it was initiating against HUL.After hearing the submissions, justice Colabawalla allowed the relief and directed Emami to serve seven days prior notice to HUL about any legal proceedings it intended to take with regards to the marks in dispute and posted the hearing of the suit on July 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-restrains-emami-from-taking-legal-recourse-against-hul-without-serving-notice/story-C3EhrdjNS8Q5rKhc09jaTM.html

07-07-2020||Chandigarh||DISAPPEARANCE CASE: Ex-Punjab DGP Saini’s interim bail extended till July 8||MOHALI The court additional district and sessions judge Sanjay Agnihotri on Monday extended the interim bail of former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini till July 8 in the case pertaining to the disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani, a Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO) employee, in 1991. The case was registered against Saini on May 6 this year.The hearing was held in the duty court of Agnihotri as the main judge, Rajnish Garg, was on leave. Citing that the case hearing was transferred to the court of Garg and as the court was not functioning today, the case was heard in the court of duty magistrate, so by the consent of counsels of defence and prosecution, the case hearing be put forth the transferee court of ADJ Garg and the interim bail orders may continue till July 8. Upholding the arguments given by the special public prosecutor Sartej Singh Narula, the district and sessions judge Rajinder Singh Rai on July 4 allowed the application seeking transfer of the case from additional district and sessions judge Monika Goyal’s court and assigned to the court of ADJ Rajnish Garg.The decision on quashing the anticipatory bail under Section 302 of the IPC will also come up for hearing in the court of ADJ Rajnish Garg. In the previous hearing, Narula had argued that the ADJ’s court had ignored the facts and gravity of the offense while discussing the merits of the case and the interim bail has been granted in a blanket manner. Narula said that prosecution has been pressing that in the enthusiasm to grant the anticipatory bail to former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, the court of ADJ unduly diluted the considerations that were required to imminently be considered. “Now, we will present the statement of eyewitness Gursharan Kaur Mann, which she recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC corroborating illegal detention and inhuman torture of Balwant Singh Mulatani at the hands of Saini while seeking cancelation of interim bail granted in anticipation of involving 320 of the IPC,” said Narula.Multani was allegedly picked up by two officers in 1991 after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then Chandigarh SSP, in which four policemen in his security posse were killed. The police later claimed that Multani had escaped from the custody of the Qadian police.Former DSP Baldev Singh Saini, inspector Satvir Singh, sub-inspectors Har Sahai Sharma, Jagir Singh and Anoop Singh and ASI Kuldip Singh were also named in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/disappearance-case-ex-punjab-dgp-saini-s-interim-bail-extended-till-july-8/story-QmURwHwfWHqNZH9KRXIOeN.html

07-07-2020||Mumbai||4,457 beds in government medical colleges across Maharashtra||With rising number of cases from districts outside Mumbai, the medical education department has increased the bed strength in all 19 government-run medical colleges across the state to 4,457 as of July 5, from around 2,000 as of May 1. Districts namely Nagpur and Aurangabad have the highest number of Covid-19 beds in medical colleges. Health activists, however, said the number is not enough.On June 11, the state recorded over 1 lakh patients and crossed the 2-lakh mark in less than a month later on July 2. Till Sunday, Mumbai recorded a total of 84,524 Covid-19 patients, while the remaining 60% of the state’s total of 2,06,619 came from other districts. As cases have plateaued in Mumbai, the state is now focusing on Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, among others, which are recording a gradual surge. The state medical education department has 19 medical colleges across 16 districts in the state—Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nanded, Solapur, Akola, Aurangabad, Gondia, Jalgaon,Sangli, Kolhapur, Dhule, Yavatmal, Beed, Latur and Chandrapur. Of the 4,557 beds, 741 are for patients in intensive care units (ICU), 385 with ventilator support and remaining 3,331 are oxygen-supported beds for moderately ill patients. “We have observed that only 5% of the patients require a ventilator. Almost 80% of the patients with breathing difficulties recover with oxygen support. So, we have over 3,000 beds with oxygen facilities,” Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary of Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD). “On a daily basis, we try to expand the number of beds to accommodate more patients.”Mumbai has 400 beds at government-run St George and GT hospitals that come under Grant Medical College (GMC), Mumbai, which is also called JJ Hospital. Pune has 266 beds in BJ Medical College and GMC in Baramati. At Nagpur, where cases have surged from 139 on May 1 to 1,719 till July 5, there are 1,124 beds at the Government Medical College (GMC) and Indira Gandhi Medical College. Aurangabad, with 6,568 cases as of July 5, has 566 beds at the GMC. On May 1, Latur recorded only 12 cases which till July 5 surged to 388. To treat patients at the district, the Vilasrao Deshmukh Institute of Medical Science has set up 388 beds. The medical education has installed 285 beds at the GMC-Miraj in Sangli, where 315 Covid-19 cases have been recorded. Since April, the medical education department has been setting up beds in all government colleges, even in districts like Beed, Chandrapur and Gondia which didn’t have any Covid-19 patients then. “In May, the Central team criticised us for investing resources in districts which had minimal cases. But as we had kept the health infrastructure ready in our colleges, we could conduct tests and provide immediate treatment to migrants,” said a senior officer from Directorate of Medical Education (DMER). “It also helped control the fatality rate.”Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor of NGO Jan Aarogya Abhiyan, said Jalgaon has only 205 beds, despite 4,000 cases and 278 deaths till Sunday. “Jalgaon district has turned out to be the epicentre for Covid-19, with a fatality rate of almost 6.5%. In districts like Latur and Beed, if the cases increase, the fatality rate might rise further, owing to other factors such as malnutrition,” said Dr More.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-457-beds-in-government-medical-colleges-across-maharashtra/story-8ggY5R8TYMUHRll7i6630O.html

The shows were very popular among Amritsar residents and also the intelligentsia of Lahore. Pakistan is covering Amritsar through a number of FM and medium-wave transmitters but India is unable to cover Lahore now. This is a wakeup call for Prasar Bharati,” said Harjap Singh Aujla, a retired engineer in Amritsar.Kulwant Singh Ankhi, patron of Amritsar Vikas Manch, an NGO, said, “Earlier, the problem was that the original 1,000-ft high tower, through which a larger audience could be reached, was not being commissioned. Now, the suspension of Urdu programming has created a new problem.”Aujla adds that the non-commissioning of the high-tower is a waste of resources as AIR is able to reach only 25% of the population it is supposed to cover in the area on both sides. He says that officials cite a slight bend in the upper portion of tower for its disuse.Santosh Rishi of the All-India Radio, Jalandhar, who manages the Gharinda tower, says, “The Urdu programming, which was relayed by the Delhi office, has gone off air temporarily due to the pandemic outbreak. The staff is currently unable to rejoin office. We have written to the Delhi office to resume the service, but we cannot say anything on when it will be resumed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pandemic-brings-air-s-urdu-shows-to-halt-border-listeners-disappointed/story-6RrtbDrmQPz29JSg3icgKN.html

07-07-2020||Gurugram||Employers feel reservation in private sector could hamper Gurugram’s economic recovery||Private employers in Gurugram expressed their dismay at the Haryana government’s plan of reserving 75 percent jobs in private sector for youth domiciled in the state (excluding jobs paying more than Rs 50,000 per month) and said that the move might gravely hamper the region’s economic recovery in a post-Covid worldThe move can also fundamentally change the economic landscape of the city, which employs people from across Haryana, Delhi-NCR, India and even the world, stakeholders said. The proposed ordinance — Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Ordinance, 2020 — was cleared for drafting on Monday by the Haryana cabinet, and will be tabled before the council of minister during its next meeting. The Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), coalition partner of the BJP in the state, had made a commitment to provide 75 percent quota in private sector jobs to Haryana youths in its election manifesto last year.Manas Fuloria, founder of a city-based IT-firm and spokesperson for NASSCOM, Haryana, said, “At present, there is not much clarity on the specific terms of the ordinance. We are ourselves trying to ascertain whether it applies only to unskilled labour, or skilled jobs as well. If the ordinance is passed as a blanket reservation, many private companies may choose to relocate their employees to other cities, at least on paper. It will be possible for a lot of companies to work remotely in the current scenario. But I think industries like manufacturing and real estate will be hit hard by these constraints.”A senior employee of a prominent real estate firm in Gurugram, seeking anonymity, said, “We have been relying on skilled workmen from states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh for years. To train locals from scratch is an investment that we cannot make as we are in a period of economic downturn. This ordinance will make Haryana a less attractive location for private firms to do business. Once the draft ordinance is made public, we can put up our objections to it.” Employers in the manufacturing sector also appeared worried at the prospect of such an ordinance being promulgated into a law. Pankaj Yadav, president of the Gurugram Udyog Association, said, “At this point in time, jobs are already scarce. Industries should be allowed to hire at their discretion for the next few years at least. This is not the time to be putting such constraints on us in an already reeling economy. We have no issues with hiring locals, but finding people with the right skills and qualifications will become much harder, and possibly more expensive as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/reservation-in-private-sector-jobs-might-hamper-gurugram-s-economic-recovery-say-employers/story-IGU61TFFV06XBKZ255wy7O.html

07-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s Covid-19 count crosses 6,000-mark; death toll at 101||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the city breached the 6,000-mark on Monday after 109 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours, according to the district health bulletin. The city’s total number of Covid-19 cases stands at 6,058, out of which 947 are active ones, while 5,010 have recovered till now. The city added 5,000 new cases in June alone when the total positivity rate was more than 50%. At present, the positivity rate is around 4.5%.Gurugram has the highest number of cases in Haryana, followed by Faridabad and Sonepat. At least 17,504 cases have been reported in the state, out of which 3,893 are active, while 13,611 patients have recovered. Gurugram’s overall burden as a percentage of the total number of cases in state is 24.3%. The city recorded its first case of Covid-19 on March 15, when a 26-year-old woman, a resident of Sector 9 had tested positive for the infection after returning from Malaysia and Indonesia. Since then, it took two-and-a-half months to record the first 1,000 cases on May 30 and another 30 days for 5,000 cases. Overall, it has taken the city 107 days since the first case to touch the 6,000-mark.On Monday, the district also recorded one death due to Covid-19. The total toll due to the Covid-19 infection in the city reached the 101-mark on Monday. This takes Gurugram’s present fatality rate to 1.66% as compared to 0.4% in May. The case fatality rate started surging from June onwards when over six to nine deaths were being reported daily. More than 50% of the deaths were reported between June 11-29. Till now, 64 patients have died due to co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension, tuberculosis, diabetes, cancer, among other underlining health issues, while another 37 have died without any co-morbidities. To ascertain the cause of death in such cases, senior doctors of PGIMS Rohtak, a Covid-19 designated tertiary care hospital of the state, are coordinating with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi. Gurugram, however, is far behind the predictions earlier made by the district administration regarding spike in the number of cases. Considering parameters, such as doubling rate and test positivity rate, it was predicted that 35,000 cases would be reported by June-end. But later experts suggested the numbers might be around 6,000-7,000. To match the swelling number of cases, it was predicted that the city would need 4,200- 5,250 beds for Covid-19 patients requiring tertiary care. Presently, the treatment for Covid-19 is being provided in 37 private hospitals and three government hospitals across the city. The city has earmarked 1,486 beds for Covid-19 patients, 192 Intensive Care Unit(ICU) beds and 92 ventilators in both government and private hospitals. Currently, 386 patients are admitted in city hospitals, out of which 197 patients are from Gurugram, while 188 patients are from other cities of the country, including 82 from Delhi. The administration has also reserved more than 1,000 beds in several hotels of the city for self-paid and government-paid isolation facilities for the treatment of asymptomatic patients.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), said, “Our focus currently is on testing, tracing and treating the patients. Today, the total number of active cases in Gurugram is below 1,000. There is also an improvement in the recovery rate. Our target is to test more than 2,000 people every day to break the chain of transmission in the large outbreak regions.”As per official estimates, 46,187 tests have been conducted in the city so far, out of which more than 6,000 have tested positive.“The average number of daily positive cases in the city is down by 22% from 152 in June to 118 in July, while daily testing has more than tripled mainly due to the introduction of rapid antigen testing. As a result, positivity rate has dropped sharply from 23.9% in June to 5.5% in the first week of July. For the next two weeks, Gurugram should sustain more than 2,000 daily tests with more focus on RT-PCR testing to achieve the 5% positivity rate as recommended by the World Health Organization(WHO),” said Dheeraj Singh, a city-based data scientist tracking Covid-19 cases in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-covid-19-count-crosses-6-000-mark-death-toll-at-101/story-kQoTUVEidLNJOkYKMK1SbL.html
07-07-2020||Mumbai||Hotels, lodges allowed to operate in Maharashtra from Wednesday, but only at 33%||A day after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray assured hotels that the sector will be opened up, the government issued a notification on Monday allowing hotels, lodges and guest houses to operate from Wednesday, but at 33% of their capacity. The government has issued guidelines for strict compliance with measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. Dine-in restaurants, however, will remain to be shut and operate only for takeaways as the government has not taken any decision yet. Restaurants at hotels and guest houses will be available only for the resident guest, although the government has pressed for room services and takeaways. Swimming pools, gymnasiums, playing areas, gaming arcades and gatherings of more than 15 people at these hotels will not be allowed, the notification issued by chief secretary Sanjay Kumar stated. Remaining 67% of the facility can be used for the quarantine facility by the district/municipal administration. The hotels have been asked to admit asymptomatic patients only after taking their travel history and self-declaration. The guests are also mandated to wear face masks at all times during their stay. It has been made mandatory for the hotel management to sanitize the rooms, lavatories, drinking and hand-washing stations and washrooms at regular intervals. Besides the sanitisation, the changing of linens and keeping rooms vacant for at least a day after it is vacated by the guest has also been made compulsory. Besides measures to avoid crowding, the notification has also made it compulsory to keep pedal-operated hand sanitizers at the entrance, in the rooms, thermal scanner at the entrance and making personal protection equipment (PPE) available to all staff members. The hotels have also been directed to follow the guidelines issued by the Central government related to the use of air-conditioning facilities.“We welcome the step and expect the cap over occupancy is removed gradually in phased manner. We have clarified to the honourable CM that hotels are the safest places in terms of maintaining social distance and there should not have been any cap on operations. Some of the compulsions like sanitizer in every room and thermal screening at the entrance are too harsh and uncalled for. In such conditions, many hoteliers would opt to not begin operations immediately,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI).Hotelier Dilip Datwani said that with 33% cap it would not be feasible to operate as the operation and maintenance cost remain the same. “Similarly, with the restrictions on industrial operations and on travelling, there are no takers too for services,” he said.Kohli said that there are 53,000 hotels in organised sectors across the country and 10,500 are in Maharashtra. The estimated losses, according to him, during the period of the lockdown are Rs1.10 lakh crore. Representatives of hoteliers had a meeting with the CM on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hotels-lodges-allowed-to-operate-in-maharashtra-from-wednesday-but-only-at-33/story-WCHhEAWoOMBsKOnclmv9HN.html
07-07-2020||Gurugram||Mid-day meals to be extended to out-of-school children in Haryana||The department of elementary education of the state has directed all the district elementary education officers to ensure that out-of-school children are enrolled in age-appropriate classes and that they are provided with mid-day meals just like regular students. Until now, mid-day meals were only being provided to students who are on the school’s roll. Out-of-school children are usually given special bridge classes before they can be formally enrolled into government schools.A directive in this regard was shared with district elementary education officers last Friday. Ritu Chowdhary, district project coordinator, Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, said mid-day meals would be provided to school drop-outs and out-of-school children in line with the new directions. “Children enrolled in schools used to receive mid-day meals in the form of cooked food earlier. In view of the spread of Covid-19, teachers have started delivering dry ration to children on the school’s roll. However, out-of-school were not being covered earlier. Now, the dry ration will be made available to these children as well,” said Chowdhary.The district administration has been providing 3kg of rice and wheat, and dry milk, as dry ration, to enrolled students. The dry ration is delivered by teachers who visit their homes. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, children are also being provided with hand sanitisers, masks and soaps.Gurugram’s block education officer Sudesh Raghav said that the department would start providing dry ration to out-of-school children once it receives the detailed guidelines regarding the dispersal of the same. “We have received the new directions recently. As per the new directions, classes will soon start for these out-of-school children. They’ll be enrolled and mid-day meals will be provided to them.While anyone can access online classes, regular classes for these children couldn’t take place due to the disruption caused by the pandemic,” said Raghav. Special centres for out-of-school children have been created in the vicinity of government schools in various clusters. In Gurugram, some of these centres run in places such as Kadipur and Nathupur. “The government maintains a data of children who are enrolled in these classes. As per the records of the department, meals in the form of dry ration will be provided to them. Efforts are also being made to ensure that such children are able to access classes through the various mediums that are currently operational,” said Raghav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mid-day-meals-to-be-extended-to-out-of-school-children-in-haryana/story-SP2ylzB5OBiOSl7KCKlDmL.html

The salary bill of the employees is about ₹1,870 crore per month, while the pension bill comes to around ₹770 crore per month.Before the imposition of the nationwide lockdown on March 24, Haryana was a revenue surplus state. However, because of the lockdown, the state has been struggling to meet its financial liabilities and has been releasing salaries and pensions in a staggered manner. The financial crisis has also forced the government to impose a ban on the purchase of new vehicles, apart from deferring all new recruitments for government jobs for a year.On Monday, the finance department, in a letter to all departmental heads, commissioners of divisions, deputy commissioners informed them about the decision to freeze the DA and DR at the current rate.“In view of the crisis arising out of Covid-19, it has been decided that additional instalment of DA payable to Haryana government employees and dearness relief to Haryana government pensioners, due from January 1, 2020, shall not be paid (sic),” read the letter.“However, dearness allowance and dearness relief at the current rate of 17% will continued to be paid,” the letter stated.The letter further stated that as and when the decision to release the future instalment of DA and DR is taken, their rates as effective from January 1, 2020; July 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, will be restored “prospectively” and will be subsumed in the cumulative revised rate, which will be effective from July 1, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-govt-freezes-dearness-allowance-and-dearness-relief-at-17-for-a-year/story-e5s4l4ygQHK3zlHJ2YS7qJ.html

Every day a different group is connected to psychiatrists and psychologists via WhatsApp video call during different time slots of the day.“The counselling sessions are held to clear doubts of people related to home isolation, and address depression and stress related issues triggered by Covid-19,” said Dr Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. “Doctors motivate patients to stay stress-free as most of them are worried about getting critically ill.Through these sessions, we try and address their doubts about the disease while helping them deal with the stress that comes with it,” he said. Through a video calling application, active Covid-19 cases are contacted and informed about basic measures to prevent the transmission of virus to their family members. “The team enquires about their health condition to prevent them from becoming critical,” said Yadav.According to him, till June 30 —when the 19 groups were formed — Gurugram had at least 925 asymptomatic Covid-19 patients under home isolation. The number as of July 6 had come down and stood at 706 , all of who are under mandatory home quarantine and have been undergoing counselling..

The online sessions are slotted from 11am to noon, noon to 1pm, 4pm to 5pm and 5pm to 6pm.At present there are three mental health experts who are involved in the programme — clinical psychologist Dr Sachin Khatana, psychiatrist Dr Vinay Saini and Ayush expert Dr Aruna Jhangar.Dr Sachin Khatana, clinical psychologist of district mental health programme, who has been holding these sessions said, “Majority of the patients under isolation complain about sleep disorder, as they are mostly occupied using their mobile phones, tablets or electronic gadgets till late night . We have also received complains of patients suffering from headaches and eye pain. Some of them ask about the confirmatory test to check whether they are positive or not after 10 days. Based on their symptoms and queries, we clear their doubts.” Most patients, dealing with stress and sleeplessness, are suggested lifestyle changes by the psychologist and the psychiatrist,with the Ayush doctor recommending regular Yoga practice. Khatana said that after patients recover, they automatically leave the group. Patients who attend these sessions submit their personal details in on a Google document to the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-dept-starts-online-sessions-for-mental-health-of-covid-patients-isolated-at-home/story-YiMproj2FmwfUuY65r96MP.html

Without divulging the quantity of remdesivir and other drugs, Yadav said, “We have some stock of these drugs, and we are also procuring more for every district.” He added that the state is also adding ventilators in districts and tier-two cities where the health infrastructure is weaker.In a bid to give a boost to the reopening of businesses, the state government has decided to allow any private establishment seeking to reopen to get their staff tested for Covid-19. The state medical education and drugs department (MEDD) issued a government resolution (GR) on Monday stating that private establishment had repeatedly sought relaxations in getting their staffers tested before reopening their businesses.According to the GR, minimum 50 people are required from an establishment for a group test. The head of the establishment must approach the district collector or municipal commissioner in urban areas to seek approval for the tests. They would have to mention the type of test they want to undergo, including RT-PCR, TrueNat, CBNAAT, antibody, or antigen test, in their application.“It is a part of Mission Begin Again for establishments that want to reopen. The establishments can approach the district collector and get approval for tests, and say we have this private lab and we need permission to test our employees. We have allowed two things: all labs to conduct antigen and antibody tests so testing is ramped up,” said Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary, MEDD.Meanwhile, the recovery rate in the state continued to remain over 54 % with 3,522 patients discharged on Monday. So far, 1,15,262 patients have been discharged after full recovery until today. The total number of active cases in the state stands at 87,681.(with inputs from Eeshanpriya MS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-19-toll-goes-past-9-000-tally-now-211-987/story-SYnfuexD856R9ODF2I6X0L.html
07-07-2020||City||Haryana Tourism Corporation to run six liquor vends in Gurugram as pilot project||Gurugram The Haryana Tourism Corporation will run six liquor vends in Gurugram as a pilot project starting Tuesday. Officials said that it is the first time that a state government entity will run liquor vends in the district. The decision was taken by the state government after the tourism department suffered huge losses due to closure of tourism complexes and guest houses during the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. During the lockdown period, the revenue receipt of the corporation was almost nil, said an official. The Gururgam excise department had placed an advertisement on June 23 for auction of 78 liquor vends in 39 zones, following which the tourism corporation filed tenders and were allotted the three zones, excise officials said, adding that there are two liquor vends in a zone. “The company was allotted six liquor vends in three zones after it followed the bidding process like others,” said H C Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC), Gurugram. Dahiya said that the tourism industry has been majorly hit during the coronavirus outbreak. Sources in the department said liquor prices at stores run by the corporation will be cheaper as compared to that of other liquor vends. Currently, retailers sell IMFL at a premium on the minimum retail price.The six liquor shops which will be run by the tourism corporation are situated at Hero Honda Chowk, Bakhtawar Chowk and Atul Kataria Chowk.Rajesh Joon, additional divisional manager of Haryana Tourism Corporation, said that they have entered the liquor business following Delhi model. “We gave our list to the excise department and got approval for opening the shops falling under the standalone category and other guidelines. Close to 284 shops are operating as of now in the district,” he said.State agencies like Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC) and Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) operate liquor shops in the national capital. “We decided to enter this field to curb the nuisance of liquor mafia. Our shops will ensure the availability of genuine liquor to the customers at a fair price,” Joon said, adding that they have taken these liquor shops after bidding nearly ₹11 crore.The excise officials said DSIIDC holds a considerable share of market in retail sale of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL), beer, imported foreign liquor and country liquor since 1979, and this is the first time any government agency will operate liquor vends in Haryana.Anurag Rastogi, principal secretary, excise and taxation, said it is a good initiative and will help the tourism corporation.By auctioning 284 liquor shops in Gurugram (the government had auctioned 206 stores in March) through e-tenders, the state earned nearly ₹800 crore, the excise officials said. The state excise department has set a target of ₹7,500 crore for 2020-21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-tourism-corporation-to-run-six-liquor-vends-in-gurugram-as-pilot-project/story-uxGJbTC6pTepW1zKI8iEuN.html
07-07-2020||Gurugram||After negligible income during lockdown, MCG earns ₹18 cr in June||After collecting a sum of merely ₹12 lakh in property tax dues in April and May, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) procured ₹18 crore in June and ₹6 crore in just six days in July. The uptick in the revenue collection happened only after the civic body introduced a rebate scheme in the last week of May to encourage taxpayers to clear their dues, said officials on Monday. Nearly 90% of the civic body’s revenue comes from property taxes. On May 23, MCG introduced a 25% rebate scheme after it realised that it has not earned any significant revenue during the lockdown period and was staring at a possibility of depleting its cash reserves. The rebate percentage offered by MCG is the highest ever since the civic body came into existence in 2008. “We wanted to make the payment of property taxes lucrative for taxpayers. As such, we offered them a 25% rebate scheme. In addition to this, taxpayers who cleared their dues in the 2020-21 fiscal were also offered an extra 10% rebate. All these measures have significantly boosted our revenue collection. In just the first six days of July, we have recovered more than ₹6 crore of dues, averaging more than ₹1 crore per day,” Dinesh Kumar, zonal taxation officer, MCG, said, adding that the rebate scheme is valid till July 31. At the start of March, just a few weeks before the nationwide lockdown came into force, MCG had set a target of collecting around ₹800 crore in the 2020-21 fiscal. This is more than three times its average collection of ₹250 crore in the previous three fiscal budgets.For instance, in the 2017-18 fiscal, MCG had collected ₹342.24 crore in property tax — its highest ever collection. Since then, the civic body had failed to meet its ₹250-crore target in the next two fiscals. As such, it had set more than triple the usual target in the 2020-21 fiscal in order to recuperate some of its previous losses. Till now, the civic body has collected nearly ₹25 crore. In order to meet the fiscal target, MCG has identified 197 property owners in the city, who owe more than ₹20 lakh each to the civic body. Another set of 243 properties has also been identified, who owe between ₹10-₹20 lakh in property tax dues. The civic body has sent notices to all the defaulting tax payers. Moreover, for the first time in its operational history, the MCG had also sent notices to 150 liquor shop owners, asking them to clear their decade-long property tax dues. MCG officials said that work on recovering dues was temporarily halted during the lockdown period, but has started since then. On Friday, during a press conference, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh also reiterated the details regarding the rebate scheme and further said that the civic body will be rewarding 5% of the total amount of taxes collected from a locality to its RWA, provided that the residents’ welfare body has ensured more than 80% collection from its residents. The money will be used by the RWA to install and upgrade sanitation, composting and waste management facilities in its locality. As per officials privy to the matter, all these steps have been initiated to ensure that the MCG does not face a cash crunch deficit, which in turn would severely impact the maintenance and upgrade of the civic infrastructure in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/after-negligible-income-during-lockdown-mcg-earns-18-cr-in-june/story-u3BXaQhQueOqEud5iiquLL.html
07-07-2020||City||Power minister warns developers against exploiting residents in name of single-point connections||NOIDA: In a big relief to people residing in high-rises in Noida and Ghaziabad, the state government has ordered builders to give multipoint connections to homebuyers, replacing single-point connections, and not to exploit them at their “whims and fancies”.State power minister Shrikant Sharma, while chairing a review meeting with officials of the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) in Noida regarding the progress in conversion of single-point connection to multipoint connections in high-rises, said he had received number of complaints from people about hiked electricity prices from builders. “The state government is determined to bring relief to those who have opted for community living in areas like Greater Noida, Noida and Ghaziabad. People living in high-rises have repeated been complaining that builders are taking extra money from them as part of their electricity bills. In the name of power backup, the builders ask for around Rs 10-12 per unit – which is illegal in any case,” he said.Sharma said the project of fragmenting single-point connections aims at saving consumers from the exorbitant electricity charges being collected by developers. “The time has come for builders to give multipoint connections to their clients, replacing single-point connections. They can’t impose unnecessary burden on them. I have asked PVVNL officials to take legal action against builders who are trying to harass residents,” he said.The power minister said under the pilot project of conversion of single-point conections to multipoint in Noida, 14 out of 142 high-rises have given their consent for giving individual connections to residents. “Conversion work has been completed in six societies and work will soon be over in the remaining eight high rises. Since our government is providing adequate electricity to every consumer in the state, the consumers now trust us more. We’ll not let them be exploited by developers who are virtually subletting them electricity,” he said.The minister asked for timely redressal of consumers’ grievances and ensure uninterrupted power supply.Developers, however, are not in favour of multipoint connections on technical grounds.“Multipoint connection in high-rises is not a good idea due to safety reasons. A single-point connection is always better in terms of safety. Maintenance of the infrastructure is also better. If any developer or apartment owner association is overcharging, then there is a way to file a complaint and solve the issue. But a multipoint connection is not a way out as it will create more problems,” said Amit Modi, vice-president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), a developers’ group.The apartment owners said the multipoint connection should be strictly implemented.“As of now, single-point connections are not converted into multiple point because a fee of Rs25,000 to Rs30,000 is being imposed. We have demanded that the conversion fee for multipoint connections should be very nominal. Multipoint connections will provide relief to consumers as they can pay as per consumption without having to argue with the developer or AOA that controls the electricity supply in single-point connections,” said Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Association (NOFAA), an umbrella body of at least 100 high-rise housing societies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/power-minister-warns-developers-against-exploiting-residents-in-name-of-single-point-connections/story-hdSE4bZ3Zot5eDSBCpJLTM.html
07-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Total Covid-19 infections cross 100k, but number of new infections fall||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases recorded in the national capital till now crossed the 100,000 mark on Monday, crossing a grim milestone that underlines the challenge in containing the outbreak even as daily numbers show a sustained decline.The capital recorded 1,379 new cases, the lowest in a day since June 9, according to Delhi government data. The number of tests dipped from 23,136 in Sunday’s to 13,879 in Monday’s bulletin. The capital’s first case was 127 days ago when on March 2, a 45-year-old man from Mayur Vihar tested positive after returning from Italy.Senior government officials said the dip in the number of tests conducted on July 5 was because it was a Sunday. Government data confirmed the trend. On June 28 (Sunday), 16,157 tests were conducted and on June 21 (Sunday), 14,682 tests were conducted. “On Saturday, all the 11 districts had conducted a total of 23,136 tests, which dropped to 13,879 on Sunday. These numbers include both RT-PCR and rapid antigen detection tests. Earlier also, the testing numbers had dipped on Sundays because fewer people turn up and fewer workers report to duty. They cannot be working seven days a week for months together,” a senior government official said. The city touched the 1-lakh mark six days later than predicted by a five-member panel set up in the beginning of June to aid the Delhi government plan the increase of infrastructure. Contrary to what the committee had suggested, the number of active cases has also not shot up to 50,000-60,000 yet.It has remained between 25,000-27,000 for the last two weeks—reaching a peak of 28,329 active cases on June 27.“We had predicted the trajectory of the infection based on the trends then. Anyway, it was the worst-case scenario; now we are well-prepared to handle the cases. The number of active cases seems to have stabilised. This is mainly due to two reasons—now even though we are testing over 20,000 people a day, the positivity rate has been reducing—fewer new cases are being reported. At the same time, the number of recoveries has gone up,” said Dr Arun Gupta, one of the members of the panel and the president of Delhi Medical Council.Even though it is declining, Delhi’s case fatality rate—the number of people who died of Covid-19—remains over 3%. This is slightly higher than the national average of about 2.8%.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal during a press briefing on Monday said the number of deaths due to Covid-19 has come down. “Earlier, over 125 deaths were being reported on a single day. Now there are 55 to 60 deaths daily. So, the umber of deaths has come down by half. It needs to be reduced further,” he said.Dr Gupta said, “No one across the globe has been able to predict the behaviour of this infection; the models have all failed. But, from the current numbers, I feel that the number of new cases and new hospitalisations will start going down now.”An increased recovery rate is the reason for the number of active cases stabilising. The number of recoveries shot up June 18 onwards when 3,884 people recovered or were discharged in one day, rather than the few hundred that were recovering before. According to the data provided by the Delhi government, the highest number of recoveries was recorded on June 20—7,725.An increase in the number of cases in June and the revised discharge policy of the union health ministry—wherein a Covid-19 patient can be discharged 10 days after the onset of symptoms or three days after recovery—are likely the reasons for Delhi’s increased recovery rate.On Monday, the recovery rate stood at 71.4%; it had crossed the 70%-mark a day ago.“I do not know whether the increased recovery rate is because of a change in the behaviour of the virus. It could also be that we are testing more people in the community and detecting mild cases. However, I have always believed, that Sar-Cov-2 just like any other zoonotic virus will slowly adapt and become less virulent. However, the virus is unlikely to disappear, it will cause milder symptoms and people will get used to living with it. A vaccine will also help,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).The data also shows that hospitalisations have started going down – with 5,250 people in hospitals on Monday as opposed to over 6,000 people that were in hospitals the week ending on June 28. This decline, however, is because of the decline in the number of new cases being recorded and not because the cases are milder.The proportion of active cases that need hospitalisation has remained more or less the same at about 21%.“It is too soon to judge whether the infection has peaked. The positivity rate has gone down since the rapid antigen tests began. They have been testing even the asymptomatic people in the community, which is likely the reason for brining down positivity rate. If you take a population that is likely to have the infection and test them, the positivity rate will be higher. Having said that, Covid-19 is likely to plateau in Delhi soon,” said Dr Broor.Delhi’s positivity rate – proportion of people who test positive among those tested – has also continued to decline and came to a single digit for the first time on Sunday after May third week. On Sunday, only 2,244 of the 23,136 people tested turned out to be positive, bringing the positivity rate to 9.7%.Experts say this is a positive sign as the number continues to decline despite increased testing.The highest positivity rate of almost 37% was recorded on June 13 – when the number of tests being conducted in the city in a day had gone down. On average, 5,525 people were being tested in a single day then. Now, the figure stands at over 20,000.The deployment of the rapid antigen testing helped the government in considerably scaling up testing, with the government now asking all hospitals to test people in the high-risk groups, such as older people and the immune-compromised to be tested mandatorily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-total-infections-cross-100k-but-number-of-new-infections-falls/story-xuWUJa6wTtoT7Hma5r2kIL.html
07-07-2020||Noida||High humidity, sweat take a toll on healthcare workers and their PPE kits||Fighting on the front lines as they treat patients of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease and try to contain the spread of the infection at the cost of making themselves vulnerable of contracting the virus, doctors and health care workers in the region have been battling one more challenge: rising temperatures and humidity levels and the resultant perspiration that makes working in the same personal protective equipment (PPE) suit difficult for long hours. The heat and especially the rising humidity levels, in the past five-six weeks, has spurred the demand for PPE gear at government-run Covid-19 facilities in the district as with the build-up of sweat inside them, the life of these kits has been reduced to almost as low as four hours, health officials said. While the PPE gear could be used by a health care worker for six to eight hours in April and May, they currently need to be changed at least after every four hours as the person wearing them has to bear high perspiration levels inside them. Out of the 14,500 PPE kits used by health workers in government-run Covid-19 facilities so far since the outbreak of the disease in March, almost 42% were used in the month of June alone when the average humidity levels touched 66.63% and the maximum temperature hovered around 38.5 degree Celsius. According to Dr Nepal Singh, Gautam Budh Nagar’s acting chief medical officer (CMO), over 6,200 PPE kits have been used in government-run Covid-19 facilities in June. “In April and May, the consumption of PPE kits was around 3,500 and 4,400, respectively. While the number of health care staff has increased by 10% in June compared to previous months, with the rise in temperatures, the demand for PPE kits has gone up by at least around 40%,” he said.The district currently has six government-run Covid-19 facilities, up from three such centres in April. According to an analysis of data by India Meteorological Department, the average humidity levels saw a sharp spike of 15.9 percentage points from 50.65 % in May to 66.63% in June. According to the records, the maximum humidity in June oscillated between 71% and 100% throughout the month, while the minimum humidity oscillated between 35 % and 75%. In May, the maximum humidity was between 47% and 100 %, while the minimum levels ranged from 14% to 65%. The average humidity level in April was 56.88%.The sharp rise in humidity in June was because of the 13 days of rain experienced caused by the western disturbances and then the arrival of monsoon. The maximum temperature experienced in June was 42 degree Celsius. The problem of working in high humidity levels and high temperatures with the PPEs on is amplified by the restrictions on using centralised air-conditioning in isolation wards. “We use fans instead of centralised air conditioning and keep the windows open for better ventilation, but humidity levels have increased in the past few weeks. As a result, health care workers need to change their PPE kits at least twice and sometimes even thrice in an eight-hour shift,” he said. Centralised air-conditioning has been shut down keeping in line with the guidelines laid down by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Reiterating that the demand of PPE kits has gone up with the rise in humidity, Dr Rakesh Gupta, director of Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, the biggest Covid-19 facility in Gautam Budh Nagar, said: “With the constant build-up of sweat inside the PPE kits, our doctors and other staff working in Covid-19 wards now have to change gear at least two times during their shifts. The daily consumption of PPE kits has now gone up to 150 per day in June from being around 100 per day in April and May,” he said. “As per the ICMR guidelines, we are not using centralised ACs in Covid-19 wards, and are using fans instead. Given the increased perspiration, our staff is very careful in maintaining adequate fluid levels. They are also taking light foods and ample amount of fluids like water, juices and milk,” he said.The average humidity in the first week of July has been around 78%, while the average maximum temperatureat 38.2 degrees Celsius. The humidity levels will continue to rise gradually till September. “The humidity levels remain very high in July August and they start dropping in September as the monsoon withdraws,” Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting centre Skymet, said.District magistrate Suhas LY, however, assured that Gautam Budh Nagar will not run out of PPE kits despite the increase in their rate of usage. “The supply chain and buffer stock of the PPE kits are maintained in such a way here that the district can never run out of them,” he said.Meanwhile, a few Covid-dedicated hospitals in Noida have started setting up window ACs in their isolation wards. The spokesperson of Sharda hospital said a separate ward with window ACs is on the verge of completion. “Once it is be completed, we will shift our Covid-19 patients to the new ward,” he said.(With inputs from Kushagra Dixit)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-high-humidity-sweat-take-a-toll-on-ppe-kits/story-BTX7N6kl4yVnO0Pu9e1fGN.html

To develop the ₹83-crore project, the authority last week floated a tender to hire a contractor, officials said. “We have floated the tender for this ambitious project to select a private agency. We hope that in the next one or two months, an agency will be finalized and work will start at the site,” said Mukesh Vaish, project engineer, Noida authority.According to a survey conducted by the Noida authority’s traffic cell, about 125,000 commuters who use the stretch daily have to face congestion at Parthala Chowk, where Master Plan-III Road meets Faridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad Expressway. The survey also found that the traffic situation at the intersection becomes worse during peak hours when around 18,000 motorists use this stretch.“The congestion that commuters face at this traffic intersection will be a thing of past once this flyover becomes operational,” said Vaish.According to the officials, the six-lane flyover that will be built on Master Plan-III Road will benefit motorists, who travel from Noida to Greater Noida West, Ghaziabad, Meerut and other areas. The work will be completed in 18 months from the day it begins at the ground, said the officials.The officials also said that once the project gets complete, motorists will not have to face any traffic signal at Parthala Chowk to reach Greater Noida’s Kisan Chowk located in Sector 1. The commuters, who use FNG Expressway, will also not have to face any traffic signal at Parthala, they added.The Noida authority had been planning to remove traffic signal at Parthala Chowk for the past three years. “We had explored several options, including an underpass, to make this a signal free stretch. And finally the authority decided to build a flyover,” said the project engineer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-floats-tender-for-building-six-lane-flyover-at-parthala-chowk/story-cS3RaKkJ3hyinaJGazP53K.html

The Noida police had first attached property owned by gangster Bhati and his accomplices on Saturday when a structure constructed on illegally acquired government land in Ghangrola village under Kasna police jurisdiction was also demolished. Targeting properties of various other criminals, the police had attached assets with a total worth of ₹8 crore on Saturday.According to Section 14 of the UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act (1986) any movable and immovable assets, owned by a known gangster, which have been obtained through fraudulent means can be attached by the government. Before the police commissionerate system was enforced in Noida, this power lay with the district magistrate.The police said on Sunday they had attached assets of eight criminals. The assets are worth around ₹3.5 crore and include vehicles and property plots in Greater Noida, a police statement said.Of the eight criminals, whose properties were attached on Sunday, five are from the Anil Dujana gang, while three are from the Sunder Bhati gang, the police said. “Associates of the Anil Dujana gang had obtained some of the assets in the names of their relatives,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2. While going to attach one such property in Bambawat village under Badalpur police jurisdiction, the police said, their team had also faced resistance from the locals. The concerned property was later attached and an FIR against six named and 30 unnamed locals was also registered, said Chander.Bhati and Dujana are both currently serving time in jail. “We will continue attaching more properties owned by gangsters and criminals in the district,” said DCP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gangsters-assets-worth-13-crore-attached-by-noida-police-in-three-days/story-8T0MiSFamu1d9N25Aw0EPP.html

He said there are around 15,500 of them, of which 10,000 beds are empty, and that the government is working to add more beds to this number.Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia paid a visit to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH) in Tahirpur Monday on a landmark occasion—the release of the 1,000th Covid-19 patient who recovered from the viral infection.The recovery rate in Delhi has improved from 38.5% during June first week to 71.4% on Monday, according to data from the Delhi government.“Delhi government’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital is playing an important role in the fight against Covid-19. Its staff is working day and night. A 1,000 patients have been discharged from here after treatment. It has increased the number of ICU beds from 45 to 200 in a day with limited resources. We have asked the hospital authorities to increase it to 500 in the next few days,” he said.“There are around 15,500 beds in the city, of which 10,000 are empty. Delhi also has around 1,900 ICU beds, of which 750 are vacant. But in the next few days, the bed requirement will increase due to an expected spike in the number of Covid-19 cases.”Over the last three months, older people with severe symptoms of Covid-19 are being admitted to RGSSH.“With mildly symptomatic patients recovering at home, we now get only patients with moderately severe to severe symptoms—several of them require oxygen and ventilator support,” Dr BL Sherwal, the medical director of RGSSH. which was the second hospital in the city to be converted into a dedicated Covid-19 centre in April, said.The doctors treating the patients said that the average age of the patients has increased from around 35 years to over 50 years.“According to the data from the first month of treatment, the average age of patients was around 35 years. The younger people must have passed it on to the elderly living in their homes because now the average age is over 50 years. I have treated a patient who was over the age of the 90. Older patients also tend to have comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension that increase the risk of severe illness,” Dr Ajeet Jain, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the hospital, said.The 1,000th patient to be discharged from the hospital was a senior nursing officer from Delhi-government-run Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hospital in East Patel Nagar. Her husband, who works in the public works department (PWD) of Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) and is associated with Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi’s biggest Covid-19 facility, was also discharged along with her. Though three others from their family are also infected, they are in home isolation. “My husband was the first to get diagnosed in our family. He tested positive on June 17 and was brought to the hospital the next day after his oxygen saturation started dropping. Once he tested positive, my family and I also got tested. Four of us tested positive. The others are in home isolation,” Manjulata Sharma, 52, said.In June, Delhi health minister Satyendra Kumar Jain was initially admitted to RGSSH when he showed symptoms of Covid-19, but was later shifted to Max Hospital in Saket for convalescent plasma therapy. Now, RGSSH has started administering convalescent plasma therapy to at least 200 patients under a trial headed by the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, which houses the country’s first plasma bank. The hospital is also administering medicines such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab to its patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-dearth-of-dedicated-covid-beds-in-delhi-kejriwal/story-gys8wnGCfvBHVThWJP9AfM.html

The boy, who is lives in the same neighbourhood, had sexually assaulted the girl when she was on her ways to the woods to relieve herself, the police said. The police detained the 14-year-old suspect on Monday based on a complaint filed by the girl’s mother.In the complaint, the girl’s mother said the boy— who is a class 7 student—sexually assaulted the girl before fleeing and leaving her alone in the alone. Police officers said that the girl’s mother had been out of town at the time of the incident and the girl, who studies in class 5, waited for her to return before informing the family about the assault. Based on the complaint of the mother, a case was registered at the Ecotech 1 police station under section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.“The girl was raped by her 14-year-old neighbour. She was sent for a medical examination on July 4th itself and the report has confirmed rape. The boy was detained on Monday,” Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, women and child safety, said.The police said the boy will be produced before a judicial magistrate. However, as many as 13 children at the Gautam Budh Nagar juvenile home testing positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on July 2, members of the Juvenile Justice Board(JJB) sent the boy for a Covid-19 test first. “To avoid any further transmission of the infection, the boy was first tested for Covid-19 at the district hospital. His report came back negative after which he was sent in remand custody to the juvenile home,” Aneet Baghel, a JJB member, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/teenager-rapes-12-year-old-neighbour-in-greater-noida/story-Enc8MHiGimwA1ltdbGbk4O.html

07-07-2020||City||Ludhiana city bus service resumes operations||After a three and a half month halt, the city bus service resumed operations here on Monday. The service was resumed only on the clock-tower to Sahnewal route and received a low response on the first day.In the absence of the service, the residents had been opting for auto-rickshaws, which charge up to Rs 20 per ride in comparison to Rs 5 charged by the city bus service.The officials said that the service would soon resume on other routes as well. As per the officials, the contractor has also sought a hike in the fare citing rising diesel price and low footfall, but the municipal corporation (MC) is yet to take the final decision on the same.Jaskirat Singh, city bus contractor, said, “We have been demanding a hike for a long time. A reminder was also given to the authorities a few days back.” Despite repeated attempts, Hindustan Times couldn’t reach MC additional commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal for comments.Before being put to a halt after the imposition of curfew in the state in March, the city bus service used to ferry around 3,500 passengers on a daily basis on four routes including Sahnewal to clock tower, Kohara to bus stand, Dugri to Metro supermarket and railway station to Meharban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-city-bus-service-resumes-operations/story-gUNSNOKL9czeOGbRSFf3iK.html
07-07-2020||City||Work on timely referral of Covid patients, Ghaziabad told||Ghaziabad The state government has laid stress on early detection of Covid-19 cases in order to prevent the rising deaths in Ghaziabad and directed the district administration to streamline systems so that patients at the most get discharged from an L1 or L2 hospital, officials said on Monday. Rajnish Dubey, UP’s additional chief secretary (medical education), on Monday held a detailed meeting with Ghaziabad officials and directed them certain measures to be taken up to contain the Covid-19 spread.The additional chief secretary (ACS) asked district officials to ensure that referral of Covid-19 patients to L2 or L3 facility is taken up in a timely manner. According to the district officials, ACS has also directed that L2 patients can be admitted to L3 hospital as it has availability of vacant beds while the only L2 category Sanjay Nagar hospital is over 80% occupied at present.The Ghaziabad district at present ranks third on the list of 75 districts in the state having most number of Covid-19 related deaths.“Most of the deaths in Ghaziabad have taken place in June. Also, a majority of them are related to patients having comorbid conditions. These also include patients who went to other districts on their own and succumbed. Later, these deaths were added to our tally. ACS, during the visit to L3 category Santosh Hospital, has also asked for creation of 200 more L2 category beds. The hospital has 630 Covid beds. Four hundred of these are for L3 patients while the rest will now be for L2 patients,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.According to the state control room figures for July 6, the district has a total of 62 Covid related deaths and accounts for about 8% of total fatalities in the state. Till May 31, the district had only four death cases. However, in June alone, 51 deaths were added to the tally while seven more patients succumbed to the viral infection this month so far.The officials said that for the purpose of immediate movement of patients to another hospital, they have requested for 15 more ambulances from the state government. “They (the ambulances) are expected to arrive soon. Now, we have also integrated the test report, referral team and ambulance service in an integrated control room. Earlier, the patients were ferried to an L1, L2 or L3 hospital only at night. Now, the integrated control room will enforce immediate referral and transportation of patients to the appropriate category Covid hospitals,” Pandey said.At present, the Ghaziabad district has 14 ambulances, including two advanced life-support ambulances, and has further acquired 20 private ambulances for better and timely referral of patients to designated Covid hospitals.On directions of the state government, the district on July 2 started with special surveillance drive in order to timely detect influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe cute respiratory illness (SARI) patients.According to official records, 2,029 teams during the special surveillance drive have surveyed 589,290 households covering a total population of 2560,941. Out of these, they identified 457 ILI and 72 SARI cases, the officials said.“These patients are now getting identified timely and we are making efforts so that they do not move to critical state. We have also started arranging for about 80 ventilator beds. We already have 33 such beds in government facilities while the rest will be acquired at private hospitals. The idea is to create backup of ventilator beds, but we are trying to prevent patients moving to ventilators,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.With the surge in positive cases in June, the health department officials expect that Covid-19 patients will rise further for the next two months. On Monday, the district reported 82 fresh Covid-19 cases,taking the tally of positive cases to 2,382. The total cases include 1,251 active cases while 970 patients have been discharged. “The rise is on account of recently started antigen testing for which we now have about 19,000 rapid test kits. If positivity rate goes on, we estimate that we can even have as high as 300-400 cases per day. But we are working on reducing deaths. We have about 70% L1 patients, besides 20% under L2 category and 5% under L3 category. The recovery rate is high in L1 and L2 categories. So, our focus is for early detection of L1 or L2 patients and quality treatment of L3 patients who require critical care,” Dr Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/work-on-timely-referral-of-covid-patients-ghaziabad-told/story-HrVPTD51l5GsK0UvNnhoPO.html

A senior official with the revenue department said that the earlier order was issued in haste and the government has planned to maintain the status quo at least till July 15. “We have to be open to the possibility of an unexpected spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the next few days,” the official, who did not wish to be identified, said.Through the Sunday order, the government had delinked Hotel Piccadily in the Janakpuri District Centre complex that was acting as an extended facility for Mata Chanan Devi Hospital, Hotel Taj Vivanta in Dwarka that was acting as an extended facility for Akash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital and Hotel Pride Plaza in Delhi Aerocity that was acting as an extended facility for Venkateswara Hospital in Dwarka.The order had further stated that Hotel Welcome in Dwarka Sector 10 that was acting as an extended facility for Manipal Hospital in Sector 6, Dwarka, would now act as an extended Covid-19 facility for the all the three other hospitals as well.The withdrawal order, which HT has seen, stated that the decision has the approval of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-withdraws-order-to-delink-three-hotels-from-hospitals/story-4kDEvTztAXZNjyJNeqsbFL.html
07-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s monuments reopen, see minimal footfall amid coronavirus crisis||Delhi’s historical monuments reopened their doors on Monday after a gap of three months but footfall remained abysmally low amid the Covid-19 pandemic and on a day the city crossed 100,000 positive cases. The monuments had been shut on March 17 as the country locked down to contain the spread of the coronavirus.Popular monuments such as Humayun’s Tomb, Purana Qila, Safdarjung Tomb and Qutub Minar, which reopened on Monday, witnessed low footfall. Red Fort will reopen on Tuesday as per its regular schedule. For instance, less than 60 and 30 people had visited Humayun’s Tomb and Purana Qila, respectively, till 5pm on Monday. Till 6pm, Qutub Minar had a little over 100 visitors on Monday. Before lockdown, Red Fort, Qutub Minar and Humayun’s Tomb saw over 10,000 visitors per day. On Monday, visitors were seen taking a stroll on the mowed grass lawns at these places, clicking selfies, or resting on the footsteps. Security guards on the premises ensured people had their masks on at all times.Several visitors spotted at these sites on Monday said they ended up there by chance. Dheeraj Deshmukh, 23, a UPSC aspirant from Maharashtra who has been in Delhi for about a year, said he had not stepped out anywhere for around three months.“I was passing by Purana Qila on my way to run an errand when I noticed it was open. I’m glad I decided to visit the place. It’s not crowded like it usually is and one can enjoy the surroundings more. The rain made the experience better,” he said. On Monday, Delhi witnessed light rainfall in some areas. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius and a minimum temperature of 26.2 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Of the 171 monuments protected under the Archaeological Survey of India in Delhi, Red Fort, Humayun’s Tomb and Qutub Minar are on the list of UNESCO’s world heritage sites. They were closed in March due to the Covid-19 lockdown.Preventive measures have been put in place in the wake of the pandemic, including compulsory e-ticketing, installation of thermal scanners and sanitiser dispensers at gates, a cap on the number of visitors to ensure social distancing, maintenance of records to help with contact tracing if needed, the mandatory wearing of masks, and digital payment at parking lots and cafeterias. Visitors need to show their e-tickets while exiting the monuments as well. The tickets can be booked through the ASI website in two slots: morning and afternoon.On Monday, those who weren’t aware of the online ticketing system took the help of fellow visitors. Rahul Jain, a businessman from Gandhinagar, visited the zoo. “When I saw that it was closed, I came to Purana Qila instead. But they asked for online tickets. A fellow visitor booked the tickets on his phone and we gave him the money,” he said. However, not all visitors came unplanned. Simran Goyal, a Class 12 student from Paschim Vihar, was among those who convinced her family to visit Humayun’s Tomb on Monday. “Due to the lack of clarity over our pending papers and results, the past three months have been very stressful. When I saw on social media that the monuments were reopening, my brother and I requested our parents that we be allowed to visit the monuments since we needed a break,” she said. Asif Khan Dehlvi, the founder of Delhi Karavan, which conducts heritage walks across the city, said that though the people needed such events in times of a pandemic, they would not be conducting them anytime soon. “With the high number of cases being recorded in Delhi, we don’t plan to conduct any heritage walk till the curve flattens here. Even if we do announce any walk this year, it will be for a smaller group and in locations where there is ample amount of space so that people can maintain social distancing,” he said.Swapna Liddle, a historian and the convener of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) Delhi, said she plans to visit the monuments soon. “Individual visits are less risky compared to heritage walks. So we won’t be conducting any heritage walks till we get a go-ahead from the medical experts. However, we have moved online and have been organising talks over social media on Delhi’s history and monuments,” she said.Ramit Mitra, the founder of Delhi By Foot, however, plans to start a walk next week depending on the Covid-19 situation in the city. “We will put some measures in place to ensure that social distancing is maintained at all times and there is no huddling during the walk. We will be using microphones and small loud speakers and we will not include more than 10 people in a group,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-monuments-reopen-see-minimal-footfall/story-aioQR1EBAeRJYyGzBu7wOL.html
07-07-2020||Delhi||CM Kejriwal asks hospitals in Delhi to encourage people to donate plasma||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday urged all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients in the city to counsel recovered patients at the time of discharge to donate their plasma, noting that even though the demand for the therapy has gone up, the number of people ready to donate is yet to pick up. The Delhi government had set up the country’s first plasma bank at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) in South Delhi’s Vasant Kunj last week to streamline plasma therapy, a treatment in which plasma from a recovered patient is injected into an infected person in order to boost the immune response to the coronavirus. According to the government, plasma therapy trials in Delhi have shown improvement in the condition of 34 out of 35 Covid-19 patients in government hospitals and 46 out of 49 patients in private hospitals.The chief minister also announced additional features in the Delhi Corona mobile application, including dedicated helpline numbers given against each hospital and colour coding for bed occupancy to make sure that people trying to locate beds and contact hospitals can do so comfortably. Addressing a digital press conference on Monday, Kejriwal said the plasma bank has boosted the demand for the therapy but the availability of plasma has remained low.“We opened the plasma bank last Wednesday and since then we have found that the demand for plasma is much more than its supply. The number of people who require plasma is more than the number of people who are donating plasma. If things continue like this, the plasma stock at the bank will be over in just a few days,” he said.Hospitals offering plasma therapy in Delhi include Lok Nayak Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, Max Hospital, Saket, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Batra Hospital and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.To scale up donations, he said the government has deployed a team of doctors who are calling up all recovered patients and appealing them to donate plasma.“If you receive such a call, please do not refuse to donate. I want to also request all the hospitals that whenever they discharge a recovered Covid-19 patient from their hospitals, they must counsel the patient for a few minutes. The hospitals must motivate them to donate plasma after 14 days of their recovery,” Kejriwal said.He urged all residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to encourage persons who have recovered from Covid-19 to become plasma donors and felicitate those who donate.“I want to request the people of Delhi to come forward in more numbers and donate their plasma. There is no need to worry. You will not experience any pain or weakness, and the government will arrange transport for you. Some people are scared that if they visit ILBS hospital, they will contract the coronavirus disease. I want to clarify that ILBS is a non-Covid hospital. There are no corona patients there and you will not be infected,” he said.The chief minister said the bank will be a success only if more and more persons who recovered from Covid-19 donate their plasma.On Monday, Delhi crossed 100,000 Covid-19 cases. The chief minister said there is no need to panic as of the 100,823 cases, 72,088 have already recovered. The recovery rate in Delhi has gone up to 72% and the positivity rate has dipped below the 10% mark for the first time in nearly 7 weeks.On the availability of beds, he said only around 5,169 beds of the total 14,986 were occupied as on Monday afternoon across all hospitals. The peak Covid-19 bed occupancy in Delhi so far has been around 6,200.To further streamline the process of getting a bed, Kejriwal has directed all Covid-19 hospitals in Delhi to launch dedicated helpline numbers to handle admission and patient-related queries.“The Delhi government received a lot of complaints from people that the phone numbers of hospitals offering Covid treatment is unreachable most of the time. Now all these hospitals have launched 24X7 authorised helpline numbers that are available on the Delhi Corona app. Any person who wants to reach out to these hospitals with Covid-19 related information can now dial these numbers directly from the app,” the government said in a statement.The hospitals have also been colour-coded -- red, yellow and green --- depending on the availability of beds, with red denoting hospitals with very few or no beds available; yellow for hospitals which have less than 50 beds available and green for hospitals that have 50 or more vacant beds. All these features were made live in the Delhi Corona mobile app and the delhifightscorona.in web portal on Monday.Dr Puneet Mishra, a professor of community medicine at AIIMS, said that a plasma bank helps ease the process of procuring plasma for patients. “Opening one centralised plasma bank is a good idea, but before opening more, the government should wait until ICMR comes out with the final result of their plasma trials. Besides, the government should now focus on increasing their ICU beds and ventilator machines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-asks-hospitals-to-encourage-people-to-donate-plasma/story-WK9cbXoiojq1wK3fyiNejN.html
07-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ambala admn launches helpline for people with comorbidities||The district administration has recently launched 24-hour helpline number 1950 to assist persons suffering from diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, besides pregnant women amid the ongoing battle against Covid-19.The helpline aims to provide medical assistance and psychological counselling to such persons.Deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said that the helpline number, launched last week, will work in a two-tier system and its main objective is to mentally strengthen the locals, who are scared of Covid-19.“A team of operators and SAKSHAM Yuva, led by the district child welfare officer, will work in a two-tier system. The first will be managed by helpline operators who will address queries related to the coronavirus and will provide psychological support if required. The second tier will be manned by the MBBS and AYUSH doctors, who will provide medical support to them at different time slots: 12 noon, 3pm and 5pm, daily,” the DC said.“This service will be beneficial for persons suffering from diseases like tuberculosis, cancer, etc. It will be ensured that pregnant women are connected with female operators only. Also, if a person, living in a containment zone, is willing to stay at the quarantine centre to avoid any risk at home, the administration will make necessary arrangements,” the DC added.Sharma also appealed to the families of pregnant women to not get the delivery done at home and get the delivery done at a hospital instead so that the immunisation of the child and the mother is taken care of properly. “Instructions have already been given to all hospitals in the district to keep their premises and equipment completely sanitised regularly,” he said.An operator at the helpline desk said that they will also arrange for a WhatsApp number and SMS facility for the callers to enable them to exchange information with the doctors and psychologists personally.An administrative official said that the district has 39 persons surviving on dialysis, 462 cancer and 845 tuberculosis patients; 2,275 pregnant women in their third trimester and 815 beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ambala-admin-launches-helpline-for-people-with-comorbidities/story-iJHmpHB70xlaumVfPnOJKJ.html

07-07-2020||Pune||PMC plans additional 1,000-bed facilities at COEP, Agriculture college||With the number of fresh Covid cases surging in the city, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to start two more Covid care facilities to increase the overall bed capacity by 1,000, while also appealing to asymptomatic patients to opt for home isolation, rather than burden the hospital infrastructure. According to Pune Municipal Commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, two facilities are coming up at the College of Engineering Pune (COEP) and College of Agriculture in the next two days. “As cases are going up each day, we are increasing bed capacity with two Covid care centres that are getting ready at COEP and Agriculture College. A total of 1,000 beds will be available in the next two days,” said Gaikwad on Monday.Anticipating more cases by July end, the PMC plans to further increase existing bed capacity at the Balewadi stadium, where currently there are 500 beds. The city administration plans to turn the badminton hall at Balewadi stadium into a Covid care centre with its engineering department making changes to the ventilation system.As of Monday, Pune reported XXXXXXX cases and XXXXX deaths. The PMC expects the city’s Covid tally to reach 48,000 by July end. With increasing cases, the administration is receiving complaints about non-availability of beds in hospitals. To de-congest hospitals, the administration wants asymptomatic patients to stay at home and complete isolation period.Medical kits for home isolation “Those having big homes and mild symptoms should opt for home isolation. In most parts of India, home isolation is being preferred but it is not happening in Pune,” said Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar, who was part of the press conference with Gaikwad and Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram.Ram said, “As the number of cases is increasing, we need to keep hospitals for critical patients instead of asymptomatic ones. Right now, it is the choice of patients but if cases increase, the administration will need to take a call on it.”The administration plans to make available a medical kit for Covid-19 positive patients who will prefer home isolation.“We are not forcing anyone, but are appealing to asymptomatic patients to prefer home isolation. It will also be helpful for them to get social and mental support from family members. We will distribute pulse oxymeters among other things,” said Mhaisekar.However, Gaikwad took a different stand on home isolation saying, “Though we are speaking about home isolation, the patients often panic when their reports come positive. They prefer to keep in contact with the medical staff. Considering this, PMC is creating more facilities.”BOX 1Gunde to be incharge of ambulancesThe government has given additional responsibility to IAS officers on deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s direction. PMPML Managing Director Nayana Gunde will now also be in-charge of ambulance operations in Pune.

07-07-2020||Pune||Kilometre-long stretch of Katraj, Bopdev ghats turn into garbage dumping ground||People entering Pune via Katraj and Bopdev ghat are greeted with piles of garbage on the roadside. At least a kilometre stretch of the ghat sections are filled with trash, which residents say is due to the dumping of the garbage from the surrounding gram panchayats.Katraj and Bopdev ghats serve as the entry points for Pune city and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) jurisdiction begins there. Solid waste management department head of the PMC, Dnyaneshwar Molak said, “Both the ghat sections do not come under the municipal corporation’s jurisdiction. However, the garbage pile-up is bad and both the spots serve as entry points to the city. We will write a letter to the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) and Pune Zilla Parishad and request them to clean the area.”PMRDA officials were not available for comment despite repeated requests, however, officials on the condition of anonymity, said, “We do not have any mechanism for garbage management. Local villages are managing their own garbage.”Molak said, “Residents of surrounding gram panchayats have been seen throwing garbage either in municipal corporation areas or near the boundaries. We have the machinery and can remove it, but the authorities responsible for cleaning it up claim that they do not have machinery and request us to remove the garbage. It is better that they manage their own garbage.”Sachin Konde, a resident of Khed Shivapur, said, “We have been using the old Katraj ghat section daily for our commute and we never saw garbage there. When the Covid restrictions were relaxed, I was shocked to see heaps of garbage in the ghat section. People from western Maharashtra mainly Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur, use this route and it is a wrong indication we are giving to our visitors.”Ranjit Diwan who stays at Khadi Machine chowk, said,“We used to travel by the Bopdev ghat almost every week. People use the ghat to get to Baramati, Jejuri and Saswad. Currently, we can see loads of trash on both sides of the road. It needs to be cleaned immediately as it gives off a foul smell as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/kilometre-long-stretch-of-katraj-bopdev-ghats-turn-into-garbage-dumping-ground/story-ZaeAwWLUWDHiXGMj4CILfL.html
07-07-2020||Pune||50 lakh urban, 2 crore rural property owners to get benefit of digital property cards||Pune Residents can now get the details of their property at the click of mouse where they can generate their digital property card.The state has fixed Rs 135 for residents from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Rs 90 for residents of municipal council while Rs 45 for rural residents as online fees for obtaining the digital property card.The property card will be affixed with digital signature and the project is implemented by the state land records department as part of its electronic mutation entry and property record storage initiative.The card is aimed at providing legal protection to one’s property as it comes with a government guarantee to the title and in future will have biometric fingerprints of owners and Aadhaar card details will be seeded with the land records, according to Maharashtra settlement commissioner S Chockalingam.Currently, full information of the real estate, including its background history and dimensions are available in the property card. Earlier, an end user had to go to the talathi office for a hardcopy of his/her property card known as 7/12 extract which was later digitised. Maharashtra revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said, “The project is in the final stage and it will benefit the citizens at large. It is a foolproof mechanism where necessary protections are in place for the property owners.”Currently the user has to pay Rs 15 online for getting a digital copy of 7/12 extract. In continuation with the digitisation policy, the state government went ahead with digitisation of complete records of individual properties in phases. Currently, the work is in its final stage after which all properties will have unique digital property cards. However, a decision regarding the fees to be charged was not taken by the government. Revenue department additional secretary Santosh Bhogale issued the government resolution (GR) regarding the fees to be charged in cities, municipalities and gram panchayat areas paving way for the earliest availability of digital property card with signature for the end users in the state.According to the land record officials at the settlement commissionerate, the digital property card will have details like name ownership title, the flat / land size, which can be obtained online subject to online payment. Besides the 50 lakh urban property owners, the benefit will extend to two crore holders of 7/12 extract in rural Maharashtra. It will trace the history of the property and generate a detailed report.“The project is being rolled out for Maharashtra from August 1. Those who want to obtain the property card can log onto mahabhumi.gov.in, link to all services and click digital property card by selecting their district and city survey no,”said Chockalingam. He said, 98.5 per cent of 2.50 crore are digitally signed and available. “We have three thousand villages having property cards. We intend to cover the state by November 1 in different stages.”The card will enable government authorities to have a clear view of the property ownership and help in taxation. It will also reduce the burden of physical running around by citizens as well as document preservation as all records are scanned and stored permanently online with a robust and secure data protection system in place, revenue department officials said. Foolproof mechanism to check property recordsThe revenue and land record individuals will be granted dedicated role-based limited access to property data through strict monitoring and accountability mechanism.Biometric access will be granted to only authorised officials after verificationMechanism to fix the responsibility of staffers with biometric access and log generationData encryption and digital signatures mechanism will be activated before government officials authorise the property documentDigital signature system has been activated to prevent unauthorised change or tamper in the individual property data on the serverSystem of verification of original informationThere will be a centralised system of the state to store data in the form of a dedicated data centreForensic audit in place to find out which official made changes in the property documents with time, data and reason||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/50-lakh-urban-and-2-crore-rural-property-owners-to-get-benefit-of-digital-property-cards/story-kZ7F7IpPTk5I5OXEOF41bL.html
07-07-2020||Pune||Maratha politics: Wadettiwar offers to give up charge over ‘Sarthi’, says he is targeted for being OBC||Maharashtra minister for relief and rehabilitation Vijay Wadettiwar on Monday offered to give up his charge over Pune-based training institute Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute (Sarthi) alleging that he was targeted by Maratha outfits for being member of Other Backward Class (OBC).The minister said he will write to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday to relinquish him from heading Sarthi and hand it over to other minister to “avoid further politics”.Wadettiwar’s remarks came after community outfits under the umbrella body Maratha Kranti Morcha targeted him for “creating hurdles” in the functioning of Sarthi, a non-profit government body for research, policy advocacy and training for socio-economic and education development of Maratha and Kunbi-Maratha communities.Established in 2019 by the then Devendra Fadnavis government, Sarthi has been at the centre of controversy over autonomy and its functioning. Maratha outfits have alleged that state government is apathetic towards the organisation and wants to close it down.Rajendra Kunjir, convenor of Maratha Kranti Morcha, said that Wadettiwar’s approach towards Sarthi has been indifferent. “Despite our repeated follow-ups, this government and the minister has not released funds to Sarthi. The body has also stopped various schemes for poor Maratha youths. We, therefore, demand that Sarthi’s charge should be taken away from Wadettiwar,” said Kunjir.Wadettiwar has repeatedly termed the stand taken by Maratha Kranti Morcha as “political”. “There was no complete autonomy to Sarthi from the beginning when it was established by the Fadnavis government in its last days. However, efforts are being made to target me possibly because a section of Maratha community feel I am OBC and they may not get justice. Therefore, I have decided to write to CM requesting him to give Sarthi’s charge to someone else.”The minister’s stand comes a day before the Supreme Court is to hear petition challenging the validity of Maratha reservation. Various Maratha organisations have alleged that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is not pro-active in ensuring that decision on Maratha reservation is upheld in the Supreme Court.During the Fadnavis government, Sarthi was allocated Rs 23 crore while MVA gave Rs 23 lakh till now. “There are efforts to kill Sarthi by MVA government just because it was founded by us,” said former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Responding to Wadettiwar’s allegations that he was being cornered for being OBC member, Leader of Opposition in the state legislative council Pravin Darekar said, “There is no question targeting Wadettiwar for being OBC. Instead of making allegations, this government should come up with time-bound programme to make Sarthi an important organisation for Maratha youths.Congress spokespersons Hemlata Patil said that the chief minister will personally see how work will be carried out at Sarthi. “There is no question of Sarthi’s autonomy being taken away. There’s politics being played as the government was formed just six months back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maratha-politics-wadettiwar-offers-to-give-up-charge-over-sarthi-says-he-is-targeted-for-being-obc/story-qEDjPLtRny26juzohzYIyH.html

DSK, his wife, son, relatives and some employees have been accused of cheating thousands of investors of over Rs 2000 crore.Makrand was granted bail on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh, according to his lawyer. However, he is awaiting release due to procedural requirements. The application was opposed by special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan.“Yes, bail was granted. We have applied for certified copies of the order. We will be challenging the release order once we have it,” said Shivaji Pawar, assistant commissioner of police, Pune who is investigating the case.DSK, his wife, and a few relatives were booked under Sections 420, 406, 409, 411, 465, 467, 468, 471, 109, 120(b) and 34 of Indian Penal Code along with Sections 3 and 4 of Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act.The first chargesheet in the case was registered against DSK and his wife Hemanti Kulkarni in May 2018. A supplementary chargesheet was filed later in 2018 against son Shirish Kulkarni, Dhananjay Pachpor, Kedar Vanjpe, Sai Vanjpe, Vinay Badgadi and Anuradha Purandare. In July 2019, a second supplementary chargesheet was filed against Sunil Madhukar Ghatpande and Rajeev Dullabhdas Nevaskar. A third supplementary chargesheet was filed in November 2019 against Makrand Kulkarni, according to advocate Nahar.“There is nothing on record to show that he has acquired any financial benefit and that he is beneficiary of DSK group of companies,” reads his bail application filed by advocate Nahar.The police had alleged that Makrand was involved in hiking up the price of a land in Phursungi. He allegedly bought land in his name from the farmers who previously owned it for Rs 4,87,25,000 and later sold it to DSK Developers Limited at a higher price of Rs 9,29,83,000.The bail application by Makrand states that he has not been a part of DSK business since 1993. However, the power of attorney of a bank account in his name was with Anuradha Purandhare and Hemanti Kulkarni, co-accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dsk-s-brother-granted-bail-in-cheating-case-police-to-challenge-order/story-sF3fuuoCwNZZGMYtaPO3FI.html

Earlier, the party workers had staged a dharna outside the Moti Bagh Palace, the residence of chief minister (CM) Capt Amarinder Singh, when they were stopped on the way to YPS.Accusing the CM of double speak, Romana said while the state government had announced it would file a review petition against the high court verdict in favour of private schools, the schools run by the CM’s family were extorting money from parents. He said the branches of YPS in Patiala and Mohali had extorted fee from parents even before the high court verdict was out.The case against SAD workers was registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, for holding dharna during a pandemic and not adhering to social distancing norms.“The police had briefed them about the pandemic situation but they went ahead with the protest. Thus on the basis of the complaint, we have registered an FIR,” confirmed SSP Mandeep Singh SIdhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yad-holds-dharna-outside-yps-over-excess-fee-charged-from-parents/story-4qcB28gsDGbfjuF1XhiKMI.html
07-07-2020||Pune||PMC doubles stipend to attract doctors for Covid care||Even as the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to double stipend of specialist doctors who will be recruited, the response is poor as the latter demand insurance cover and definite job profile.The civic administration’s shortage of critical care infrastructure got a boost when it received 21 ventilators from the PM Cares funds. However, the civic body is facing a shortage of specialist doctors to run the critical care facilities. With earlier calls to invite specialist doctors to join PMC failing to get the desired result, the civic body has doubled their stipend.In May, the civic body placed advertisements to invite specialist doctors like intensivist, ICU physician, paediatrician, anaesthetist, resident medical officer, dentist, pharmacist and medical officer (Covid-19 Aayush certificate holder). Few replied to the job offer, forcing PMC to increase payment terms. On June 29, the civic body published an advertisement to recruit 10 intensivists, 20 physicians, 10 paediatricians and 10 ICU physicians with a starting a salary of Rs 2.25 lakh per month. The civic body’s recent recruitment drive under the health department is the appointment of over 150 doctors for six months under ‘The Urban Learning Internship Programme’ or TULIP. The civic body published advertisements to hire 50 MBBS at Rs 60,000 per month, 50 BAMS as Rs 40,000 per month and 50 BHMS doctors at Rs 35,000 per month.Dr Ramchandra Hankare, PMC health officer chief, “For the second round, we compared our offers with the Mumbai civic body, PCMC civic body and the state. We have put forward these advertisements across the country. We hope to get a better response this time. Those working continuously in ICU or Covid wards will be given enough rest if the recruitment drive succeeds.”Dr Anjali Sabne, officer incharge of recruitment, PMC health department said, “We did not get the desired response to our earlier advertisement and have now doubled the pay offer. We have begun the interview process for specialist doctors from Monday and hope to get more doctors. Those hired will work at Covid care centres and flu clinics and carry out Covid and non-Covid duties.” Dr Sanjay Patil, vice-president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Maharashtra chapter said, “The uncertainty of job profile and the time period is a concern among doctors. While specialist doctors want a shorter duration like the one Sassoon hospital offers of 14 days package with 7 days of quarantine, interns require a longer duration which provides job guarantee of at least 6 months. Sassoon hospital offers a package of about 14 days wherein the person gets enough time to rest and recharge and even continue his or her private practice. They have now even started the second round. Another important issue is that while PMC hires a person as a dentist or even as an intensivist, they are often asked to work in Covid-19 ward as a general physician which is what was happening earlier. So, these uncertainties are keeping doctors away from accepting PMC offer.” Dr Patil said that despite IMA writing to the state government to provide deputation letters and insurance coverage under the PM’s Covid-19 warrior insurance coverage scheme to those being hired on contract, the response is still awaited. He said, “An official recognition like a deputation letter will also go a long way in encouraging young doctors to work for PMC and open a window of opportunities for young doctors in the near future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-doubles-stipend-to-attract-doctors-for-covid-care/story-SklzcFymBqqB6aRIBptDRM.html
07-07-2020||World||1.2 million died from snake bite in India between 2000-2019: Report||Nearly 1.2 million people died from snake bite deaths in India between 2000 and 2019, and many of these fatalities can be avoided by adopting a series of targeted precautions, a new study has pointed out.Published in the open access journal eLife, the ‘Trends in snakebite deaths in India from 2000 to 2019 in a nationally representative mortality study’, was based on data collected from the Indian Million Death Study, a collaborative effort between the Toronto-based Centre for Global Health Research or CGHR and the Registrar General of India.The World Health Organisation has estimated that between 81,000 and 138,000 people die from snake bites globally each year, and of these, nearly half are in India. Three times that number survive but may require amputations or suffer permanent disabilities.CGHR executive director and senior author of the snake bite study, Dr Prabhat Jha, told the Hindustan Times there is “evidence of avoidability here.” “A set of measures targeted at high-burden states, during the peak period during the monsoon, could result in an appreciable reduction in fatalities. Some of the measures could be simple,” Jha said.Jha added that as the deaths primarily occur in rural areas at lower elevations, provision of rubber boots, rechargeable torches, and aligning anti-venom availability with need, education about preventative measures including safe harvesting practices during farming, are among the steps required.The regional hotspots lie in the high-burden states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Jharkhand.“The risk of an Indian dying from snakebite before age 70 is about 1 in 250, but notably higher in some areas,” the study said. It recommended innovative outreach to tackle the menace. “Increased use of antivenom would require tactful cooperation with local traditional healers and ayurvedic practitioners to persuade them to refer severely ill patients for treatment with antivenom, and raising awareness of the effectiveness of antivenom,” it said.The study’s lead author Wilson Suraweera, senior research analyst and Bio-statistician at CGHR, noted, “We wanted to provide the most complete picture of snakebite epidemiology in India to better understand the volume of untimely deaths, case-fatality patterns and important snakebite characteristics, while analysing 20 years of scientific data to drill down to regions on which public health measures should be focused.”“India has sufficient manufacturing capacity for large snake antivenom production. Better understanding of the distribution of India’s many venomous snake species could help in the development of more appropriate antivenoms.”Among the species identified in the study are Russell’s viper, four types of cobras, eight varieties of kraits, and saw-scaled viper, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-2-million-died-from-snake-bite-in-india-between-2000-2019/story-zvG8RyFWr5F6ySoDofeuAM.html
07-07-2020||World||UK’s Rishi Sunak urged to go further to protect young from recession||The UK opposition Labour Party has urged Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak to focus more effort on protecting young people from the effects of what could be the worst recession in three centuries.Sunak will on Wednesday unveil the next stage of his program to reduce the damage done to the British economy by coronavirus. The government is trying to restart businesses that have been closed since the country went into lockdown in March, with pubs and restaurants the latest to reopen their doors. But Labour is concerned that the young will be particularly badly hit.Ed Miliband, Labour’s business spokesman, told the Resolution Foundation think tank he hoped the government would recognize “the particular impact on particular groups in this crisis” such as young people. Over one million young people could be out of work by the end of the year, according to research by the Institute for Public Policy Research.“Governments tend to think that the danger is that they do too much too quickly, when really the danger is doing too little too late,” Miliband said. “I hope we see a response which is equal to the scale of the emergency, particularly facing young people. What you don’t want is a kind of abyss between the end of furlough and the job-creation measures in place.”Among Sunak’s announcements on Wednesday will be a 111 million-pound ($140 million) program to triple the number of traineeships for young people, but Labour argues that more is needed.Sunak Eyes $3.8 Billion of Green Spend to Fuel UK RecoveryLabour’s Treasury spokeswoman Anneliese Dodds told Sunak in Parliament on Tuesday the government’s current proposal “hardly reflects a focus on jobs, jobs, jobs.” The Chancellor replied that tens of thousands of “good local jobs” would be created through new grants for energy-efficient housing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-rishi-sunak-urged-to-go-further-to-protect-young-from-recession/story-RCaNN2bFIXqDVUQJzHmFmN.html
07-07-2020||World||Bolsonaro gets Covid after downplaying its impact on Brazil||Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, who has consistently belittled the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic while his country has soared to the world’s second-most cases and deaths, tested positive for Covid-19.“I’m perfectly well,” Bolsonaro told journalists in a live interview on Tuesday, after announcing the result of his test. He’s taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria medicine that he has touted as being effective against the virus though its use hasn’t been authorized by most health experts globally and could carry dangerous side effects.He joins other world leaders who have been contaminated by the virus, including Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, both of whom were hospitalized during the treatment.“Everyone knew that sooner or later it would affect a good part of the population,” he said. “Life continues. But if the economy doesn’t work it will bring new forms of death and suicide.”He told reporters his latest temperature reading was 36.7 degrees Celsius, or 98 Fahrenheit.He asked reporters to step away and then pulled off his face mask to say, “See, I am fine. See you next week, God willing.”Bolsonaro has refused to use a mask in public and even battled the court over an order forcing him to. During the announcement of his test results, he refrained from suggesting that Brazilians use masks, saying that any precautions should be weighed against the economic damage they might cause.The 65-year-old president, who during his campaign to reopen the economy called the virus “just a little flu,” has repeatedly disobeyed medical recommendations to avoid contamination, mingling in crowds without a face mask and shaking hands.Late on Monday, however, a video posted on YouTube showed a masked Bolsonaro trying not to get too close to supporters who awaited him in front of the presidential palace. He told them he was following social distancing orders from a doctor after showing symptoms of the virus, and added that an exam had shown his lungs were “clean.”But Bolsonaro has had recent health troubles. In September 2018 while campaigning for president, he was stabbed in the abdomen, leading to multiple surgeries. For months, he relied on a feeding tube and colostomy bag. During his interview Tuesday he appeared weary with dark circles around his eyes.Brazil has become a global hotspot for the virus, trailing only the U.S. with more than 65,000 confirmed deaths and over 1.62 million total cases. Its response has been erratic, with the president often clashing with state governors and other officials over quarantine measures and possible treatments. Brazil’s health ministry is currently headed by an army general after Bolsonaro fired his first minister and a second resigned.The Brazilian real, which was leading gains earlier in the day, fell after the announcement, joining a slide in other emerging-market currencies. Stocks held onto losses.“So What?“Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus since Brazil confirmed its first case in late February. In a televised speech in March, he said he wasn’t worried about being infected by the illness because he was “an athlete” in the past.“If I am infected by the virus, I wouldn’t have to worry,” Bolsonaro said at that time. “I wouldn’t feel anything. I would be affected by only a little flu.”In April, when questioned about news that Brazil surpassed had China in terms of virus deaths, Bolsonaro replied by saying, “so what?” When asked about virus fatalities at another point in the same month, he said “I’m not a gravedigger, ok?”Still, Bolsonaro could be seen coughing during a Thursday broadcast on his social networks, when he sat next to six other people, none of whom wore a mask. Officials who were present included Regional Development Minister Rogerio Marinho and the chief executive officer of state-owned bank Caixa Economica Federal, Pedro Guimaraes. Guimaraes was tested for the virus on Tuesday, his office said.Since then, Bolsonaro has mingled with members of his administration and the general public, and had lunch with the U.S. ambassador to Brazil on Saturday. That day, Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo tweeted an image from the lunch showing the president with his arm around the minister and seated beside the ambassador, Todd Chapman. Both the ambassador and his wife tested negative and will remain under quarantine, the U.S. embassy said on Tuesday.On Monday, Bolsonaro didn’t participate in a ceremony that he was supposed to host, opting instead to go to the hospital. The president later canceled most of his agenda for the rest of the week, including a scheduled trip to the state of Bahia.It is not the first time Bolsonaro has been tested for Covid-19. In March, after multiple members of his delegation to a U.S. visit contracted the virus, he said he tested negative.On June 25, he said during a Facebook live broadcast that he thought he had already contracted the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-gets-covid-after-downplaying-its-impact-on-brazil/story-bdrolgeZ7ta3wOkL8l7Z0N.html
07-07-2020||World||New UK sanctions could apply to Indians too: Dominic Raab||A new sanctions regime against abusers of human rights unveiled on Monday could be applied to individuals in India or those in countries that are allies or friends of the United Kingdom, foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said.The first list of individuals and entities facing asset freeze and visa bans include those from Russia, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar and North Korea. Raab came under pressure on Tuesday to name individuals in China (on abuses related to Uyghur Muslims) and Hong Kong.During the debate in the House of Commons, Scottish National Party MP Brendan O’Hara asked Raab about imposing sanctions on the UK’s allies, including India, which is one of the key markets with which the post-Brexit UK is keen to reach a free trade deal.He asked: “Can the Foreign Secretary assure the House that the application of the sanctions regime will be transparently even-handed and will not be blind to human rights abuses carried out by or in the name of our so-called allies and friends such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Israel or India, or indeed countries with which we are seeking to secure a post-Brexit trade deal?Raab responded: “If the hon. Gentleman looks at the designations, he will see that we have answered that in the first round that we are making today”. The UK has a ‘long-standing relationship’ with Saudi Arabia, which is one of the countries whose citizens named on Monday.Raab said MPs, civil society groups and others could suggest names for future sanctions. Britain’s crime officials have been dealing with several cases of foreign nationals with controversial backgrounds who have bought property and other assets in London and the UK.Raab told MPs: “(This) Government and this House send a very clear message, on behalf of the British people: those with blood on their hands, the thugs of despots, the henchmen of dictators, will not be free to waltz into this country, to buy up property on the Kings Road, do their Christmas shopping in Knightsbridge or siphon dirty money through British banks or other financial institutions”.Labour MP Gagan Mohindra, who was one of the new Indian-origin MPs elected in the December 2019 election, asked Raab if the sanctions regime would include the issue of freedom of religion and belief around the world.Raab responded: “The regime focuses on the most serious human rights abuses—those against the right to life, the prohibition against torture, and the prohibition against slave labour and forced labour—but of course many of those abuses can be directed at journalists and those practising their religion, and if he looks at the designations that we have made today, he will find that that is true even in relation to the first wave”.Those named in the first list of sanctions include Myanmar army commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and Soe Win, deputy commander-in-chief – both named in relation to Rohingya Muslims in the Rakhine state.The regime is expected to allow the UK to target individuals and organisations around the world unlike conventional geographic sanctions regime, which only target a country. It could also include those who commit unlawful killings perpetrated against journalists and media workers, or violations and abuses motivated on the grounds of religion or belief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-sanctions-could-apply-to-indians-too-dominic-raab/story-g5s1NZTOO7iGtZUFwEpXXM.html
07-07-2020||World||UK’s home secretary Priti Patel, daughter of shopkeepers, vows to tackle shop crime||Home secretary Priti Patel on Tuesday remembered her background as a daughter of immigrants from Uganda who ran shops after arriving in the UK, and set out plans to crack down on abuse and violence by customers against workers in shops.The plans include guidance on reporting crime, strengthening and making full use of existing laws and improving data sharing between businesses and police. The focus will be on theft of goods valued up to £200 from a shop being prosecuted as a criminal offence.Responding to a consultation on the issue, Patel said: “As the daughter of shopkeepers, I know what a vital role they play within our communities and just how tirelessly they have worked during the coronavirus pandemic”.“I will not tolerate violence and abuse against any shopworker and it’s right that those who commit these crimes must be caught and punished,” she said.The majority of nearly 3,500 individuals, businesses and other organisations that engaged with the consultation believed that abuse toward shop staff had increased in recent years and a significant number said they did not report incidents to the police.Officials said that respondents gave many examples of behaviour they faced at work; the most common being violence or abuse in the context of preventing shop theft. Other commonly cited issues included attacks, or threat of attack, involving a weapon.Respondents said they were subjected to anti-social behaviour, typically committed by young people; organised criminal activity by gangs or groups of individuals; racial abuse; armed robberies; criminal damage; sexual harassment; spitting; biting; and, acts of violence, or threats to commit acts of violence, including use of, or threats to use, a weapon.A large number of Asian immigrants set up shops – known as ‘Patel corner shops’ – after arriving in the UK over the decades, often facing racism. The character of the mostly family-run shops has changed over the years, with younger generations preferring other vocations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-home-secretary-priti-patel-daughter-of-shopkeepers-vows-to-tackle-shop-crime/story-6EzpJvY8suS4UltPMmcEXL.html
07-07-2020||World||Joe Biden promises to up US production of key medical equipment||Joe Biden is promising to shift production of medical equipment and other key pandemic-fighting products “back to U.S. soil,” creating jobs and bolstering a domestic supply chain he says has been exposed as inadequate and vulnerable by the coronavirus outbreak.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s campaign released a plan Tuesday to reinforce stockpiles of a “range of critical products on which the U.S. is dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers.” That includes medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, but also energy and grid resilience technologies, semiconductors and key electronics, as well as telecommunications infrastructure and raw materials.It marked the Biden campaign’s most comprehensive statements yet on how it would better equip the nation to fight the coronavirus and future pandemics — though it did not include specifics on how much doing so would cost. If elected in November, Biden promises to initiate immediately a 100-day review of “critical national security risks across America’s international supply chain,” while asking Congress to create a permanent, mandatory review process.The former vice president envisions creating a “critical supply chains workforce” that would be part of a larger job creation and economic recovery plan his camp has spent weeks promising it will soon release.In a conference call with reporters, senior Biden campaign officials said public health officials have indicated that there were positive signs around the creation of coronavirus vaccines but that there’s no guarantee any might be ready by January. The officials said Biden’s camp is preparing for the possibility that a vaccine isn’t available by then, or that one is but will need to be mass produced and distributed in equitable ways around the country.Biden has long criticized President Donald Trump’s administration for failing to press more private companies into production of ventilators and other critical medical and protective equipment during the virus outbreak under the Defense Production Act. The Republican president has countered that his use of the authority has saved lives by “removing obstacles in the supply chain.”The Biden plan released Tuesday promises to rely more heavily on the Defense Production Act while seeking to harness federal purchasing power to improve manufacturing capacity for products deemed vital to national security.It also includes an emphasis on increasing long-term pharmaceutical production, citing the Food and Drug Administration in reporting that more than 70% of active pharmaceutical ingredient facilities that currently supply the U.S. market are located abroad.The campaign officials said the goal was not to make U.S. manufacturing “purely self-sufficient” but to decrease dependence on foreign producers like China. Biden also wants a system that is resilient.The plan aims to increase critical stockpiles while also creating national “surge capacity” to further ramp up production in times of crisis. It also includes provisions to work with U.S. allies globally and use regulatory tools to bolster their own critical supply chains while potentially creating new markets for American manufactured goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-promises-to-up-us-production-of-key-medical-equipment/story-j3autL2fie6XE57y1Yk6NJ.html

07-07-2020||World||ICE guideline forces students enrolled in colleges holding online classes out of US||Panic has gripped Indian and international students in US colleges over the new guideline announced Monday by the Trump administration. The guideline forces foreign non-immigrant students to leave the country if they are enrolled in institutions holding only online classes for the fall semester. The state department will not issue visas to students on F-1 and M-1 — for academic and vocations students — enrolled in online-only institutions and the US border and customs will not let them enter the country, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) department said in the guideline. This would apply, presumably, to new enrolments.Students who were already in the United States and were enrolled at these online-only institutions will be allowed a maximum of one online class or three credit hours to remain in status or they would have to switch to a school that allows them to take the minimum number of in-person classes.At institutions that are moving towards a “hybrid model” — a mix of online and in-person teaching or “blended” programme as some universities call them — students will be allowed to take more than one course online, or three credit hours. However, the university must certify that the “program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program”.But these exemptions did not apply to F-1 students in English language training programs or M-1 students pursing vocational degrees, ICE said. These students are “not permitted to enroll in any online courses,” it added.With an eye on his re-election bid coming November, President Donald Trump has been pushing for the country to reopen after Covid-19 lockdown to get the economy back on track. “Schools must reopen in the fall,” he wrote on twitter, in all-caps, around the time as the ICE announcement was made.“There is a sense of panic among students,” said Onkar Joshi, a doctoral candidate at the University of Maryland in Maryland. “The order forces us to choose between our health and staying in the US,” he added.There are approximately 200,000 Indian students in the United States. It was not clear immediately how many of them would be impacted and in what way as universities do not have a uniform model for reopening. Not all of them have announced their programmes for the fall semester, which starts mid-August.India raised the issue with the US at foreign office consultations Tuesday morning. Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and US under-secretary of state for political affairs David Hale discussed ways to further enhance mutually beneficial trade and people-to-people ties, including through visa facilitation for students and professionals, the ministry of external affairs said in a readout of the meeting.An estimated 1 million international students enrolled in US colleges every year. Their impact on US economy is worth $41 billion and they support more than 450,000 jobs.Harvard University announced earlier Monday — just before the ICE guideline — that it will hold all classes online and will allow only 40% of these students to return live on campus for the fall semester, according to The Harvard Crimson.“We are deeply concerned that the guidance issued today by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement imposes a blunt, one-size-fits-all approach to a complex problem, giving international students, particularly those in online programs, few options beyond leaving the country or transferring schools,” Harvard University president Lawrence S Bacow said in a statement.“This guidance undermines the thoughtful approach taken on behalf of students by so many institutions, including Harvard, to plan for continuing academic programs while balancing the health and safety challenges of the global pandemic,” he added.The American Council on Education (ACE), which represents US colleges and universities, slammed the ICE guideline as “horrifying”.“At a time when institutions are doing everything they can to help reopen our country, we need flexibility, not a big step in the wrong direction,” the organization said further in a statement. “ICE should allow any international student with a valid visa to continue their education regardless of whether a student is receiving his or her education online, in person, or through a combination of both, whether in the United States or in their home country, during this unprecedented global health crisis.”Foreign students are not allowed into the United States through online-only institutions and an exemption was made , ICE said in the statement, in view of the Covid-19 epidemic. “This policy permitted non-immigrant students to take more online courses than normally permitted by federal regulation to maintain their non-immigrant status during the Covid-19 emergency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panic-among-indian-students-due-to-new-ice-guideline/story-OGnJrhSTGPjX5xDD5eNhwK.html
07-07-2020||World||Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro tests positive for Covid-19||Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro tested positive for Covid-19 in an escalation of the health crisis that has engulfed Latin America’s largest economy.“I’m perfectly well,” Bolsonaro told CNN Brasil in a live interview, after announcing the result of his test. He added he is taking hydroxichloroquine, an anti-malaria medicine he’s been touting as being effective against the virus though its use hasn’t been authorized by most health experts globally and could carry dangerous side effects.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe 65-year-old president, who during his campaign to reopen the economy called the virus “just a little flu,” has repeatedly disobeyed medical recommendations to avoid contamination, mingling in crowds without a face mask and giving people handshakes.Late on Monday, however, a video posted on YouTube showed a masked Bolsonaro trying not to get too close to supporters who awaited him in front of the presidential palace. He told them he was following social distancing orders from a doctor after showing symptoms of the virus, and added that an exam had shown his lungs were “clean.”Brazil has become a global hotspot for the virus, trailing only the U.S. with more than 65,000 confirmed deaths and over 1.62 million total cases. It has implemented an erratic response to the pandemic, with the president often clashing with state governors and even his health minister over quarantine measures and possible treatments. Brazil’s health ministry is currently headed by an interim chief after Bolsonaro fired his first minister and a second resigned.Bolsonaro could be seen coughing during a Thursday broadcast on his social networks, when he sat next to six other people, none of whom wore a mask. Officials who were present included Regional Development Minister Rogerio Marinho and the chief executive officer of state-owned bank Caixa Economica Federal, Pedro Guimaraes. Since then, he has mingled with members of his administration and the general public, and had lunch with the U.S. ambassador to Brazil on Saturday.It is not the first time Bolsonaro has been tested for Covid-19. In March, after multiple members of his delegation to a U.S. visit contracted the virus, he said he tested negative.On June 25, he said during a Facebook live broadcast that he thought he had already contracted the virus.Bolsonaro joins other world leaders who have been contamined by the virus, including Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, both of whom were hospitalized during the treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-president-jair-bolsonaro-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-YH3IgqjjE0DwOevBzKwdBI.html
07-07-2020||World||Trump insists that school open, but teachers aren’t so sure||President Donald Trump has made his position clear: “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” he tweeted Monday. As Covid-19 surges in parts of the US, many teachers aren’t convinced.The pandemic’s ever-shifting nature has robbed school districts of the ability to plan with certainty -- not only for instruction, but to provide protective equipment and intensive cleaning. Even if a sustained decline in infections allows them to open their doors, many are preparing a mix of in-person and remote education that is certain to fall short of the president’s expectations.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The reality is that they have to map out several scenarios for the fall with the real possibility that they don’t know what the scenario will be on the first day of school,” said Betheny Gross, associate director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington at Bothell, which has been tracking districts’ responses to the coronavirus shutdown.In Washington on Tuesday, Trump will host a gathering of health and education leaders -- as well as students and parents -- for an event billed as a “National Dialogue on Safely Reopening America’s Schools.”The event comes as many students approach five months without setting foot in a classroom. Proponents of returning say distance learning is hobbling children’s development and the economy, with parents trying to juggle work and their offspring. Many teachers say they’re well aware of the benefits of face-to-face instruction, but worry about endangering students and peers.“The Trump Administration is committed to working in partnership with university presidents, superintendents, principals, counselors, teachers, health professionals, parents, and students to ensure in-person learning resumes in a safe and healthy way,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.Economic dragTrump’s demand that schools open this fall was a reminder of how politicized the issue has become. “It’s not surprising,” said Douglas Harris, chair of the Department of Economics at Tulane University in New Orleans and a public-education expert. “The economy can’t really open back up again until kids go back to school.”Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, the nation’s biggest teachers union, said schools need a massive allocation of federal stimulus funds to purchase protective equipment and hire cleaners. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday predicted Congress this month will pass one final rescue package.Teachers agree that remote instruction isn’t optimal, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. The real debate, she said, is around how to return to school safely -- and the need for money to do it right.“Either you have to be a moron about not understanding how government or schools work, or you have to be really callous and craven that you’d wait till the end, till it’s almost too late,” Weingarten said.To maintain social distancing, schools will have to use lunchrooms, gyms, libraries and trailers as classrooms. Some are considering rotating classes in mornings and afternoons or three days a week. Others may keep older pupils online, while using high-school classrooms for younger children who don’t learn well via Zoom, Garcia said.Gross said schools may also need to rotate through different scenarios as the school year goes on and the pandemic changes anew.In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday reiterated that no decision has been made on whether students across the state will be able to return for in-person learning in the fall.“We obviously very much would like to,” Cuomo said, adding that New York City and 700 school districts are in the process of developing reopening plans that must be submitted to the state.In Texas, where Covid-19 cases have surged since the state embarked on one of the country’s most aggressive reopening plans, most teachers surveyed by the Houston Federation of Teachers have said they would prefer to not return to in-person learning until it is “safe,” according to Andy Dewey, the group’s executive vice president.Defining safe“The definition of safe is where we have disagreement,” he said by phone Monday. “The problem is this: The district hasn’t given us any guidance on it because the district says the state hasn’t given any guidance on it.”The latest survey conducted by the El Paso branch of the AFT showed that just 7% of 790 respondents were in favor of full face-to-face learning at the start of the school year. About 20% said they supported a “hybrid” return, while roughly 72% said they favored remote learning. The city and surrounding area’s two main school districts both plan to start the first few weeks of the year virtually.Teachers for the Houston Independent School District have until the end of this week to decide whether they want to resign to avoid potentially being required to return to classrooms. After that, they risk having their teaching certificates suspended for a year if they defy an in-person start to the school year, with a permanent notation that could make it harder for them to get hired in other districts, Dewey said.Leslie LaFollette, a third-grade teacher at Kiker Elementary in Austin, said she’s prepared to move to Massachusetts, where her wife has family, if educators aren’t allowed to stick to online learning.“It’s drastic, but I’m willing to do that if we lose the option,” said LaFollette, 46. “I miss my kids, I want to be with them. But not to the detriment of their health and my health.”In Seattle, site of the first major US outbreak, officials are pursuing a hybrid reopening. Parents have been asked to fill out a questionnaire with their preferences so the district can plan. In August, families must finalize their pick.“We’re focusing on making that as equitable and safe as possible,” said Julie Popper, spokeswoman for the Seattle Educational Association, which represents some 6,000 members, including teachers and staff.Before opening, the union wants to make sure Seattle is spending enough on staff and protective equipment to meet state health and safety rules, as well as adding custodial workers to disinfect, and having nurses and mental-health professionals in every school daily, Popper said.Peer interactionIn North Carolina, Angie Mangin is optimistic about getting her two incoming eighth-graders back to school, especially her daughter, after having them home-learning since March.“My son wasn’t too affected by the change, but my daughter needs that interaction with her peers,” said Mangin, 54, who works in the insurance and risk department of Circle K convenience stores.Tulane’s Harris, who studies the economics of education and education policy, said there’s simply no guarantee everyone is going back. “It’s hard to imagine that schools will reopen fully in person on a large scale,” he said.Trump, who avoids wearing a mask in public and has convened rallies without social-distancing requirements, has urged local governments to reopen. Stacy Davis Gates, vice president of the Chicago Teachers Union and executive vice president of the Illinois Federation of Teachers, said she didn’t trust him to lead on education policy.“President Trump has been virtually missing in action with respect to keeping Americans safe countrywide,” Gates said. “It gives me a great amount of anxiety to know that he is going to set the standard for my children and America’s children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-insists-that-school-open-but-teachers-aren-t-so-sure/story-6G2MS5pwH82cKkNOfZyBkM.html
07-07-2020||World||TikTok quits Hong Kong as US giants suspend processing data requests||Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok announced on Tuesday it would pull out of Hong Kong within days, as global tech giants struggle to figure out how to operate in the city under sweeping new security rules imposed by Beijing.Major U.S. internet companies including Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Twitter and Zoom have all announced they have suspended the processing of requests for user data from the Hong Kong authorities while they study the new law.The U.S. companies’ social media platforms are generally banned in China, where access is blocked by Beijing’s “great firewall”. Most have operated freely in Hong Kong, but will now have to determine how to comply with new rules for the city, which rights groups say threaten freedoms enjoyed for decades.Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, said in a statement on Monday it was pausing reviews of user data requests for all of its services “pending further assessment of the National Security Law.”Google and Twitter said they had suspended their reviews of data requests from Hong Kong authorities immediately after the law went into effect last week. Zoom and Microsoft’s LinkedIn issued similar statements on Tuesday.Apple said it does not receive requests for user content directly from Hong Kong, but requires authorities there to submit requests through the U.S. department of justice under a legal assistance treaty.“We’re assessing the new law, which went into effect less than a week ago, and we have not received any content requests since the law went into effect,” Apple said in a statement. Tuesday’s announcement by TikTok of its plan to quit Hong Kong is notable because the short-form video app is owned by a Chinese company but operates only outside of mainland China. Its parent company, ByteDance, runs a separate, similar service inside China, while saying TikTok is intended to appeal to users worldwide. Its exit means Hong Kong users, like those in mainland China, will now be cut off from the global version.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday Washington was considering banning TikTok in the United States. Asked if Americans should download it, he told Fox News: “Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.”A source familiar with TikTok’s decision to exit Hong Kong said the city was a small, loss making market for the platform.RADICAL CHANGESChina’s parliament passed the national security legislation last week, setting the stage for the most radical changes to the former British colony’s way of life since it returned to Chinese rule 23 years ago. Hong Kong late on Monday published more details about how the new law will strengthen police powers over the internet, including the ability to ask publishers to remove information deemed a threat to national security.Asked about the moves by the U.S. tech firms, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told a news conference on Tuesday: “Ultimately, time and facts will tell that this law will not undermine human rights and freedoms.”Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, in response to a question on TikTok’s plan to exit Hong Kong, said the business environment would improve after the law was established. “We hope the relevant sides will view China’s rights in safeguarding its sovereignty and safety in a fair, objective and reasonable manner, to speak and act cautiously on the Hong Kong issue, to not selectively create barriers and politicize the issue,” he said.King-wa Fu, an associate professor at The University of Hong Kong’s Journalism and Media Studies Centre, said he expected Hong Kong to introduce measures to regulate media and the Internet, with a system of censorship similar to that in mainland China.“That’s why (the platforms) are ‘suspending’ and evaluating the situation. I don’t have a crystal ball. But I believe the national security office wouldn’t tolerate a free Internet in Hong Kong to continue and further restrictions would be imposed,” he said.Some Hong Kong residents say they are reviewing their social media posts, deleting ones that could be viewed as sensitive.“It’s not safe anymore if the government really does this,” said Richard Lai, 26, a former medical worker. “I’ll keep using the social media platforms but will just use it for obtaining information but will not post anything.”Messaging app Signal, which promises end-to-end encryption, has seen a surge in sign-ups by Hong Kong residents.“We’d announce that we’re stopping too, but we never started turning over user data to HK police. Also, we don’t have user data to turn over,” it said on Twitter on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-quits-hong-kong-as-us-giants-suspend-processing-data-requests/story-PndLAo7Z7WdDNKkVSH0BeJ.html
07-07-2020||World||Doctors say experimental treatment may have rid man of HIV||A Brazilian man infected with the AIDS virus has shown no sign of it for more than a year since he stopped HIV medicines after an intense experimental drug therapy aimed at purging hidden, dormant virus from his body, doctors reported Tuesday.The case needs independent verification and it’s way too soon to speculate about a possible cure, scientists cautioned.“These are exciting findings but they’re very preliminary,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an AIDS specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. “This has happened to one person, and one person only,” and it didn’t succeed in four others given the same treatment, she said.Another UCSF specialist, Dr. Steven Deeks, said: “This is not a cure,” just an interesting case that merits more study.The case was described at an AIDS conference where researchers also disclosed an important prevention advance: A shot of an experimental medicine every two months worked better than daily Truvada pills to help keep uninfected gay men from catching HIV from an infected sex partner. Hundreds of thousands of people take these “pre-exposure prevention” pills now and the shot could give a new option, almost like a temporary vaccine.If the Brazil man’s case is confirmed, it would be the first time HIV has been eliminated in an adult without a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Independent experts want to see whether his remission lasts and for the intense drug combination that he received to undergo more testing.“I’m very moved because it’s something that millions of people want,” said the 35-year-old man, whose spoke to The Associated Press on condition that his name not be published. “It’s a gift of life, a second chance to live.”Transplants are how two other men, nicknamed the Berlin and London patients for where they were treated, were cured previously.“I’m the living proof it’s possible to be cured,” Adam Castillejo, the London patient, said in a news conference at the AIDS meeting, which is being held online because of the coronavirus pandemic.He and the Berlin patient, Timothy Ray Brown, had donors with a gene that confers natural immunity to HIV infection. Such transplants are too medically risky and impractical to attempt on a large scale, so doctors have been trying other approaches.It’s hard to eliminate HIV because it establishes an early “reservoir” of blood cells where it lies dormant and can’t be attacked by medicines or the immune system. Infections can be controlled with drugs, but as soon as patients stop taking them, the dormant virus activates and renews the disease.Dr. Ricardo Diaz of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil led a study testing strong and new drug combinations to try to purge this reservoir.“We are trying to wake up the virus” and boost the immune system’s ability to eliminate it once it’s flushed out of hiding, Diaz explained. The Brazil man had been taking a standard three-drug combo to suppress his virus. In September 2015, Diaz added two newer ones to intensify his treatment — dolutegravir and maraviroc — plus nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3 that may help expose dormant virus.After nearly a year, the patient went back to the standard three drugs for two more years, then stopped all HIV medicines in March 2019. The virus has been undetectable in many blood and tissue samples since then.“We can’t search the entire body, but by the best evidence, we do not have infected cells,” Diaz said.The most convincing evidence: Tests show the man has lost nearly all HIV antibodies — substances the immune system makes when fighting the virus.Eager for independent verification, the patient said he went to a counseling center for an anonymous HIV test in February. It was negative.“He made a picture of the results” and sent a photo of them, Diaz said.The antibody results are “the most fascinating part of this story,” said Deeks. “These are solid scientists” and “the team may have come up with something that helps,” but it’s going to take verification of these results and much more testing to know, he said.In particular, doctors will want to see proof from blood tests that the patient truly had stopped his HIV medicines. Diaz said all HIV patients in Brazil get their medicines from a government health program and that he verified the man had stopped.“I think it’s very promising. This patient might be cured,” but it will take more time to know, Diaz said.The treatment did not succeed in four others treated the same way, or in any of the others in the 30-person study testing related approaches.Diaz said he has approval for a new study in 60 patients, sponsored by government grants in Brazil and by ViiV Healthcare, the British company that makes maraviroc.Dr. Anton Pozniak, head of the AIDS conference and an HIV specialist at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, said more time is needed to see if the virus rebounds.“I’m waiting. I’m a skeptic about all of this ... until a couple of years go by,” he said.The separate study on prevention involved nearly 4,600 people in North and South America, Asia, and Africa. It tested shots of ViiV’s experimental drug cabotegravir against daily pills of Truvada, the Gilead Sciences drug already approved for preventing HIV infection.The study was stopped early, in May, when the shot seemed at least as effective as the pills. Final results now show the shot works better — there were 13 new infections among those who got it versus 39 among those taking Truvada, said the study leader, Dr. Raphael Landovitz of the University of California, Los Angeles.“People can stay protected without having taken a pill every day,” he said. “You get a shot and you don’t have to do anything for two months. That’s incredibly powerful.”The results “could revolutionize prevention for HIV worldwide” and give a new option for people who don’t want to take a daily pill, Gandhi said.ViiV has said it will seek U.S. approval for cabotegravir; its eventual price is unknown. Truvada costs $1,600 to $1,800 a month, but what patients pay out of pocket depends on insurance and other factors. With either drug, people are still urged to use condoms to prevent other sexually spread diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctors-say-experimental-treatment-may-have-rid-man-of-hiv/story-Zofp8NRPI5cvnMArU1eAIP.html
07-07-2020||World||Hong Kong local coronavirus cases jump rapidly, alarming health officials||Hong Kong reported its largest number of local coronavirus transmission cases in almost three months, stumping local health officials and reflecting the difficulty of eradicating the pathogen.The city found nine new local cases, government officials said in a press briefing Tuesday. That’s the most since at least April 8, according to government data. Authorities have yet to determine how five of the patients contracted the disease.“Over the weekend, Hong Kong’s local epidemic rapidly changed,” said Wong Ka-hing, an official with the Department of Health. “The situation is very severe. The new local cases are quite a lot. We will increase monitoring.”The emergence of hidden transmission chains of the virus, which can be spread via asymptomatic carriers, is a setback for a city that had largely succeeded in containing the disease for months. It also occurs two weeks after the government’s latest easing of social-distancing restrictions.Hong Kong isn’t alone in battling flare-ups of the disease. Australia’s second-largest city recently re-entered virus lockdown, while Tokyo continues to find more than a hundred new coronavirus cases daily. In Beijing, the city is showing signs of emerging from a second wave of virus cases after reporting zero new patients on Tuesday for the first time in 26 days.Hong Kong had only reported about a dozen of new local cases in June. The latest outbreak threatens to further undermine the battered economy, which shrank by a record 8.9% in the first quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-local-coronavirus-cases-jump-rapidly-alarming-health-officials/story-3dWVhh6dkwKUMvClTLJJYK.html
07-07-2020||World||Kenya declares school year ‘lost’, classes back in 2021||Kenya on Tuesday declared that its school year was considered lost because of the coronavirus pandemic, and primary and secondary pupils would return to class next January.The school year in the East African country runs from January to November, when it climaxes with end-of-term exams.But Education Minister George Magoha said in a statement that the curve of Covid-19 infections was expected to flatten only by December.As a result, no primary and secondary school examinations will be held and “the 2020 school calendar year will be considered lost due to Covid-19 restrictions”, he said.Kenya closed schools on March 15 when it had only three confirmed cases, among a raft of measures taken that month including a nighttime curfew to combat the spread of the virus.President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday announced a “phased reopening” of the country, with international flights resuming on August 1 and the lifting of internal travel restrictions that had cordoned off the capital for four months. The 9pm to 4am curfew will remain in place.However cases are surging, with over 8,000 reported infections and 164 deaths.“Faced with this uncertain environment, the stakeholders have resolved to reopen all basic education learning institutions in January 2021,” said Magoha. “This is based on the assumption that the infection curve will have flattened by December, 2020.”The decisions “will apply to all children,” the statement said, specifying that this included schools offering international curriculum.Initially Kenya had planned to reopen schools in September for those in their final years of primary and secondary school to allow them to take their exams, however the mounting infection rate resulted in the shelving of this plan, the statement said.The re-opening of universities will take place on a “case-by-case” basis, and the institutions were encouraged to consider phased re-opening and continue holding virtual classes and graduation ceremonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenya-declares-school-year-lost-classes-back-in-2021/story-zpxZsoACtqn4hGtLsPAirJ.html
07-07-2020||World||Justin Trudeau to skip USMCA pact meet with Trump, Obrador in Washington||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will skip a meeting organized by American President Donald Trump to celebrate the US Mexico Canada or USMCA pact, a refurbished version of the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA which existed earlier.Trump, Trudeau and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador were expected to meet in Washington on Wednesday to mark the enforcement of the new deal, which was championed by Trump. However, Trudeau has turned down the invitation from Trump.The official version for Trudeau avoiding the Washington trip is that Trudeau is participating in a virtual Cabinet retreat leading up to a session of Parliament where Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present a fiscal update relating to the economy and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in lieu of a regular budget.However, Trudeau has been miffed with Trump in recent days. In a media briefing last week, he said, “We’re obviously concerned about the proposed issue of tariffs on aluminum and steel that the Americans have floated recently,” according to the outlet CBC News.Trudeau had also expressed concern over having to self-isolate for two weeks on returning from the United States, as is now mandated in Canada.Trudeau spoke to Mexican President Obrador on Monday and “expressed regret that he is unable to travel to Washington D.C. this week and wished President López Obrador a successful meeting with the President of the United States, Donald Trump,” according to a readout issued by the Canadian PMO.They also “agreed” that the recent entry into force of the new NAFTA will “strengthen the deep economic ties and longstanding friendship between Canada and Mexico, and advance social as well as economic development in both countries.” There was no word on whether Trudeau held a similar call with Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-to-skip-usmca-pact-meet-with-trump-obrador-in-washington/story-hQ5dKcnYtuIfEFruNgOQ6O.html
07-07-2020||World||New at Saudi hajj: Bottled holy water, sterilized pebbles||Saudi Arabia has issued guidelines for the 1,000 or so pilgrims that will be allowed to perform the hajj pilgrimage in Mecca later this month, an experience that will be unlike any before because of the coronavirus pandemic.The pilgrims will be only be able to drink holy water from the Zamzam well in Mecca that is packaged in plastic bottles, and pebbles for casting away evil that are usually picked up by pilgrims along hajj routes will be sterilized and bagged ahead of time. Pilgrims will also have to bring their own prayer rugs.The guidelines were announced on Monday as Saudi authorities prepare to carry out a very limited hajj, which for the first time will not include pilgrims from outside the country. Instead, the kingdom said that 70% of pilgrims allowed to participate this year will be from among foreign residents of Saudi Arabia while 30% would be Saudi citizens.Saudi pilgrims will be selected from among healthcare workers and security personnel who have recovered from Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. The government said their selection represents a “token of appreciation for their role in providing care” during the pandemic.Saudi Arabia has one of the Middle East’s largest outbreaks of the virus, with infection rates rising by 3,000-4,000 cases daily. More than 213,000 people have contracted the virus in the kingdom so far, including 1,968 who have died.The new guidelines also mandate that foreign residents in Saudi Arabia who want to participate in this year’s pilgrimage should be between the ages of 20 and 50, and that have not performed the hajj before. The pilgrims will have to quarantine before and after the hajj, and they will be tested for the coronavirus. Those eligible have until Friday to submit an application through the kingdom’s Hajj Ministry’s website.The hajj is not only a once-in-a-lifetime requirement for Muslims but also a chance to wipe away past sins and connect with Muslims from different walks of life.Saudi Arabia dramatically scaled back the hajj due to concerns about overcrowding at the annual pilgrimage, which usually draws 2.5 million people. The crowds move, pray and stand in extremely close proximity, often squeezed shoulder-to-shoulder, as they carry out five days of rites around Mecca.Saudi Arabia said its decision to curtail the hajj was aimed at preserving global public health because of the risks associated with large gatherings.Pilgrims normally crowd and push their way toward the cube-shaped Kaaba, which is Islam’s holiest site and the metaphorical house of God. This year, authorities said anyone participating in the hajj will not be allowed to touch the Kaaba as part of the new safety measures.Pilgrims this year will also have to wear masks, maintain physical distance during prayers and sleep in tents that follow guidelines on social distancing.Elsewhere in the Mideast, Israel’s parliament early on Tuesday passed an emergency bill allowing the government to bypass the house in making immediate decisions on combating a renewed outbreak of the coronavirus.Lawmakers supporting the bill said it was essential, given the fast-spreading nature of the virus, but some opposition lawmakers decried the sidelining of the legislature as another step in undermining the foundations of Israeli democracy.On Monday, the Israeli government reimposed new restrictions on the public, limiting gatherings and ordering reception halls, restaurants, bars, theaters, fitness centers and pools be shut down again.Just weeks ago, Israel appeared to have contained its initial outbreak after imposing strict measures early on in the pandemic. But after reporting just a handful of new cases a day in early May, it has experienced a steady uptick following an easing of restrictions. Currently, Israel is reporting upward of 1,000 new cases a day — higher than its peak during the previous wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-at-saudi-hajj-bottled-holy-water-sterilized-pebbles/story-FudGVDmoBLapbm8G2Z6XIO.html

Biegun is to discuss “allied cooperation” on the “final, fully verified denuclearisation” of North Korea, among other issues, during his meetings with officials in Seoul and Tokyo this week, according to the US State Department.The phrase is Washington’s goal for its negotiations with Pyongyang, but the North has made clear it has no intention of giving up its arsenal while it sees itself as threatened by a US invasion.Biegun’s plane landed at Osan air base south of Seoul, local media reported.Hours before his arrival, senior North Korean foreign ministry official Kwon Jong Gun released a statement reiterating the North had no intention to sit down with the US, while urging Seoul to “stop meddling”.“It is just the time for it to stop meddling in others’ affairs but it seems there is no cure or prescription for its bad habit,” Kwon said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency.“Explicitly speaking once again, we have no intention to sit face to face with the United States.”Talks over Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal have been stalled since a Hanoi summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un collapsed in early 2019 over what the North would be willing to give up in exchange for sanctions relief.Kim declared in December an end to moratoriums on nuclear and ballistic missile tests, and Pyongyang has repeatedly said it has no intention to continue talks unless Washington drops what it describes as “hostile” policies toward the North.Biegun also suggested last month that another meeting between Trump and Kim is unlikely, although he held out hope for progress in nuclear negotiations. Even so, rumours surrounding the possibility of another summit swirled last week, after former US national security advisor John Bolton reportedly said Trump might pursue another meeting with Kim in October, if it would help his re-election chances.South Korean President Moon Jae-in -- who has long backed engagement with the North -- also called for another Kim-Trump meeting before the US presidential election in November, saying the South would make “utmost efforts” to help arrange it.But the North’s Kwon described Moon as a “meddlesome man”, saying his administration was “guided by the habit of always talking in their own favour”.Kwon’s statement came days after North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said the Trump administration considered diplomacy with the North as “nothing more than a tool” to deal with its own political crisis, adding the North does not feel “any need” to sit down with the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-to-north-korea-arrives-in-south-after-pyongyang-rejects-talks/story-ROI3889hut2qLbyKoao7UP.html
07-07-2020||World||Covid-19: Face covering a must, says Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan||Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan on Tuesday told those who remain sceptical about using face coverings that not using them should be considered as much an anti-social act as driving after imbibing alcohol or driving without putting on seat-belts.Ramakrishnan, who is president of Royal Society, made the intervention as two new reports added to studies highlighting the benefits of wearing face coverings to prevent coronavirus infection for the wearer as we all for those around her.He said: “It used to be quite normal to have quite a few drinks and drive home, and it also used to be normal to drive without seatbelts. Today both of those would be considered anti-social, and not wearing face coverings in public should be regarded in the same way”.“If all of us wear one, we protect each other and thereby ourselves, reducing transmission. We lower the chances of future surges and lockdowns which are economically and psychologically disruptive, and we increase the chance of eliminating the virus. Not doing so increases the risk for everyone”.One of the two reports presents mounting evidence for the effectiveness of wearing face coverings in reducing the risk of transmission, authored by Paul Edelstein of the University of Pennsylvania and Lalita Ramakrishan of the University of Cambridge.The second report, by the Royal Society’s SET-C (Science in Emergencies Tasking – Covid-19) group looks at the effectiveness of different face mask types and coverings and isolates behavioural factors that have limited adherence such as public understanding of the virus transmission, risk perception, trust, effectiveness of public messages and perceived barriers to wearing a mask.In Britain, the people are much less likely to wear face coverings in public compared to other countries, including the United States.Ramakrishnan said: “The UK is way behind many countries in terms of wearing masks and clear policies and guidelines about mask wearing for the public. The public have taken to hand-washing and distancing but remain sceptical about face coverings”.“You only need to go on public transport, where they are supposed to be mandatory, to see how many people are ignoring this new rule based on the growing body of evidence that wearing a mask will help protect others – and might even protect you”.According to him, there are multiple factors why the people have not taken to face coverings. Since the message has not been clear enough, the people may not understand the benefits or are not convinced of them.“Whatever the reasons, we need to overcome our reservations and wear face coverings whenever we are around others in public”, he said.The Royal Society has sent up groups comprising leading experts to find the most important factors that can help slow the spread of coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-face-covering-a-must-says-nobel-laureate-venki-ramakrishnan/story-xuKejxtiZ0CkqBL5mcNCAK.html

We’re not going to stand by and let China or anyone else take the reins in terms of being the most powerful, dominant force, whether it’s in that region or over here,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News on Monday.“And the message is clear. Our military might stands strong and will continue to stand strong, whether it’s in relationship to a conflict between India and China or anywhere else,” Meadows said in response to a question.He was told that India banned Chinese apps because Indian soldiers were killed by Chinese troops last month and asked what’s mission of the two aircraft carriers - the Ronald Reagan and the Nimitz - and what’s America’s mission.The troops of India and China are locked in an eight-week standoff in several areas in eastern Ladakh including Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and Gogra Hot Spring. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC.Also Read: The Middle Kingdom’s rush of blood and the need for strong Indian deterrenceThe Chinese military on Monday began withdrawing troops from the Galwan Valley and Gogra Hot Spring after National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held lengthy talks on Sunday. Doval and Wang are also the special representatives on the India-China boundary talks. The United States has sent two of its aircraft carriers to the South China Sea. “Our mission is to make sure that the world knows that we still have the preeminent fighting force on the face of the globe,” Meadows said.President Donald Trump has invested more in the US military, more in not only the hardware, but the men and women who serve so sacrificially each and every day, he said. “He (Trump) continues to do so,” he added.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are vital to global trade.China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the area.Meadows also hinted that President Trump might sign an executive order that relates to China, among other issues.“I’ll give you a couple of hints, all right. So, a sneak preview here. We’re going to be looking at how we make sure that China is addressed, how we bring manufacturing back from overseas to make sure the American worker is supported,” he said.“We’re also going to look at a number of issues as it relates to immigration. We’re going to look at a number of issues as it relates to prescription drug prices and we’re going to get them done when Congress couldn’t get them done,” Meadows said.Appearing on the same Fox News on Monday talk show with host Brian Kilmeade, influential Republican Senator Tom Cotton said that the US aircraft carriers are headed to the South China Sea to thwart off any Chinese misadventure against Taiwan or other countries in the region.“That’s one of the reasons why we have those aircraft carrier groups in the South China Sea. I mean, look what China did in the southwest. It’s essentially invaded India over the last few weeks and killed Indian soldiers,” Cotton said.“No country on China’s periphery, right now, is safe from Chinese aggression. All those countries want a close relationship with the United States. We ought to have one,” Cotton said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-military-to-stand-with-india-in-conflict-with-china-indicates-white-house-official/story-lCB1yu2KrOLuNKz4g7c1FI.html
07-07-2020||World||China urges Canada to correct mistake on extradition treaty||China condemned Canada’s suspension of its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, calling it a “serious violation” of international law and a “flagrant interference” in its domestic affairs.“We urge the Canadian side to correct its mistake and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China’s domestic affairs to prevent further damage to bilateral relations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing in Beijing on Monday, responding to a question about new Canadian measures including the treaty’s suspension and an updated Hong Kong travel advisory.“China condemns that and reserves the right to take further actions,” Zhao said. “All consequences shall be borne by the Canadian government.”Shortly following the briefing, the Chinese embassy in Canada advised Chinese citizens traveling to the country to exercise caution citing “frequent use of violence from local law enforcement” and protests in Canada, according to the embassy’s official WeChat account.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced measures including the suspension of the extradition treaty last week, making his country the first to break law enforcement links with Hong Kong since China handed down a sweeping new national security law that’s raised concerns about the city’s autonomy from the mainland. Hong Kong’s large expatriate community includes some 300,000 Canadians.Trudeau’s move stands to inflame already-heightened tensions between Canada and China stemming from the 2018 arrest in Vancouver of Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou. Her case has been closely linked to Beijing’s subsequent detention of two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were charged with espionage last month.Other steps announced by Trudeau will include a ban on the export of sensitive military equipment to the Asian financial hub Hong Kong and a travel advisory warning of the security law’s impact. Hong Kong has extradition pacts with 30 countries and jurisdictions around the world.“Canada’s erroneous remarks on Hong Kong and its measures show a disregard of the basic fact that the national security law in Hong Kong is conducive to the sustained implementation of ‘one country, two systems,’” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-urges-canada-to-correct-mistake-on-extradition-treaty/story-l8o8JHLi1llfffLGC5ujfL.html
07-07-2020||World||Melbourne Australia’s second-largest city re-enters 6-week virus lockdown||Australia’s second-most populous state announced a six-week lockdown across metropolitan Melbourne as a coronavirus outbreak risks triggering a second wave of infections in the nation.Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said from midnight Wednesday people must stay home except for work, essential services, medical treatment or school. The state recorded 191 new cases overnight, the biggest daily increase since the crisis began.“These are unsustainably high numbers of new cases,” he told reporters. At such levels it is impossible to “suppress and contain this virus without taking significant steps.”The lockdown dashes the hopes of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who’d aimed for most social-distancing restrictions across the nation and border closures to be lifted by the end of July in a bid to revive the crippled economy. The Victoria outbreak risks deepening and prolonging the nation’s first recession in almost three decades, while wearying Australians who’d hoped the first wave of restrictions imposed in late March had crushed the infection curve.The Australian dollar fell 0.2% to 69.57 US after the announcement, while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index hit a session low.“The overall recovery of the Australian economy is expected to be significantly hindered by the second lockdown,” IBISWorld said in an emailed statement on Tuesday, pointing out that Victoria contributed almost 24% to the nation’s gross domestic product in fiscal 2019.Victoria’s northern neighbor New South Wales will close their shared border from midnight, for the first time since the 1919 Spanish Flu pandemic.The lockdown across metropolitan Melbourne is a dramatic escalation of the state’s response, after it recorded more than two weeks of double-digit daily increases in case numbers. In recent days, authorities have ordered residents in 12 of the city’s poorer and more multicultural suburbs to stay at home except for work and essential shopping. At the weekend, about 3,000 residents of public-housing tower blocks were barred from leaving their apartments.Melbourne Covid Second Wave Sets Back Tourism, Education HubWhile Australia has been one of the standout performers globally in limiting the spread of the virus to less than 9,000 cases, Victoria’s flare-up shows just how hard it will be to eradicate without a vaccine.“I know there will be enormous amounts of damage that will be done because of this,” Andrews told reporters. “But we can’t pretend it’s over. It is not over in so many parts of the world and it is not over in metropolitan Melbourne and to a certain extent right across Victoria.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melbourne-australia-s-second-largest-city-re-enters-6-week-virus-lockdown/story-xiMgGleea84Az4zKsnRrAP.html
07-07-2020||World||France: Emmanuel Macron ousts security chief after police protests||French President Emmanuel Macron ousted his top security official Monday following protests over police brutality as part of a government shakeup aimed at focusing on France’s post-pandemic economic recovery for the remaining two years of Macron’s term.In a surprise move, Macron named a provocative lawyer who has defended WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and suspected terrorists as head of the Justice Ministry. A former Green Party lawmaker was appointed to lead the powerful Ministry for Ecological Transition after Macron came under criticism for lagging on promises to cut emissions.The 42-year-old centrist leader, whose presidency has been buffeted by protests and now the virus crisis, promised that the new government would be one of “purpose and unity.” Macron tweeted that his 2017 campaign promises to modernize France and free up its businesses remain central to his agenda, but he “must adapt to the international upheavals and crises we are experiencing. A new path must be forged.”First among the priorities that Macron listed is helping the world’s sixth-largest economy recover from the battering delivered by the coronavirus pandemic. His new lineup includes some new faces but also leans heavily on loyalists as Macron seeks to steady the country.One key change is at the Interior Ministry, which is in charge of police. Former budget minister Gerald Darmanin was named to replace Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, who had come under fire amid widespread French protests against racial injustice and police violence spurred by the death of George Floyd in the United States.In response, Castaner initially announced a ban on the use of chokeholds in policing, but he then backed down in the face of counter-demonstrations and pressure by police unions. He also launched an experiment with expanded Taser use.Darmanin, a member of Macron’s young guard, is a former conservative who joined Macron’s centrist party in 2017 and is seen as outspoken but effective.The new government reflects a balance of figures from the left and right and from outside politics altogether -- like Eric Dupond-Moretti, arguably France’s most famous lawyer.Among his clients have been Assange; accomplices to Mohamed Merah, who killed Jewish children, a rabbi and paratroopers in a 2012 rampage around Toulouse; and former French government ministers accused of tax fraud or sexual harassment.Two other important changes are at the Labor Ministry, whose new chief, Elisabeth Borne, will have to deal with a pending surge in unemployment, and the Ministry for Ecological Transition, to be led by former Green Party legislator Barbara Pompili.Macron didn’t change the finance or health ministers, posts central to helping France through the virus crisis and recession, or the foreign and defense ministers.The new government will be led by Prime Minister Jean Castex. who was appointed Friday. Macron last week ditched Edouard Philippe, who as prime minister steered France through its coronavirus lockdown and the first three years of Macron’s presidency.Castex is a career civil servant, and his low profile suggests that Macron doesn’t want to be overshadowed should he choose to seek reelection in 2022. Macron has not yet said if he’ll run for a second term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-emmanuel-macron-ousts-security-chief-after-police-protests/story-4xmzNc087hRxRvHx47YpWL.html

Sinovac said the study, which will be done in partnership with Brazilian vaccine producer the Instituto Butantan, would recruit nearly 9,000 healthcare professionals working in Covid-19 specialised facilities and start this month.AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine, developed by researchers at the University of Oxford, and China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) are the only other candidates in late-stage Phase III trials.Moderna also plans to start its late-stage trial this month.Sinovac initiated the development of the vaccine candidate in late January and is preparing a coronavirus vaccine plant, which it hopes will be ready this year and capable of making up to 100 million shots a year. Phase I and Phase II trials typically test the safety of a drug before it enters Phase III trials that test its efficacy. The World Health Organization (WHO) says there are 19 vaccine trials in clinical evaluation and hundreds being developed and tested around the world to stop the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and ravaged the global economy.No Covid-19 vaccine has yet been approved for commercial use. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysis last year found that about one in three vaccines in the first stage of testing later gains approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-sinovac-starts-late-stage-trials-for-its-covid-19-vaccine/story-PtIj0xhL57Z2kDOZ4zqbXP.html

US lawmakers have raised national security concerns over TikTok’s handling of user data, saying they were worried about Chinese laws requiring domestic companies “to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.”The app, which is not available in China, has sought to distance itself from its Chinese roots to appeal to a global audience and has emphasized its independence from China.Pompeo’s remarks also come amid increasing US-China tensions over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, China’s actions in Hong Kong and a nearly two-year trade war.TikTok, a short-form video app owned by China-based ByteDance, was recently banned in India along with 58 other Chinese apps after a border clash between India and China.Reuters reported late on Monday that TikTok would exit the Hong Kong market within days, deciding to do so after China’s establishment of a sweeping new national security law for the semi-autonomous city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tik-tok-could-be-banned-in-us-says-pompeo-report/story-HNU6F3v6iCiRUdzXc4VKNP.html
07-07-2020||World||‘They need food’: Yemen’s starving children, grim legacy of six years of war||Masirah Saqer could barely open her eyes, as she struggled to swallow the milk her grandmother attempted to feed her with a syringe.Nearby the cries of other malnourished children reverberated around the pink-walled hospital ward, a vivid reminder of the human cost of Yemen’s devastating conflict, which drags into a seventh year on Tuesday.Masirah, just short of three months old, was undergoing treatment at Al-Sabyine hospital’s infant malnutrition department in the capital Sanaa.Swaddled in a pink and white comforter, her tiny frame and slender limbs were dwarfed by the full-sized bed on which her grandmother sat as she tried to feed her.The war in Yemen, the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country, has mutated into what the United Nations calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.After years of protests and political crises that escalated into violent clashes, the conflict took a decisive turn on July 8, 2014.Huthi rebels from the north pulled off a decisive victory in the battle for the city of Amran north of Sanaa, comprehensively defeating government troops.The major battlefield win opened the way for the rebels to march on the capital and take it with ease -- but not without a dire human cost, with millions eventually pushed to the brink of starvation.Brink of famineMasirah was one of the many thousands of infants affected by the conflict.Weighing just 2.4 kilograms (5.3 pounds), she suffered from acute malnutrition, her grandmother told AFP.“We needed a medical checkup, milk, and food. If the medicines are available in the hospital, they give them to us, if not we have to buy them outside,” she said.Millions of children in Yemen now face starvation due to a lack of aid for the country, UNICEF said in June.The long conflict has devastated the health system and displaced 3.3 million people who live in camps where cholera and other diseases are rife.The humanitarian situation has worsened since Saudi Arabia intervened in March 2015, leading a coalition in support of government forces against the rebels, who are in turn backed by Riyadh’s arch-rival Iran.Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, including hundreds of children, in air strikes and raids.Serious shortagesYemen, a country with scarce clean water supplies, is now facing another threat -- the spread of the novel coronavirus. Officially, the respiratory disease has killed 330 people in the country.Doctors at Al-Sabyine’s malnutrition department, a facility with capacity for 25 patients, have warned that COVID-19 coupled with fuel shortages have worsened the situation and acted as a barrier to treatment.Many parents fear their children are at risk of the deadly respiratory disease if they are hospitalised, said doctor Hazaa Abdallah al-Farah.“Some people ... won’t send their children to hospital any more” due to fears about the virus, he said.But the true scale of the impact of coronavirus in the Huthi-controlled north of Yemen remains a mystery. The internationally recognised government accuses the rebels of a cover-up.NGOs and the UN are braced for a catastrophe. UNICEF, the latter’s children’s agency, has called for $461 million to fund humanitarian work in Yemen and an additional $53 million to fight COVID-19.Despite the urgent need, only 39 percent of the first sum and just 10 percent of the second have so far been amassed, UNICEF says.The agency has also sounded the alarm over the reduction to its services on the ground.In June, the UN raised just $1.35 billion of the $2.41 billion it was aiming to secure for Yemen during a virtual donor conference.“They die in their homes unable to get to the health centre or hospital or a clinic because of their bad financial situation,” said Amin al-Aizari, another doctor at Al-Sabyine.“They need food,” he said. “The children of Yemen die every hour and every minute.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/they-need-food-yemen-s-starving-children-grim-legacy-of-six-years-of-war/story-L957wCl40gHZHBoY2nOm0L.html
07-07-2020||World||Hong Kong schools told to remove books that might violate new national security law||Hong Kong Education Bureau has recommended schools to review their book collections and remove those titles that may breach the draconian national security law.“If any teaching materials including books have content which is outdated or involve the four crimes under the law, unless they are being used to positively teach pupils about their national security awareness or sense of safeguarding national security ... they should otherwise be removed from the school,” a spokesperson for the bureau was quoted as saying by by South China Morning Post.“Schools have a gatekeeping role in terms of choosing suitable teaching resources. The bureau would take serious follow-up actions if any problems arise over the issue,” he added.Earlier on Sunday, South China Morning Post had reported that Hong Kong libraries have taken at least nine titles written by localist or democracy advocates out of circulation for conducting a review of whether the books run afoul of the new national security law.Bar Association chairman Philip Dykes had called the move to be alarming and said authorities needed to justify restricting the public’s right to seek information.The Leisure and Cultural Services Department, which manages the city’s public libraries, had confirmed it was scrutinising some books for compliance with the new law, without naming them.The Chinese-language books were written by activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung, localist Horace Chin Wan-kan and Civic Party lawmaker Tanya Chan. A search of the nine titles on the library website on Saturday found all the titles marked “under review”.Beijing drafted and passed the legislation late last month that targets acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with punishments of up to life in prison for the most serious offences.The move came after months of social upheaval triggered by opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill but that morphed into wider demands, including universal suffrage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-schools-told-to-remove-books-that-might-violate-new-national-security-law/story-edoXM5ciV16iVTHDV0ZpkI.html
07-07-2020||World||TikTok says it will exit Hong Kong market within days||TikTok will exit the Hong Kong market within days, a spokesman told Reuters late on Monday, as other technology companies including Facebook Inc have suspended processing government requests for user data in the region.The short form video app owned by China-based ByteDance has made the decision to exit the region following China’s establishment of a sweeping new national security law for the semi-autonomous city.“In light of recent events, we’ve decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,” a TikTok spokesman said in response to a Reuters question about its commitment to the market.The company, now run by former Walt Disney Co executive Kevin Mayer, has said in the past that the app’s user data is not stored in China. TikTok has also said previously that it would not comply with any requests made by the Chinese government to censor content or for access to TikTok’s user data, nor has it ever been asked to do so. The Hong Kong region is a small, loss-making market for the company, one source familiar with the matter said. Last August, TikTok reported it had attracted 150,000 users in Hong Kong. Globally, TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times through the Apple and Google app stores after the first quarter this year, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. The source said the move was made because it was not clear if Hong Kong would now fall entirely under Beijing’s jurisdiction. TikTok was designed so it could not be accessed by mainland China. That was part of a strategy to appeal to a more global audience. ByteDance operates a similar short video sharing app called Douyin in China. Although there are no current plans to introduce Douyin to the Hong Kong market, a ByteDance spokesman said, the app already has a sizeable audience in the Asian financial centre as Chinese on the mainland travel and stay in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-says-it-will-exit-hong-kong-market-within-days/story-ZKSYt4caM83KnUJLBWnDmO.html

However, Trudeau has turned down the invitation from Trump.The official version for Trudeau avoiding the Washington trip is that Trudeau is participating in a virtual Cabinet retreat leading up to a session of Parliament where Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present a fiscal update relating to the economy and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in lieu of a regular budget.However, Trudeau has been miffed with Trump in recent days. In a media briefing last week, he said, “We’re obviously concerned about the proposed issue of tariffs on aluminum and steel that the Americans have floated recently,” according to the outlet CBC News.Trudeau had also expressed concern over having to self-isolate for two weeks on returning from the United States, as is now mandated in Canada.Trudeau spoke to Mexican President Obrador on Monday and “expressed regret that he is unable to travel to Washington D.C. this week and wished President López Obrador a successful meeting with the President of the United States, Donald Trump,” according to a readout issued by the Canadian PMO.They also “agreed” tthat the recent entry into force of the new NAFTA will “strengthen the deep economic ties and longstanding friendship between Canada and Mexico, and advance social as well as economic development in both countries.” There was no word on whether Trudeau held a similar call with Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-to-skip-dinner-usmca-dinner-hosted-by-trump/story-bRbdIVrDZ9vMmrB34plI3I.html
07-07-2020||World||Man held near Canadian PM Trudeau’s home posed assassination threat: Report||The Canadian Armed Forces reservist who intruded into an area in the vicinity of the residence of the country’s Prime Minister on Thursday may have also conveyed a threat to kill or injure Justin Trudeau, according to documents filed in an Ottawa court by law enforcement.The 46-year-old Corey Hurren, a reservist with the Canadian Rangers, drove his vehicle into a pedestrian gate fronting Rideau Hall in the country’s capital early on Thursday. He then proceeded on foot into the area before he was arrested by Royal Canadian Mounter Police or RCMP personnel patrolling there. Rideau Hall is the official residence of Canada’s Governor General Julie Payette while Trudeau and his family live close by at Rideau Cottage.Some Canadian media like the National Post said the documents suggested this may have been an “assassination attempt.” Neither Trudeau nor Payette were present in the area when the incident occurred. However, Rideau Cottage has been the venue for Trudeau’s high-profile media briefings during the period of the coronavirus crisis.While investigators did not comment on his motive, court documents cited by the outlet Global News appear to indicate he may have posed a threat to Trudeau. They alleged that Hurren “did knowingly utter a threat to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or convey a threat to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or cause Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to receive a threat to cause death or bodily harm to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.”Hurren, who is from the town of Bowsman in the province of Manitoba, faces 22 criminal charges related to that episode. Police documents submitted to the court alleged he was carrying four loaded firearms, including two shotguns, a rifle and a revolver.He remains in custody and has a hearing scheduled for later this month. Hurren owned a sausage products business, GrindHouse Fine Foods which may have suffered from the restrictive measures implemented to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Before arriving a 1 Sussex Drive, where Rideau Hall is located, Hurren posted a link to a coronavirus-related conspiracy theory on the Facebook page for the business. He had made a similar post even earlier.The investigation into the intrusion is being led by the RCMP’s integrated national security team. Security in and around Rideau Hall has been enhanced since the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-held-near-canadian-pm-trudeau-s-home-may-have-attempted-assassination-report/story-pANGjSTK3z29Y2zjoUHWhP.html

Polish President Andrzej Duda met with Trump at the White House on June 24.The dinner will be indoors and one of the people said that some social distancing measures would be taken.Lopez Obrador said he would take a coronavirus test before his departure from Mexico on Tuesday, and was willing to take another one in the US if asked.The guests will include some 20 executives, about 10 from each nation, who will represent the automobile, telecommunications and media, transportation, technology, energy and financial industries, one of the people said.The occasion is to mark the dawn of the United-States-Mexico Canada-Agreement trade pact, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, the other party to the accord, will not be coming to Washington.The two leaders plan to discuss the new agreement as well as measures to combat narcotics traffic, business between the two countries and migration.The Mexican guests invited include broadcast, banking and retail billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego, according to a person familiar with the plans, who asked not to be identified because the guest list hasn’t been made public.

A Social media campaign on Twitter trend with Hashtag #SaveRiversSaveAJK was also launched to highlight the issue on global platform.The protesters asked under which law is the river agreement of disputed region was signed between Pakistan and China? They said that Pakistan and China are violating UN Security Council resolutions by occupying rivers.“We should march towards Kohala project and continue protest there until it does not stop,” said one of the protesters.Recently, a tripartite agreement was signed between a Chinese company and the governments of Pakistan and China for construction of a 1,124 megawatt hydropower project in Kohala costing 2.4 billion dollar.The hydropower plant, being built on Jhelum river in PoK under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), has been awarded to Kohala Hydropower Company Ltd (KHCL), which is a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC).

Bolsonaro told supporters outside the presidential palace that he had just visited the hospital and been tested.“I can’t get very close,” he said in comments recorded by Foco do Brasil, a pro-government YouTube channel. “I came from the hospital. I underwent a lung scan. The lung’s clean.”The president’s office said in a statement that the president is at his home and is “in good health.”The right-wing populist has often defied local guidelines to wear a mask in public, even after a judge ordered him to do so in late June.Over the weekend, Bolsonaro attended several events and was in close contact with the U.S. ambassador to Brazil during July 4 celebrations. The U.S. embassy in Brasilia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Bolsonaro tested negative for the coronavirus after several aides were diagnosed following a visit to U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, Florida, estate in March.CNN Brasil reported that Bolsonaro has begun taking the drugs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which he touts as a Covid-19 treatment despite little proof of their effectiveness.Bolsonaro’s official events on Tuesday have been canceled, according to CNN Brasil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/my-lung-is-clean-bolsonaro-says-as-he-awaits-his-covid-19-results/story-FOxcBscce379JZtmg1oAVJ.html

Officials last blocked movement between the two states in 1919 during the Spanish flu.3. Israel’s government reimposed a series of restrictions on Monday to fight a spike in infections, deciding on the immediate closure of bars, night clubs, gyms and event halls, Israel Radio said.4. Even as Covid-19 deaths in the US topped 130,000, President Trump’s campaign has announced he will hold an outdoor rally on Saturday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.The rally at Portsmouth International Airport will come three weeks after an indoor rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Trump’s first of the Covid-19 era.On Monday, Trump continued to lash out at China over the pandemic. “China has caused great damage to the United States and the rest of the world!” Trump tweeted.US House Speaker Philip Gunn tested positive for coronavirus. Gunn, a Republican, said in a video posted on Sunday to Facebook that he got tested because he had been in close proximity to another member of the House who tested positive.5. In Pakistan, the county’s point person on Covid-19 has himself contracted the virus. Health minister Zafar Mirza said on Monday he was self-isolating at home .6. The government of Singapore invoked the fake news law to crack down on critics of its stand on the testing of migrant workers, the biggest cluster of its coronavirus outbreak in the country.

07-07-2020||World||Mexico’s coronavirus pandemic could last until next April: Report||The coronavirus pandemic could last in Mexico until next April, with infections expected to rise during the October flu season and through winter, a top health official said on Monday, further pushing back the potential resolution of the crisis. Mexico has recorded 261,750 total cases and 31,119 overall deaths, putting it in fifth place worldwide for most fatalities from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a Reuters tally.Mexican Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell, the coronavirus czar, has continually walked back forecasts about when the crisis would peak, and has said the death toll and infection tally are likely higher than reported figures. In an interview with Mexico’s Radio Formula, he warned that coronavirus infections may persist in significant numbers into the winter, carrying the pandemic into spring.“Flu season begins in October and there are some reasonable assumptions that we could also have a spike in COVID-19 along with the flu throughout the fall-to-winter season,” he said.When asked about the length of the pandemic in Mexico, Lopez-Gatell said it could last “until March to April of next year.”The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has estimated that Mexico will exceed 88,000 deaths from the coronavirus by October.

07-07-2020||World||UK chooses fights as it seeks its place in a post-Brexit world||The UK reaffirmed its collision course with Beijing and Moscow on Monday as it sought to establish its place in the world after Brexit.China’s ambassador to London warned of “consequences” if Britain treats his country as a “hostile” power in its dealings over Hong Kong and Huawei Technologies Co., while Russian officials topped the list of people sanctioned for human rights abuses, sparking a threat of retaliation from the Kremlin.“As we forge a dynamic new vision for a truly global Britain, this Government are absolutely committed to the United Kingdom becoming an even stronger force for good in the world,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Parliament as he introduced the sanctions. He pledged “to keep the flame of freedom alive for those brave souls still suffering in the very darkest corners of the world.”The announcement of targeted sanctions on 49 individuals and organizations for human rights abuses immediately sparked calls from senior lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party for similar curbs on China. The demands highlight a tension for the UK as it seeks trade deals around the world after Brexit while trying to assert itself as a champion of freedom.“Britain’s future means balancing different interests and some tough choices,” said Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative and chairman of Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee. “But to get through this we need to remember what really matters and hold on to core beliefs -- none more than the rule of law.”Tensions, ‘Consequences’Tugendhat was joined by former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith as senior MPs called for the sanctions, currently limited to Russia, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar and North Korea, to be extended to Chinese officials for the suppression of protests in Hong Kong and human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang. Some said Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam should be added to the list.Raab didn’t rule out including Chinese nationals and said he is already working on the next round of sanctions, which he told MPs are “a forensic tool” and have to be legally watertight before they are applied.The escalation of tensions came after it emerged Britain is preparing to phase Huawei out of plans for fifth-generation telecommunications networks, sparking a robust response from Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador in London.He accused the UK of following the bidding of the US over the Chinese technology giant and criticized its response to a crackdown on demonstrations in Hong Kong. Last week Johnson offered a fast-track to citizenship to almost 3 million residents of Britain’s former colony.“We want to be your friend, we want to be your partner, but if you want to make China a hostile partner you have to bear the consequences.” Liu said on a video call with reporters Monday. “If you dance to the tune of other countries, how can you call yourself Great Britain?”‘Significant Impact’A report from the UK’s National Cybersecurity Centre concluded that new US sanctions mean Huawei will have to use untrusted technology, making security risks impossible to control, a person familiar with the matter said.Officials are drawing plans to speed up the removal of existing Huawei kit, although an exact timetable is yet to be set, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing unpublished proposals.Johnson, who set a US trade deal as the centerpiece of his international plans after Britain leaves the European Union, has been under heavy pressure from US President Donald Trump’s administration to drop Huawei from his plans. Washington warned future security cooperation could be under threat if London pressed on with the company after ministers cleared its participation in January.Monday’s sanctions were announced as Raab set out the British version of the US Magnitsky Act. They included visa bans and assets freezes for 20 Saudi citizens suspected of involvement in the killing of the columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, and two government entities in charge of North Korea’s prison camps.‘Unfriendly Decision’The action against Saudi nationals marks a change for the UK, which has long regarded the kingdom as a crucial ally and trade partner in the Middle East. Raab was asked in Parliament if the sanctions would be extended to others in the Saudi regime and neighboring countries, including Bahrain and the UAE.“It would be welcome if it marked the start of a more consistent approach from the Government towards Saudi Arabia, and in particular the arms sales from this country that are being used to harm innocent civilians in Yemen,” Lisa Nandy, foreign affairs spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, told Parliament.The Magnitsky Act is named for Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in jail in 2009 after alleging officials were involved in tax fraud, and the list includes individuals implicated in his case. Twenty-five Russians were named by the Foreign Office.Raab, who compared Magnitsky to the Soviet-era dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn, said targeting individuals rather than states, will “allow us to continue to engage bilaterally with countries that, frankly, we need to.”That view was not shared by Russia, which said the UK’s targeting of judges and prosecutors was an “assault” on judicial independence.“Russia reserves the right to respond to today’s unfriendly decision by the UK on the basis of reciprocity,” Russia’s Embassy in London said in a statement. “It will not improve Russian-British relations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-chooses-fights-as-it-seeks-its-place-in-a-post-brexit-world/story-984d2ApNP9BvbyRFgc9gIK.html
07-07-2020||World||Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Google CEOs to testify to House on July 27||The chief executive officers of Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. will testify on July 27 before a congressional panel investigating competition in the technology industry, according to an announcement from the House Judiciary Committee.Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook are likely to face a torrent of critical questions from lawmakers on the panel’s antitrust subcommittee as the investigation builds a case for revamping antitrust enforcement.Bezos may be in for a particularly tough session. Unlike the other chiefs, the world’s richest man will be addressing Congress for the first time, and his company has sparred with subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline over previous testimony by another company official and allegations of anticompetitive conduct.The appearances may be virtual, according to the Monday evening announcement, which said additional details on the format would be forthcoming.“Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming,” said Cicilline and Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler in a joint statement. “As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation.”Some of the companies had been reluctant to send their top executives even though Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has said he would be willing to subpoena CEOs. He has said he wants to use their appearances to inform a final report recommending changes to antitrust law.Antitrust scrutiny of giant technology companies is accelerating. Facebook and Alphabet’s Google both face competition inquiries by federal enforcers and nearly all 50 states. Amazon is under investigation in California, Bloomberg has reported, and both the e-commerce giant and Apple are facing scrutiny from the European Union.The Judiciary Committee had previously announced that the four men would testify, but had not set a date or format.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-facebook-apple-google-ceos-to-testify-to-house-on-july-27/story-zXQPxesMx5q5u30e7wzCYP.html
07-07-2020||World||US to force out foreign students whose classes move online due to Covid-19||The United States said Monday it would not allow foreign students to remain in the country if all of their classes are moved online in the fall because of the coronavirus crisis.“Nonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States,” US Immigration and Custom Enforcement said in a statement.“Active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status,” ICE said.“If not, they may face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.”ICE said the State Department “will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will US Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States.” F-1 students pursue academic coursework and M-1 students pursue “vocational coursework,” according to ICE.Universities with a hybrid system of in-person and online classes will have to show that foreign students are taking as many in-person classes as possible, to maintain their status.Critics quickly hit back at the decision. “The cruelty of this White House knows no bounds,” tweeted Senator Bernie Sanders.“Foreign students are being threatened with a choice: risk your life going to class-in person or get deported,” he said.For Gonzalo Fernandez, a 32-year-old Spaniard doing his doctorate in economics at George Washington University in the US capital, “the worst thing is the uncertainty.”“We don’t know if we will have classes next semester, if we should go home, if they are going to throw us out.”Plans up in the airMost US colleges and universities have not yet announced their plans for the fall semester.A number of schools are looking at a hybrid model of in-person and online instruction but some, including Harvard University, have said all classes will be conducted online.Harvard said 40 percent of undergraduates would be allowed to return to campus -- but their instruction would be conducted remotely.There were more than one million international students in the United States for the 2018-19 academic year, according to the Institute of International Education (IIE).That accounted for 5.5 percent of the total US higher education population, the IIE said, and international students contributed $44.7 billion to the US economy in 2018.The largest number of international students came from China, followed by India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Canada.According to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, who works as the policy counsel at the Washington-based think tank American Immigration Council, the new rule is “almost certainly going to be challenged in court.”He explained on Twitter that foreign students will likely struggle to continue their studies while abroad, due to time differences or a lack of access to technology or academic resources.President Donald Trump, who is campaigning for reelection in November, has taken a bullish approach to reopening the country even as virus infections continue to spike in parts of the country, particularly the south and west.“SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” he tweeted Monday.With more than 130,000 deaths linked to the novel coronavirus, the United States is the hardest-hit country in the global pandemic.While cracking down on immigration is one of his key issues, Trump has taken a particularly hard stance on foreigners since the health crisis began.In June, he froze until 2021 the issuing of green cards -- which offer permanent US resident status -- and some work visas, particularly those used in the technology sector, with the stated goal of reserving jobs for Americans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-to-withdraw-visas-for-foreign-students-whose-classes-move-online/story-QYjIu1Pz50BwatSdNvBzjO.html
07-07-2020||World||US coronavirus death toll passes 130,000: Johns Hopkins tally||The United States passed another grim coronavirus milestone Monday as the death toll from the virus climbed past 130,000, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.The country has had 2,888,729 Covid-19 cases and 130,007 deaths as of midday in Washington, the university reported.The world’s hardest hit country, both in confirmed cases and deaths, the United States has experienced a resurgence of the disease since June that has forced several states to suspend their phased economic reopenings.On Saturday, the number of new daily infections hit a record 57,683.When the death toll passed the 100,000 mark May 27, President Donald Trump expressed satisfaction that the number of new infections was declining, even though experts warned of a possible resurgence.Despite the worsening trend, White House officials say the US economy, which went into a nosedive in March and April due to lockdowns, will not be shut down again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-130-000-johns-hopkins-tally/story-kEWJcGu6RUXVh5prVXZ9fM.html
07-07-2020||World||Hong Kong police granted sweeping powers under national security law||In implementing the national security law for Hong Kong, police will have sweeping authority that allows them to take actions including conducting searches without a warrant, restricting suspects from leaving the city, and intercepting communications.Hong Kong’s government gazetted the details of Article 43 in the city’s national security law on Monday night, which outlines the measures that the police force can take to implement the legislation in the city.According to the rules, police may be authorized to conduct searches for evidence without a warrant in “exceptional circumstances.” Police may also apply for a warrant that requires a person suspected of violating the national security law to surrender their travel documents, thus restricting them from leaving Hong Kong.Additionally, under the rules, written notices or restraining orders may be issued to freeze or confiscate property if there is “reasonable grounds” to suspect that the property is related to an offence endangering national security.Platforms and publishers, as well as internet service providers, may also be ordered to take down electronic messages published that are “likely to constitute an offence endangering national security or is likely to cause the occurrence of an offence endangering national security.”Service providers who do not comply with such requests could face fines of up to 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) and receive jail terms of six months.Individuals who post such messages may also be asked to remove the message, or face similar fines and a jail term of one year.Prior to the release of the implementation rules on Monday, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram said that they would deny law enforcement requests for user data in Hong Kong as they assess the impact of the national security law.The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new implementation rules.Under the implementation rules, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam may also authorize police to intercept communications and conduct surveillance to “prevent and detect offences endangering national security.”Finally, written notices may also be served to a foreign political organisation or Taiwan political organisation, or individual agents, to furnish details on their activities related to Hong Kong. This includes details such as personal particulars, assets, income, and expenditure of the organisation in Hong Kong. Failure to comply or providing false or incomplete information can result in a fine of 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) or imprisonment of six months or two years respectively.The details of the implementation rules come into effect Wednesday and details were released after the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR, chaired by Lam, convened its first meeting on Monday.Hong Kong’s national security law, imposed last week following anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, makes secessionist, subversive, and terrorist activities illegal, as well as foreign intervention in the city’s internal affairs. Any activities such as shouting slogans or holding up banners and flags calling for the city’s independence are a violation of the law regardless of whether violence is used. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment.Critics see it as Beijing’s boldest step yet to erase the legal firewall between the former British colony and the mainland’s authoritarian Communist Party system.Hanscom Smith, US consul general to Hong Kong and Macau, said Monday that it is a “tragedy” to use the semi-autonomous Chinese territory’s new national security law to chip away at freedoms in the Asian financial hub.“Using the national security law to erode fundamental freedoms and to create an atmosphere of coercion and self-censorship is a tragedy for Hong Kong,” Smith told reporters. “Hong Kong has been successful precisely because of its openness and we’ll do everything we can to maintain that.”Since the law went into effect, the government has specified that the popular protest slogan “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time” has separatist connotations and is thus criminalized.In Hong Kong’s public libraries, books by pro-democracy figures have been pulled from the shelves, including those written by prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong and politician Tanya Chan. The authority that runs the libraries said it is reviewing the books in light of the new legislation.Many pro-democracy shops that publicly stood in solidarity with protesters have removed pro-democracy notes and artwork that adorned the walls of their stores, fearful that they might violate the new law.A 23-year-old man, Tong Ying-kit, was the first person in Hong Kong to be charged under the new law, for allegedly driving a motorcycle into a group of policemen while bearing a flag with the “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time” slogan.Tong appeared in court Monday facing charges of incitement to secession and terrorist activities. He was denied bail.Separately, pro-democracy activists Agnes Chow, Joshua Wong and Ivan Lam also appeared in court Monday over charges related to a protest last June. Chow pleaded guilty to inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly, as well as to participating in an unauthorized assembly.Wong, who was indicted on similar charges, pleaded not guilty. Lam, who was charged with inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly, also pleaded not guilty. All three were released on bail.“With the risk of our personal safety, with the threat of life sentencing, we might be worried, and also being targeted by Beijing, but we also encourage the global community to let our voice be heard in the world,” Wong told reporters Monday. “We still hope to let the world know that now is the time to stand with Hong Kong, and now is the time for Hong Kongers to keep our momentum.”The cases will move to trial and sentencing following a pretrial review for Wong and Lam scheduled for Aug. 5.A group of about 10 protesters gathered at a shopping mall in Hong Kong’s Central business district on Monday holding up signs calling for city leader Carrie Lam to step down, as well as reiterating protesters’ demands from the pro-democracy movement last year. The demands include an independent inquiry into the police and greater democracy.Others held up blank pieces of paper as a sign of protest against the suppression of political protest in the city. About 20 riot police later entered the mall, detaining protesters holding up signs, although they did not appear to make any arrests.“We feel worried that we may be convicted for expressing our views,” said protester Anthea Wong. “That’s why we are using white paper instead.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-granted-sweeping-powers-under-national-security-law/story-SjAMahUGZN9TVxCQOjoIkM.html

The medical superintendents of all government and private COVID hospitals have been issued directions in this regard. The feedback form will have questions about cleanliness, food, doctors at the hospital, blood group and underlying conditions. It will ask if the recovered person is willing to donate plasma. In plasma therapy, the antibody rich plasma from a recovered patient is extracted and administered to a patient. The trials are trying to find out if the antibodies can help patients recover. Last week, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated India’s first plasma bank at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences here to ease access to plasma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-to-collect-feedback-from-covid-19-survivors/story-3doompSr9xzlWnFuIS6dyO.html
07-07-2020||India||In bilateral talks, India raises with US its decision on foreign students’ visas||India on Tuesday raised with the US its decision to withdraw US visas from foreign students whose courses moved fully online even as the two countries held extensive talks covering a range of issues like ongoing threats to the rules-based international order as well as situation in the Indo-Pacific region.It is understood that India’s border row with China figured in the talks between Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale though there was no mention of it in the press statements issued by the two sides. In a statement, the US State Department said Hale and Shringla agreed to consult closely on all challenges and endeavour to support each other’s objectives, adding the discussions included ongoing threats to the rules-based international order, maritime security, and the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It said both officials pledged to remain in close contact on regional and international issues of mutual concern.On the Trump administration’s decision on students’ visas, official sources said Shringla raised the issue following which the US side said they will keep the best interests of the Indian students in mind and would try and mitigate the impact of the decision. The online talks were held under the framework of India-US Foreign Office Consultations. In a move that is expected to adversely impact hundreds of thousands of Indian students, the US immigration authority announced that foreign students will have to leave the country or risk deportation if their universities switch to online-only classes in this fall semester due to the coronavirus pandemic.In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said the two sides discussed ways to further enhance mutually beneficial trade and people-to-people ties, including through visa facilitation for students and professionals.It said Shringla and Hale exchanged views on a number of regional and global issues of shared interest. “They reaffirmed their commitment to work towards ensuring a free, open, inclusive, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific. They agreed on the need to deepen cooperation in the United Nations, especially during India’s membership of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2021-2022,” the MEA said.India and the US have been expanding cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region where China has been trying to expand its military and economic clout.Referring to the COVID-19 pandemic, the MEA said the two sides agreed to further strengthen the bilateral health partnership, including on pharmaceuticals and vaccine development. On its part, the US State Department said both sides agreed that the US-India health partnership, including cooperation on pharmaceutical and vaccine development, will continue to play a critical role in the world’s recovery from COVID-19. The MEA said the two sides agreed to remain in touch, and move forward on the bilateral agenda through a range of mechanisms like the 2+2 ministerial dialogue that India will host later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bilateral-talks-india-raises-with-us-its-decision-on-foreign-students-visas/story-RKoa3z6mRijpYWmTjTCaoK.html

One arm of her elder daughter, a five-year-old, had to be amputated while the younger daughter, aged 18 months, lost a leg and an arm, said a nephew of the dead teacher. The woman and her children are admitted in North Bengal Medical College and Hospital.The 36-year-old primary school teacher was admitted to Siliguri district hospital last Thursday with fever and cough.“His swab sample was collected on Friday and the report came on Monday.

He died at 1.35 am on Tuesday,” said Ambuj Kumar Ray, the headmaster of the school.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAround 11 am, after the administration had put up a barricade in front of the teacher’s house to mark it as a containment zone, his wife left the building with her daughters and went to New Jalpaiguri railway station. She jumped in front of a train in platform No 3, said people who were present at the spot.Since no suicide note was found, the reason behind the attempt could not be ascertained.Kunwar Bhusan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Siliguri West, said, “According to the doctors, the woman and the children are stable.”On Tuesday, the number of Covid-19 cases in Darjeeling district stood at 647 and most of the positive cases were reported in Siliguri.

Anant Deo Tewari had allegedly ignored the complaint.Vinay Tewari was subsequently suspended, allegedly for passing on information about the police raid on Dubey’s house, during which eight police personnel were killed by the gangster and his henchmen early Friday.Three other IPS officers were also transferred in a minor reshuffle. The government in its order said Anant Deo Tewari has been transferred as DIG PAC, Moradabad sector, while Sudhir Kumar Singh, who was posted as commandant of 15th battalion PAC in Agra, replaced him.Anant Deo Tewari, who was posted as SSP Kanpur till June 15 before being promoted as DIG STF found himself in controversy after the letter by the slain DSP became viral on social media. Mishra’s daughter released the letter on social media, alleging inaction by senior police officers in not removing Vinay Tewari despite her late father’s complaints against him.There were demands on social media for Anant Deo’s removal from his present post as the STF was investigating the killing of eight policemen during the raid at Vikas Dubey’s house in Kanpur’s Bikru village.In the other transfers, SSP Moradabad Amit Pathak and SSP Varanasi Prabhakar Chaudhary swapped places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-s-controversial-ex-ssp-transferred-days-after-massacre-of-cops/story-LPIkl1ae21ZWeAWLoPkLFK.html
07-07-2020||India||India targets Pakistan at UN body over counter-terrorism record||India on Tuesday mounted a sharp attack on Pakistan during a virtual meeting of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, accusing it of sheltering and supporting terrorists and pushing a false narrative on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.Mahaveer Singhvi, joint secretary (counter-terrorism) in the external affairs ministry who led the Indian delegation for the webinar organised by the UN body, pointed out the meeting was being held on a day when the Indian embassy in Kabul was attacked by a Pakistan-backed terror group 12 years ago and Indians and Afghans were killed.“It is very unfortunate that a country which perpetrated terrorist attacks in Mumbai (2008), Pathankot (2016), Uri and Pulwama is now preaching to the world community,” Singhvi said in his intervention during the meeting with the theme “The global scourge of terrorism: Assessment of high risk threats and trends including the rise of violent extremism and hate speech in a pandemic environment”.“While the world is coming together to battle the pandemic, it is unfortunate that Pakistan, a state which sponsors cross-border terrorism, continues to use every opportunity to peddle false narratives and make baseless, malicious and egregious allegations against India and interfere in our internal affairs,” he said, adding that the statement by Pakistan’s representative at the meeting was part of this pattern.Singhvi added, “Even as Pakistan provides shelter and support to terrorists, it continues to peddle a false and motivated narrative on the situation in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is seeking to portray its military, financial [and] logistical support to cross-border terrorism against India as a freedom struggle. It is also peddling misinformation about India’s domestic legislation and policies.”The webinar was part of the UN body’s virtual counter-terrorism week, and Singhvi pointed out that terrorists have made innumerable attempts to infiltrate India “from their safe abodes across the border to carry out attacks and have even used unmanned aerial systems to smuggle weapons across our borders”.At the global level, terrorists have tried to exploit financial and emotional distress caused by the pandemic, and used the increased presence of people online and on social media to disseminate misinformation through hate speech, fake news and doctored videos, he said. Another disturbing trend is the collection of funds by proscribed terror groups ostensibly for charitable activities but which would be used to finance terror, he said.Singhvi described Pakistan’s statement claiming credit for eliminating al-Qaeda as “ludicrous” and said the group’s founder, Osama Bin Laden, was recently glorified as a “martyr” by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in Parliament. “This is a chilling reminder of the patronage that international terrorists receive in Pakistan,” he said.Khan had publicly acknowledged the presence of up to 40,000 terrorists in Pakistan and the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the UN Security Council had reported that about 6,500 Pakistani terrorists from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are operating in Afghanistan, he said.“Pakistan’s role as epicentre of terrorism has been well documented by numerous international organisations including UN and FATF. Unlike Pakistan, India does not make any distinction between terrorists and invariably condemns terror attacks anywhere in the world, including the one in Karachi, referred to by Pakistan’s representative in his statement,” Singhvi said.The Indian official also criticised human rights violations in Balochistan, Kyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the discrimination against religious and cultural minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-targets-pakistan-at-un-body-over-counter-terrorism-record/story-wLb4CA11IDrtHoqtybgOaM.html

Doctors eventually attended him but he died shortly thereafter.The man had been admitted to the People’s General Hospital on June 23 for renal failure before he contracted Covid-19.“It is unfortunate that a patient was ill-treated in Bhopal. A magisterial inquiry has already been ordered and wrongdoers will not be spared,” the chief minister told reporters.The People’s General Hospital released CCTV footage where the driver and ambulance attendant of Chirayu Medical College and Hospital could be seen leaving the patient unattended on the floor of the parking lot. The deceased’s son demanded a tough action against the management of both the hospitals.“People’s General hospital, where my father was left unattended, neither informed any of family members including me nor provided the necessary treatment to him and Chirayu hospital’s ambulance left my father in a serious condition on the floor in the parking lot. The driver of the ambulance said instead of taking my father to Covid-19 designated Chirayu Hospital, he came back to People’s Hospital as my father’s condition was getting critical,” said the son.“How could a sensitive person leave a critical patient unattended at a parking lot?” he asked and demanded legal action against the driver too.Zameel Khan a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Bhopal, said the patient was left behind after a disagreement between the two hospitals.“The ambulance came at around 7.30 pm to take the patient to Chirayu Hospital after he tested positive for coronavirus as Chirayu happens to be a dedicated Covid hospital. But later, the driver called the People’s General Hospital that they were coming back as the patient was getting critical and needed an ambulance equipped with a ventilator. When People’s General Hospital refused to take the patient back, the driver left the patient in the parking lot. Later, while the doctors at People’s General Hospital started treating him, he died,” Khan said.The two hospitals blamed each other for the patient’s death. The People’s General hospital blamed Chirayu Medical College and Hospital for the lapses whereas Chirayu hospital administration blamed People’s Hospital for not providing correct information to it regarding the patient and later refusing to attend the patient. People’s General Hospital’s manager Udayshankar Dixit said, “As we are not a Covid-19 designated hospital, we requested the ambulance driver not to come back but he not only ignored our request but also left the patient outside the hospital without informing us.” Chirayu Medical College and Hospital managing director Ajay Goenka said, “The driver came back with a good intention as the patient was getting critical. He informed a doctor of People’s General hospital that they needed to take care of the patient just for 20 minutes as another ambulance equipped with a ventilator was on its way but People’s General Hospital refused to take care of him immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patient-in-bhopal-dies-after-being-dumped-in-hospital-parking-lot/story-Ze2jOxEYeFbFnHAW9MYPqI.html
07-07-2020||India||Ready for CBI probe in gold smuggling case, says Kerala CM after removing top aide||A day after a senior information technology consultant to the Kerala government allegedly emerged as the key player in the gold smuggling racket operated through diplomatic channels, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday rushed to contain the political fallout of the racket, removed his top aide M Sivasankar and declared that he was ready for any probe.A brief statement by Vijayan’s office announced the transfer of the chief minister’s principal secretary M Sivasankar “with immediate effect”. Sivasankar’s charge has been handed over to another IAS officer Mir Mohammad.Sivasankar has been linked to the IT consultant Swapna Suresh who is alleged to have played a key role in the gold smuggling racket following the seizure of 30 kg gold from a diplomatic consignment on Sunday. The government sacked Swapna Suresh the next day.But the opposition kept up the pressure. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala sought a CBI probe, alleging that Swapna Suresh and Sivasankar, who was also the state’s IT secretary, were linked. Other opposition leaders also joined in, insisting that the chief minister was aware of Swapna Suresh’s appointment and that she was given key responsibilities.Customs officials on Sunday had seized a diplomatic bag that landed from the UAE, ostensibly being sent to its consulate in the state capital. Since authorities cannot not open a diplomatic bag under the Vienna convention, they roped in UAE consulate officials. The bag, which arrived on a chartered flight from the UAE, contained 30 kg of gold in cylindrical form hidden within some equipment.Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the consulate, has been arrested by the customs. He is alleged to have disclosed Swapna’s role in the racket. There are reports that they made at least 10 such sorties which went unnoticed.Chief Minister Vijayan played down the controversy saying the state was ready for any probe.“She was hired by a placement agency. Customs also made it clear that nobody had called from the CM’s office to bail her out. Some people are creating a smoke screen to portray the government in the bad light,” he said.Asked why he had removed his principal secretary, the chief minister said he was sent out of the CM’s office after receipt of some general complaints.BJP state president K Surendran, however, alleged that a senior official from the CM’s office did make a call to customs officials pleading with them to spare some people involved in the case. The gold bars and sticks were hidden inside some of the household equipment like handlebars to avoid detection.As the controversy raged, the CPM central leadership said the party is ready for a probe by an agency including the CBI. The United Arab Emirates embassy has also said it will cooperate with the ongoing probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-for-cbi-probe-in-gold-smuggling-case-says-kerala-cm-after-removing-top-aide/story-rZ77ByvUpTR7zO7YA5t98M.html

07-07-2020||India||Ban on foreign tours, buying cars as Odisha limits expenses to fight Covid-19||Air and first class rail travel ban for officials were among several measures adopted by the Odisha government on Tuesday as part of its austerity measures to make space for Covid-19 related expenditure.Odisha finance department secretary AKK Meena in a letter to all the government departments said there would be a complete ban on purchase of new vehicles for the next two years and travel and official tours have to be avoided in general.“All administrative departments are required to prioritise their expenditure needs in order to limit the expenditure within the resources available with priority to make fiscal space for Covid-19 related expenditure. There would be a complete ban on travel outside the country and air travel in business class using government funds. Air journey should be avoided and meetings through video conferencing or IT may be preferred. In exigencies approval of authority one level higher than the present delegation would be required for journey by air. There would be a complete ban on journey by train in 1st class AC by all government officers,” Meena instructed in the letter.The finance secretary further said if any officer has to travel, then no reimbursement would be allowed for occupancy in any hotel in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai.There would be a complete ban on creation of new posts except for the health & family welfare department.New engagement of consultants, outsourcing and employing services of retired government officers would be restricted. In case, there is necessity for creation of posts for modernisation of administration or effective implementation of development and welfare programmes, the same would be considered only against abolition of equivalent posts with concurrence of the finance department.Experts have said that Odisha has no other way than to borrow liberally so as to provide for higher spending on healthcare and continue with its welfare programmes.Recently, while speaking at a webinar organised by the Odisha Alochana Chakra, former chief secretary Jugal Mohapatra and former NIPFP professor Dr Tapas Sen said as economic activities remained suspended for most part of the April-June period, the Odisha government could raise only 60% of the revenues it had budgeted for the quarter.“If this trend continues through the rest of the financial year, the government’s revenues in financial year 2020-21 may fall about Rs 49,600 crore, or 40%, of the Rs 1,24,000 crore budget target,” said Dr Pravas Mishra, a public finance analyst with Oxfam India. “Assuming that economic activities and revenue collections return to normal by October-December quarter, the most optimistic scenario could still leave the state with a revenue shortfall of at least Rs 17,000 crore, or 25%.”Mohapatra said the government of Odisha could tap the Debt Redemption Fund that has about Rs 12,000 crore lying in it. Also, it has enough headroom to borrow from the RBI via ways and means advances, as the limit for such loans has been raised to 5% of GDP, around Rs 22,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-foreign-tours-buying-cars-as-odisha-limits-expenses-to-fight-covid-19/story-vPpbciRtRxMDwzvdpSyn6L.html
07-07-2020||India||Assam govt’s Covid-19 management decisions whimsical, says IMA||The Assam unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Tuesday expressed resentment and reservations on certain policy changes by the state government on management of Covid-19 pandemic in the state.In a letter addressed to health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma (copy of which is with HT), the IMA unit said with present surge in Covid-19 cases in the state it will be difficult to control the situation in the absence of proper planning. “Increasing hospital beds without manpower planning will be futile exercise as we have very limited resources in terms of doctors and health workers,” the IMA’s letter said.Till Monday, Assam had recorded 12,522 Covid-19 positive cases. The state’s biggest city, Guwahati, and rest of Kamrup Metro district have been placed under total shutdown for 14 days beginning June 28 due to community spread of the disease.“On Monday, the government issued a fresh set of guidelines increasing Covid duty for doctors from existing 7 days at a stretch to 11 days followed by 3 days in quarantine and resumption of duty after their tests come negative,” said Dr. Satyajit Borah, IMA Assam unit president.“This was done without consultation with stakeholders. Working in Covid centres for 11-days at a stretch wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits in this summer without air-conditioning in most centres is very exerting and will demoralize frontline workers,” he added.The IMA unit also opposed the government’s decision to switch over from RT-PCR tests to rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests for checking health workers engaged in COVID. It added that according to ICMR, the RAD test “is less sensitive and negative result does not rule out Covid”.“Already a number of doctors and healthcare workers have fallen victim to Covid and such unplanned and insensitive steps will further endanger the health workers. IMA demands a critical review on why so many doctors and health workers are affected by the disease,” the letter stated.Though exact figures of Covid-19 infection among doctors and health workers wasn’t available, IMA office bearers mentioned nearly 20-25 doctors have tested positive for the virus in the state.“IMA urges the government to take experienced healthcare professionals and groups in confidence in proper planning to face the challenges rather than taking closed door and whimsical decisions. Otherwise the much talked about successful Assam model will collapse in no time,” the letter cautioned.The IMA unit advised the state government to adhere to ICMR’s advice of management of asymptomatic Covid-19 patients in their homes in order to lessen burden on healthcare workers and facilities.Reacting to the IMA letter, principal secretary (health and family welfare) Samir Kumar Sinha mentioned that he was aware of the issues raised and they will be sorted out after consultations.“We had to raise the number of Covid duty days from 7 to 11 for healthcare workers due to the surge in cases. We have to provide medical services to the patients or else there will be more deaths,” Sinha said.“Unlike RT-PCR test, which used to take several days to get results, the RAD test allows us to get results within an hour. Once the results come negative and their quarantine period is over, healthcare workers can get back to duty,” he added.Health department officials requesting anonymity said keeping asymptomatic Covid-19 patients in home quarantine is tough for Assam as healthcare workers will need to pay visits regularly to monitor them. But a change in protocol is expected within the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-govt-s-covid-19-management-decisions-whimsical-says-ima/story-NseeOuSKnv9QRVH3IJppKO.html
07-07-2020||India||Alliance intact in Bihar, says BJP; Congress works at ‘honourable’ pact||The BJP and Congress in-charge for Bihar were in the state on Tuesday to shore up and firm up their alliances ahead of the assembly polls. The BJP said that NDA partners will fight unitedly. The Congress, on the other hand, said it will hammer out an “honourable” pact with its coalition partners.Underscoring that its alliance in Bihar was intact, the BJP said that it would contest the polls with its two other partners - JD(U) and the LJP - with a “positive mindset” and on a “development plank”.The comment assumes significance as differences have cropped up between the JD (U) and the LJP on several issues lately.“NDA is comfortably placed. Nobody should have doubt about the alliance. The alliance will contest elections unitedly on the plank of work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government in six years and the steps taken during the lockdown period,” said Bhupendra Yadav, Rajya Sabha MP and in-charge of Bihar BJP affairs.The BJP in-charge also made it clear to the cadres that they should not bother about who will be contesting how many seats. “Whatever seats one gets, NDA will fight unitedly. Prepare for all 243 seats,” he said.The LJP had been critical of JD(U) over employment opportunities for migrant labourers during the lockdown, farmers’ issues, seat sharing, and, above all, the issue of chief ministership in the state.The Congress in-charge for Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil also sent a message to sulking alliance partners that the party would have an “honourable” tie up with the alliance partners for the upcoming assembly polls.Gohil, who was recently elected to the Rajya Sabha, rushed to Patna on a three-day visit apparently to coordinate with the leaders of the opposition alliance in the wake of fissures emerging over two issues — common minimum programme (CMP) and coordination committee.Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha and campaign committee chairman Akhilesh Prasad Singh were also present when Gohil addressed the gathering of party workers at the BPCC office at Sadaquat Ashram in the evening.A senior BPCC functionary, pleading anonymity, said that meeting the top leaders of the alliance to sort out “minor” differences on the issues of CMP and coordination committee also topped the AICC in-charge agenda, which was not included in his official itinerary.“HAM-S leader Jitan Ram Manjhi is also anxiously waiting for Gohil’s meeting with RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav to sort out issues,” he said.BPCC media in-charge HK Verma said that Gohil’s visit was quite significant as the party would form an initial view for the seats it would bargain to contest in the assembly polls with RJD and other alliance leaders. The party leaders have identified around 100 out of 243 seats to contest in the upcoming assembly polls set to be held in October-November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alliance-intact-in-bihar-says-bjp-congress-works-at-honourable-pact/story-d27OHwL0iWKoDBTpOmWQOL.html
07-07-2020||India||Gadkari seeks forest clearance for infra projects, nudges ministries||Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday chaired a meeting of the ‘group on infrastructure’ with railway minister Piyush Goyal and environment minister Prakash Javadekar seeking to expedite clearances for several pending highway and infrastructure projects. The road transport and highways minister raised the issue of outstanding forest clearance for 187 highway projects. It was also noted that many projects had not yet applied for Stage II forest clearance. Environment minister Javadekar was asked to direct the forest officers posted in states to follow and implement the circulars and orders issued by the environment ministry.“Special High powered committees on forest issues can be conducted as is being done in Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Arunachal Pradesh. It was felt that this step will remove many hindrances in the way of infrastructure projects, which will save both time and money,” the transport ministry said.A major issue before infrastructure projects is tree cutting, however, there are ambiguities over inclusion of certain local breeds of shrubs and plants in forest cover, the ministry noted.“An example of Babool or Kikar was presented in the meeting. This being an exotic Arabian shrub, its inclusion in the definition of trees is causing hindrance while considering forest clearance for several projects. In Delhi, an ambitious project monitored by PMO, the Dwarka Expressway, is facing such 1939 Babool shrubs in a total of 6364 trees. It was pointed out that many States like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh do not cover this shrub in land revenue code as a tree,” it said.The meeting was also attended by the railway board chairman, senior officers of the ministries of road transport, power environment and forests, NHAI and representatives from the state governments of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka.Chairman railway board, director general forests and director general roads have been directed to meet every month to expedite work on the concerned projects.It was stressed in the meeting that level crossings on National Highways need to be removed, as they constitute major accident spots. It was pointed out that while their designs had been approved at 167 locations, but work has not begun as yet.“MoUs were signed in this respect over 5 years ago, and there is a need to improve performance. In this direction, it was agreed to monitor the projects under Setubharatam programme on a monthly basis. It also was underlined that 30 road projects are pending with Railways. However, the railway minister assured to resolve these within two days,” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gadkari-seeks-environmental-clearance-for-infra-projects-nudges-ministries/story-fXnmeXfMPtpKeQ5RQGunyK.html

07-07-2020||India||NHAI’s elevated Saharanpur-Dehradun road to reduce wildlife casualties||The National Highway Authority of India’s (NHAI) proposed 12-km, four-lane elevated road to Dehradun, through Shivalik forest in Saharanpur, is expected to be a unique model of development that takes care of wildlife conservation.The road will connect Mohand in Saharanpur to Dehradun and replace the existing two-lane road on which many wild animals often die after getting hit by vehicles.The elevated road will take a detour into the Mohand Rau (seasonal rivulet), instead of the earlier plan to widen the existing road to four lanes and pass it through two tunnels. It will provide a safe corridor to wild animals, especially tigers, to walk freely between Rajaji National Park (RNP) and Shivalik forests.A joint team of RNP, Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Saharanpur forest department and NHAI conducted the final spot survey of the area last week to finalise the alignment of the proposed road. NHAI’s Dehradun region project director Vibhav Mittal said the project would be a unique model where development and conservation of wild animals would go hand-in-hand. He hoped its tendering would be processed by the end of this year. The entire project would cost between Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 1,700 crore and vehicles could ply on it with a maximum speed of 80 km per hour. He also claimed that there would be minimum loss of trees and hills during completion of the project.The Uttarakhand government had recently decided to translocate a few tigers in Motichur range of RNP’s tiger reserve from other locations of the state.Meanwhile, the Saharanpur forest department sent a proposal to declare over 33,000 hectares of thick forest area of Shivalik forest as the fourth tiger reserve of UP and second in western UP.A six month trap camera survey of the forest has spotted more than 50 leopards, different species of herbivores, snakes, civet cats and many other animals which make it perfect for relocation of tigers, which were sighted here till 2005. Sanjay Kumar, divisional commissioner of Saharanpur, said initially the project was designed to widen the existing road to four lanes with construction of two tunnels. “But we shared the idea of an elevated road and the NHAI accepted it after verifying its viability and cost. It will be a mesmerising journey for people with scenic beauty of hills and rivers on both sides of the road and at the same time set an example of development by taking care of wildlife conservation,” Kumar said.Conservator of forest of Saharanpur division V K Jain, who is working hard to get the Shivalik forests declared tiger reserve, said the elevated road would prevent deaths of animals. He further said people would have a road on which they can travel at 80 km per hour to make their journey faster and pleasant. The existing road to Dehradun passes through jungle area of Mohand and Shivalik hills up to Daat Devi temple. A new tunnel has been built close to the old tunnel near Daat Devi temple and project director Mittal says that the elevated road would end at the temple. He further said NHAI generally constructs roads for a speed of 120 km per hour but because of many sharp turns in the hills, this road will have maximum speed of 80 km per hour and cut travel time to Dehradun by an hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhai-s-elevated-saharanpur-dehradun-road-to-reduce-wildlife-casualties/story-JgXPjEecDj6k9Bm0wmOdmI.html

In 2018, the pilgrimage was held for 60 days.Thousands of pilgrims either trek the traditional and longer 45-km-long Pahalgam route or the shorter 16-km Baltal route to the holy shrine every year.One of the holiest pilgrimages of Hinduism, the Amarnath Yatra attracts pilgrims from India as well as across the world. There have been terror attacks on the route of the yatra in the past. The last attack took place in 2017 on a bus from Gujarat in Anantnag district that left seven pilgrims dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarnath-yatra-1000-pilgrims-on-helicopters-500-on-foot-to-be-allowed-per-day-via-baltal-track-this-year/story-THuiDktB0jUafuhVax4tSI.html

We find that the situation at and around Lonar Lake is really pathetic,” the bench said in its 12-page order published on Tuesday.“The pathetic situation has arisen mainly because of the indifference rather callous indifference of many of the authorities responsible in their own way for conservation and preservation of Lonar Crater Lake.”Meanwhile, the bench took serious note of Buldhana collector’s alleged failures to implement HC directions and to attend court hearings, not even through video conferencing for the latest hearing and in person prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.“We are of the prima-facie view that the Buldhana collector.. has failed in discharging fundamental duties in the recent past, thereby owing an explanation to this court, for dislodgement of the prima facie impression,” the bench said.Suman Chandra, district collector and magistrate, Buldhana said, “There has been no intentional negligence. Over the past three months, there was a delay due to Covid-19. Special efforts will be made to ensure that all directions of the HC are complied with at the earliest. Meanwhile, the lake colour has normalised after rain that led to dilution. The colour had turned pink due to the increased salinity.”The bench also directed the civic body to furnish documental evidence of increased STP capacity (from 500 kilo litres per day to 1000 KLD) by July 22, and ensure untreated sewage is stopped from entering the lake within three days from the order date.Located 500 km from Mumbai and over 90 km from Buldhana city, the oval shaped Lonar Lake is a part of the 383-hectare Lonar Wildlife Sanctuary declared on June 8, 2000.The lake has an average diameter of over 6,000 feet and is 449-feet deep. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it was formed by a meteorite impact between 35,000 and 50,000 years ago. It was identified as a unique geographical site by a British officer C J E Alexander in 1823. A combined area of 366-hectare of Lonar Lake and surrounding regions was first proposed to be declared as a Ramsar site, a wetland of ecological importance in 2017 by the state forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-raps-officials-for-pathetic-condition-of-maharashtra-s-famed-lonar-crater-lake/story-FYshUxpUewR92zPm6kcnfP.html

The order, however, did not mention how long the fresh spell of the shutdown will last.  A containment zone has a stricter form of the lockdown and people are not allowed to leave or enter such areas while a buffer zone is a certain area marked outside the containment zone.A Centre-mandated nationwide lockdown in containment zones is in place till July 31.“Current concept of containment zones may be combined with the current concept of buffer zone and together they may constitute a revised and broad-based containment zone approach,” read a government notification.The state government said the following activities will be barred in these broader containment zones: all offices (government and private), all non-essential services, all congregations, all transportation, all marketing/industrial/trading activities. The movement of residents, the government added, will be strictly regulated.“Local authorities will try to arrange home delivery to the residents staying inside the broad-based containment zones,” it said further.In another decision last week, flights from six coronavirus hotspots - Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai and Ahmedabad - will not be allowed to land in Kolkata between July 6-19 as the state government stepped up efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus.Kolkata has of late been witnessing a daily average of 200 people being infected by coronavirus. The city had 2,415 active coronavirus cases on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-club-containment-buffer-zones-for-stricter-lockdown-from-july-9/story-bBRw2NydQegQNTDMcHNS4M.html
07-07-2020||India||HC asks state whether lawyers can travel by special suburban local trains during lockdown||Mumbai: The Bombay high court (HC) has directed Maharashtra government to respond to a public interest litigation (PIL), which sought directions to permit lawyers to travel by Mumbai’s suburban trains like the other frontline essential service providers battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The PIL cited that many lawyers are facing daily commuting woes since they don’t own private vehicles and as a result, should get the relief to travel by Mumbai’s suburban trains, the faster and the popular mode of public transport in a city known for massive traffic snarls, especially during the current monsoon season.Maharashtra government’s rules stipulate that only the government employees and essential service providers are allowed to use local trains since services resumed on June 15 after they were suspended in end-March because of the nationwide lockdown restrictions that were enforced to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.A two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices AA Sayed and MS Karnik, directed the Maharashtra government to file its response by submitting an affidavit before the court while hearing the PIL on Tuesday via a video-conference link.Lawyer Chirag Chanani and his colleagues filed the PIL through their advocates Shyam Dewani and Bhoomi Katira, who prayed before the court that services rendered by lawyers must also be considered under essential services and extend relief such as travel by Mumbai’s suburban trains on the lines of those extended to others rendering similar services.Dewani cited that both the Supreme Court (SC) and the Delhi HC considered lawyers as essential service providers and allowed them to freely commute by local trains amid the pandemic, but an exception has been made for his fraternity in Mumbai by both the Western and Central railway authorities.He further cited that as courts started functioning since June, the petitioners, who are residents of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), are facing acute difficulties in their daily commute to work since their workplaces, including courts and offices, are located in south Mumbai.To make matters worse, they don’t own private vehicles and suburban trains are also off-limits for them.The petition stated that many lawyers have to change at least three-four buses to reach their workplaces often after an inordinate delay and that, too, in a profession such as legal, where time is of the essence.The court will hear the PIL next after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-state-whether-lawyers-can-travel-by-special-suburban-local-trains-during-lockdown/story-bdH0UKNQYYcOd0HVR2lWaO.html

The bag, which arrived on a chartered flight from the UAE, contained 30 kg of gold in cylindrical form hidden within some equipment.The UAE’s ambassador to India, Ahmed Al Banna, has told the media in Dubai that he will coordinate with officials in Kerala for the investigation into the incident.A statement issued by the UAE embassy said the mission in Thiruvananthapuram and its diplomatic role had no role in the matter. The statement said the embassy “condemns the attempted misuse of diplomatic channels by an individual engaged in smuggling activity” and “firmly rejected such acts”.“Initial inquiries conducted by the mission revealed that a former locally hired employee of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram was responsible for this act. The employee in question was fired for misconduct long preceding this incident,” the statement said.“At this time, it appears that this individual exploited his knowledge of the mission’s channels to engage in criminal activity,” it said.“The UAE looks forward to fully cooperating with Indian customs authorities to thoroughly investigate this matter and urges stringent legal action against those involved,” the statement added.Police in Kerala have named two former employees of the UAE consulate – Sarith Kumar and Swapna Suresh – as suspects in the case. Sarith was arrested after he allegedly went to the airport with a fake ID card to collect the diplomatic bag.People familiar with developments, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the diplomatic bag apparently had the required authorisation, including documentation regarding its contents and a tamper-proof seal.Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, authorities in the receiving state cannot open a diplomatic bag even if they have suspicions about its contents. The bag can only be opened in the presence of officials or diplomats of the sending state. This was done in the case of the UAE’s diplomatic bag after receiving the required permission, the people said.Sarith worked as a public relations officer for the UAE consulate but was fired some months ago as “he was not doing his job”, Al Banna told Gulf News. “Unfortunately, he used different means and ways to misuse the name of the consulate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-embassy-says-diplomats-had-no-role-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-D7KTWVzDX8Jx6XFS0NQImM.html

Essential government services and medical emergencies will be exempt from the restriction,” he added.Besides Kokrajhar, authorities in Nagaon, Tinsukia, Biswanath, Sonitpur, Nalbari, Barpeta and South Salmara districts have also imposed a ban on travel to and from Kamrup Metro under provisions of Disaster Management Act, 2005. People found violating the ban will have to undergo 14 days quarantine.“We issued an order on Tuesday restricting movement to and from Kamrup Metro. People who returned from Guwahati or any part of Kamrup Metro during the past few days have been advised to undergo home quarantine for 14 days and report to health authorities immediately if they show any symptoms of Covid-19,” said Nagaon deputy commissioner Jadav Saikia.Meanwhile, Assam health authorities launched door-to-door coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests at a locality in Guwahati from Tuesday following a spike in coronavirus infections.Rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests, where results are made available within an hour, started in Ward-2 (Pandu), a densely populated locality, under the Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC), state health minister Himanta Biswa Sharma said.Healthcare workers aim to conduct 3,000 RAD tests by Wednesday. The door-to-door RAD tests are aimed at measuring the extent of spread of the viral disease within the community.Taking a cue from Kamrup Metro, some other districts in the state have also enforced lockdown restrictions. On Monday, a two-week lockdown began in the hilly Dima Hasao district, allowing only 30% of all grocery shops to operate between 11 am and 4 pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.The authorities in Upper Assam’s Jorhat district also announced on Monday that they would impose a lockdown for from July 9 to July 15, both days inclusive.Dima Hasao and Jorhat districts had recorded 89 and 145 Covid-19 positive cases, respectively, until Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-assam-districts-impose-travel-curbs-to-and-from-guwahati-after-covid-19-cases-surge/story-04mKeC65TL74PtcvJ99xWM.html

The incident happened after the cop put up posters of the rebels in his village urging them to surrender during a campaign last month.Superintendent of Police , Dantewada , Abhishek Pallava told Hindustan Times that around dozen Maoists entered the Gumiypal village on Monday night and abducted constable Ajay Telam’s parents. “They abducted Telam’s father, Lachhu Telam (64) and mother Vijjo Telam (62 )and also beat up the constable’s sister,”the SP said.Telam was recruited in the District Reserve Guard by Dantewada police last year.“He had distributed pamphlets and put posters of Maoists in his village, urging them to surrender. On Tuesday, about 15-20 rebels from the village were about to surrender and hence out of frustration, Maoists have abducted his parents,” Pallava said.Last month, the Dantewada police had launched the ‘Lon Varratu’ campaign under which posters and banners of the rebels, who carry cash rewards on their heads, are being put up in their native villages. The posters mention their names and appeal to the rebels to join the mainstream.“I had met families from Gumiyapal village and urged them to come and live in Dantewada district headquarters. Some families did move but the constable’s parents, who are old, decided to live in their village,” said the SP.Police sources said that about 200 people have gone to jungles to appeal to the Maoists to release Telam’s parents.Last week, Maoists killed a policeman’s brother-in-law in Hiroli village of Dantewada.Meanwhile, tribal leader Soni Sori said that Maoists’ act is condemnable but blamed the police force of “using the youth for their own gain”.“If Maoists have abducted Ajay’s parents, this is completely wrong and is condemnable. But police are using tribal youths like Ajay for their gain. For the last two years, Ajay was being accused by villagers of giving information of two tribal youths – Lachhu and Podia – who were killed by security forces,” said Sori.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-abduct-policeman-s-parents-in-chhattisgarh-s-dantewada/story-8EATXxLkXRl0AT62i3U1IL.html
07-07-2020||India||‘I stand with Modiji ’: Shashi Tharoor uses PM Narendra Modi’s 2013 tweet to target Centre’s response to China||Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday retweeted a 2013 tweet by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he had posted as the chief minister of Gujarat while questioning Indian troops’ withdrawal from the conflict zones at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in Ladakh sector.Retweeting the post, Tharoor said he agreed with the question Modi raised then as the Gujarat chief minister in 2013, while referring to instances of Chinese incursions into Indian territory and the subsequent stand-off between the armed forces of the two sides.“China withdraws its forces but I wonder why Indian forces are withdrawing from Indian territory? Why did we retreat?,” Modi, then Gujarat chief minister, had asked in a tweet dated May 13, 2013.On 15 April 2013, a platoon of Chinese troops had erected four tents southeast of Daulat Beg Oldi, 19km inside the Indian territory which resulted in a 21-day standoff. Two months later, the same year, Chinese soldiers again intruded into the Chumar sector in Ladakh on June 17. Modi had accused the then UPA government of not standing up to Chinese aggressions.US Military to stand with India in conflict with China, indicates White House officialMore than seven years later, Tharoor retweeted Modi’s questioning of the withdrawal of the Indian forces in 2013 to draw a parallel with the current situation in July 2020, when Narendra Modi-led Central government has negotiated an agreement with China for the withdrawal of troops from forward positions in the eastern Ladakh sector, where the two sides clashed in a brutal face off on June 15 in Galwan Valley, leading to deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and an unverified number of Chinese casualties.“I stand with Modiji on this. PM must answer his question!,” Tharror said while retweeting Modi’s 2013 tweet.Tharoor’s dig at the Modi government’s handling of the current crisis follows the beginning of an agreement between India and China to disengage from the Line of Actual Control which has resulted in troops on both sides withdrawing up to 1.5km from key friction points of Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra.Explained | Missiles, fighter jets: How India’s boosting forces amid China rowThe breakthrough to a three month long tense stand-off followed a conversation between the Special Representatives (SR) on the boundary issue, national security adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. Officials also attributed the developments to intense bilateral engagements over the past few days at the diplomatic and military levels.This is not the first time that Tharoor has tried to use PM Modi’s tweets from the past to bring into focus Modi government’s handling of the border dispute with China. Earlier on June 18, he had retweeted several of Modi’s old tweets on the issue, posted on May 13, 2013, February 8, 2014 and August 15, 2013 respectively. Tharoor’s re-tweets are in line with Congress offensive accusing the Centre of being soft on China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-stand-with-modiji-on-this-shashi-tharoor-uses-pm-narendra-modi-s-2013-tweet-to-target-centre-s-response-to-china/story-vlsXqF3ah4vQsV1w0mPkPL.html

An average of 12 murder cases occur every day. Between 2016-2018, crimes against children increased by 24% in UP. What have the UP Home Department and CM done other than covering these figures?” she tweeted.In another tweet, she said that the letter that slain police officer Devendra Mishra wrote to the then SSP was an alarm for last week’s ambush where Mishra and seven other policemen were killed. “Today there are many reports that the letter is missing. All these facts raise a serious question on the working of the Home Department of UP,” Priyanka Gandhi said.The massacre of the policemen who had gone to raid the gangster caught the police on the wrong foot and exposed a rot in the department’s ranks forcing it to suspend several personnel for ties with Dubey and allegedly tipping him off about the raid. The UP government which has often publiscised a policy of zero tolerance to crime has come out in poor light following the encounter. The UP Police have launched one of its biggest manhunts ever to arrest Dubey who has vanished after the ambush and is suspected to have crossed over to Madhya Pradesh. The police also raised the bounty on Dubey’s head to Rs 2.5 lakh. On Tuesday, the Uttarakhand Police went on alert after reports that the gangster was sighted in UP’s Bijnor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-accuses-up-govt-of-dressing-up-crime-statistics/story-tg8kghZcuD5FuB5zCDfEiN.html

There is non-application of mind on the part of the state government,” he argued before the court and cited the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016, which only empowers the UGC to take such a decision.The plea stated, “The hanging sword of uncertainty is faced by final year students and the resolution is not clear as to when the examinations will be conducted and the academic year will end. The fate of a large number of students, who wish to take admission for their post-graduation courses, is hanging in balance.”The petitioner prayed before the court to quash and set aside the resolution.The court directed that the UGC should be made a party to the PIL and the Maharashtra government to file its response within a week.The next hearing of the PIL will be on July 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-challenges-cancellation-of-exams-due-to-covid-19-hc-asks-ugc-to-be-made-party-state-to-respond/story-PZyxyz1P1Q3MxLrHai6CNN.html
07-07-2020||India||SC notice to Centre on plea for refund of ticket for flights cancelled due to Covid||The Supreme Court Tuesday asked the Centre and the DGCA to respond to a plea seeking directions to airlines to refund full amount of tickets for the flights cancelled due to restrictions imposed in India to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan issued notices to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) seeking their replies on the plea which has alleged that airlines have failed to refund the ticket amount and are “illegally imposing” the mechanism of ‘credit shell’ on unwilling passengers.“Issue notice,” said the bench, also comprising Justices S K Kaul and M R Shah.The plea, filed by Air Passengers Association of India, claimed that refusal to refund the amount is “arbitrary” and is in blatant violation of the Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) as acceptance of ‘credit shell’ is at the sole discretion of the passengers.“It is submitted that the airlines are illegally imposing the mechanism of ‘credit shell’ on the unwilling passengers. The concept refers to a form of credit note which can be used to make a new booking with the same airline for a period so provided by the airline, usually of one year, as is being offered by most of the airlines,” said the plea, filed through advocate Rohit Rathi.The bench said the matter would be heard along with a pending petition in the apex court which has also raised similar issue. The apex court said the petitioner’s counsel shall serve a copy of the plea to Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.The plea filed by the association has also sought declaring as “arbitrary” the action on the part of airlines in not refunding the full ticket amount. It said that on April 16, the Ministry of Civil Aviation had directed all airlines to refund the full amount collected for tickets booked during first lockdown period from March 25 to April 14, and also where refund was sought by passengers against booking being cancelled.The plea said the office memorandum further directed that for ticket booked during the first lockdown period for travel during the second lockdown period from April 15 to May 3 and the passenger seeking refund on cancellation of ticket, the airline shall refund the full amount without levy of cancellation charges.It said the DGCA had issued a circular on April 19 directing the airlines to refrain from booking tickets for journeys to be undertaken with effect from May 4.The plea claimed that despite the directives of the ministry and the DGCA, the airlines have failed to refund the ticket amount.“The action on the part of airlines insofar they fail to refund the money of the passengers is in blatant violation of the CAR given that the acceptance of ‘credit shell’ is at the sole discretion of the passengers,” it alleged.“It is submitted that the money lying in the ‘credit shell’ may not be of any avail to the passenger who had a specific reason for booking the tickets during the lockdown,” the plea said. It said that in these “testing times”, a passenger might require the money lying in ‘credit shell’ for immediate necessity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-centre-dgca-on-plea-for-refund-of-ticket-for-flights-cancelled-due-to-lockdown/story-s9HpgD40Y2s5IeEsHEKKuO.html

In addition to this, authorities should come up displays with descriptions about the year of construction of bridges, as many date back to the British era,” said Shikhar Paliwal, founder of the Being Bhagirath foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/selfie-points-to-come-up-on-british-era-bridges-in-haridwar/story-4jBmCKcuyLp9l1Jz1Qi3NO.html

Hou has, over the last few days, met President Bidhya Devi Bhandari and senior Nepal Communist Party (NCP) leader Madhav Kumar Nepal as well, triggering criticism about the envoy’s role in Nepal’s internal politics. Nepal and Khanal, both former prime ministers, are aligned with the rival faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known by his nom de guerre Prachanda.A meeting between Hou and Prachanda hasn’t matured yet. Prachanda, who is leading the campaign to oust PM Oli, is reluctant to meet her, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times. It is not clear how long he would be able to resist.Hou Yanqi’s deep interest in Nepal’s politics and PM Oli’s continuation has been widely criticised in Kathmandu.The Chinese Embassy has defended Hou’s meetings. Embassy spokesperson Zhang Si told the Kathmandu Post that China did not wish to see the Nepal Communist Party in trouble and wanted the leaders to resolve their differences and stay united.“The embassy keeps good relationships with Nepali leaders and is ready to exchange views on issues of common interest at any convenient time,” said Zhang, according to a report in the Post.The ambassador – and the embassy – keeps good relationships with the government, political parties , think tanks and all walks of life in Nepal, and always exchanges views on issues of common concern at convenient times, said Zhang.Prachanda’s reluctance to make it convenient to meet the ambassador stems from his experience in April this year when Hou persuaded the three big feuding players in the NCP - Prachanda, Madhav Nepal and Oli - to stay on the same side. That intervention came as a reprieve for PM Oli, who promptly fuelled a controversy around a 80-km road built by India and issued a new political map for Nepal to consolidate his position in the party and government.When the rebel leaders revived their campaign for his exit from one of the two posts that he holds - the NCPs co-chairman and the Prime Minister’s office - KP Sharma Oli promptly blamed New Delhi for the rebellion, even accusing Prachanda and his faction of batting for the Himalayan nation’s giant neighbour India that was upset over the map.PM Oli’s accusation, designed to put Prachanda on the back foot, however, appeared to backfire when he amped up the campaign against the prime minister, now insisting that Oli quit the prime minister’s office.Kathmandu watchers say Oli has dug in his heels and is unlikely to just give in. Instead, according to reports in Nepal’s media, he is planning to split the party and form a government in coalition with Sher Bahadur Deuba-led Nepali Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-envoy-hou-yanqi-steps-in-to-save-pm-oli-govt-her-office-says-don-t-want-ncp-in-trouble/story-d4YoLhsDt5bkF5qsavvnuJ.html

Your desk-job may be good for your health||Conventional wisdom has it that a desk-job with long hours before the computer is unhealthy, but new research released on Tuesday suggests that a typical office-based job has a lower risk of poor cognition compared to those that involve manual work.Research by experts at the University of Cambridge has concluded that people who work in jobs that require less physical activity – typically office and desk-based jobs – are at a lower risk of subsequent poor cognition than those whose work is more physically active.Lack of physical activity and exercise are known risk factors for major health conditions, including cognitive impairments such as memory and concentration problems. But evidence on whether physical activity actually protects against cognitive decline is inconclusive.The researchers examined patterns of physical activity among 8,500 men and women aged 40-79 years at the start of the study and who had a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds and educational attainment. The team was able to separate physical activity during work and leisure to see if these had different associations with later life cognition.The study, published on Tuesday in the International Journal of Epidemiology, concludes that individuals with no qualifications were more likely to have physically active jobs, but less likely to be physically active outside of work.Besides, a physically inactive job (typically a desk-job), is associated with lower risk of poor cognition, irrespective of the level of education. Those who remained in this type of work throughout the study period were the most likely to be in the top 10% of performers.Those in manual work had almost three times increased risk of poor cognition than those with an inactive job, the study adds.Says the study’s lead author Shabina Hayat: “The often used mantra ‘what is good for the heart, is good for the brain’ makes complete sense, but the evidence on what we need to do as individuals can be confusing”.“People who have less active jobs – typically office-based, desk jobs – performed better at cognitive tests regardless of their education. This suggests that because desk jobs tend to be more mentally challenging than manual occupations, they may offer protection against cognitive decline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chained-to-computer-your-desk-job-may-be-good-for-your-health/story-rjcjkJjYr0dPu9ZkFa9WON.html

Eight policemen were killed in an ambush in Kanpur when they had gone to arrest notorious criminal Vikas Dubey. The criminal continues to be on the run. “We’ve directed all police authorities in the State to assess the level of criminals before conducting raids, gather information about them and plan accordingly,” Uttarakhand DG (Law and Order) Ashok Kumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.  We've directed all police authorities in the State to assess the level of criminals before conducting raids, gather information about them and plan accordingly: Uttarakhand DG (Law and Order) Ashok Kumar on being asked about steps taken by police after UP's Kanpur encounter pic.twitter.com/yyMNY6xvIsThe officer said authorities have been told to raid only after taking everything into account. “If the criminal is of a very high level then we can call commandos for assistance,” he added.Fifty dedicated teams and over 3,000 police personnel across UP have been deployed in a massive manhunt to nab history-sheeter Vikas Dubey. The police have also raised the bounty on his head to Rs 2.5 lakh from the initial Rs 50,000.According to local police officials who did not want to be named, the UP police team came under attack from three sides when it had gone to arrest the criminal from his village in Kanpur. Taken by surprise, as they ran for cover, criminals on the ground accosted them and snatched their weapons, they said.By the time a wounded policeman escaped the site and raised an alarm, the criminals — believed to be around 20 in number — escaped.The autopsy report said that the policemen were killed by their own weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assess-level-of-criminals-before-planning-raids-uttarakhand-top-cop-after-kanpur-encounter/story-37TwHV3IeX2igLt532KifI.html

The state police chief added that the force will not rest until Dubey is nabbed.The sensational and barbaric execution of policemen last Thursday night is also in focus for exposing moles in the state police force who actively tipped off Dubey hours before the police raid and led their own colleagues into a deadly trap laid by the gangster. A stunned UP police force is now in hot pursuit of the gangster who managed to flee with his accomplices the same night.“40 teams and STF are working. We’re collecting information on Vikas Dubey’s accomplices and members of his family. Until and unless we arrest Vikas Dubey and his accomplices, we will not sit quietly,” UP’s ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar was quoted as saying on Tuesday by news agency ANI.Two sub-inspectors and a constable were suspended yesterday over suspicion that they might have leaked information to Dubey. Another sub-inspector was suspended earlier for his alleged links with Dubey. The police chief cited the huge cache of arms and explosives found at Dubey’s house which was razed down by police later to question if there was a deeper link to this incident.3 more cops suspended on suspicion of links to Vikas Dubey“The entire house was searched and 2 kg of explosive substance, 6 country-made pistols, 15 crude bombs and 25 cartridges were recovered,” Kumar said before adding, “Where did they get such a huge cache of weapons? What weapons were used? Information was received that someone kept it hidden at his home.”Police had also stumbled upon a concrete bunker built inside Dubey’s house that was stocked with provisions to last for months apart from the seized weapons and explosives, hidden carefully inside the walls.25 cops, all eyewitnesses to 2001 murder, turned hostile during Dubey’s triaState-wide raids to track down Dubey, who faces 60 criminal cases, are continuing. An alert has been sounded in all 75 districts of the state and 25 teams from 40 police stations are involved in search operations. UP borders have been sealed and posters put up at toll plazas in the state amidst apprehensions that he might have already crossed the border. The bounty on his head was increased to Rs 2.5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh.Officials believe that Dubey had supporters in the police force who helped him and his gang have a free run. This suspicion was corroborated when Daya Shankar Agnihotri, an aide of Dubey arrested on Sunday, claimed in a video statement that Dubey had been alerted about the raid by a caller from a police station. It is suspected that the police station in question could be the one in Chaubeypur, about 14km from Bikru village where Dubey lived. Vinay Tiwari, the Chaubeypur station officer was the first person to be suspended in the case. There are allegations that he has been protecting Dubey. “It is viral in the media that Circle Officer Devendra Mishra, who lost his life in Kanpur encounter, had written a letter. DGP has sent an IG level officer to investigate this. The truth will come out in the investigation,” Prashant Kumar said., referring to reports that Bilhaur circle officer Mishra, who led the raid team to Dubey’s village, had told former Kanpur senior superintendent of police about Tiwari protecting Dubey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-40-teams-chasing-kanpur-gangster-up-police-vows-not-to-sit-quietly-till-dubey-is-nabbed/story-jpb0EWWQxcmj9gnzP01zpN.html

Another sub-inspector was suspended earlier over his alleged links with Dubey.Officials were also probing a purported report by Devendra Mishra, the deputy superintendent killed in the failed raid.HC Awasthy, Uttar Pradesh’s director general of police, has said the force was conducting raids to track down Dubey, who faces 60 criminal cases.An alert has been sounded in all the 75 districts of the state and 25 teams from 40 police stations pressed into action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-firing-up-police-release-photos-details-of-15-absconding-accused/story-vVkjOCqMfUA147NvoFteKK.html
07-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand HC reserves judgement in PIL against govt takeover of Char Dham, 51 other temples||Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Monday reserved its judgment in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy against the state government’s takeover of the Char Dhams and 51 other temples in the hill state by invoking the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019, said counsel Manisha Bhandari, who appeared in the matter along with petitioner Swamy.Kartikey Hari Gupta, the counsel representing intervenor, Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), in the matter that is supporting the state government’s stand, said the court over the past week had heard all the parties concerned and reserved its judgment in the matter.The PIL had challenged the constitutional validity of the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019, by which the administration and control of major Hindu religious institutions have been taken over by the Uttarakhand government or by any authority functioning under the state government.Last December, the Uttarakhand assembly had passed the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Bill.In January, Uttarakhand Governor Baby Rani Maurya gave her assent for the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019.Aggrieved priests had threatened that they would move the HC against the Act, as they claimed to have been kept in the dark about the new law.They had alleged that the government took the step to ensure its control over shrine-related issues, bypassing the powerful priest community. On February 10, a four-member delegation of the state’s priest body met Swamy and submitted documents that were required to file a PIL along with a copy of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019.Soon, Swamy filed the PIL against the formation of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board and the resultant Act.Gupta said he argued in favour of the state government’s decision and presented various historical and legal documents before the court.He said the Act does not interfere in the matter of religion, it only regulates the temporal functions associated with matters of faith, as far as these shrines are concerned.“The administration of these temples was made by the then HC bench of Kumaon in 1899, which had separated the religious and temporal affairs. The 1939 Act for the management of these temples records that the law was needed due to the mismanagement of temples and also to alleviate pilgrims’ plight. The new Act has been passed to further that objective and it is valid,” he said.Gupta cited that the shrines’ mismanagement led to a separation of religious and temporal functions.“Irish lawyer Edwin T. Atkinson has recorded this fact of gross mismanagement of temples in the Himalayan Gazetteer published in 1884. The Supreme Court in its Ayodhya Ram Mandir judgement last November had also held that gazetteers are key evidence that courts can rely on,” he added. Gupta said he apprised the HC that “Manusmiriti, which is the ancient text for Hindu laws, in its Chapter 7 lays down that it is the choice of the King as to whom he wants to keep a priest and all rites and sacrifices in temples are performed by priests on his behalf. Thus, priests have no inherent right to manage temples. Scholar and educational reformer Madan Mohan Malaviya in 1933 had also published a book appealing to the public to hand over the management of temples for their better upkeep.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-hc-reserves-judgement-in-pil-against-govt-takeover-of-char-dham-51-other-temples/story-h8Lt9Ty7WBrbqTUpZk7VDK.html

CBI had even searched the premises of GVK in Mumbai and Hyderabad last week. The anti money laundering probe agency will soon start examining the accounts of companies and transfer of funds to ascertain the money laundering. It has powers to attach properties during investigation.In a statement issued last week, a MIAL spokesperson said, “MIAL is surprised to note the registration of case by CBI against MIAL and others. MIAL would have provided every assistance had the agency sought explanation or any document even if a preliminary enquiry had been initiated. MIAL is a transparent and responsible corporate entity which is committed to co-operate with the agency in its investigation to arrive at the truth”. On Tuesday, a GVK spokesperson said, “We have not received any notice from the Enforcement Directorate”.MIAL is a PPP (public private partnership) between AAI (Airports Authority of India), GVK and foreign entities in the name of MIAL under which GVK has a shareholding of 50.5%, AAI with 26% and remaining with shareholding is with foreign companies.The AAI entered an OMDA (operation, management and development agreement) in April, 2006 for modernization and up gradation, operation and maintenance of Mumbai airport as part of joint venture called –MIAL. As per the agreement, it was decided that MIAL will share 38.7% of their revenue as annual fee with AAI and that the government authority will have the first right on the revenue. “The essence of agreement was to create a world class facility and at the same time protecting the interests of government of India, promoters and passengers,” CBI FIR filed on June 27 states.“Despite there being a clear cut understanding in the OMDA, the promoters of GVK group in MIAL, in connivance with their executives and the unknown officials of AAI resorted to siphoning of funds fraudulently adopting various modus operandi,” CBI says.It has been alleged that MIAL entered into fake work contracts during 2017-18 with at least nine companies on the pretext of real estate development. MIAL transferred the funds to them but these projects have never been executed on the ground, and the transactions were only on papers. Using this modus operandi, Rs 310 crore have been fraudulently siphoned off which resulted in wrongful loss to AAI and corresponding gain to themselves. Similarly, from 2012 onwards, GVK used the surplus of MIAL to the tune of Rs 395 crore to finance their other group companies. The promoters of GVK, CBI has alleged, also embezzled funds by resorting to inflating the expenditure of MIAL.Subsequently, CBI FIR alleges that the GVK group connived with their family members, relatives and employees they assigned the premium retail areas of Mumbai airport to their family members at extremely low rates thereby reducing the revenue of MIAL on account of rentals and sales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-slaps-money-laundering-case-against-gvk-group-and-mial-for-airport-scam/story-h64ohqBSo4JpzCCvNmYU4O.html

The increase in recovery rate was recorded on the day India crossed the grim milestone of over 20,000 deaths due to the infection, with 467 new deaths in the last 24 hours. The country has recorded cases over 20,000 for fifth day in a row. However, in terms of death toll globally due to Covid-19, India is at the seventh spot, behind United States, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain, indicating better grasp over the infection spread in the country. Just a day before, India had overtaken Russia as the third most affected country globally, behind the United States and Brazil. While the country recorded one lakh coronavirus cases in 110 days, it took just 49 days for the cases to multiply seven fold and cross the seven-lakh mark. India’s case fatality rate is approximately 2.8 per cent and the number of active cases a little over a third of the total, suggesting the country’s health care system is able to keep up with the outbreak.In contrast with first week of June and May when India had recorded an average of 250 and 101 deaths respectively, the country has recorded an average of 450 deaths every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-from-one-lakh-cases-in-110-days-to-7-lakh-in-just-49-days/story-tw6fIRPEBn2zrbwbATMl8L.html

During the operation, some Maoists opened fire and the security personnel retaliated. On Tuesday morning, the body of an active member of the Bansadhara-Ghumusar-Nagabali division of CPI-Maoist outfit was recovered along with two weapons and some other Maoist articles from the spot.Also Read: Maoists preponed tactical counter-offensive campaign in ChhattisgarhMeanwhile, police said the identity of three of the four Maoists killed in the Sunday operation has been established. One of them was identified as Kosa Sodi alias Sukru, a member of the Odisha state committee of the CPI(Maoist) with a bounty of Rs 20 lakh on his head. Sodi hailed from Malkangiri district and had taken the place of Sabyasachi Panda after his expulsion from the outfit in 2012 and is involved in a number of cases. Two others were identified as Itesh and Reena, both area committee members with rewards of Rs 4 lakh each on their heads.Sunday’s encounter of Maoists was the first by police in Odisha this year. In August last year, police in Malkangiri district had killed Rakesh Sodhi, a platoon commander with a bounty of Rs 8 lakh on his head during an encounter. A policeman, too, was killed and another was critically injured in that encounter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-more-maoist-eliminated-in-odisha-among-the-dead-is-one-with-rs-20-lakh-reward-on-head/story-Nq39pLWG3dU71WRXknMORJ.html
07-07-2020||India||Rajasthan has more inbred tigers than any other state in India: Research||Rajasthan has more inbred tigers than any other state in the country, ongoing research by the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) has found.Anubhab Khan, one of the researchers who is a part of the NCBS team, said the reason behind the inbreeding—producing offspring from mating or breeding of individuals or organisms that are closely related genetically—in Rajasthan because of their isolation. “Tigers from here have dispersed up to 150-200 km towards Madhya Pradesh, but there aren’t any reports of any coming to Rajasthan from other states,” Khan said.“We have sequenced tiger genome across Rajasthan. Here, mostly the tigers have dispersed or shifted from the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) to Sarika Tiger Reserve (STR) in Alwar and Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) in Kota. This shows that all the Rajasthan tigers are related,” he added.The NCBS team has been using hair, blood, tissue and muscle samples from the big cats to create their genetic database and pedigree in Rajasthan.“In the six-year-long study, we have collected blood samples (besides tissue and muscle samples) from 18 dead or tranquilised tigers, and hair sheds of 34 tigers,” he added.Khan said the study of tiger genome through its hair is a faster and reliable method. “Earlier, we had to wait for a tiger to get tranquilised, but now we just need to follow the tiger and wait for him to sit,” he said.The researchers, so far have studied 60 tigers from eight states of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Khan said the study was useful in numerous ways. For example, he said, that if a tiger is to be shifted from Ranthambore to Mukundra, the sequencing of its genome will help identify the RTR big cat—not related to any other such animal in MHTR—that can be sent there for better reproduction.“Mitochondrial (related to cell) lineage can also be studied. During the study, we found that T-47 (a tiger) whose parents were not known is from the family of Machli, the longest surviving tigress,” he said.Emphasising on the need for inbreeding, RTR field director Manoj Parashar said it has been seen everywhere as the tiger population is isolated. It’s the tigers from RTR, which have gone to Sariska and Mukundra. There are zero possibilities that any tiger from outside comes in contact.“Inbreeding is right but it has not affected the population figure of tiger,” he said.Parashar said the research is ongoing and the report is yet to be submitted.A senior forest official, who did not want to be named, said in order to avoid inbreeding and create a fresh gene pool of tigers, the forest department in Rajasthan is mulling bringing two to three big cats from Madhya Pradesh under the tiger reintroduction programme to the Sariska Tiger Reserve.Sariska has 20 big cats—11 females, five males and four cubs.The officer also pointed to the need for a fresh gene pool of tigers.“In the case of the death of tiger ST-16, cancer was suspected. The disease is indicative of inbreeding, which also could be a cause of infertility,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-has-more-inbred-tigers-than-any-other-state-in-india-research/story-LNXMDqPkbR80AZ3AtbMR1M.html
07-07-2020||India||IAF projects day-night, all-weather combat capability in Ladakh||The Indian Air Force is projecting its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions in the Ladakh sector, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters and multi-mission choppers getting airborne for demanding night-time missions from a forward airbase in the area even as the Indian and Chinese armies have kicked off a complex disengagement process to defuse tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.The air force’s MiG-29 fighter jets, Sukhoi-30s, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters are among the platforms that are undertaking night missions in the mountainous terrain, amid the border row in Ladakh and worst tensions there since the 1962 India-China war, said one of the persons cited above.The IAF is sending out a message to the adversary that it has exploited the full capabilities of its platforms that can be assigned to undertake “all-weather, all-terrain and day/night missions” in the Ladakh theatre, said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Fali H Major (retd).“The message is that we have the capability and it can be used as and when required,” he said.Also read: India keeps focus on building border infrastructure, Rajnath Singh chairs crucial meet to review projectsAny professional force has to be ready to fight 24x7, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “Earlier, there were limitations of aircraft that prevented flying in the hills at night but now they have been mostly overcome. The night flying activity seen in Ladakh is part of IAF training to keep the skills of pilots and other personnel honed,” he said. “The challenges in those hills are many, especially illusions caused due to hill shadows and faulty depth perception that are overcome with experience,” said Bahadur, a veteran helicopter pilot who has carried out night flying in the area.While disengagement is underway along the tense and heavily militarised border, the Indian armed forces are keeping their guard up and advancing with maximum caution with the IAF’s forward air bases continuing to be on their highest state of alert to deal with any Chinese provocation, a second official said.The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has withdrawn up to 1.5 km from friction areas in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra along the LAC, and the Indian Army has pulled back proportionately, acting on an understanding reached last week by top Indian and Chinese military commanders on a phased de-escalation of the ongoing border conflict, as reported by Hindustan Times on Tuesday. Some thinning of PLA soldiers has also been noticed at the sensitive Finger Area near Pangong Tso.The IAF has played a key role in the Ladakh sector since border tensions began in early May. Its C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft have been used to move soldiers, tanks and infantry combat vehicles to the sector, while C-130J Super Hercules aircraft have undertaken sorties to the advanced landing ground in the strategic Daulat Beg Oldie sector to support the military’s forward deployments, the officials said.The IAF’s new inductions --- the Apache attack and Chinook multi-mission helicopters --- have significantly enhanced the IAF’s capabilities, the officials said.

We aim to conduct 3,000 tests in the ward by Wednesday,” Sarma had tweeted on Monday.The move follows the detection of 3,891 Covid-19 positive cases in Guwahati and rest of the Kamrup Metro district between June 24 and July 6.Earlier, the Assam government had imposed 14-day lockdown restrictions from June 28 to July 12 in the Kamrup Metro district in a bid to contain the viral outbreak.Sarma had admitted that community transmission of the pandemic occurred in Guwahati. The door-to-door RAD tests are aimed at measuring the extent of spread of the viral disease within the community.“We decided to start the campaign with Pandu, as the area has become a Covid-19 hotspot and many cases have been detected from there. Other localities in the city will also be covered at a later stage,” Sarma told media persons on Monday.Some districts in Assam have imposed travel bans to Guwahati because of the spike in Covid-19 positive cases in the city and other parts of the Kamrup Metro district.On Saturday, Sonitpur district authorities imposed restrictions in a bid to ensure “public health, hygiene, and safety of the general public”.The move follows similar steps taken by Nalbari and Barpeta district administrations while invoking the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.Several districts in the state have taken a cue from Kamrup Metro and enforced lockdown restrictions, as Assam grapples with its annual woes, the flood fury due to torrential downpour and swollen rivers. So far, floods have affected over 6.9 lakh people in 17 districts in the state and 38 people have died due to the seasonal scourge.On Monday, a two-week lockdown restrictions began in the hilly and tribal-dominated Dima Hasao district, allowing only 30% of all grocery shops to operate between 11 am and 4 pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.The authorities in Upper Assam’s Jorhat district also announced on Monday that they would impose a lockdown for from July 9 to July 15.Dima Hasao and Jorhat districts have recorded 89 and 145 Covid-19 positive cases, respectively, to date.Assam has reported 12,522 Covid-19 positive cases, including 7,882 recoveries and 14 deaths, until Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/door-to-door-covid-19-testing-begins-in-guwahati-after-spike-in-cases/story-vpgijhhKTDhBldYW1wXz6I.html
07-07-2020||India||Trinamool Congress suspends 18 workers after allegations of corruption in distribution of cyclone relief amount||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Tuesday suspended 18 of its panchayat workers and leaders in the Nandigram area of East Midnapore district after allegations of nepotism and corruption in distribution of monetary compensation to people affected by cyclone Amphan which hit the state on May 20.These were among the 200 workers and leaders who were issued show-cause notice on Sunday.The state government had released a relief package of Rs 6,800 crore. A part of this amount is being spent as compensation for those whose houses were damaged by cyclone Amphan. But there have been complaints that thousands of people whose houses were not damaged also got the money.More than 50 of those TMC workers who received show-cause notice from the party in Nandigram have returned the compensation of Rs 20,000 that the government transferred to their bank accounts for repairing homes. In no other area of Bengal has so many people been charged by the party in a single move. Complaints of nepotism in south Bengal districts run into thousands.“TMC will conduct a survey in all 25 community blocks in the district and take action against errant workers,” said Sisir Adhikari, TMC Lok Sabha member and the party’s East Midnapore unit president.TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee had on Sunday said that those involved in nepotism would be punished by the party.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Monday that the state government is rectifying the lapses which might have occurred in its efforts to pay the compensation to the victims quickly.“A few lapses might have taken place while we fast- tracked the compensation payment process on an emergency basis. We are rectifying the anomalies. Every affected family will receive the monetary relief,” she had said.Incidentally, the TMC-led movement against acquisition of farmland for a chemical hub at Nandigram witnessed unprecedented violence in the last years of the Left Front government and helped Banerjee come to power in 2011. The violence, which continued for more than two years, erupted after 14 villagers died in police firing in 2007. It is widely acknowledged that without the Nandigram movement and a prolonged agitation against the proposed Tata small car plant at Singur in Hooghly district, Banerjee might not have been able to overthrow the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led government. The two incidents rocked the state, became headlines in the international media and galvanised public opinion against the Buddhadeb Battacharjee government. “TMC sponsored the violence in Nandigram with help from Maoists. After she came to power, Banerjee promised to transform Nandigram with new industries. It never happened and local people had to look for jobs in other states. Now they are witnessing loot by the ruling party,” said Md Salim, a member of the CPI(M) politburo.The BJP on Monday started an agitation at Singur as well, alleging that a woman who had asked for tarpaulin after the cyclone was raped by a TMC worker in June. The party said the woman and her husband were threatened and told not to go to the police.BJP state women’s wing president Agnimitra Paul led the agitation at Singur police station. “The woman has two children. She was raped and threatened,” she said. An officer at the police station said that a complaint has been registered.While community block development offices are still receiving applications from scores of people who did not receive the compensation, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has turned this into a raging issue prior to the 2021 assembly polls. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh on Sunday launched a website where people who have been deprived can lodge complaints. To counter this, TMC has accused the BJP of indulging in the same nepotism in several parts in North 24 Parganas district. On Monday, TMC workers staged an agitation at a panchayat office in the district’s Bagdah area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-congress-pulls-up-200-workers-after-allegations-of-corruption-in-distribution-of-cyclone-relief-amount/story-gNOb4AlyE9353v3TVtelvO.html

She had come to visit her grandmother, who lives at Agripada in south Mumbai, in June.The rape survivor, who had befriended the accused on the social media network about a year ago, has been in regular touch with him, her relatives told the police.“On July 1, the accused, who works at a Haryana-based company that manufactures bottled water, along with his MP-based friends came to Mumbai in a private vehicle and picked up the minor girl from Agripada. He took her to his native state Rajasthan and raped her there,” said Sawalaram Agawane, senior inspector, Agripada police station.The police started a probe on the basis of a complaint filed by the rape survivor’s grandmother at Agripada police station.A preliminary probe revealed that the rape survivor was in contact with a person on the social media network for a while and recently the communication had become more regular.Police analysed her social media activities and zeroed in on a suspect’s profile and also found his phone number linked to it. An analysis of the call details traced the accused’s links to Rajasthan and MP.Two separate police teams were sent to these two states.A police team arrested the accused and rescued the rape survivor from Rajasthan’s Jhalawar district on Monday. While the other team arrested the accused’s three accomplices from MP. Police have also seized an MP registered car that was used in the rape survivor’s abduction.“The accused have been brought to Mumbai on transit remand. They will be produced before a court on Tuesday. However, one accused is still wanted in the case,” said R Syed, inspector, Agripada police station.The accused has been booked under relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, Agawane said.The rape survivor has been sent to a children’s home for safe custody, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-22-year-old-from-rajasthan-arrested-for-kidnapping-raping-minor/story-bH88sUX6soC8dqXd5IM7hN.html
07-07-2020||India||‘BJP is LeBron James of elections, Congress a dilettante’: Sanjay Jha||Drawing attention to the BJP’s pole position in election management, Congress member Sanjay Jha, who was recently removed as party spokesperson, compared the party performance to one of the greats of American basketball: LeBron James. In comparison, the leader, said the Congress appeared like “dilly-dallying dilettantes”.“The BJP is the LeBron James of election management and organisational agility. By comparison, we look like dilly-dallying dilettantes. It is an asymmetrical war,” wrote Jha in an article for scroll.in.The Congress has still not addressed the leadership issue in the party, with Sonia Gandhi holding the reins as interim president after Rahul Gandhi resigned taking responsibility for the dismal performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. At the party’s top body meet recently, there was again the murmur of Rahul Gandhi returning as president, however the rumours have been strongly denied by the Congress. Zoya Hasan, who taught at JNU and authored a book on the Congress, told HT there is a larger problem with the party. “...The basic problem is that Congress doesn’t have a full time president for more than a year which should be unacceptable at any time but more so when the ruling party has a strong leader and the leading opposition party has none. It’s odd for a party to have an interim president (Sonia Gandhi) and de facto president (Rahul Gandhi) but no full time president. No political party can function without a full time president,” said Hasan.The BJP has already kickstarted its virtual ‘Jan samvad’ to spread the its message with elections in Bihar and Bengal ahead. There is no such activity seen on the Congress side. Turning spotlight on the Congress rule - 55 years since Independence - Jha said the party needs to step up “not through an occasional sugar-rush or Twitter tantrums, but a bold imaginative structural transformation”.The leader was removed as party spokesperson after he wrote two articles in a major daily that predicted the Congress’s political oblivion because of its “extraordinary lassitude and lackadaisical attitude”.He complained about the lack of internal democracy in the party and called for renewal of political strategy and brought the focus back on the leadership issue.In an earlier tweet, he also made it clear that he will be “throwing his hat in the ring” as a candidate for the Congress Working Committee - the highest decision-making body in the grand old party - as and when the polls are held.Jha, Mumbai-based former banker-turned-Congress politician, in his latest article, called the Congress “India’s most powerful brand”, but added that it needed a “dramatic reinvention”.Underlining that he is not joining the BJP or any other party, Jha said those who criticised him for speaking the “truth” have not cared to understand him. As a way forward, he suggested that they revisit My Experiments With Truth and Discovery of India, books by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, respectively.The party leader, who calls himself “hardcore Nehruvian”, also offered hope, saying one can always start anew. “It is never too late to make a new beginning. The ostrich is the fastest animal on two legs, reportedly clocking a mind-numbing 75 km an hour. The giant bird is also known for burying its head in the sand. The Congress must make a choice,” wrote Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-is-lebron-james-of-election-management-congress-a-dilettante-sanjay-jha/story-N8aO5kbv9ML4nw9kQSAuAN.html

They alleged that Unitech had convinced them to book a flat at Wild Flowers Country in Gurgaon for a sum of Rs 57.34 lakh in August 2011.Later, 90 more complaints concerning the same project were registered against the firm.

07-07-2020||India||India keeps focus on building border infrastructure, Rajnath Singh chairs crucial meet to review projects||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday held a meeting with Border Roads Organisation (BRO) chief Lt Gen Harpal Singh and other officials about the progress in ongoing infrastructure projects on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China and Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan.The meeting went for about an hour where the BRO chief gave presentation to Singh about the work being done to boost infrastructure in India’s border areas, news agency ANI reported.India’s push to improve the infrastructure in the border areas was the primary reason for clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. Beijing was opposed to a 60-metre bridge over Galwan river in eastern Ladakh that would consolidate India’s hold of the sensitive sector by allowing Indian infantry to move across the cold mountain river and also protect the 255 km strategic road from Darbuk to Daulat Beg Oldie, the last military post just south of the Karakoram Pass.That bridge was completed last month, days after a face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers.In the last few years, there have been frequent face-offs in certain sensitive areas in Eastern Ladakh. It has been a direct outcome of India’s ability of increased patrolling in the area due to vastly improved infrastructure readiness.The genesis of the building up of faster strategic infrastructure can be traced back to 2014, when the Modi government gave it a big push. One of the first decision of the government was to issue a general approval in July 2014 for the creation of road network by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) within 100 km of aerial distance from LAC. This general approval ensured that requirement of prior central government and other bureaucratic process were done away with.In May, the BRO completed a key road in Uttarakhand which will cut travel time drastically. The road was inaugurated by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh through video conferencing. He also flagged off a caravan of nine vehicles from Pithoragarh to Gunji to indicate that both passengers and load can be sent by the new road stretch through mountainous terrain.The road has been built from Ghatibagar in Dharchula to Lipulekh near the border with China. It is also known as Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra Route. The road is 75 kilometre long.The road ends at the 17,000 feet high Lipulekh pass. From there, Mount Kailash is located around 97 km north of the pass in Tibet. The Lipulekh pass, close to the tri-junction of India-China-Nepal, is the lowest point in this section of the high Himalayas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-keeps-focus-on-building-border-infrastructure-rajnath-singh-chairs-crucial-meet-to-review-projects/story-Ar1BNZOKmq1uf1frBD56hP.html
07-07-2020||India||BJP relying on the Kashmir issue to stitch Bengal strategy||The 119th birth anniversary of nationalist leader Dr. Syama Prasad Mookherjee, the founder president of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, which led to the birth of the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1980, was used as a platform by the party president JP Nadda to target the Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal.However, the policies of the Congress and the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, particularly in the context of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), were the mainstay of his speech.Addressing a digital rally on Monday, Nadda dubbed the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) government as an impediment to Bengal’s development and called for dismissing it “lock, stock, and barrel”.As the Bengal assembly polls, slated to be held next year, draws near; the BJP has been sharpening its attack against its main rival, the TMC. From accusing it of fostering policies of appeasement to shielding those involved in financial scams; the BJP has recently begun blaming the Bengal government of not taking the Centre’s help in its battle against the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and “depriving” the people of the state of benefits of Central schemes such as Ayushman Bharat.However, it was Dr. Mookherjee’s clarion call of “ek desh, ek nishan, ek vidhan” to scrap the special status of J&K that has set the tone for the BJP’s battle royale in the state in next year’s assembly polls.On Monday, Nadda trained his guns on the TMC government by accusing the party of being power-hungry and chose Dr. Mookherjee as an arsenal. He said Dr. Mookerjee, who was instrumental in ensuring that Bengal and Punjab were not merged with Pakistan during the Partition in 1947, had opted to resign from the Nehru cabinet, when he had felt ideologically distanced from the government.“West Bengal has always given the country a new vision and a new direction, however, under the current dispensation, the state’s condition is pitiable. The current West Bengal government has not only ruined education in the state, manufacturing, and trade has also been severely affected. For the sake of the country and West Bengal, Dr. Mookherjee had resigned from a position of power. However, to the current government clinging to power is all that matters,” Nadda said.The party is relying on the J&K issue to stitch its Bengal strategy for the next year’s assembly polls.By bringing up Dr. Mookherjee’s stand on the Kashmir issue it has drawn a comparison between the Bharatiya Jan Sangh founder’s push for national integration versus CM Banerjee’s constant tussle with the Centre.“The state government has adopted the policy of appeasement and violence in the state. It is not even cooperating with the Centre in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, whereas PM Narendra Modi has been speaking about cooperative federalism. The West Bengal government has not allowed BJP MLAs (members of legislative assembly) and MPs (members of Parliament) to participate in the war against the viral outbreak. The TMC government is busy filing cases against BJP lawmakers in a bid keep them under house arrest,” Nadda said.In Bengal, where the BJP had won a record 18 of the 42 Lok Saba seats in last year’s parliamentary polls, the party is assiduously trying to dislodge the TMC government from power.It recently rejigged its state unit and expanded the roles of known Banerjee-baiters.And while its political opponents have accused it of trying to appropriate the legacy of Dr. Mookherjee, social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and renowned poet Nazrul Islam; the BJP has found ways of linking the current discourse to its ideology.For instance, the issue of stripping J&K of special status, which has a pan-India resonance, has been particularly cited in the context of Dr. Mookherjee’s sacrifice.“Dr. Mookherjee’s three contributions in the national interest can never be forgotten -- the partition of Bengal before the Independence, the establishment of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh and the J&K movement,” Nadda said.Will the BJP’s gambit of making Dr. Mookherjee and J&K the focal point of the Bengal polls pay off?Ajay Gudavarthy, a political commentator and a faculty member at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said the BJP could benefit from linking the polls to the reading down of Article 370 of the Constitution. “Dr. Mookherjee is not part of the popular discourse or culture of Bengal in the way, say, Swami Vivekananda is. His name may resonate with the urban middle class, but the issue of J&K and the scrapping of Article 370 is an emotional issue that people support,” he said.BJP’s national vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, however, said it is a matter of interpretation, if the party is reviving Dr. Mookherjee’s legacy for its own political gains.“Dr. Mookerjee’s legacy is an inseparable part of national politics. He has been an icon of our ideology and our political journey; and consequently, bound to figure in our narrative,” Sahasrabuddhe said.“We cannot help if people find that there are many similarities in the current situation in West Bengal and those during the times of Dr. Mookherjee. If there is any party that is talking about his legacy, it is the BJP. Although he was a Congressman, the Congress has forgotten him. It is the BJP that tried to translate his ideals into reality. For example, his dream of keeping secessionist forces in J&K at bay by abrogating Article 370,” he added.Saugata Roy, TMC’s Lok Sabha MP from Dum Dum constituency, said the BJP is banking on Dr. Mookherjee since the party doesn’t have an icon in the state that it can call its own.“Dr. Mookherjee never had a deep political base in Bengal...while he enjoyed respect because of being the son of Sir Ashutosh Mookherjee, Syama Prasad was never a freedom fighter and never went to jail... the BJP is projecting him because it doesn’t have an icon In Bengal. The state’s true icons such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Dr. Chittaranjan Das, and many others, spoke of Hindu-Muslim unity and not Hindutva. Unfortunately, Nadda doesn’t know Bengal’s rich history,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-relying-on-the-kashmir-issue-to-stitch-bengal-strategy/story-18sqkWHzeuLhf6JVqMFNnN.html

The two sides also spoke about working together to avoid such incidents in future, a top government official had said.Doval and Wang, the two special representatives on the boundary issue, had “a frank and in-depth exchange of views on the recent developments in the Western Sector of the India-China border areas”, an external affairs ministry statement had said. On Tuesday, the former Congress president tweeted two photographs of the statements issued by India and China after Sunday’s talk between Doval and Wang. A part of the Chinese statement has been highlighted in one of the photographs.“National interest is paramount. GOI’s duty is to protect it,” Rahul Gandhi posted on Twitter.“Then, 1. Why has Status Quo Ante not been insisted on? 2. Why is China allowed to justify the murder of 20 unarmed jawans in our territory? 3. Why is there no mention of the territorial sovereignty of Galwan valley?” Gandhi asked.Rahul Gandhi has been relentless with his attack on the government over the border standoff with China in Galwan Valley of eastern Ladakh.The Congress party has also been taking jibes at the Centre since the June 15 violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley, which resulted in the killing of 20 Indian Army soldiers, including the commanding officer of 16 Bihar Regiment.It has also been questioning the government whether Indian land has been occupied by China.The Bharatiya Janata Party, on its part, has attacked the opposition party for what it called the demoralising of the country’s armed forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-3-questions-rahul-gandhi-reminds-govt-of-its-duty-over-border-stand-off/story-k0CtH3F5CZSQcmQHNkJV0N.html

07-07-2020||India||After eight days, diesel price hiked again; petrol remains unchanged||New Delhi: Fuel prices again started moving north after a pause for eight days, as oil companies on Tuesday raised pump price of diesel by 25 paise that pushed up its price in Delhi to a record Rs 80.78 per litre.The retail price of petrol, however, remained unchanged for the eighth day on Tuesday at Rs 80.43 per litre, according to state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). Retail prices of auto fuels differ from city to city across the country due to variations in local levies.Pump prices of auto fuels that witnessed a rising streak since June 7 saw 12.86% and 16.41% jump in the rate of petrol and diesel, respectively.In comparison, the international benchmark, Brent crude, rose by 1.89% in the last one month.During the intraday trade on Tuesday, Brent was trading at $42.81 per barrel, or about 1.3% lower than the previous day’s close weighed down by a stronger dollar and oversupply concerns.A petroleum ministry spokesperson said, “The diesel and petrol prices in the country are linked to the international prices of finished products, and not crude prices.”However, he could not immediately provide the percentage changes in global benchmarks of petrol and diesel in the one-month period between June 7 and July 7.An executive of state-run oil marketing firm said, requesting anonymity, that companies do not disclose data related to the price movement of petrol and diesel benchmarks as a matter of commercial secret.Theoretically, the government has no role in the daily revision of petrol and diesel prices, as these are deregulated products. The government had deregulated petrol pricing in 2010 and diesel in 2014.State-run fuel retailers – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) – declined comments. The three public sector oil companies control over 90% of domestic fuel retail trade.The oil company executive mentioned above said petrol and diesel rates are also high because of a significant jump in central levies that mop up the entire price benefits when international crude oil prices were low.In the last one month, petrol and diesel rates have seen 21 and 23 revisions, respectively.Prior to the start of a daily price surge, petrol was sold at Rs 71.26 per litre in Delhi and diesel at Rs 69.39 a litre on June 6.Two people with direct knowledge of fuel pricing matters, requesting anonymity, said that the price rise in the last month also gave an opportunity to state-run oil marketing companies to recover their past losses, as they had frozen fuel rates to provide relief to consumers, who had been distressed by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Fuel retailers had frozen petrol and diesel rates since March 16.However, retail prices were raised on May 5 because the Delhi government had raised the value-added tax (VAT).Almost all states have raised VAT on petrol and diesel since mid-March to take advantage of low oil prices in the global markets.One of the persons working in the petroleum ministry said all past dues of oil marketing companies have been already been recovered and the current fuel price hike is purely aligned with international prices of petrol and diesel. Diesel prices in Delhi have surpassed petrol because the state government raised VAT on diesel sharply. Even otherwise, internationally, diesel rates are higher than petrol, the person said. The Union government raised excise duties on petrol and diesel twice – first on March 14 by Rs 3 per litre each, and later on May 5 by Rs 10 a litre on petrol and Rs 13 on diesel. A Re 1 per litre hike in excise duty meant an additional Rs 14,500 crore revenue to the exchequer.Consumers could not reap the benefit of the recent oil price slump because both the Centre and states have cornered the entire benefits through higher levies in the forms of central excise and VAT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-eight-days-diesel-price-hiked-again-petrol-remains-unchanged/story-HhgX9cnQ1DYynUYgwPLl2O.html
07-07-2020||India||Despite worries, many felt happy during Covid-19 lockdown, finds online survey||During the first two phases of lockdown (March 25-May 3), not everyone was fearful. There were some who were happy for different reasons like getting ample time to spend with family and working from home in pyjamas. Happiness is also coming from the fact that they do not have to commute to work daily and getting stuck in traffic.This has been revealed by a pan-India online survey conducted by Centre for Marketing in Emerging Economies (CMEE) at Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow (IIML). The survey was conducted in collaboration with Qualisys Research and Consulting.“This wasn’t a planned holiday but a sudden one. I am getting more family time which is a rarity these days, more sleep and less work is making this time worthwhile,” said a 22-year-old student from Punjab.There were 931 respondents across various online platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, out of which 124 (or 13 per cent) said they were happy .“Due to this lockdown, I am spending more time with family, especially kids, which I was not able to do earlier,” a 38-year-old chartered accountant from Delhi said about his lockdown experience.The happy ones were also treating the lockdown time like an unplanned vacation. For many who had not faced economic consequences by then, it was like a paid vacation during which they pursued hobbies and reduced their sleep deficit. The survey further revealed that 56 per cent of these happy people tried out new dishes and 38 per cent of them talked over phone with friends and relatives - something they were not able to do earlier.“I am getting to spend a lot of quality time with my children and my wife, I am able to assist my wife with household chores and getting more time interact with my friends and relatives over phone or social media,” said a 34-year-old investment manager from Gurugram.“Happiness is a frame of mind and once the factors that contributed to that happiness change, the mood could change. But it was interesting to see that some viewed lockdown like a vacation,” said IIM, Lucknow’s prof Satyabhusan Dash who led the research survey.The adage that money cannot buy happiness does not hold true in this case as people with a higher income had a higher happiness quotient. Some 15 per cent of all those who earned over Rs 10 lakh annually were happy as compared to only seven per cent of those who earned less than that.“I am getting 10-hour of sleep everyday,” said a 22-year-old student from Hyderabad.However, being happy did not mean that they were not worried about the current pandemic. About 52 per cent of the respondents were very much worried about the prevailing situation, yet they managed to stay in a happy state of mind.The survey also found that 40 per cent of the total sample size said it was fearful, 22 per cent felt sad, 11 per cent respondents felt disgusted, nine per cent were surprised and five per cent respondent felt angry.The survey covered participants in 104 cities across 23 states across metros, tier-1 and tier-2 cities.Snowballing sampling methods were used to cover a fairly representative sample across India. Given the nature of these online platforms, the survey has a skew predominantly towards male (62 per cent) vs female (38 per cent), higher education (63 per cent post graduation and over) and upper income participants with 40 per cent over Rs 10 lakh annual income. Ashu Sabharwal (founder, Qualisys), Mohan Krishnan (former VP, Kantar), Avinash Jain, PhD scholar (IIM Lucknow) and Ankita Singh (research director, Qualisys) were integral part of the research team.“There was also a joy to see the earth healing and reclaiming itself and the newness of being at home with family,” said Sabharwal.Those who are happy are also of the belief that Indians have higher immunity level to face the disease as compared to the rest of the world. They also strongly believe that India is in a better position as compared to other countries in the world.Some of the respondents who are spiritually inclined see this unlikely event as the nature’s way to bring justice and heal itself. And many do not believe in fretting over something which is not in their control, they are trying to make the most of the current time. They see a ray of hope even in this trying times and are of the belief that everything will return to normal sooner than later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-worries-many-felt-happy-during-covid-19-lockdown-finds-online-survey/story-UzO8qSjrvW20CBVBC1hoGM.html
07-07-2020||India||Chinese envoy to Nepal in fresh row for her meetings with Nepalese political leaders||China’s envoy to Nepal Hou Yanqi is at the centre of a fresh controversy for her meetings with Nepalese political leaders amid growing pressure on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli from within his party to step down over charges of poor governance.Hou is no stranger to such controversies, as she held a series of meetings with leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) in late April and early May after an internal rift in the party became public and threatened to lead to the ouster of Oli. Political analysts also believe China played a key role in bringing together various communist leaders to form the ruling party.In the past week, Hou met President Bidya Bhandari on July 3 for what was described as a courtesy call and senior politician Madhav Kumar Nepal, who heads the foreign relations department of NCP, on July 5.As with her meetings with Oli and NCP chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” and Nepal in April-May, analysts believe Hou is engaged in efforts to shore up the position of the beleaguered prime minister. Media reports in May said that Hou had, in her earlier meetings, expressed concern at the rift within the NCP and urged the party’s leaders to maintain unity and avert any sort of split.Hou’s latest meetings with government officials and political leaders have sparked concerns among political analysts and former diplomats as they came at a time when Nepal’s politics is in disarray and different actors are attempting to gain the upper hand, The Kathmandu Post reported on Tuesday.Questions have been raised about Bhandari’s role in the ruling party, especially against the backdrop of tensions between Oli and Prachanda. Thirty of the 44 members of NCP’s standing committee have asked Oli to step down as party chairman and prime minister.Bhandari’s meeting with Hou led to more questions, especially since foreign ministry officials said the President’s Office has repeatedly violated the diplomatic code of conduct, The Kathmandu Post reported.An under secretary of the foreign ministry is posted in the President’s Office to brief Bhandari on potential meetings with foreign dignitaries and envoys, but this official wasn’t informed about the meeting between Bhandari and Hou, the report said.“As per the diplomatic code of conduct, foreign ministry officials should be present at such meetings, but we were not informed,” an unnamed ministry official told The Post. “So there is no institutional record of the meetings and we don’t know what the talking points were.”During her meeting with NCP leader Nepal, Hou discussed the conflict within the ruling party and urged all sides to maintain restraint, according to sources cited by The Post.Bishnu Rijal, deputy chief of NCP’s foreign relations department, didn’t provide details of the meeting.“I don’t have details about the meeting between Nepal and ambassador Hou but as far as I understand Chinese protocol, the Chinese begin meeting top ranking officials and gradually come down to other officials,” said Rijal, implying Hou should have already met the two NCP chairs before meeting Nepal.Hou also reportedly met Oli before the beginning of NCP’s standing committee meeting, which began on June 24. On Monday evening, Hou met senior NCP leader Jhala Nath Khanal to discuss internal politics, according to an aide to Khanal.The Chinese envoy has reportedly been advising NCP leaders to remain united as Beijing is concerned about “political stability” in Nepal.Asked about the objective of Hou’s meetings, Chinese embassy spokesperson Zhang Si told The Post that China didn’t wish to see the NCP in trouble and wished its leaders would resolve their differences and stay united.The ambassador and the embassy have a good relationship with the government, political parties, think tanks and people from all walks of life, and always exchange views on issues of common concern, Zhang said.Foreign affairs analysts, however, haven’t taken kindly to the Chinese envoy holding meetings with Nepalese leaders at a time of crisis within the ruling party, The Post reported.“I blame our leaders for inviting interference in our internal affairs,” former ambassador Lokraj Baral said. “Earlier, the Indian ambassadors would involve themselves in our internal affairs, and now it is the Chinese’s turn.”Baral pointed to the changing facets of Nepal’s relationship with both countries, where India is viewed with more suspicion than China.“When the Indian ambassadors did the same thing, we called it interference,” he said. “But the same does not apply to the Chinese. Only the media have raised this issue, but the political leadership and public intellectuals have not thought about it that way.”Recently, NCP and the Chinese Communist Party held a virtual interaction and Nepal, as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, voted in favour of the controversial Chinese security law for Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-envoy-to-nepal-in-fresh-row-for-her-meetings-with-nepalese-political-leaders/story-jBfStIx7OWlorYRVamASXI.html
07-07-2020||India||Maoists preponed tactical counter-offensive campaign in Chhattisgarh||The outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) has made a key strategic change and advanced its annual tactical counter-offensive campaign (TCOC), where rebels carry out maximum attacks against security forces, to two phases this year – January to March and April to June – officials said.Usually, TCOC was be carried out between March and June, allowing rebels easier move in dense jungles of Central India during peak summer.However, an alarming trend has come to light amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, where ultras managed to freshly recruit 50 cadres in eastern Bastar, a Maoists’ letter seized by the security forces revealed, said a police official posted in the region. The officials believe that rebels have also managed to recruit new cadres in Sukma, Bijapur, Dantewada, and Narayanpur districts.The seized letter is written by Maoist leader of Maad division of Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee, Sukhlal, and addressed to the banned party’s leader Nagesh, who goes by his first name.The letter stated that TCOC would start in January this year, as a marked departure in a bid to take security forces by surprise.Sukhlal claimed that half a dozen ambushes and attacks were carried out in the Maad division in Narayanpur district and also fresh recruitment of 50 cadres since TCOC had started in January.TCOC is an arm of the Maoists, which reports to the party’s Central Military Commission (CMC), whose chief is responsible for making an annual strategy for the counter-offensive operations against security forces that are aimed at destablising the government by an aggressive armed rebellion. A fresh recruitment drive for cadres is also carried out during this period. Typically, the new recruits are deployed in areas, where the rebels are planning fresh strikes against security forces.“TCOC helps Maoists to regroup and startle security forces with a pulverising attack out of the blue. Though the campaign had started in January, the Minpa attack on March 23 was its culmination, when 17 jawans were killed in a daring attack in Sukma district. This is for the first time that TCOC has been advanced to January and held in two phases,” said the official quoted above.Data showed that 26 security personnel were killed and bodies of 20 rebels were recovered in Chhattisgarh between January 1 and June 30. Most of the strikes were carried out in the Left Wing Extremist (LWE)-hit areas such as the tribal-dominated Bastar division and districts that come under the newly formed Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh (MMC) region.In 2019 and 2018, 12 security jawans and another 35 lost their lives in anti-Naxal operations, respectively.“The Minpa attack, where 17 jawans were killed on March 23, is the worst-attack on security forces over the past two years. Altogether, 21 jawans were killed between January and March,” said an Indian Police Service (IPS) official posted in Chhattisgarh.The official expressed concern about the fresh recruitment drive in eastern Bastar.“This is a worrying trend. Over 300 cadres have been recruited in the Bastar division between March and June, despite the pandemic. The Maoists’ toll of 20 between January and June is the lowest in the 10 years,” he said.DM Awasthi, director-general of police (DGP), Chhattisgarh, said, “The pattern for conducting TCOC has been constantly changing over the past few years. In the last couple of years, TCOC was held for four months after June and ended in December. It was started in January this year, as they have become more flexible. However, we were prepared because we had prior information of an early start.”Shubhranshu Chaudhary, a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) journalist-turned-peace activist in Maoist-infested areas in central India, weighed in on the TCOC’s early start in January“If TCOC had started in January, it also suggests an ‘over militarisation’ in the party’s ranks since the new leadership assumed charge. Now, the party is filled with people, who are adept at Guerrilla warfare since Nambala Keshav Rao, alias Basavaraju, took charge as the new general secretary. There has been a sea-change in their combat strategies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-preponed-tactical-counter-offensive-campaign-in-chhattisgarh/story-fZIwhSp4NHT0Md4RfVYfhP.html
07-07-2020||India||As India crosses another grim Covid-19 milestone, these states could emerge as new hotspots||India has seen a huge spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last few days, which has taken the country’s tally to over seven lakh.But there are some states which are of particular concern where the positivity rate - total cases per 100 tests - has been rising.Among these states is Odisha, where the positivity rate stands at 9.44 per cent, more than the national average. According to Union health ministry, the national positivity rate is 6.73 per cent.On Monday, Odisha reported 456 new cases from the 4,827 samples tested. The rise is a sharp departure from positivity rate of 4-6 per cent that it reported till July 1. The total number of positive cases in the state shot up to 9,526 on Tuesday and the number of fatalities stand at 38. There are close to 3,000 active cases in the state.Looking at the rise in the number of cases and increasing positivity rate, the weekend curfew in Odisha, which started on June 1, has been extended to 18 districts from an earlier 11 for the entire month of July.The other states which are heading towards becoming the new hotspots are West Bengal and Puducherry. While the positivity rate in Puducherry is 5.5 per cent, it stands at 4.16 per cent in West Bengal. This is an increase of more than one per cent from May 19, when Bengal’s positivity rate stood at 3.11 per cent.Chandigarh too has a high positivity rate of 4.36 per cent.The World Health Organisation (WHO) had advised governments in May that the positive confirmation rate should remain at five per cent or lower for at least 14 days. The states who do not meet this criteria are considered closer to the red zone.Goa, which though has a very low positivity rate, has seen it increase from 0.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent in the last one month, according to official data.The Goa government plans to expand the scope of Covid-19 testing in the state by designating special teams at the primary health centres and community health centres to collect samples of suspected coronavirus patients, health minister Vishwajit Rane has said.Currently, samples for Covid-19 testing are collected only at the district hospitals in Margao (South Goa) and Mapusa (North Goa), and the sub-district hospital in Ponda (North Goa).The number of Covid-19 positive cases in the state stand at 1,813.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-india-crosses-another-grime-covid-19-milestone-these-states-could-emerge-as-new-hotspots/story-2c26CuoqOWKjjY5VgHNjuO.html

The report came on Monday that suggested my father suffering from Covid-19. The Peoples Hospital called Chirayu Hospital, a Covid-19 designated private medical college’s hospital, for an ambulance to shift him there,” he said.“The ambulance came at around 5pm and took my father. I also left the place but later in the evening, I came to know that my father was abandoned by Chirayu Hospital ambulance back at People’s hospital. The carelessness of staff of both the hospitals led to the death of my father. I want strict action against them,” he said. Relatives of Covid-19 patients are not allowed to accompany them, he said.The administration of Peoples General hospital, where the patient was allegedly abandoned, blamed Chirayu Medical College and Hospital for the death. “The patient has been visiting the hospital for his dialysis for the past five years. He was referred to Chirayu Hospital after completing all the discharge formalities in an ambulance. After 20 minutes of discharge, the ambulance attendant called us that they are coming back and we should get ready to provide the man treatment at ICU,” Udayshankar Dixit, the Peoples Hospital’s manager said.“I asked him not to come back as we had already sealed our ICU as he was the first Covid-19 patient detected in our hospital for the safety of other patients. But instead of listening to us, they left the patient on a stretcher in the parking area. We arranged a PPE kit and provided the patient oxygen but he died,” said Dixit.When contacted, Chirayu Hospital’s director Dr Ajay Goenka denied the allegations as “baseless to say that patient was left abandoned in parking”. He said the man was in a critical condition due to renal failure and was also suffering from a heart ailment.“When a doctor from Peoples Hospital called us, our team of doctors inquired about the condition of the patient to send the ambulance accordingly but the doctor over the phone didn’t explain the condition. When the ambulance driver was taking the patient to Chirayu Hospital, he found that he was very critical and needed ventilator support,” Goenka said.He said the ambulance driver called the Peoples Hospital and asked them to attend to the man as Chirayu Hospital was 45 minutes away. “The ambulance driver urged the People’s Hospital to manage the patient for just 20 minutes till another ambulance from Chirayu equipped with a ventilator could reach there. First, the administration of Peoples Hospital refused to take the patient back. Later, it provided oxygen and CPR. When our second ambulance reached there the patient was found dead,” Goenka said.As the photo and video of the man lying in the parking area went viral on social media, Zameel Khan, a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), reached the hospital and shifted the body to a morgue. SDM Khan said tough action will be taken against whoever is found responsible for the man’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhopal-covid-19-patient-dies-family-alleges-he-was-left-unattended-in-private-hospital-s-parking-lot/story-0AcVdHR9VIGMRw7bzZUrqM.html

Backing the ban, he had said these apps could sometimes “serve as appendages of the CCP’s surveillance state”“India’s Clean App approach will boost India’s sovereignty,” he had added.The spokesperson did not explain the “costs”, but in recent days, the United States has announced the end of export of controlled defense equipment to Hong Kong over the new Chinese national security law that western powers have said is violative of China’s international commitments. And Trump has signed into law a bill that sought to impose sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the repression of Uighur minorities.The president and allies in Congress have also talked about holding China accountable for the spread of the coronavirus by billing it the damages caused to the US economy.Also read: For Ladakh stand-off, how India readied its fleet of Apache attack choppersJosh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri state, moved a resolution in March that sought to hold China “accountable” for the pandemic and “design a mechanism for delivering compensation from the Government of the People’s Republic of China to all affected nations for the harm caused by its decision to hide the emergence and spread of COVID–19 during the initial weeks of the outbreak”.Missouri has already filed a lawsuit against China for damages.Support for India in its recent border confrontation with China has been growing.

During the last 24 hours, 15,515 patients have been cured.The number of recovered patients is more than the 259,557 active cases of Covid-19. This takes India’s recovery rate to 61.13%.The health ministry has also said that the national positivity rate, the percentage of samples testing coronavirus positive from the total number of samples, is 6.73% while many states have reported lower.“As part of the coordinated efforts, the Union government has emphasized on increasing testing, prompt contact tracing and timely clinical management of the cases. It has also helped the States to significantly ramp up testing capacities. This has resulted in reduced positivity in the country. Currently, the national positivity rate stands at 6.73%,” it said on Monday.It added that in Delhi, the efforts being made by the UT were significantly bolstered by the Centre to ensure an increase in testing.“As a result of concerted and focused efforts by Government of India to augment efforts, the average number of samples being tested per day which was only 5481 (1st-5th June 2020) has witnessed a huge increase to reach an average of 18,766 samples per day between 1st to 5th July 2020,” it said.Delhi’s positivity rate has seen a substantial decrease from about 30% to 10% in the last three weeks.Maharashtra remains the worst-affected state with 211,987 cases, including 9,026 deaths. Tamil Nadu is second with 114,978 cases, including 1,571 deaths, and Delhi is third with 100,823 cases, including 3,115 deaths.The national capital is the worst-affected metro city in the country.The health ministry said on Monday that the number of tests to detect the coronavirus disease has crossed the 10 million milestone. “This signifies the importance accorded to widespread testing and the focussed ‘Test, Trace, Treat’ strategy with several follow-up measures taken in tandem by the Central government and the States/UTs,” it said.It said on Monday that 346,459 samples had been tested in 24 hours and that the cumulative number of samples tested as of now is 1,01,35,525.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-over-22-000-new-covid-19-cases-and-467-deaths-india-s-tally-at-7-19-lakh/story-UoecdgkhBOs7mDIMwEM6WK.html

Dr Amonkar was also the ex-president of the Goa unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Dr Amonkar, 68, was found positive on June 22 and admitted to the state’s dedicated Covid-19 hospital but his condition deteriorated in the following days and he succumbed to the infection on Monday.“Deeply saddened by the passing away of Dr. Suresh Amonkar, former President of BJP Goa Pradesh and Former Cabinet Minister of Goa Govt. His contribution to the state of Goa is immense and will never be forgotten. I express my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family,” Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant tweeted. “Shocked with the unfortunate demise of my close friend, former Health Minister Dr. Suresh Amonkar. I shared a close bonding with him. He lived with sincerity and Honesty in his personal, professional, political & social career. My condolences to his family. May his soul rest in peace,” Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat said. Dr Amonkar was a two-term MLA, being elected to the Goa Assembly in 1999 and 2002, as well as served as minister in the first Manohar Parrikar cabinet in 2000 as a minister of health.

07-07-2020||India||Odisha’s Covid-19 positivity rate crosses national average, Opposition leaders attack state government over testing||As Odisha’s Covid-19 positivity rate went past the national average of 6.73% and more and more hospitals turned Covid hotspots, Opposition leaders accused the state government of failing to control the pandemic by not increasing its daily testing.On Monday, Odisha reported 456 new cases from the 4,827 samples tested indicating a positivity rate of 9.44 per cent, a sharp departure from positivity rate of 4-6 per cent that it reported till July 1. The total number of positive cases in the state shot up to 9,526 and the number of fatalities stand at 38. There are close to 3,000 active cases in the state.For the third day on Monday, the number of local cases was more than 30 per cent of the total suggesting onset of community transmission. Among the positive cases reported was a BJP MLA, a 70-year-old priest attached to one of the prominent temples in Dhenkanal town, two doctors and a pharmacist working at a community health centre of Ganjam district. The MLA is the first legislator in Odisha to get infected by Covid-19.The rise in cases came even as Opposition Congress and BJP slammed the state government for falling tests. Senior Congress leader Santosh Singh Saluja said the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in Odisha would have been more than 1 lakh had the state government done more testing. “Had all migrant workers who returned from Maharashtra and Gujarat been tested for Covid-19, then we would have known the actual spread of the disease. The government is just picking and choosing few infected people from a large number of people already infected,” said Saluja.The general secretary of BJP’s Odisha unit Golak Mahapatra alleged that the state government has miserably failed in scaling up the daily tests to 15,000 resulting in the current situation. “Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in April had announced that the government would conduct 15,000 Covid-19 tests a day in June. It’s already July, and we are testing arund 4,000-5,000 samples a day,” said Mahapatra.Referring to Delhi, Mahapatra said increasing testing there brought the situation under control.BJP’s another general secretary Prithviraj Harichandan also raised questions over the Covid-19 management by the state government saying it had become more bureaucratic which is not yielding any result. “Over last month, we have seen weekly shutdowns. Has it helped bring down the numbers? The state government has just no clue about the spread of the virus,” said Harichandan.Meanwhile, a Covid-19 positive person escaped from a hospital in Nabarangpur district by scaling the boundary wall. Nabarangpur district collector Ajit Kumar Mishra said the 50-year-old who was brought to the Covid-19 hospital on July 3, went missing on the morning of July 5. “The patient was missing when the hospital staff went to offer him breakfast. A police complaint has been lodged,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-s-covid-19-positivity-rate-crosses-national-average-opposition-leaders-attack-state-government-over-testing/story-g3nPVccwb0t52WYERjTk8H.html
07-07-2020||India||PM must apologise for remarks made at all-party meet on June 19: Congress||The Congress on Monday lauded the Indian army for “pushing back” Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh but demanded an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his June 19 remarks at the all-party meeting that no one had entered Indian territory or occupied any Indian post.“Our brave army has been trying to push Chinese army back and we are very happy to see reports that we have succeeded. We are proud of our army...,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera told a virtual news conference. Prime Minister Modi stated at an all-party meeting last month that neither anyone is present in the Indian territory nor is any Indian post captured by the Chinese.The Congress said Modi’s stand contradicted past remarks by defence minister Rajnath Singh and foreign minister S Jaishankar on Chinese intrusion.“What we are worried about is the PM’s comments that he made at the all-party meeting where he said that ‘No one has entered our territory or occupied any of our post’... The Prime Minister should use this opportunity come out and address the nation, take the country into confidence and apologise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-must-apologise-for-remarks-made-at-all-party-meet-on-june-19-congress/story-seHwgfuKNxKJeuuaTULYhP.html
07-07-2020||India||Phone call at 8.45 am, then a video call: The backstory of the PLA’s pullback||India will adopt a cautious approach, cognizant of the risk of an “accident”, to the limited withdrawal by China’s People’s Liberation Army soldiers who had set off the stand-off at four locations in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley and Pangong Lake. PLA has started troop withdrawal from the stand-off sites at three locations in the Galwan Valley and is in the process of dismantling some structures on Finger 4, one of the eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range that overlooks the Pangong Lake.The troop pullback till Monday evening was thinner, and slower at Finger 4 than the other locations, said an Indian military commander. “We need to keep track of the movements at Pangong Tso to arrive at any firm conclusion,” he said.The army officer said PLA had been at a disadvantage in Galwan, Gogra and Hot Springs in terms of their military positions. In Pangong Tso, however, the situation favoured the Chinese since they had built a road up to Finger 4, he said.Officials said the disengagement process was likely to be a gradual and calibrated process by both sides, with each point being negotiated by the military commanders on the ground.China was the first to start thinning its troops at the site of the June 15 bloody clash that killed soldiers on both sides. Local army commanders quickly relayed the information to their superiors once they were able to establish a trend.At just about 8.45am on Sunday, Indian Army chief General MM Naravane picked up the phone to inform defence minister Rajnath Singh. Diplomats from the two countries touched base and by evening, they had fixed a quick video conference between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and China’s foreign minister Wang Yi.The conversation went on for about two hours. There were disagreements on who was to blame for the stand-off and the June 15 violence. But they had arrived at agreements on many points. Doval told Wang that Beijing would need to restore the patrolling rights of the Indian army on these four points to ensure peace and tranquillity along the 1,597km Line of Actual Control (LAC).Also read: For Ladakh stand-off, how India readied its fleet of Apache attack choppersAnalysts insist that the litmus test of the success of the Doval-Wang conversation would be the restoration of the Indian patrolling rights on the north banks of the Pangong Lake.Indian officials said the military buildup in the depth areas on both sides of the LAC would continue till the situation at the stand-off points did not settle down. India had mobilised thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, attack helicopters, tanks and artillery guns to respond to the Chinese mobilisation.It was during the disengagement process that violence broke out on June 15, the worst clash between soldiers of the two countries in 45 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phone-call-at-8-45-am-then-a-video-call-the-backstory-of-the-pla-s-pullback/story-3BCkWhrHqLa36tzh7c9xFO.html
07-07-2020||India||For Ladakh stand-off, how India readied its fleet of Apache attack choppers||India fast-tracked delivery of the last batch of the US-built Apache attack choppers after the May 5 stand-off with China in eastern Ladakh to be able to ramp up their presence along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The last batch of five choppers arrived in India last month after the central government exempted Boeing contractors from the mandatory quarantine rules notified due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The team assembled the five choppers that had been shipped to India and quickly had them flown to the Pathankot air base after being flight-tested for deployment in Ladakh.“The military wanted to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. And it was,” a top government official told Hindustan Times on Monday.India had last year inducted 17 of the 22 AH-64 Apache choppers ordered from Boeing that can track 128 targets, prioritise threats and engage 16 targets. The remaining five were to arrive in India by the end of March. But the plan to ship the choppers had to be halted due to the nationwide lockdown enforced in India due to the coronavirus pandemic.India was taken by surprise in early May when China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers adopted an aggressive posture, setting up a stand-off at four locations in eastern Ladakh. As it became clear that the stand-off was probably directed from Beijing, New Delhi started preparing for all eventualities.Over the next few days and weeks, the air force started moving its assets such as the Apache choppers and the 15 heavy-lift Chinook choppers to airbases closer to Jammu and Kashmir.Simultaneously, it also reached out to Boeing to indicate its ability to receive the shipment. Special visas were arranged and formal orders exempting the contractors who would re-assemble the choppers from the mandatory quarantine rule was issued on grounds of national security. By 1 June, the Home Ministry allowed visas to foreign technical specialists travelling for installation, repair and maintenance of foreign-origin equipment.The induction of the two aerial platforms acquired in a $3 billion deal is a game-changer for the Indian military which otherwise relied on Russian Mi-17 medium lift helicopters for rapid induction of forces and an obsolete squadron of Russian Mi-26 helicopters.The Chinook helped the military transport troops, artillery, equipment, and fuel to forward bases. The AH-64 Apache choppers, described by some as the Ferrari of attack choppers, was one of India’s primary counter to Chinese threats on the ground and in the air. Because they have an amazing maneuverability, the Apache is designed to operate in “nap-of-the-earth” flight - that is flying at an extremely low level and using terrain and vegetation to hide from hostile elements.Counted among the deadliest flying machines, the Apache has a 30mm cannon under the nose that can fire 1,200 rounds in less than two minutes. It can also carry 80 rockets besides Hellfire missiles that can identify, track and hunt targets in the dark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-ladakh-stand-off-how-india-readied-its-fleet-of-apache-attack-choppers/story-ozj3NiqeSQw0jA2AGebqwI.html

The police said that the pen was stolen from a professor’s house by Vishal Kumare, who was proudly showing it off.“About half a dozen thefts were committed in Masjid Chowk, Babu Chowk, Suyog Colony and Kalapatha areas in the past six months or so in which thieves stole two wheelers, laptops, mobile phones and other valuables but we were not getting any clue about the criminals. Only recently we came to know through our informers about one Vishal Kumare, a resident of Gyaraspur area who was flaunting a costly pen which hardly suited his personality given his education and background,” said Ganj police station in charge SS Solanki. Kumar is a school dropout.The police officer added that the police kept a watch on Kumare and he was finally arrested on Sunday. “During questioning he confessed to have committed about half a dozen thefts along with his accomplices including a theft committed at Prof BR Khatarkar’s house on June 26 from where they had stolen the pen besides a two wheeler and a laptop. Though the pen looked costly, the professor couldn’t tell about its price as it had been gifted to him by a student,” said Solanki.Kumare’s arrest also led the police to his accomplices.Solanki said that others who were arrested include Sanjay Parte, Umesh Kumare and a minor boy. The police recovered from their possession three two-wheelers, one bike, laptops, mobile phones and the pen. Umesh is said to be the mastermind behind the gang’s operation. Solanki also said that the accused men may have committed other thefts too that will be revealed during interrogation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-arrest-man-flaunting-costly-pen-gang-of-thieves-busted/story-QnJocA7BUe264lY8jOxy7J.html

Maxwell agreed to the remote hearing and the date in a letter to the judge late Monday.Maxwell, who is being held in a federal jail in New York City, was arrested in New Hampshire on Thursday on charges including conspiracy and enticing minors to engage in sex. She is currently at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, said Justin Long, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.Maxwell had rarely been seen in the past year since Epstein’s arrest on charges of sex trafficking in minor girls. In a brief hearing Thursday, she said she wouldn’t fight her move to New York.In a letter to the court late Sunday, prosecutors and Maxwell’s lawyers proposed a schedule that included her submitting a bail request on Thursday and appearing at a hearing Friday. Maxwell was living in a million-dollar home in Bradford, New Hampshire, when she was arrested. Prosecutors say she is a flight risk and have said they will fight any bail proposal.The Brooklyn jail has been criticized as having terrible conditions for its female detainees. US Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak called the conditions there “unconscionable” in 2016. In addition, it has had five inmates and six employees with confirmed cases of Covid-19, according to the lockup’s website.The US attorney’s office in Manhattan, where the case is, responded to requests for comment.Maxwell isn’t in the jail where Epstein was found dead last year, ruled a suicide.

The current West Bengal government has not only ruined education in the state, manufacturing and trade has also been severely affected. For the sake of the country and West Bengal Dr Mukherjee resigned from a position of power, however to the current government in West Bengal only posts matter,” Nadda said.“The state government has adopted the policy of appeasement and violence in the state. It is not even cooperating with the Centre in the fight against the corona pandemic...”Saugata Roy, TMC’s veteran Lok Sabha member, said, “Shyama Prasad never had a deep political base in Bengal...While he enjoyed respect because of being the son of Sir Asutosh Mookerjee, Shyama Prasad was never a freedom fighter and never went to jail.”“BJP is projecting him because it does not have an icon In Bengal. The state’s real icons, such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Tagore, Chittaranjan Das and others spoke of Hindu-Muslim unity and not Hindutva. Nadda does not know the history of the state,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-impediment-to-growth-says-bjp-chief-jp-nadda/story-yPGi92jQspKN2FZ9O2tepI.html
07-07-2020||India||Delhi riots: Court seeks status report on pleas for FIR against Kapil Mishra||A city court has issued notices to the police seeking a status report after three residents of northeast Delhi filed pleas to register FIRs (first information reports) against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra and his associates over their alleged role in inciting communal violence in the area in February, according to the complainants, their lawyer and court records.The residents have alleged the BJP leader was not booked despite their police complaints against him in late February and early March. They approached the Karkardooma court under Section 156 (3) of the code of criminal procedure (CrPC), which empowers the court to direct the police to file an FIR.The court asked the police to respond to two petitions filed in March. Hearing in these cases was affected due to the lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease. The first petition, filed on March 12, is expected to heard on July 20. The second, filed on March 18, will be taken up on August 13. The third petition was filed on Saturday (June 4). No date has been fixed for its hearing.In their response to HT, the Delhi Police said they “meticulously” followed up on all complaints and probed them, stressing that “no discrimination has been made on grounds of community, caste or faith” in a free and fair investigation. Mishra said “some forces” that want to divert attention from the truth are trying to “fabricate false complaints” against him and the Delhi Police.The Delhi Police have filed around 750 FIRs in connection with the riots between Hindus and Muslims that killed 53 persons and left 400 others wounded over four days (February 23-26). An FIR is the first step in launching a formal police investigation.In his court application, accessed by HT, one petitioner who asked not to be named said he was at his godown in Karawal Nagar around 4.30pm on February 24 when Mishra’s men attacked him. This person, who was the first of the three to approach the court, said he filed a police complaint on February 25.Mohammad Jami Rizvi, another complainant and a resident of Yamuna Vihar, said he filed a police complaint on February 23 against Mishra. “We have now approached the Karkardooma court. I know many other complainants on whom pressure is being built to either withdraw the complaint or remove names of Mishra and his men from their complaints,” Rizvi said.The third complainant, who approached the court on Saturday, said she filed a police complaint on May 5. Advocate Mahmood Pracha, counsel for all three complainants, claimed the police did not even file any status report in any of these complaints.Six other residents of northeast Delhi, who have not approached the court have also alleged that their houses and shops were robbed and vandalised by Mishra’s men, according to their complaints in four police stations — Jafrabad, Usmanpur, Gokalpuri and Karawal Nagar —between March 12 and April 29. They have alleged that police did not register an FIR. HT has seen the complaints.On February 23, Mishra visited the Jafrabad metro station and held protests against those who blocked the road (anti-Citizenship Amendment Act, or anti-CAA, demonstrators) that runs underneath the metro station. Mishra demanded that the police remove anti-CAA protesters within three days. The Delhi Police, in their charge sheets, have acknowledged that two groups of pro-CAA and anti-CAA protesters clashed at Jafrabad at the start of the riots. They did not mention Mishra’s name.Mishra told HT that even legal experts have said there was nothing wrong in what he said that day. “What I said is captured in video, and everyone has seen that video (on social media)...Now that the entire conspiracy of Delhi riots is exposed, people such as Tahir Hussain, Khalid Saifi, Shahrukh, Safoora Zargar, and Sharjeel Imam, and the role of Pinjra Tod (a students’ group) are under the scanner,” he said, referring to people held in connection with the riots. He alleged that the violence began in Delhi at the Jamia Millia Islamia in December.“The truth of Delhi riots is out; how long they have planned, their funding and why they especially chose the days of [US President] Donald Trump’s visit [in February-end]; everything is exposed already. I am the only one who actually went out and assisted riot victims, and if you go on ground, you will hear the reality from people,” Mishra said.A Delhi Police spokesperson said a case has been registered at Khajuri Khas police station regarding the incident referred to by the first complainant. He confirmed that the department received court papers on March 18, but also said no complaint was received by the Khajuri Khas police from the first person. However, the matter is being investigated.Responding to Rizvi’s complaint, the official said he gave a wrong address and was not available on phone. “The enquiry has not revealed an iota of truth in his complaint. The allegations laid down by Rizvi are outrightly and vehemently denied..,” he said. “The matter is also under judicial scrutiny in court and necessary action will be taken as per the outcome and directions of the court.”Allegations in the third complaint, too, were found to be “vague, concocted, false and baseless”, the spokesperson said. Senior Advocate Rebecca John, who has represented some of those accused of the Dehi riots (by the police) in the Delhi high court, said the law laid down by the Supreme Court is clear, and the police have no option but to register an FIR if a complaint discloses the commission of a cognisable offence.“If after investigation, the police find the complaint to be false, they have the option of filing a closure report. But that closure report will also be scrutinised judicially and the magistrate need not agree with the view taken by the police. But by not registering an FIR in this first instance, police are avoiding an investigation into cognisable offences mentioned in the complaint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-court-seeks-status-report-on-pleas-for-fir-against-kapil-mishra/story-uBgmdlv2F91IxNEzgHXIeL.html

Covid19. 2. Demonetisation.3. GST implementation,” Gandhi tweeted.Gandhi’s attack came a day after India surpassed Russia to become the third worst-hit nation by the Covid-19 pandemic. He also took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi by posting a video clip of the remarks that the Mahabharata war was won in 18 days and the battle against coronavirus will take 21 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-takes-fresh-dig-at-centre-over-rising-coronavirus-infections/story-WbDeFhdJ3iEUY4kvEQTrZN.html
07-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Till Sunday, July 5, India tested 9.79 million people (9,790,387 to be precise – excluding repeat tests) for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). That translates into 7,531 tests per million (taking India’s population as 1.3 billion). India’s Covid-19 dashboard on Sunday night read: 697,284 cases, 19,700 deaths, and 424,596 recoveries. That translates into a positivity rate of 7.12% overall, a case fatality rate of 2.82%, and a recovery rate of almost 61%.But the number of daily cases has been on the rise (as has the number of deaths). On Sunday, 24,422 cases and 421 deaths were recorded. The average number of cases registered last week was 21,180; the average number of deaths, 460. The positivity rate on July 5 was 13.52%; the average positivity rate for the past week was 9.43% (which is a better measure; testing in India seems to fall off on Sundays). Still, given that the positivity rates of the past week have been higher than those overall, there’s clearly some increase, although this is not necessarily a bad thing – as this writer has previously pointed out, positivity rates increase with testing up to a point, then plateau, and finally start decreasing with more testing (as is happening in Delhi). Sure, the system can be gamed (and some Indian states are definitely guilty of this) by going slow on tests, although no one gains in the long term from this.Also read| Keep toll low, suppress Covid-19 transmission: Centre to statesDelhi and Tamil Nadu have been aggressive in testing, and the results are evident – Delhi has actually seen the number of daily cases begin to fall from their June peaks, although they are still high (on Sunday, for instance, 2,244 new cases were recorded in Delhi) and experts are beginning to speak of the city entering a long plateau in terms of cases; Tamil Nadu has seen the number of cases increase (4,150 new cases on Sunday alone), but has managed to keep its positivity rate in the 7-12% band, and lower than previous peaks, indicating adequate testing. The big difference between Tamil Nadu and Delhi is that the latter is carrying out antigen tests, which are administered indiscriminately in so-called containment zones (which means anyone in a containment zone can get tested, not just those who meet the Indian Council of Medical Research’s stringent criteria for testing). Last week, the central government asked states to roll out antigen testing, pretty much on the same basis that Delhi has. This is a good move, and may finally mean India starts testing adequately.Which brings us to the original question: How does one define adequate testing?Russia has so far tested close to 16% of its population, according to worldometers.info. The US has tested 11%, and the UK 15%. India has tested 0.8% of its population. Even Brazil has tested 1.5%. And China, with a population higher than India’s, has tested 6% of its population.India’s policymakers and politicians have been happy to cite per capita statistics to show how India has managed the pandemic well, but point to the country’s size and population when its low testing number is highlighted. If China (the world’s most populous nation) and the US (the world’s third most populous nation) can test 6% and 11% of their population, India can surely do better than 0.8%?Also read: Man infected with Covid-19 kills himself at Delhi hospitalSo, what should India’s target be, when it comes to tests?India should aim for 50 million tests (which would mean testing a little less than 4% of the population).India has increased its testing capacity manifold – but the most tests it has carried out in a single day in the past few weeks is a quarter of a million. Is there a way to increase this to a million? For that would mean hitting the 50 million tests target by August 15.This is the kind of challenge and deadline I’d like to see ICMR set for itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-KDINlXVJ3G9tStgwBkwrXP.html

He has not been named as an accused but figures in the charge-sheet for being in touch with Davinder Singh and terrorists through WhatsApp and other platforms.“Devender Singh was in touch with certain officials of Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi through secure social media platforms. Investigation revealed that he was being groomed by Pakistani officials for obtaining sensitive information,” said Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sonia Narang, NIA Spokesperson in a statement.Apart from Singh, the charge sheet named Hizbul’s commander in Shopian and Qazigund Syed Naveed Mushtaq, alias Naveed Babu; and other HM terrorists Irfan Shafi Mir, Rafi Ahmad Rather, Tanvir Ahmed Mir and Babu’s brother Syed Irfan Ahmad. Singh was arrested by J&K police on January 11 this year at a check-post in Qazigund while he was taking Babu, Irfan and Rafi in his i20 car.The agency stated in its charge-sheet that Davinder Singh had provided safe passage to Babu and his brother in February 2019 as well in his Scorpio car. The agency recovered an AK-47 rifle from his car, a Chinese pistol from his house along with ammunition and some phones which he used for communication with terrorists and Pakistan high commission officials.Sonia Narang said in the statement: “Investigation has revealed that Pakistan based leadership of Hizb-ulMujahideen (HM) namely Syed Salahudin, Amir Khan (Deputy Chief), Khursheed Alam (Operational Head), Nazar Mehmood (Financial Head) and others along with Pakistani establishment is extending support to the cadre and commanders of outfit in Jammu & Kashmir.”The agency said that Irfan Shafi Mir was a key person in the case as he had been to Pakistan four times since 2016 and met Syed Salahuddin.“Irfan Shafi not only met HM leadership in Pakistan but also met Umar Cheema, Ahshan Chaudhary, Sohail Abbas and others of ISI {Inter-Services Intelligence} of Pakistan and he was tasked to identify and activate the new hawala channels for transfer of money for sustaining terrorist activities in Kashmir valley. Investigation also revealed that certain officials of Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi were in constant touch with Irfan Shafi and he was provided with funds to organize seminars in J&K to mobilize the masses against the Indian government. He also used to receive instructions and money from Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi and also facilitated the visa applications for number of Kashmiris for their visit to Pakistan,” Narang added.She added that Naveed Babu, a former constable of J&K police who deserted the force, was responsible for various killings in which labourers and truck drivers were killed after the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K in August last year that divested the state of its special status.“Naveed Babu had made efforts to recruit gullible Muslims youths to join cadre of HM. He was also receiving funds from LoC traders and accused Tanveer Ahmad Wani (who was an Ex-President of LoC traders Association), was providing him funds with the help of other traders based in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK).

07-07-2020||India||Anger after firm assesses own project in Arunachal Pradesh||On June 25, the environment ministry asked the Arunchal Pradesh state government to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the controversial Etalin hydropower project, and also offered to help. The state has since submitted the analysis -- done, not by it but by the developer of the project, Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited . Expectedly, the analysis found the project beneficial. And environmentalists are protesting the conflict of interest in getting a project’s developer to effectively decide on the future of the project.  The 3,097-megawatt project being developed in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang valley entails the loss of 270,000 trees at the junction of the Paleo-arctic, Indo-Chinese, and Indo-Malayan biogeographic regions with luxuriant forests. After environmentalists protested the loss of habitat that te project would entail, the environment ministry called for the analysis to be conducted by the state government . A cost-benefit ratio analysis is a process of working out the best return on an investment based on the costs, resources and risks involved in a project. Guidelines framed in 2017 for such an analysis state that ecological and environmental losses and distress caused to the people who are displaced are weighted against economic and social gains.Senior officials of Arunachal Pradesh’s forest department said they submitted the analysis done by Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture between the Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited, to the Union environment ministry.“The project proponent...has made a cost-benefit analysis which has been sent to the ministry. We haven’t conducted the analysis,” admitted RK Singh, principal chief conservator of forests, Arunachal Pradesh.The Etalin Hydropower Project will involve clearing at least 270,000 trees in sub-tropical evergreen and rain forests in a vital tiger habitat, according to a fact sheet prepared by the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC).In a letter addressed to principal secretary (forests), Arunachal Pradesh dated June 25 (available on the environment ministry’s Parivesh website) the environment ministry asked the state government to submit a cost-benefit ratio analysis and told that the regional office of the ministry in Shillong would assist with the analysis. The state government was also asked to examine all the representations (attached with the letter) thoroughly, take “concrete action” on the matter and submit its response to the ministry.The ministry also asked the Arunachal government to review if trees marked for felling could be left untouched.“The area is rich in bird life (230 species recorded by WII, or Wildlife Institute of India). State government will, therefore, review if trees marked for felling could be left as such, at least in the reservoir area, as dried trees could also be used as bird habitat,” the letter said.Hindustan Times hasn’t seen the cost-benefit analysis.A spokesperson for Jindal Power said in response to queries from HT: ”As desired by Arunachal Pradesh state government, a cost-benefit analysis report was submitted, which was as per guidelines framed by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change. As per the Analysis, the project is definitely beneficial to all the stakeholders like local population / state government / government. of India,”“We expect the cost-benefit ratio analysis to be done by the state government. If not completely, they should be involved in the process. If the state government is satisfied with project developer doing the analysis, we have nothing to say,” said a senior environment ministry official who is communicating with the Arunachal Pradesh government. “We haven’t received the analysis or responses on our queries yet from the state government,” he added, requesting anonymity.The environment ministry, on the recommendation of the FAC, specifically asked the Arunachal Pradesh state government and the regional office of the ministry of environment, forest & climate change in Shillong to submit a “revised” cost benefit analysis in line with the latest guidelines, said Parvish Pandya, director, conservation and science, Sanctuary Nature Foundation which focuses on wildlife and nature conservation.The foundation submitted its representation to the environment ministry citing several concerns with the project.“Jindal, the project proponent, has no role in this process. For a project of this scope and impact it is crucial that this directive is followed, and the previous report prepared by the project proponent is not recycled,” Pandya added.Anoko Mega, a member of the Arunachal Pradesh Wildlife Advisory Board, has also sent a representation against the Etalin project to the National Tiger Conservation Authority. “I am very concerned for my region and my community—the Idu Mishmi people. Since we have many tributaries here, if we allow any large hydropower project, more companies will try to enter the area and use our land, rivers and forests. We are strongly connected to our forests. In my personal opinion the community will not allow any dams here,” said Mega.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anger-after-firm-assesses-own-project-in-arunachal/story-27N1uycoSraaVCpGN0p2gP.html
07-07-2020||India||Pickle hub bears pandemic brunt, prepares for long haul||Pickle manufacturers in Panipat, one of India’s largest hubs, are unable to meet the rising demand following relaxation of curbs as the lockdown curtailed their activities from April to June, the main season for the manufacturing process.As many as 15 to 20 manufacturers said that they are facing at a crisis due to the exodus of migrants and restrictions on transport during the last three months. They said that procurement of fruit was hit due to the lockdown curbs and they have been left unprepared to meet the current demand, which has also put thousands of jobs at stake.They said it would take them a year to return to normalcy, due to challenges in meeting demands across the country, besides exports to the US, UK and other countries.“We depend on migrant labourers, as the locals are not willing to work. We had to shut production for more than two months as most of the workers had gone home for Holi and were unable to return due to the lockdown,” said Pankaj Dhingra, owner of Pachranga Foods.“We are facing labour and transportation problems as train movement remains restricted,” he said, adding that orders have started coming in from international customers.To deal with the situations, manufacturers demanded relief from 12% GST on their products, as workers and farmers working for the industry had been affected by the pandemic. “Pickles are like vegetables for the poor and taste boosters for the rich. Around 50% of our products are consumed locally and 50% is exported to other states and abroad,” said Jitender Juneja, owner of Popular Achar.Om Parkash, who has been in the pickle business since 1984, said government restrictions, including 12% GST, has hit manufacturers, forcing many out of business. “There are problems with raw material procurement as farmers do not sell their products directly to the manufacturers and we have to buy it from traders,” he said.Pickle outlets were also not receiving enough footfall. “Like dhabas, pickle outlets also remained closed for three months during the lockdown. Even now, though the eateries are open, no one stops to eat because of fears of contracting Covid-19,” said Rahul Dahiya, owner of a pickle shop on National Highway 44 near Gharaunda.Chhattardhari, who ran an outlet on Jattal Road in Panipat city and had 14 varieties of pickles in stock, including mixed, mango, lime, green and red chillies, amla, carrot, radish, turnip, onion and garlic, said buyers are yet to turn up. “My two sons are completing undergraduate studies. The younger one is in holding coaching classes in Kota, Rajasthan, as I am finding it difficult to pay their fees,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pickle-hub-bears-pandemic-brunt-prepares-for-long-haul/story-Kt3KfawV4Sj16PujQyn6JJ.html
07-07-2020||India||Some states opt for hard lockdown as coronavirus cases spike||At a time when most of India is in an Unlock phase, some states have selectively opted for a hard lockdown, confining residents indoors, shutting offices and commercial establishments and taking transport off the streets, to stanch the rising number of Covid-19 cases since restrictions began to be eased on June 1.The number of coronavirus disease cases in the country has almost quadrupled to 700,000 from 190,000 since the Unlock guidelines were enforced. Lockdowns were to continue in containment zones and hotspots until July 31, the Union home ministry said, allowing states to identify and demarcate such zones and impose fines on violators.Almost all activities except the opening of educational institutions, cinema halls and metro train services, have been allowed in the Unlock phase.On Monday, Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, went into what the state government said was a triple lockdown with almost all offices, shops and public transport closed. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan worked from his residence, Cliff House. And, at the state secretariat, only the offices of chief secretary, home and revenue secretaries were functional. “The situation is grim,” said Kerala tourism Minister Kadakkampally Surendran, adding that stringent restrictions will continue even after the week-long triple lockdown that was announced on Sunday ends.In the Thiruvananthapuram municipal corporation limits, 100 wards are fully closed and only essential services like banks, automated teller machines, pharmacies, hospitals, the media, milk booths, petrol pumps and gas agencies were functioning with minimal staff. Thiruvananthapuram deputy commissioner of police Divya Gopinath said cases would be registered and vehicles seized if people come out of their homes unnecessarily and violators of the restrictions would have to undergo institutional quarantine.The Kerala government had earlier imposed a triple lockdown in the northern Kasaragod and Kannur districts and in some parts of Malappuram to keep all Covid-19 patients and their primary and secondary contacts inside their houses to prevent community spread of the virus.Kerala’s coronavirus tally has crossed the 5,000 with 2,228 people under treatment and over 3,000 having recovered. On Sunday, the state reported 225 fresh cases, much fewer than several other small states such as Haryana, West Bengal and Odisha, but the government decided to impose a hard lockdown in the state capital, where half the new cases were reported.In Assam, the state government is set to extend the lockdown in the state capital of Guwahati, and the rest of Kamrup Metro district, as the number of Covid cases continue to rise. On Sunday, 777 new Covid-19 cases were reported, the single biggest spike in a day in the Kamrup Metro district, taking the district’s tally for 10 days (between June 24 and July 4) to 2,741 cases, nearly one-fourth the total 11,001 cases in the state.“We have to extend the lockdown in the district for another week as cases continue to rise,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. On June 28, the Assam government had imposed a 14-day hard lockdown in Kamrup Metro district, allowing only pharmacies to operate. States such as Odisha, Tripura and Karnataka have announced weekend curfews or hard lockdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, saw its first weekend curfew on June 5, which would continue till August 2, chief minister B S Yediyurappa announced on Sunday, while ruling out a complete lockdown in the state. All shops and business establishments except those selling essential goods and services are closed during the Sunday curfew. The weekend curfew in Odisha, which started on June 1, has been extended to 18 districts from an earlier 11 for the entire month of July as the number of Covid-19 cases in the state touched 10,000 on Monday. Around half the cases are locals, unlike in the months of May and June, when a majority of the cases detected were among migrant workers returning home from across the country.Some of the Odisha districts have added their own conditions to the shutdowns. In Dhenkanal district, the collector banned the entry of the devotees in various Shiva temples during the month of Shravan. In Koraput district, shops and business establishments can run between 7 am and 2 pm. Ganjam has banned non-essential vehicular movement till July 31. And the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation prohibited labourers belonging to hotspot states or districts from working in the industrial, construction, hotels/hospitality sectors till July 31.“The weekend curfews help us to ramp up collecting swabs and conducting rapid testing,” saida Odisha health department official who didn’t want to be named.Tripura’s capital city of Agartala has been under a weekend curfew since July 5. In an order, the state government has imposed 24-hour lockdown, which it says would continue on all Sundays in July.“Our state is in the Covid-19 stage I. We need to prepare for Stage 2 and 3,” Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb said in announcing the Sunday lockdown. Tripura has reported 1,559 Covid-19 positive cases, of whom 1,199 recovered. Manipur has also imposed a lockdown in Jiribam district, 220 km west of Imphal, till July 15 after 28 police personnel posted at a border check-post with Assam tested positive. Manipur chief secretary Dr J Suresh Babu said only essential services will be allowed. “Passenger coming by vehicles at Jiribam gate (from Assam) after the midnight of July 5 will not be allowed to pass and will be put in institutional quarantine at Jiribam,” Babu said. Jiribam district authorities have declared 17 areas as containment zones. Manipur has reported 1,625 Covid cases, of whom 667 have recovered.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-states-opt-for-hard-lockdown-as-cases-spike/story-yDK549ygghK9Q0pk4DofFP.html
07-07-2020||India||3 more cops suspended on suspicion of links to Vikas Dubey||Police in Uttar Pradesh suspended two sub-inspectors and a constable on Monday over suspicion that they leaked information of an operation targeting dreaded criminal Vikas Dubey, whose accomplices shot dead eight members of the team that went on the late-night raid to Bikru village near Kanpur city.Officials were also probing a purported report by deputy superintendent Devendra Mishra, killed in the failed raid on Thursday night, indicting another sub-inspector suspended earlier in the case over his alleged links with Dubey while also indicating that there could be a deep rot in the system.On another front, police intensified efforts to locate the hardened criminal and his men who escaped in the dark after the chilling 15-minute ambush. Officials put up posters with images of the 48-year-old Dubey at toll plazas amidst apprehensions that he had already left the state, and increased the bounty on him to Rs 2.5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh.“...as soon as he crosses any of these toll plazas, information on his whereabouts can be obtained...Some teams have also been sent to other states. We are expecting news soon,” Mohit Agarwal, Kanpur inspector general of police, said.Uttar Pradesh director general of police HC Awasthy said the police were conducting raids to track down Dubey, who faces 60 criminal cases. An alert has been sounded in all 75 districts of the state and 25 teams from 40 police stations were pressed into action.In Chaubeypur, where an attempt to murder case was registered against Dubey on Wednesday, sub-inspectors Kunwar Pal and KK Sharma and constable Rajeev were suspended over their suspected collusion with the gangster.“A preliminary enquiry has been initiated against the three suspended policemen,” Dinesh Kumar P, Kanpur’s senior superintendent of police, said.Officials believe that Dubey, an influential gangster whose criminal records date back to 1993, had supporters in the police force and that they helped him and his gang have a free run despite cases of murder, attempted murder and abduction against them.Daya Shankar Agnihotri, an aide of Dubey arrested on Sunday, has said in a video statement that a caller from a police station informed the gangster about the raid. Officials suspect that it could be the police station in Chaubeypur, about 14km from Bikru. The team that raided Bikru on Thursday night left from the police station there.Police also said they were investigating reports that Bilhaur circle officer Mishra, who led the raid team to Dubey’s village, told former Kanpur senior superintendent of police that Vinay Tiwari, the Chaubeypur station officer who was the first person to be suspended in the case, was protecting Dubey.

I have already spoken to you [SSP] about the criminal and the case,” a part of the purported report read.Local police officials who did not want to be named said Mishra regularly complained about Tiwari, and asked for a preliminary enquiry against him over his alleged links with Dubey.Tiwari has been suspended though officials have not specified the exact nature of allegations against him.

The strategies were discussed at meetings last week including an interaction between cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba and state officials, the people said on condition of anonymity.The Centre’s revised strategy to tackle Covid-19 comes at a time when India has overtaken Russia to the third position in the tally of cases, behind only the US and Brazil, and after a careful assessment of the experiences of states such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Haryana and the urban centre of Hyderabad, capital of Telangana.Also read: Thiruvananthapuram under triple lockdown as Kerala’s Covid-19 tally rises to 5,622The Centre has also pointed out that Delhi, which had a positivity rate—or number of positive cases per 100 tests—of 40% a month ago, has reduced to just 10% now. The Centre underlined that Delhi has also doubled its testing from 11,000 per day a month ago to daily 22,000 tests.The states have been told to ensure 72-hour surveillance of at least 80% of close contacts of Covid-19 patients, a measure that can go a long way in reducing the transmission and possibility of spread of the virus. From proper quarantine of suspected Covid-19 patients to setting a target of ensuring a positivity rate of less than 10%, the centre has set a series of doable tasks for the states. Gauba has also said that once the positivity rate declines to less than 5%, the states can feel they are in a comfort zone.All states have been told to conduct minimum of a 14 tests per 100,000 people.While Delhi’s Covid-19 management has improved after the Union home ministry stepped in last month, working out collaborative strategies at joint meetings with the state, a few other states have emerged as a big headache for the Centre.“Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the city of Hyderabad had seen transmission slowing down but again the outbreak gained pace. We have told the states that they initially did a good job but then lost some momentum,” said a senior official involved in the management of the outbreak.In two meeting with the cabinet secretary, lasting two hours each, examples of Kerala, Haryana and Tamil Nadu were given to other states to show how these states were able to keep the death rate or case fatality ratio around 1% or below.To improve the death rate, the Centre has asked states to improve the “speed to care” or speed up ambulance services and less triage time in the hospitals.Also read: Manipur’s recovered Covid-19 cases surpass active cases for 3rd straight day “We had asked states to do an assessment of how many people called for ambulances, how many were rejected and what time it took for the patient to reach hospital in an ambulance,” said another official, “and also ensure that when a patient reaches the hospital he or she should not spend more than 45 minutes in triage.” The states were also told it is critical to “smoothen transition points” which includes test confirmation to hospitalization to ambulance coordination.For suppressing transmissions, the Centre is referring to the detailed guidelines issued by the WHO such as the need for more effective contact tracing, better sealing of hotspots and antibody testing. It also include screening and triage for early recognition of suspected Covid-19 patients, and rapid implementation of source control measures, isolation and cohorting of patients suspected or confirmed to have been infected by the virus and standard precautions like the use of masks and sanitizers The states were also encouraged to hold teleconferences for local doctors with specialists or senior doctors of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and other top hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-toll-low-suppress-covid-transmission-centre-to-states/story-02HbUfjISA3V5L7UyLsYoO.html
07-07-2020||India||Delhi High Court cannot decide Navlakha’s bail plea: Supreme Court||New Delhi: The Supreme Court expunged on Monday scathing criticism of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) by the Delhi high court in connection with the bail application of Gautam Navlakha and set aside the high court’s order asking to examine documents used to transfer the jailed activist from Delhi to Mumbai last month. A bench of justices Arun Mishra and Navin Sinha said only courts in Mumbai, and not the Delhi high court, have the jurisdiction to decide Navlakha’s bail plea. The 67-year-old activist is currently in Mumbai’s Taloja jail facing charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for their alleged links with banned Maoist outfits. “The entire exercise taken by the high court of Delhi was totally uncalled for…..it was the jurisdiction of the Bombay court alone to entertain any application (of bail). The high court of Delhi should not have entertained the application at the threshold, the observations made are hereby ordered to be expunged,” the bench said in its order. “Since the respondent (Navlakha) has been moved to Bombay, he is at liberty to apply before the competent court in Bombay,” the order added.  Also read: European Parliament’s panel on human rights expresses concern at arrest of Indian activistsNavlakha, along with nine other activists, is wanted in connection with the violence that broke out in Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village on January 1, 2018. Police say the activists had Maoist links and fuelled clashes by giving inflammatory speeches at an event called Elgar Parishad held on December 31, 2017. Navlakha surrendered on April 14, after the top court’s order to the effect on April 8, and was taken to Mumbai by train on May 26. On May 27, the Delhi high court pulled up the NIA for taking away Navlakha from Tihar Jail to Mumbai even when his interim bail plea was pending here. Justice Anup Bhambhani had noted there was an “evident haste” shown by the NIA in moving pleas across Mumbai and Delhi over weekends and Gazetted holidays (Eid) and obtaining orders by e-mail, and “whisking away” Navlakha to Mumbai. The HC also sought to examine the documents produced by the agency in support of its production warrant from a special judge in Mumbai. During Monday’s proceedings in the SC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing the NIA, submitted that on May 22, the NIA apprised the Delhi HC that Navlakha will be taken back to Mumbai as soon as the lockdown is lifted. “We did nothing behind HC’s back,” Mehta said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Navlakha, told the apex court that the occasion to approach the Delhi HC arose after Navlakha took ill. Due to lockdown, Navlakha was lodged at Tihar Jail where he faced a high risk of contracting the coronavirus disease, said Sibal.The bench directed Sibal to seek all appropriate remedies before the competent court in Mumbai. Sibal objected to the remarks being expunged as the order was being set aside. But the court felt it necessary as the Delhi HC acted without jurisdiction.Also read- UAPA: When laws turn oppressive | OpinionIt is not routine for the top court to expunge remarks but it has occurred in many cases before.

Of them, 7.1 million did not know that they were infected, the report said.Around 1.7 million people were infected by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in 2019 alone, said the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (Unaids) report, adding that the progress in prevention, diagnosis and treatment was being impacted by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. About 2.8 million people were infected in 1998, when HIV/AIDS peaked.“The response could be set back further, by 10 years or more, if the Covid-19 pandemic results in severe disruptions to HIV services,” the report said. Till date, HIV has infected 75.7 million and 32.7 have died due to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)-related illnesses.In 2019, 690,000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses, and 12.6 million people with HIV were not on life-saving antiretroviral therapy used to treat HIV/AIDS.Also read: WHO halts hydroxychloroquine and combination of HIV drug trials among hospitalised Covid-19 patients“Stigma and discrimination and widespread inequalities are major barriers to ending AIDS...Every day in the next decade, decisive action is needed to get the world back on track to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030,” said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS.Around 62% of the new HIV infections in 2019 occurred among vulnerable sections and their sexual partners, including men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs and people in prison, despite them constituting a very small proportion of the general population.“This is the first time UNAIDS has admitted to a collective failure of countries and multinational agencies in failing to meet the 2020 targets. Countries have not focused enough on prevention, which has gone down. The increasing emphasis in treatment is needed but not at the cost of prevention in key vulnerable populations, who account for 62% of the new infections,” said JVR Prasada Rao, former health secretary and founder director of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).In India, there were 2.14 million people living with HIV at the end of 2017 (the last year for which data was released) with new infections rising in Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Uttarakhand, and declining in Nagaland, Manipur, Delhi and Chhattisgarh. Just eight states accounted for two-thirds of the 87,580 annual new HIV infections in India.Among high-risk groups in India, HIV incidence was the highest among injecting drug users compared to other high-risk groups such as female sex workers, and gay, lesbian, bisexual and tans people, according to NACO data.Also read: Sex workers lack food for taking HIV drugs during Covid-19“The global political shift towards the right has also exacerbated stigma and discrimination with some countries in Africa criminalising behaviours that reduce access to preventive services,” said Prasada Rao, who is also a former special envoy at UNAIDS. In 2019, funding for HIV was 30% short of the $ 26.2 billion needed to respond to HIV. Now, the Covid-19 pandemic has seriously impacted the AIDS response and there could be more disruptions.“We cannot take money from one disease to treat another. Both HIV and Covid-19 must be fully funded if we are to avoid massive loss of life,” said Byanyima.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-hit-hiv-treatment-un-report/story-gSubzpF4qniQ0MdNONiocN.html

The attachment of property in London is the first major overseas act by the investigative agency in the case , which deals with Kapoor’s alleged use of the bank to extend loans in exchange for “kickbacks” as detailed in ED’s May 6, 2020, charge sheet against Kapoor. The agency has identified that a company run by Kapoor’s daughter Rakhi Kapoor , Doit Creation Jersey Ltd, having investment of Rs 83 crore, has three properties in London including an office-cum-guest house at 77 South Audley Street, London worth 11.5 million British Pounds (around Rs 107 crore) and another residential property.Also read: Supreme Court dismisses anticipatory bail plea of DHFL promoters in Yes Bank money laundering caseWithout divulging details of the specific property under the scanner, one of the people cited in the first instance, an officer at the agency said: “One property in Central London will be attached next week under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), for which documentation is already done”.Kapoor’s lawyer Subhash Jadhav declined comment.The anti-money laundering probe agency has identified several expensive properties owned by Kapoor’s family and companies run by them including bungalows, villas, clubs, resorts, apartments, farmland, etc in Delhi, Mumbai, Goa, London, the US , the UK and other places worth several thousand crores, and the people cited in th first instance added that these may have been obtained with proceeds from kickbacks for loans given to undeserving companies.Three of these bungalows are in Delhi’s Lutyen’s Zone alone , 40 Amrita Shergill Marg (worth Rs 375 crore), 18 Kautilya Marg (Rs 195 crore) and 20 Sardar Patel Marg (Rs 175 crore) . Then there is 7.5 acres of prime beach-front land in Alibaug, near Mumbai. ED has already attached properties worth Rs 59 crore in India. “This will be first attachment abroad in Yes Bank scam. More will follow soon,” said the officer cited above.Both ED and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) have already filed chargesheets in May and June respectively against the founder of Yes Bank and his family members.While ED has claimed that Rana Kapoor used Yes Bank as his personal fiefdom to carry illegal activities over the years and that there was a poor credit culture, poor compliance culture, and centralization of power as well as lack of institutionalization in the bank.Also read: YES Bank asks court to restrain Zee stake sale“Rana Kapoor perpetrated the entire scam by firstly taking money out of Yes Bank under the garb of debentures and loans, by abusing his position in the bank and secondly, receiving kickbacks/gratification for the same,” ED’s chargesheet says. The agency has pegged the proceeds of crime at Rs 5,050 crore and says a complex web of at least 100 shell companies was used to channel this money. Loans worth around Rs 30,000 crore given under the tenure of Rana Kapoor (he co-founded the bank in 2004 and was MD-CEO till January 2019) have turned into bad loans and out of these, Rs 20,000 crore have become NPAs (non-performing assets), according to ED.CBI has claimed in its chargesheet last month that Rana Kapoor conspired with Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan of DHFL (Dewan Housing Finance Limited) for benefitting each other using public money.Kapoor is currently in Mumbai’s Taloja jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yes-bank-scam-ed-to-attach-rana-kapoor-s-central-london-property/story-oGAKkHQYaA3CxFu5N0uhMO.html
07-07-2020||India||Tirupati civic staff dumps body of Covid-19 victim in grave||Hyderabad Municipal staff of the temple town of Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district drew ire on social media after a video of them using an earth mover to dump a victim’s body into the grave went viral on Monday.The video showed sanitation staff of the Tirupati Municipal Corporation lifting the body of the Covid-19 victim using the earth mover and dumping it into an already dug pit in the graveyard. The body was that of a 50-year old man, a resident of a village on the outskirts of Tirupati, who was admitted to state-run Sri Venkateshwara Ram Narayan Ruia Hospitals last week. He died of Covid-19 on Monday.The municipal staff, wearing PPE and masks, brought the body in the ambulance belonging to Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) to Harischandra cremation ground. They pulled the body out of the ambulance and placed it on the ground. Then they used the earth mover to dump it in the grave.As the video was telecast by the local television channels, Tirupati municipal commissioner P S Girisha called a press conference to explain the action. “Generally, we cremate the bodies of Covid-19 victims in the electric crematorium. So far, we have cremated 17 bodies without any complaints,” he said.The body of this particular victim was also taken to the electric crematorium, said Girisha. “However, it was very heavy, weighing around 175-180 kgs, and tall; it did not fit on the pyre. As it was being lifted, the wrapping around the body got torn. As part of standard operating procedure, it was again taken to the hospital to be wrapped again,” he said.The municipal authorities then decided to give it a burial instead of cremation. As per the Covid-19 protocol, they had to dig a 14 ft-deep pit using the earth moving machine. “The municipal staff were exhausted as they had already carried the body three or four times. So, they had to use the earth mover to shift the body from the ambulance to the grave, hardly two metres away and bury the body. This was done only after taking the consent of the relatives of the deceased,” Girisha said.He, however, admitted that the municipal staff should not have used the machine to dump the body in such a disrespectful manner. “They should have engaged another five or six more workers to carry the body physically,” the municipal commissioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirupati-civic-staff-dumps-body-in-grave/story-iIRcd7WeaWKLKq3rUcDDOP.html
07-07-2020||India||Heavy rains lash Gujarat; flood situation improves in Assam||Heavy rains battered Gujarat, causing a flood-like situation, while in neighbouring Maharashtra the intensity of rains reduced on Monday, even as the flood situation improved in Assam, where one person lost his life in the deluge. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the monsoon remains “vigorous” and heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely in parts of Gujarat in the next three days and moderate rains in parts of Maharashtra.Due to heavy rainfall in Gujarat, a nearly 30-year-old bridge over a river in Junagadh district caved in, a local official said, adding that no one was injured.A team of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) was also deployed at the state’s Khambhalia town to meet rain-related exigencies in the area, officials said.Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan received light to moderate rainfall, while heavy rains lashed isolated places in these states.In Delhi, sporadic light rains kept the mercury in check and more precipitation is likely in the next few days. The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded 0.6 mm rainfall and a maximum of 36.2 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the year. The MeT Department has forecast light to moderate rains, thundershowers, and strong surface winds in Delhi on Tuesday. In Assam, one person was killed in the flood at Raha of Nagaon district, officials said.With this, the total number of people losing their lives in this year’s flooding and landslide has gone up to 62 across the state, of whom 38 people were killed by flood and 24 died due to landslides.According to the daily flood report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), over 3.86 lakh people are affected due to floods in Dhemaji, Sivasagar, Biswanath, Chirang, Nalbari, Barpeta, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, Goalpara, Kamrup, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat and Tinsukia districts.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and district administrations have rescued 128 people during the last 24 hours in two districts. After witnessing a spell of heavy rainfall over the past three days, Mumbai and neighbouring Thane in Maharashtra received moderate rains, but the IMD predicted showers will continue in the night in the region.According to the India Meteorological Department, the Santacruz weather bureau (in suburbs) recorded 5.2 mm rainfall, while the Colaba weather station, representative of the island city, reported 1.2 mm rainfall between 8:30 am and 5:30 pm. In eastern Uttar Pradesh, light to moderate rains occurred at many places while heavy showers lashed isolated places in the western parts in the last 24 hours, the Meteorological (MeT) Department said. Thundershowers accompanied by lightning is likely to occur at most places in the state over the next three days, it said.Weather in Punjab and Haryana remained pleasant as the maximum temperatures at both the places hovered close to normal limits.Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, recorded a maximum of 35.4 degrees Celsius.     A yellow weather warning was issued by the MeT Department in Himachal Pradesh for heavy rains, thunderstorm and lightning on July 9 and 10. The state witnessed light to moderate rainfall in several parts. Yellow, the least dangerous of all the weather warnings, indicates the possibility of severe weather over the next few days.Rajasthan received light to moderate rainfall in many parts, while heavy rains lashed isolated places in the state. Ghatol in Banswara district recorded the maximum rainfall of 8 cm during the 24 hours till Monday morning.Mundwa (Nagaur), Shergarh (Jodhpur) recorded 7 cm and 6 cm of rainfall, respectively, during this period.

07-07-2020||India||Bengaluru struggles to arrest spike in Covid-19 cases||On Friday, July 3, a resident of Bengaluru’s Hanumanthanagar neighbourhood, who had been running a fever and had breathing difficulties, collapsed in the middle of the road and died. His family had tried to get him admitted in seven different hospitals, all of which refused to take him in. After he died, his body lay on the road for the four hours it took an ambulance to finally reach. Incidents such as these are giving rise to a perception that after its initial success in curbing Covid-19, the Karnataka government has lost the plot in the battle against the pandemic, especially in Bengaluru.On Sunday, when medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar visited the Jayanagar General Hospital, patients narrated a litany of woes -- from the non-availability of an ambulance to arrive at the hospital to lack of hygiene, and from the poor quality of food to the time taken for Covid testing reports to be provided. Sudhakar admitted that there were issues and promised that 400 additional ambulances (two per ward for the 200 wards in Bangalore) would be provided. As cases mounted, private hospitals that promised to provide 2,734 beds have in fact provided only 116, he said. The minister warned of criminal cases against hospitals that do not provide treatment or turn away patients.A day earlier, Jayanagar MLA Sowmya Reddy, daughter of Congress politician Ramalinga Reddy, tweeted her anger at the government’s mismanagement of the situation. “On the phone calling hospital after hospital,”she wrote as she tried to help with a patient’s hospital admission. “They don’t respond/switched off, if they do they say no beds with oxygen/ICU..So angry..pathetic state of our healthcare.” She was a legislator and this was her experience, she pointed out. “Imagine plight of people who don’t have connections or strings to pull.”The state government’s response has been a mixture of denial and passing the buck. Since the first Covid-19 case in Karnataka was detected on March 8 – a software engineer who returned from the US – the government has been touting its “success” in containing the spread of the coronavirus disease as well as the low mortality rate in the state compared to other states of similar size.As recently as a month back - on June 6 – Bengaluru accounted for a mere 162 of the 3,184 active Covid-19 cases in Karnataka. It then had a mere 5% of the total cases in the state. On Sunday, the city’s tally of active cases was 8,167, accounting for more than 60% of all cases under treatment in the state.How did things spin out of control so quickly? Opposition parties allege gross incompetence and lack of coordination between various ministries. The health and welfare minister is B Sriramulu and medical education minister is K Sudhakar. After the two sparred, the chief minister was forced to nominate the primary and secondary education minister and one of the government’s most articulate spokespersons, Suresh Kumar, to brief the media and give daily updates on the statewide Covid-19 situation. Sriramulu and Sudhakar themselves were accused of violating quarantine norms. After announcing various relief packages, chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who saw that the treasuary was empty, decided to go full throttle in opening up Bengaluru by lifting lockdown regulations . A medical advisor to the Covid-19 taskforce who did not want to be identified said: “The pace at which the opening up of the city took place was probably too fast but the government had made up its mind.”Former Bellary MP and Congress spokesperson V S Ugrappa said a lack of coordination and one-upmanship between various ministers was one of the key reasons for things spinning out of control. “What was the government doing for the last three months? Were they sleeping? Why was infrastructure not put in place? Why are people dying waiting for ambulances and why are patients being turned away without treatment?”A senior official in the health and family welfare department who did not want to be identified said: “I think given the circumstances we have done a good job. The scale of the challenge is humongous. Yes, there might have been some lacunae which we are addressing but remember this is a situation without a precedent. Also, numbers went up as people also did not follow social distancing norms plus the testing has gone up, which all have led to the current situation. Things are under control and it is incorrect to paint a picture of it being otherwise.”On Saturday, as thousands jammed the highways leading out of Bangalore hoping to escape the city and the deadly spread of the virus, Vignesh Gowda, an auto -rickshawdriver who originally hails from Chennapatna, told HT: “I have a 3-year-old son and a wife. My younger brother tills some family land in Byrapatna. Instead of dying here, I would rather go back and take up agriculture until things improve.” A worried CM on Monday appealed to the people not to leave Bangalore. “There is no need to panic. Please cooperate with the government. We have added 10,000 more beds as well as 450 more ambulances and if required will add more. Unfortunately, we have to coexist with this situation as there is no solution for now. Your lives are important and the government is taking all measures to protect you.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/b-luru-struggles-to-arrest-covid-spike/story-uFwz2Ky5raypY6YXwk4GHN.html
07-07-2020||India||Govt flags concerns over issuing summons over WhatsApp chats||The central government told the Supreme Court on Monday that it has reservations about issuing court summons and serving notices to litigants over WhatsApp.Attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal, representing the central government, told the top court that service of notices and summons should be permitted through email and fax in view of Covid -19 ,but not through WhatsApp given that the messaging app does not allow the government to access data even in matters concerning terrorism and pornography.“Union government has reservations regarding WhatsApp. It does not allow (government to) access (data) in cases involving terrorism and pornography”, Venugopal told a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde.The submissions were made in a case relating to extension of the limitation period for filing cases. Limitation period is the deadline to file cases in any court or tribunal in the country. The limitation period is generally prescribed under the Limitation Act. It is also sometimes provided under special laws in certain cases.The Supreme Court had, on March 23, extended for an indefinite period, the limitation period to file cases in any court on tribunal amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The order was passed by the apex court in a suo motu (on its own) case initiated after taking into account the coronavirus threat and the resultant difficulties faced by litigants in approaching courts.The issue of service of summons and notice through WhatsApp came up on Monday during submissions by the central government requesting the apex court to pass further orders allowing summons and notice through email and fax.The matter was eventually adjourned for July 10.Certain high courts like the Bombay high court and Madras high court had allowed service of notice to parties via WhatsApp.The Delhi high court, after taking note of the spurt in coronavirus disease cases, issued a circular on June 9 allowing service of documents, notices and summons through WhatsApp, email and fax.The Bombay high court had, in 2018, held that the service of notices through WhatsApp was valid.AG Venugopal, however, said that the practice should not be allowed for the time being and pointed to a case which is pending before the Supreme Court on the traceability of messages sent over WhatsApp.He was referring to a case from Tamil Nadu involving WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in which the government has pressed for a decryption of messages on social media and messaging platforms in matters involving considerations of national security, law and order etc.That case had started before the Madras high court as a plea for linkage of social media accounts with Aadhaar. Subsequently, the Tamil Nadu government raised concerns about WhatsApp not cooperating with police probes in key cases, citing end-to-end encryption.The matter was transferred to the Supreme Court in October 2019 on a plea by Facebook in August 2019.WhatsApp has maintained that the original sender of a message cannot be tracked because of end-to-end encryption.“For Facebook and WhatsApp to say they cannot decrypt is not acceptable. A terrorist cannot claim privacy”, AG Venugopal told the court in October 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-flags-concerns-over-issuing-summons-over-whatsapp-chats/story-KhNsxKi5N3w073zBS0RNZL.html
07-07-2020||India||Assam wildlife sanctuary upgraded amid row over coal mining||The Assam government on Monday decided to upgrade the Dehing Patkai wildlife sanctuary into a national park amid a controversy over allowing coal mining inside its area.“Our government has decided to upgrade the Dehing Patkai wildlife sanctuary in Assam, which is home to a variety of flora and fauna, to a national park. In a meeting with senior officials today, I have directed them to take necessary steps in this regard,” chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal tweeted.Experts said the state government seemed to have taken the decision to placate public concerns ahead of next year’s assembly polls in the state. Proposed coal mining in wildlife habitats has evoked protests from locals. In April, the National Board of Wild Life (NBWL) had recommended coal mining to be allowed in a portion of the Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve provided it fulfilled 28 preconditions.Spread across 937 sq km, the Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve falls in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts and is located withinthe periphery of the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary, said to be the largest lowland tropical rainforest in India.NBWL allowed Coal India Limited (CIL) to conduct opencast coal mining in 98.59 hectares of the reserve forest. CIL had been carrying out mining in 57 hectares of the reserve and the fresh recommendation allowed it to mine coal in another 41 hectares.Besides elephants, leopards, hoolock gibbons, pangolins and bears, Dehing Patkai is also home to over 200 species of birds, various replies and many species of butterflies and orchids. The habitats of these species as well as the foraging routes of elephants are expected to be affected by coal mining.Following the NBWL move, opposition surfaced against the proposed coal mining. The Assam government also sent forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya to visit the site in May and he held out an assurance that there would be no compromise in protecting the state’s forests and biodiversity.Although the NBWL recommendation was passed in April, a right to information (RTI) query revealed that mining in the area had been underway even before the approval came.The reply to an RTI query by environment activist Rohit Choudhury revealed mining related work had already started in 17 hectares (or nearly 39% area) of the 41 hectares area claimed by CIL to be unbroken. “It was confirmed that about 9 hectare area out of 41.39 hectares has already been broken up and operated and another approximately 7 hectare area has been cleared,” mentioned a November, 2019 site inspection report by the Shillong office of the ministry for environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC).North Eastern Coalfields, a subsidiary of CIL had secured a lease for coal mining in an area of 4 sq miles in the Saleki area of Dehing Patkai for a period of 30 years from 1973. Although the lease expired in 2003, CIL applied for lease/diversion of forest land only in 2012, seeking permission for coal extraction in 98.59 hectares.Taking up a suo motu (on its own) case against a proposed move to allow coal mining, the Gauhati high court issued notices to the Centre, the Assam government, Coal India and others last month.Hearing two public interest litigations (PILs) on the same issue, a division bench of chief justice Ajay Lamba and justice Soumitra Saikia said the court too had taken up the matter suo motu.The court issued notices to the Centre, the Assam government, CIL, NBWL, mines and mineral department of Assam, the home department, Assam Police and others and fixed July 20 as the next date of hearing of the case. All respondents have been asked to file affidavits by July 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-wildlife-sanctuary-upgraded-amid-row/story-WnbNAxVOts3xpMOyXjaWUM.html

Air force pilots are using an in-house technology to spray atomised pesticides from the air, which has been able to track and kill large armies of locusts, an official said, requesting anonymity. On July 5, Mi-17 air force choppers doused large swarms of locusts in Jodhpur with atomised pesticides, a first in the battle against the pests. “The choppers were needed because they have better manoeuvrability and can target large trails of pests with a special form of the pesticide malathion, which has been indigenously developed,” the official said.“Also, the civil aviation ministry on June 27 relaxed more rules, allowing the use of engine-powered drone of up to 50kg during night times,” a second official said.Also read: Six states on high alert as govt warns of more locust swarmsAn empowered group, led by the agriculture ministry, has decided to deploy more resources to protect robustly progressing kharif or summer-sown crops from the voracious pests.Dozens of countries, from Kenya to Pakistan, are battling the worst locust outbreak in generations. The migratory insects are setting off from the Horn of Africa, where they are breeding in “insurmountable” numbers due to frequent cyclones, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). These cyclones are possibly linked to climate change, according to the FAO. The organisation has already warned the invasions pose a “serious” risk to India’s agriculture.In the intervening night of July 3 and 4 , operations were carried out at 25 places in six districts including Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Nagaur, and Dausa of Rajasthan and in Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi.The farm ministry had signed a contract with the UK’s Micron Group to modify two Mi-17 helicopters for spraying atomized pesticides. The UK-based firm’s supply has now been delayed until September, the second official said. The air force then tasked its “no. 3 base repair depot” in Chandigarh to indigenously design an airborne locust control system for Mi-17 helicopters. “The atomized airborne spraying has been successfully achieved in air through a configuration of nozzles mounted on both sides on external trusses of Mi-17 helicopters,” a statement said.The pesticide malathion is filled in the internal auxiliary tank of 800 litres of the choppers, achieving nearly 40 minutes of spaying duration covering approximately 750 hectare in each mission. One hectare is roughly 2.5 acres.Also read: Interministerial group set up to tackle locust invasion across statesOperations are continuing in six states -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana -- by locust circle offices. “So far, the damage has been limited, of below 10%. But there seems to no control over breeding in Africa, where millions are at risk of food scarcity. So, we can’t let our guard down,” said Pramod Vajpayi, a former entomologist with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-with-pesticides-mi-17-choppers-fight-locust-swarms/story-sYKhnBtek5gKdSlSIkUdUP.html
07-07-2020||India||Gujarat has become ‘epicentre of Chinese investment in India’: Congress||The Congress on Monday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state Gujarat has become the “epicentre of Chinese investment in India” and said there cannot be business as usual with China after its forces killed 20 Indian soldiers. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said Gujarat has signed three major MoUs in the last five years involving Rs 43,000-crore investment, which includes an industrial park for Chinese SMEs (small and medium enterprises). He claimed that business has not stopped in the last 20 days and cargo flights continue to operate between the two countries. “There cannot be business as usual with the country, which is transgressing our territory, to protect which our brave hearts are sacrificing their lives. These are questions that the Prime Minister must answer and respond to,” he asked at a virtual press conference. Khera said there are various methods of applying pressure on a “hostile” nation and since Gujarat has witnessed record investments from China, “now is the time to use that pressure”. “Gujarat has become the epicentre of Chinese investment in India.... On the one hand our brave army is pushing the PLA back from the Ladakh border and on the other hand, PSUs (public sector undertakings) continue to give contracts to Chinese companies.... We see Gujarat is becoming the hub of Chinese investment. We see that the process of Chinese investment in Gujarat continues,” he said. The Congress leader said the prime minister will therefore be asked if he “has a special fondness for China”. “We grant him that, we have no problem, he has invested in the relationship for two decades, we understand that also, provided the country’s borders remain safe, the country’s economy remains safe from China,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-has-become-epicentre-of-chinese-investment-in-india-congress/story-ShZ7j949AfJEYUPQcv8N5H.html
07-07-2020||India||United States, China hashtag battle over carriers in South China Sea||The US Navy and Chinese media exchanged hashtag fire on Twitter over US carrier groups and the Chinese military holding exercises in the South China Sea at the same time. The state-owned Global Times tweeted pictures of Chinese missiles and warships, and warned any US carriers in the sea did so “at the pleasure of PLA)”. The US Navy’s chief of information tweeted back the next day: “And yet, there they are… #USSNimitz & #USSRonaldReagan are not intimidated.” The tweet ended, “#AtOurDiscretion.”PLA is the People’s Liberation Army, the Chinese military. The Nimitz and Reagan are two “supercarriers”, or large aircraft carriers, in the US American fleet.Military exercises with two carrier battle groups are rare. The last one held by the US in the South China Sea took place in 2014, and indicates a deliberate show of military power in waters claimed by Beijing. Also read| South China Sea is not China’s maritime empire: PompeoThe Global Times tweeted pictures of the main gun of the Chinese guided missile frigate Yulin and three long-range anti-carrier missiles, either DF-21Ds or DF-26s. It warned that the “South China Sea is fully within the grasp of the #PLA”, and linked an article criticising the US decision to deliberately hold exercises at the same time China was holding military drills near the Xisha islands in the disputed South China Sea. The US decision showed it was “the real source of potential regional instability”, the newspaper said. On Sunday, another Global Times article described the carrier groups as “nothing more than paper tigers on China’s doorstep”. It claimed the US drills were “a mere show to make up for its loss of face regarding epidemic control” and the loss of its “Hong Kong card” following the passage a new national security law giving Beijing sweeping powers of arrest there. The Chinese drills were originally scheduled to run from Wednesday to Sunday. The US Navy’s started on Saturday.David Larter of defensenews.com noted that whether or not the carriers could be destroyed by Chinese missiles was irrelevant. “The point of operating aircraft carriers in the S. China Sea isn’t to demonstrate American invincibility, it’s to demonstrate that the United States is not deterred by China’s missiles,” he tweeted. The US Pacific Fleet’s twitter account joined the fray on Monday with pictures of a B-52H bomber and fighters from the USS Nimitz flying in formation over the South China Sea. The bomber was flown from a base in Louisiana to show, the US Air Force said, “strategic predictability and operational unpredictability”. Also read: China to supply 4 attack drones to Pak, prompts India to revive Predator-B planBeijing’s response was to call in the diplomats.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Monday accused the US of “ulterior motives by intentionally sending heavy forces into the South China Sea for large-scale drills and flexing its muscles.” He added that Washington was “alienating countries in the region, pushing for South China Sea militarisation and sabotaging peace and stability, and that China holding military drills in waters of Xisha islands was “within the country’s sovereignty”.The Twitter banter over the exercises reflects the deepening and increasingly more overt strategic rivalry between the US and China. Senior US and Chinese officials make statements against each other’s military intentions in the Indo Pacific region every few days. The past few weeks, for example, has seen US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo say the US needs to shift troops out of Europe to take on Chinese military might. The White House cited a “pattern of aggression” by Beijing that encompassed the South China Sea, the Ladakh border clashes and other actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-china-engage-in-a-virtual-war-over-carriers/story-7zwbI7zneeao9aHYHGYFaJ.html
07-07-2020||India||Monsoon in east, northeast may trigger floods||Intense monsoon rains are expected to begin again in east and northeast India from July 8, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday. Many parts of Assam and Bihar have already been impacted by flooding because of extreme rains in these regions from June 29 to July 1.On Monday, the weather office issued an orange category warning for eastern and north-eastern states from July 8 to 10 after forecasts of thunderstorms, lightning and extremely heavy rains.An orange category warning implies that authorities should be prepared for emergencies or rain related disasters.The monsoon trough at mean sea level lies to south of its normal position. “It is very likely to shift northwards towards the foothills of Himalayas from July 9 onwards. High convergence of south-westerly-southerly winds from Bay of Bengal at lower tropospheric levels very likely over northeast and east India from July 9 onwards. Under its influence, widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls very likely over Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Bihar and east Uttar Pradesh on July 9 and 10,” IMD said in a statement on Monday.Extremely heavy rain (≥ 20 cm) is also likely over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim from July 9 to 12. Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura are likely to receive very heavy rains from July 9 to 12.“The normal position of the monsoon trough is between Ganganagar in Rajasthan to Bay of Bengal. But through the monsoon months the trough keeps shifting or oscillating. Even now the trough is slightly south of its normal position passing along Gujarat and over Jharkhand. We are expecting the trough to shift northwards towards the Himalayan foothills in the next few days. Moist winds along with orography (topography of mountains) can bring extreme rains in east and northeast India. Many parts of the region were already flooding because the monsoon trough had shifted northwards around June 30. If the rivers are swollen, they can flood again,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.Meanwhile, under the influence of the well-marked low-pressure area over Saurashtra and its neighbourhood, widespread rainfall activity is likely over Gujarat during the next two days. Extremely heavy rain is also very likely over Saurashtra and Kutch during the next 48 hours. IMD has issued a red category warning for July 6 and 7, which implies that local authorities are supposed to take action against disasters caused by heavy rain.Moderate to intense thunderstorm and lightning is expected over Madhya Pradesh, south Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and north coastal Andhra Pradesh during the next 12 hours.Monsoon rains over the country is 13% excess, It’s 26% excess over central India; 8% excess over east and northeast India; 11% excess over south peninsula; and 5% deficient over northwest India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-in-east-ne-may-trigger-floods/story-ckaa0eLUaIhcLy2dgtQb1M.html
07-07-2020||India||Rahul skips defence panel meetings, says BJP chief JP Nadda||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda on Monday questioned former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s persistent absence from meetings of the parliamentary standing committee on defence and said his recent comments on the India-China standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh demoralised Indian forces.“Rahul Gandhi does not attend a single meeting of Standing Committee on Defence. But sadly, he continues to demoralise the nation, question the valour of our armed forces and do everything that a responsible opposition leader should not do,” Nadda tweeted.The Congress responded by accusing the BJP of resorting to “cheap distractions and stunts to manage headlines” during the India-China border standoff.As per the records on the Lok Sabha’s website, the committee met 11 times between September 2019 and March 2020 and Gandhi did not attend any of the meetings. While Gandhi has been critical of the government over its handling of the crisis, the BJP has accused the Congress of politicising the issue.“Rahul Gandhi belongs to that glorious dynastic tradition where as far as defence is concerned, committees don’t matter, only commissions do. Congress has many deserving members who understand parliamentary matters but one dynasty will never let such leaders grow. Really sad,” he tweeted.The defence committee, headed by BJP’s Jual Oram, has 31 members in all -- 10 from the Rajya Sabha and 21 from the Lok Sabha. Gandhi is not the only member who skipped the meetings. While the first meeting was attended by 20 members, , the subsequent meetings saw lower attendance. BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao sought an explanation from Gandhi for not attending the meetings and also asked why he skipped a field visit to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, which proved to be a very important visit for the committee. “He and his party have nominated him as a member on this very important standing committee which deals with all matters dealing with defence and armed forces. We demand an explanation from Rahul Gandhi as to why he chose to be absent from all the meetings of Standing Committee on Defence, of which he is a member,” Rao said.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala responded in a series of tweets. “Dear Nadda Ji, Daily insidious comments are making you look like a poorer version of malicious BJP spokespersons. Had the BJP & Modi Govt spent its energy in fighting China & supporting our Armed Forces, you wouldn’t need to lie on Chinese transgressions to mislead the Nation,” he tweeted.Surjewala then went to pose questions to the BJP chief on the defence preparedness of the country.“Did the Estimates Committee of Parliament headed by Ex BJP President, Sh. M.M.Joshi submit a report citing that Defence Expenditure was ‘lowest since 1962’-lowest in 56 yrs? Is this Modi Govt’s way of enhancing the morale of our Armed Forces?” he asked in one .“Why did Modi Govt shelve the creation of 90,000 strong “Mountain Strike Corps” to be carved out as a counter measure to Chinese build up on our borders? Why did you deny our Armed Forces this strategic fire power to take on the Chinese forces?” he said in a second tweet.“Why has China committed 2,264 transgressions on our territory since 2015 under Modi Govt (Year 2015-428, Yr 2016-296, Yr 2017-473, Yr 2018-404, Yr 2019-663)? Why did the BJP Govt not act upon this pre-meditated Chinese design?” Surjewala asked in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-skips-defence-panel-meetings-says-bjp-chief/story-QmSoG4AwRvWAdvxc5wPWsO.html
07-07-2020||India||Talcher fertiliser plant work, given to Chinese firm, halted||Work on the Rs 13,277 crore Talcher fertiliser and coal gasification project, which was awarded to China’s Wuhuan Engineering Company Ltd in September last year, has been halted because of technical reasons, people aware of the development said.The Chinese firm is unable to immediately mobilise technicians, equipment and workers at the site because of disruption in air connectivity amid the Covid-19 pandemic and visa issues, they added, requesting anonymity.The recent India-China military standoff at the border may also have some indirect impact on the project, but it is too early to come to a definitive conclusion at this stage on the extent of the impact, the people cited above said. The project is the first in India to employ coal gasification technology for production of urea. Coal gasification is a process that converts coal into synthesis gas or syngas that is a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide..Also read| ‘Ensure expeditious restoration of peace in border areas’: India urges China“The project is on. Any call, if at all, will be taken by the competent authority depending on how India-China border talks unfold. Although the project is important to reduce India’s dependence on imported urea, national interest is supreme,” one of the people cited above, who works in an economic ministry, said. The Narendra Modi govenment last week announced a ban on 59 mostly Chinese mobile applications such as Tik-Tok, UC Browser and WeChat, citing concerns that these are “prejudicial to sovereignty of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.” Imports from China are also facing strict scrutiny at customs check-points and Chinese investments are subject to prior government approval amid security concerns.Also read| ‘Banning Chinese apps a digital strike’: Union minister Ravi Shankar PrasadSindo-Indian tensions shot up after a violent brawl between Chinese and Indian soldiers on June 15 along the Line of Actual Control in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in which 20 Indian army personnel an unspecified number of Chinese were killed.The state-owned Talcher Fertilizers Limited (TFL) awarded the lump-sum turnkey (LSTK) contract project to Wuhuan Engineering on September 17, 2019 after a global competitive bid. TFL is backed by four state-run companies Gail India Ltd (GAIL), Coal India Ltd (CIL), Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd (RCF) and Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (FCIL). GAIL, CIL and RCF hold 31.85% equity stake each in the company and the balance 4.45% is held by FCIL. Email queries sent to TFL, GAIL, CIL, RCF, FCIL, Wuhuan Engineering and the ministries of fertiliser, coal and petroleum did not elicit any response.One person aware of the ground developments said, “The project had been hit by coronavirus pandemic that started in (the central Chinese city of) Wuhan last year in December, hence slow progress. But you can’t judge the outcome of a match in the first few overs. We are hopeful of completing the project by September 2023.”An officer in the fertiliser ministry said the project has already been delayed by almost six months.The Talcher project will produce 1.27 million tonnes per annum of neem-coated urea through gasification of a mixed feedstock comprising of high ash Indian coal and petcoke. TFL has been allotted northern part of the North Arkhapal mine as a captive asset for meeting its coal requirements and petcoke shall be sourced from the Paradip refinery of Indian Oil.SC Sharma, an energy expert and former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission, said, “Coal gasification to urea is not a viable technology in an era of cheap imported gas. Talcher Coal is best used for power generation at pithead where costs could be Rs 1.5 per kWh to Rs 2 per kWh. It’s more important to reduce import of coal for power generation rather than creating another technology which may not turn out to be a competitive option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talcher-fertiliser-plant-work-given-to-chinese-firm-halted/story-SXC2tL3vHcnEM5oQQwfihI.html
07-07-2020||India||Behind the Indo-China border de-escalation||At 8.45am on Sunday, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane called up defence minister Rajnath Singh to inform him that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was moving out troops from the Y-junction of Galwan Valley, towards its base camp in the rear.The same evening, between 5pm and 6pm, National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval, also the Special Representative (SR) on the Boundary Dialogue between the two countries, had a candid conversation with Chinese SR Wang Yi (also the country’s foreign minister). Coming out of more than two weeks of quarantine and indisposition during which he monitored the LAC developments from home, NSA Doval stressed the need to restore patrolling rights of the Indian Army on these four points in order to bring peace and tranquillity along the 1597km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) in east Ladakh.People aware of the matter said that, by Monday evening, the Chinese started moving back at the four contested stand-off points between the two countries — Galwan, Gogra, Hot Springs and Pangong Tso. The PLA and the Indian Army had withdrawn to their respective base camps in the Galwan sector; initial troop withdrawal had begun in Gogra (patrolling point 15) and Hot Springs (patrolling point 17); and the PLA was in the process of dismantling some structures on Finger 4. People aware of the developments said that till such time as the withdrawal is complete, there will be no let up from the Indian forces, which will continue to be deployed, as an “accident” cannot be ruled out.Also read: India-China ties in complex situation, says Beijing after Doval-Wang icebreakerWhile these are the first steps taken towards disengagement on the LAC leading to de-escalation, Doval and Wang agreed that both sides will have patrolling rights on the contested points, but will avoid any friction or clash in the future. While the joint secretary-level Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border issues will meet soon to implement these decisions on the ground, the two SRs are scheduled to hold talks three weeks later, by which time the withdrawal process should have been completed, the people cited above said.The development is a culmination of series of meetings between military commanders and diplomatic officials that began after the PLA took an aggressive posture on the LAC in May. India’s response was handed by NSA Doval under guidance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and in close coordination with Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah and external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who stood in for an indisposed Doval to talk to SR Wang Yi on June 17 after the Indian Army and the PLA clashed at patrolling point 14 in the Galwan sector.The people said it two had a tough conversation, with both sides accusing the other of initiating the border skirmish in which 20 Indian Army soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers were killed.While India will continue to put pressure on China to ensure that the PLA withdraws to its April positions, the country’s national security planners say that the disengagement process will take time, with each point being negotiated by the military commanders on the ground with diplomatic support. While the PLA were at a disadvantage in Galwan, Gogra and Hot Springs in terms of military positions, the situation at Pangong Tso is in favour of the Chinese, as they have built a road up to Finger 4.Also read| No unilateral change to status quo, agree India-China: 10 pointsUltimately, said analysts, it is restoration of Indian patrolling rights on the north banks of Pangong Tso which will determine the success of the Doval-Wang parleys.Although Raisina Hill is relieved at the reduction of tension at the border, it is still foxed at the reasons for the Chinese PLA to initiate military aggression on the LAC at the cost of a nuanced and complex relationship between the two countries achieved with 30 years of careful nurturing. “ Even if we say that PLA was showcasing the power differential between China and India, it does not make any sense strategically as the move to acquire few kilometres of territory not only riled up all India including Opposition parties but also severely hit the economic ties (between the countries),” said a senior government official who asked not to be named.The only explanation to the PLA aggression, according to a member of China Study Group, a government body, is that Beijing expected New Delhi to capitulate much the way some ASEAN nations have when it comes to China’s aggression in the South China Sea.While India has noted the US Navy counter to Chinese Navy’s exercises in the South China Sea, senior officials are at pains to clarify that this has no links to Ladakh withdrawal. “ For the past two months, we were prepared for the worst in Ladakh as PM Modi had decided that India will not back down from any aggression on the borders and surrendering of any territory was unacceptable,” said a senior Cabinet Minister who spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behind-the-border-de-escalation/story-6dDImaSYp1irdBkp0NkrqK.html
07-07-2020||India||China troops pull back from key friction points||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has withdrawn up to 1.5km from friction areas in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, and the Indian Army has pulled back proportionately, acting on an understanding reached last week by top Indian and Chinese military commanders on a phased de-escalation of the ongoing border conflict in the Ladakh theatre, multiple people familiar with the developments said on Monday.A minor thinning of PLA soldiers has also been noticed at the sensitive Finger Area near Pangong Tso, they added.But India is keeping its guard up and advancing with maximum caution as the complex disengagement process begins along the tense and heavily militarised border, an official said on the condition of anonymity.The Indian Army has observed the PLA retreat up to 1.5km (still under verification) from Patrolling Point (PP)-14 in the Galwan Valley — the site of a deadly clash which left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead on June 15 — after removing some temporary structures and tents it had pitched there, a second official said.This stepping back of soldiers in Galwan Valley has created a 3km buffer zone, he added.“Rearward movement of PLA vehicles has been seen in Galwan Valley and the Hot Springs-Gogra post sector (PP-15 and PP-17),” the official said. “Some skeletal withdrawal of PLA troops and vehicles has been observed at Finger 4 but the army wouldn’t categorise it as disengagement while it keeps a close watch on the developments there,” said a third official aware of the matter.The military buildup in Indian and Chinese depth areas, however, hasn’t thinned, with both sides keeping their guard up. The deployment of thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence weapons continues in the region, according to the people cited above.The disengagement process, a precursor to any kind of de-escalation of the border conflict — which entered its third month on Monday — has started under the terms mutually agreed to at the June 30 meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region.It also followed a two-hour video conference between India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and China’s foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official statements by both countries.The two Special Representatives (SR) on the India-China boundary question agreed that “it was necessary to ensure at the earliest complete disengagement of troops along the LAC and de-escalation from India-China border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquillity,” the ministry of external affairs said in a statement.“The two sides welcome the progress made in the recent military and diplomatic meetings between the two countries, and agree to continue the dialogue and consultation, and emphasise that the consensus reached at the level of the two border defence forces commanders should be implemented as soon as possible to complete the process of disengagement of the front-line forces of the two sides as soon as possible,” said the Chinese statement.Explaining the need for maximum caution while dealing with China, the officials cited above said the Chinese PLA was making claims to areas that are up to 800 metres inside what New Delhi considers its territory in Galwan Valley.“The PLA claim has shifted to Nala junction or Y-junction where Galwan river meets the Shyok, which is 800 metres on the Indian side of China’s claim of 1959. In April 2020, the PLA objected to the construction of a bridge at the mouth of Galwan. This area was never contested and that’s why face-offs never took place here,” the officials said.As disengagement progresses, it’s critical to define buffer zones clearly with natural features and ensure that soldiers do not venture into these areas as a step towards reversing the trust deficit created by the Galwan Valley clash, they said.The officials said that the PLA was also creating a dispute at Naku La in north Sikkim by disregarding the watershed principle, an established global norm for border demarcation. They said the PLA was repeatedly carrying out transgressions in the Naku La area, where four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured during a violent face-off involving 150 troops on May 9.Military experts reacted to the development with guarded optimism and underlined the need to proceed with caution, given the trust deficit created by the Galwan Valley skirmish.“It’s a positive sign that some disengagement is taking place. Separation of soldiers lessens the chances of any clash taking place that could vitiate the atmosphere for future diplomatic and military-level talks,” said Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), a former Northern Army commander.A limited military disengagement in the same friction areas — Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra — was initiated last month after the senior military commanders reached an understanding on reducing tensions during their first meeting on June 6. However, the Galwan Valley clash dashed disengagement hopes.“While we need to tread cautiously, at least there does appear to be some desire from both sides to break through the stalemate that has existed along the LAC,” Hooda added.Disengagement involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the complex plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides. It also entails the phased withdrawal of weapons and equipment to a mutually agreed distance, and finally the restoration of status quo ante (early April).At the June 30 meeting, the Indian side reiterated its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from friction points along the LAC and sought the restoration of status quo ante (early April) in key areas such as Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Hot Springs, Gogra and the strategic Depsang plains, apart from emphasising the need for thinning the military buildup in the region.The corps commander-ranked officers previously met on June 22 when they hammered out a consensus on disengaging from friction points along the disputed border. However, the “mutual consensus to disengage” from all “friction areas” neither enabled any disengagement on the ground nor led to the thinning of the military build-up by rival forces in the region, leading to their third meeting on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-troops-pull-back-from-key-friction-points/story-Svod0u2N2ftpNIDpiltwIJ.html
07-07-2020||India||HT Salutes: Assam trio makes face masks, shields||As a non-practising medical doctor, Dipannita Kaushik decided she had to pitch in as the coronavirus pandemic raged across the globe. So the 29-year-old from Guwahati, Assam, who is currently pursuing a Masters in public health, decided to make face shields and masks for workers on the frontline with the help of her mother and her fiancé, reusing old X-ray and projector sheets.“I know what it’s like to not have proper gear, even in ordinary times,” said Kaushik, who has served as a resident at an Apollo hospital and at Pratiksha Hospital in Assam.“During an outbreak like this one, I can’t even imagine the risks. Often the most under-equipped and severely affected are the Asha [accredited social health activists], multipurpose health workers and anganwadi workers who are actually doing the grass root data collection and who act as a bridge between the healthcare community and the population. So I wanted to do this for them.” Watch | HT Salutes: Assam doctor who makes face shields, masks for Covid warriorsKaushik’s mother, Simarekha Bhagowati, 56, a college professor, had plenty of old OHP sheets lying around, leftovers from Math lectures in earlier decades. They dug up a bunch of old X-rays too. They use multiple strips of the stiff X-ray sheets to make each frame; the projector films form the veil.Kaushik’s fiancé, Tuhin Bhuyan, 28, a software engineer, helps put the shields together using craft glue. Her mother pitches in with the masks, on their sewing machine.Their first batch of 40 masks and shields was ready by the first week of April. “The second part of my job was to reach the right people,” Kaushik said. She contacted Dr Santimoyee Barua, the surveillance medical officer at the ministry of health and family welfare in Guwahati, who said she would be glad to have the consignment.The second batch was ready by the middle of May and went to Dr Nabin Bhuyan, medical superintendent at the Morigaon Civil Hospital, a designated facility for Covid-positive cases.“Such quick thinking can be life-saving,” said Barua. “The shields especially, because of the greater protection they offer, are very useful to the Asha and multipurpose workers who are out in the field, tracing suspected Covid-19 infections.”Her third batch, Kaushik said, will go to traffic personnel, street vendors and local shopkeepers later this month. Meanwhile, she has also posted YouTube tutorials to help others make such kits too.“DIY shields could be a vital strategy as we unlock and prepare for life amid the virus,” she said. “The good thing about them is that they can also be sterilised and reused, again and again, until some component gives way. It’s just what we need.”Each kit takes the group of three around 10 minutes to make. And since she has had plenty of time indoors, Kaushik said it’s been a good way to keep busy and make herself useful, outside her regular routine of housework and thesis work.“Her masks more than meet our standards,” Nabin Bhuyan said. “We have used them in the hospital and out in the field. Innovative, cost-effective ventures like these are vital in resource-constrained countries like ours.”Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you 15 stories of HT Salutes.

07-07-2020||Editorials||India must remain careful | HT Editorial||After escalatory rhetoric, and more important, aggressive actions, a process to slowly, in a calibrated manner, defuse the tensions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), has commenced. China’s slight withdrawal of troops from Galwan, and the Hot Springs Area, and what appears to be a minor thinning of its presence at Finger 4 in Pangong-Tso, is a positive development. With a two-hour-long conversation between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi — the designated special representatives on border talks — there appears to be a degree of convergence between the two countries on the need to first disengage, and eventually de-escalate, from the current stand-off.There are structural reasons why disengagement makes sense for both countries. China was solely responsible for transgressing across LAC. Even the finest scholars who study China have not been able to offer a fully rounded explanation on why Beijing has behaved the way it did. Is it linked to its pattern of aggression elsewhere? Is it to overcome domestic legitimacy issues Xi Jinping may be confronting? Is it a message to India to not cosy up to the United States? Is it to halt India’s border infrastructure development? Is it to gain tactical advantage to secure Aksai Chin and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor? Beijing may have been motivated by all these factors, but the fact is, even for a rising power, its actions defied rational calculation, for it has alienated India, and Indian public opinion entirely, throwing the entire relationship — of which China too has been a beneficiary — off-gear. It will also push India in the very direction Beijing does not want it to move. If Beijing is now waking up to what is a miscalculation, that is wise. New Delhi too does not want conflict. It was left with no choice but to respond aggressively to Chinese incursions and defend its territorial integrity. But given the internal economic weaknesses, the Covid-19 challenge, the gaps in military preparation, and the costs of any conflict, peace is, of course, the most desirable option.But this seeming thaw needs to be accompanied with two caveats. One is immediate. As the Indian establishment has made clear, every step of the disengagement process will be carefully monitored and verified. China has violated past understandings; its statement contained a hint of continued belligerence; and there doesn’t appear to be a deal on it stepping back from the finger area in Pangong-Tso. India must ensure complete restoration of status quo ante. The second is medium-term. Irrespective of a possible de-escalation, it cannot be business-as-usual. India must ramp up its capabilities, deepen external partnerships, reduce dependence on China, and remain wary, for this is possibly the beginning, not the end, of an era of a new strategic competition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/india-must-remain-careful/story-7Rh6PRgiYAlBanH3byHT2I.html
07-07-2020||Editorials||Donald Trump is wrong, yet again | HT Editorial||The United States (US) Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has announced that foreign students who plan to take only online college courses this coming semester must leave the US. Indian students currently in the US, or who were planning to come in as new students, must take in-person courses. The new immigration regulations will face court challenges. It is conceivable they may never come into force until the semester is over.As President Donald Trump’s standing in the polls falls, he has become increasingly populist in his responses. On the domestic front, he has played footsie with white supremacists and, increasingly, turned on immigrants. Mr Trump has long denounced illegal migration. Now, he has turned his ire on immigrants who go through the legal process. When he suspended H and L visas, given high joblessness rates, this had some political resonance. Restrictions on students inflict both short and long-term damage to the US economy and offer no benefits to its citizens. Mr Trump may hope that hitting out at students in a country where a college degree defines middle-class status will appeal to his working-class base. So tenuous is the reasoning that one can predict his political fortunes will not improve because of this narrow-minded act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/donald-trump-is-wrong-yet-again/story-LbO6YFeJtIrwlLxNaF3dIM.html
