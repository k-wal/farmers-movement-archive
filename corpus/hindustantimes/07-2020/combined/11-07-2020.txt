The aggressive Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has thinned its presence at Finger Four in Pangong Tso, has withdrawn from forward positions to base camps in the Galwan sector, and is on the way back to its April positions in the Gogra and Hot Springs area. Disengagement has begun with de-escalation to follow in next three weeks — three divisions (30,000 troops) each of the Indian and Chinese armies are still facing each other from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. There is a certain amount of satisfaction among national security planners that the Indian military stood up to PLA, but the massive bilateral erosion of trust after the June 15 flare-up has convinced the Narendra Modi government that Beijing will be back on LAC, perhaps at Depsang Plains in Ladakh, next summer. For a country which believes that it is a global superpower, 2017 Doklam and 2020 Galwan are mere tactical mistakes in power projection and ambition. That Prime Minister (PM) Modi will think a hundred times before he does a Wuhan or Chennai connect again with paramount leader Xi Jinping is akin to a traffic ticket for the Middle Kingdom. For a rampaging China, it is only the big picture that matters.The Chinese expansionist posture in Ladakh is intertwined with the country’s plans in the South China Sea — something that is evident by looking at the world map. Beijing wants the Shyok river alignment to be the border with India in Ladakh so that the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is further away from the Indian military positions, and also to ensure it gets a better all-weather route linking the Tibet Highway in Aksai Chin to the Karakoram highway south of the Khunjerab pass. With Pakistan now reduced to a client State of China, it is through the port of Balochistan that the PLA Navy will dominate the oil trade in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea. The Chinese base in Djibouti and Beijing’s huge influence on Africa’s eastern seaboard will allow it to dominate the sea route from Suez Canal. The strategic location of both the Gwadar and Djibouti bases makes this amply evident to any military planner. The Chinese military’s ambition in the South China Sea is not only limited to dominating more than half of world trade passing through the Malacca, Lombard and Sunda Straits, but to also capture Taiwan as part of One China Policy to, then, break out from its backyard and contest the dominance of the Pacific Ocean with the United States (US) Japan and Australia. The military key to this posture is the presence of ballistic missile firing Chinese nuclear submarines at Yulin Naval Base at Hainan Islands, just north of Vietnam. As a military plan, all this looked good and achievable, till such time India, under PM Modi, called the Ladakh bluff and the mighty US Navy simultaneously pincered Beijing by challenging the PLA Navy in the South China Sea. Currently, supercarriers USS Ronald Reagan and USS Nimitz are not only orchestrating a full spectrum war game in the South China Sea but also daring Beijing’s mouthpieces who threaten to use DF-21 D and DF-26 “ship killer” nuclear missiles on carriers. The US task forces now dominate all the exit routes from the East and South China sea in Miyako, Bashi Channel and Luzon Strait through which the global internet cables pass undersea. Asean countries are also unhappy with China, and Japan is finally standing up to Beijing in the Senkaku Island dispute. Australia and Canada have called out China, and Europe has finally woken up to the reality of a Communist State. If one were to look at the big picture, then the global pushback against China was inspired by the Galwan fightback and followed by US President Donald Trump translating America’s often stated but never implemented Asian Pivot objectives on the sea. The plight of the Buddhist people of Tibet and Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang under the traditionally xenophobic Han Chinese is back on the global agenda, and suddenly things don’t look so good for the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.Rather than distracting countries from the global fight against the marauding coronavirus, which originated from Wuhan, by indulging in a war dance in Ladakh and the South China Sea, China should be at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic. It needs to de-escalate from both the areas and not wait for another opportunistic strike when the world is focused on US Presidential elections in November 2020 as it did against India in 1962 taking advantage of Cuban Missile Crisis.Taking a leaf out of past paramount rulers, China needs to settle the borders on basis of the 2005 agreement on the Political Parameters and Guiding Principles of the India-China Boundary Question. President Xi surely understands the popularity of Modi, whom much of India followed faithfully through the painful demonetisation and total lockdown. But the global bully that China has become, it understands only the language of power, and the economic, military might and technological superiority of the US. Had the India-US nuclear deal been nixed by opponents in India, the 2005 border agreement would have never come through. Beijing will not forget 2020, the year of the metal rat in the Chinese calendar, in a hurry. The world, particularly India and the happy tiny kingdom of Bhutan, will hear the echoes of this in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-pm-modi-called-china-s-bluff-in-ladakh/story-AKpv1q56OsH87tVp6ssBnL.html
11-07-2020||Chandigarh||16 vehicles impounded, 21 held for violating night curfew in Chandigarh||In compliance with the UT administrator’s directions to impose a night curfew in the city, 16 vehicles were impounded and 21 persons were arrested, the police said on Saturday.The cases were registered between 10pm on Friday and 5am on Saturday. All those arrested were later released on bail.The action came after UT administrator VP Singh Badnore took to Twitter and issued the directions for a night curfew in wake of the rising number of Covid-19 positive cases. Badnore directed the police to impound all vehicles moving during curfew hours except those on essential duty. Chandigarh DGP, Sanjay Baniwal, had assured strict compliance.More than 100 vehicles were turned back from the city borders after 10pm to prevent unauthorised entry in the night. Apart from impounding vehicles, police also imposed a fine of ₹1.44 lakh on 287 persons for moving without masks and violating other restrictions during a special drive carried out on Friday between 6pm to 10pm.EXCUSES GALOREFrom after dinner strolls to purchasing medicines or getting late at work, city residents are giving all kinds of excuses after being caught by the police. “The most common excuse is going out to buy medicines. But most of them are unable to show prescriptions or even the medicines they purchased,” said a police personnel on duty at IT park.The maximum number of cases (5) were registered in Sector 26 and Industrial Area. In Sector 26, most cases were registered for violating the night curfew at Bapu Dham Colony.“‘I was out for a stroll after dinner’ is the most common excuse which the residents of Bapu Dham give on being caught. Some say they get late coming back from work in Mohali,” added a police official posted at Bapu Dham Colony. If caught without a mask, the residents will blame their forgetfulness even though wearing a mask while stepping out of the house is mandatory.From June 25 to July 7, the police issued 2,075 challans and collected a fine of ₹10.56 lakh from people for various violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/16-vehicles-impounded-21-held-for-violating-night-curfew-in-chandigarh/story-MSIyTuoxft1EBVufkUY6vK.html
11-07-2020||City||Aaditya Thackeray says Dharavi’s ‘Chase the virus’ model will be implemented in Mumbai Metropolitan Region||Maharashtra environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said that Dharavi’s ‘chase the virus’ pattern, which helped in bringing down the Covid-19 cases at Dharavi, will be strictly implemented in the rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region too. The Worli legislator made the statement at the Kalyan sports complex on Saturday in a meeting held to review the Covid-19 situation at Kalyan-Dombivli, Bhiwandi, Mira Bhayander and Navi Mumbai.The meeting was attended by the civic commissioners of all corporations within MMR. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC’s) G-North ward (which includes Dharavi) who played a key role in bringing the spread of the virus under control, was also present for Saturday’s meeting.“If the spread of the virus can be controlled in Dharavi, it can be curtailed at Kalyan and Dombivli too. We need to impose “chase the virus” pattern here to achieve the purpose. There is a need to push contact tracing, increase testing and isolation.”The “chase the virus” pattern, which was introduced by the state in May, focussed on increasing the high-risk contact tracing and quarantining of Covid-19 patients, and testing capacity along with several other measures. “Like Mumbai and Thane, health facilities are being upgraded at Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar and Ambernath too, to ensure that all patients receive treatment. We will increase the facilities of jumbo beds, oxygen, ventilators and ambulances across MMR. The civic bodies should also emphasise on reducing the death rates,” Thackeray said.Taking a jibe at leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis’s recent visit to Kalyan, Thackeray said that the Opposition should “engage in constructive criticism”. “Our emphasis is on keeping the citizens fit while the Opposition parties are engaging in disaster​ tourism. They should visit other states and see the medical response there, even as we work here without blaming anyone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aaditya-thackeray-says-dharavi-s-chase-the-virus-model-will-be-implemented-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region/story-xDbPm4pNzxvGWAWj6Yz7KM.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||Ragpickers struggle to make ends meet, risk Covid infection||Usha Bant, 38, earned a living by collecting segregated dry waste from hotels and restaurants in Santacruz. But in the last three months, her livelihood took a hit as the lockdown ravaged the hospitality sector. With hotels locking their doors, Bant found herself in dire straits. The pandemic has hit the informal waste collection sector harder than most.From a 90% drop in daily wages, fear of segregating contaminated mixed waste, and witnessing relatives walk miles to go back to their states, to being barred from entering societies and landfills, ragpickers in the city have had a tough four months.Bant’s story is no different. Prior to the lockdown, the Andheri slum resident would take the local train to Santacruz to collect waste, sell it, and earn around ₹200 per day. “From March to May, I could not earn anything. Neither was there any transport, nor waste available. I managed to segregate waste outside societies, earning ₹5 per day. NGOs helped or else I would have died of hunger,” said Bant.Vile-Parle resident Bharti Sukaya, 49, a ragpicker at MIDC Andheri for 12 years, would earn ₹150 per day to support her three children, before the lockdown. She was forced to change her daily route after some areas were declared as containment zones. “I began following civic sanitation workers, resorting to scavenging for valuable plastic that they missed, and making ₹5-10 per day,” she said. Three major NGOs in the city that run 15 of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) waste segregation centres explained that the entire dry waste supply chain collapsed during the lockdown. “Ragpickers’ income dropped to one-tenth of what they normally make. Stricter regulations restricted their movement since they don’t collect waste around the area they live in. Segregation in Mumbai from March onwards fell to zero, with contaminated waste being discarded alongside daily garbage. This scared them, but they had no option,” said Jyoti Mhapsekar, president, Stree Mukti Sanghatana (SMS), a Dadar-based organisation that assists 3,500 women waste-pickers from across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).BMC had banned the entry of ragpickers at city landfills after fires were reported at Deonar dumping ground in 2015 and 2016. “An order to reverse this was never implemented,” said Mhapsekar.Haider Ali Sayyed, founder, Aasra Welfare Association, with 450 registered ragpickers, said the informal sector had collapsed due to lack of transportation of waste, and most of it was hoarded by local dealers. “This happened as the majority of transporters who were from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar left Mumbai. Transportation of waste stopped and major waste dealers dropped rates of scrap collected. Local dealers are now selling that scrap at much higher prices,” he said.Aasra provided 700 PPE kits, 5,500kg of ration (including rice, oil, lentils, etc.), 13,500 food packets, and 3,700 sanitary kits (soaps, toothpaste, sanitary pads, etc.) to ragpickers, with support from private companies and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). “Besides PPE kits, temporary identification (ID) cards and training on Covid-19 precautions were provided,” said Alpita Rathod, project associate, UNDP.“While doctors have been hailed for their efforts, this lowest segment of Covid-19 warriors has remained ignored. Ragpickers are responsible for segregating 60% of Mumbai’s waste, even during this pandemic,” said Jidnyasa Arondekar, president, Aakar Mumbai, with 1,550 registered ragpickers employed across six segregation centres in the western suburbs. “Many would have contracted the virus without realising it. Despite repeated reminders to BMC to provide ID cards, a majority of ragpickers don’t have them,” Arondekar said.From March 25 to April 14 (Lockdown 1.0), none of Mumbai’s 46 waste segregation centres were functional. However, operations resumed from April 15.BMC officials said owing to mixed waste containing Covid protective equipment that could be potentially hazardous, workers at these segregation centres were also at risk. “70% of ragpickers are illegally associated with the informal sector, where help cannot be provided. The matter will be considered after Covid-19 cases are reduced,” said a senior solid waste management department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ragpickers-struggle-to-make-ends-meet-risk-covid-infection/story-vmRnbF8JzSlHwgNVLgwPrL.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||2-feet cap for Ganpati idols at homes; Maharashtra government issues guidelines||Maharashtra government on Saturday issued guidelines for the celebration of Ganeshotsav in the state, which include reducing the size of idols as well as recommendations to organise online viewing and postpone the immersion of idols to next year.The 11-day Ganeshotsav is one of the most important Hindu festivals in Maharashtra and mandals in the city attract huge crowds. It will be held in end-August this year. As of July 10, BMC has started accepting online applications to erect a pandal or set up a stage on roads and footpaths in its jurisdiction. Mumbai has nearly 12,000 public pandals every year.The state home department has issued detailed guidelines for Ganeshotsav organisers to limit the spread of Covid-19 through contact and prevent overcrowding. It is mandatory for all public Ganesh mandals to take prior permission from local authorities. Previously, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had called for a low-key celebration in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.The state in its notification has recommended marble or metal idols, adding that if clay or other materials are used, then immersion ceremonies should be performed either at home or in artificial ponds. The guidelines also recommend postponing immersion ceremonies wherever possible to Maghi Ganeshotsav (in February 2021) or next year’s Ganeshotsav.For Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has laid down a number of conditions for Ganeshotsav organisers. These include reducing the size of pandals, a ban on offerings like flowers and garlands, sanitising pandals thrice a day, and ensuring only five workers are inside a pandal at a time.Organisers have also been asked to conduct public awareness campaigns, blood donation camps, health check-ups and other public health programmes during the festival. Senior civic officials said that a decision allowing a limited number of devotees inside a pandal is yet to be taken.In a meeting held on June 27 between the state government and representatives of the public mandals, a decision was taken to cap the height of idols at 4 feet for idols at public mandals and at 2 feet for household idols.Public mandals have also been asked to adhere to distancing norms, carry out fumigation, use sanitizers, and pay special attention to the safety of children and senior citizens. Organisers have been asked not to advertise in order to reduce crowds in attendance at their pandals. They have been encouraged to tie up with local cable networks and/or use social media to let devotees see rituals like the aarti and get ‘darshan’ of the idols online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-feet-cap-for-ganpati-idols-at-homes-maharashtra-government-issues-guidelines/story-JrLoARXkJvmsVKV7L5ndlK.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||NIOS cancels board exams, students to be marked on previous performance||The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) announced the cancellation of its secondary (Class 10) and senior secondary (Class 12) examinations due to the ongoing Covid-19 situation. The announcement was published on the institute’s official website on Friday. More than three lakh students from across the country appear for Class 10 and 12 exams through NIOS every year.As per the official announcement, both the exams which were earlier postponed to July have been cancelled. Students will be marked based on their past performance while those who wish to improve their performance will be given a chance to appear for the next exam as and when the situation is conducive. The institute also released the marking criteria which will be used to compute results. An average of the subjects passed earlier will be considered to mark students for the subjects for which exams are not conducted. For instance, learners, who have previously passed in three subjects, would be awarded the average marks of their best two subjects for the remaining papers. For learners who were set to appear for the first time, their performance would be calculated on the basis of the tutor-marked assignment and practical marks.Parents said the decision was a big relief, especially to students with special needs. “Students were under stress because appearing for the exams in the middle of a pandemic would have been extremely risky. We are happy that the board has taken a decision in the favour of students,” said the parent of a student from Andheri. Several parents had requested the institute to cancel the exams and had suggested that students be marked based on their internal exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nios-cancels-board-exams-students-to-be-marked-on-previous-performance/story-6AMAFdpYxLU5ZpJjYD7PLO.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||Go back to annual exam pattern: MLA to UGC||A state MLA recently approached the University Grants Commission (UGC) seeking change in the academic pattern for the year 2020-21. In a letter addressed to the UGC chairman, former minister of state education and higher education DP Sawant has requested the UGC to propose shifting from semester pattern to an annual pattern for the next academic year.In his letter dated July 9, Sawant has highlighted that instead of dividing the curriculum into two semesters, colleges should instead focus on the old pattern of annual exams so they have enough time to finish the curriculum, and then conduct exams and assessment only once in the coming year.“Many states including Maharashtra, Odisha and Haryana have deferred their end of term examinations in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases. There is no clarity of when institutes will reopen for the new academic year,” highlighted the letter. It further states that generally, the first-semester university exams are held between the month of October-November, which will be impossible to hold in the current scenario. “I, therefore, suggest the UGC goes back to the annual exam pattern for the 2020-21 academic year,” stated his letter.While such a decision might prove beneficial to complete the curriculum, college principals pointed that such a format will be impossible to implement, especially since MU students’ study 12 different subjects across two semesters every year.“To go back to an annual pattern, subjects will have to be reduced to make sure students are not burdened with 12 different subjects in a year. The semester concept was introduced to cover maximum topics in a year and cramming it into one single semester will be an impossible task,” said the principal of a suburban college.At present, the state is yet to announce its final stand on the status of end of term exams for final year students. While the UGC has insisted that exams be held before September 2020, the Maharashtra government has clarified that it is in no state to conduct exams in the next few months. After clarifying their stand, the state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant this week stated that the government plans to end this confusion by next week and announce their final decision soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/go-back-to-annual-exam-pattern-mla-to-ugc/story-oWLA6fgf6vVhwRhgS6BnfI.html
11-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Four-decade old storm sewer lines caused 4 road cave-ins in 3 years||The deteriorating condition of the four decade-old storm sewers in areas including Dugri, Kaka Marriage place road and Saggu chowk has resulted in four major road cave-in incidents over the last three years.The sewer line starting from Dugri which goes upto CRPF colony near Dugri canal bridge damaged an adjoining house in Dugri phase 2 for the second consecutive year last week. Fortunately, the foundation of the house was not damaged and a crater formed in the green belt adjoining the house.The resident of the house, Gagan Singla, said,”The line moves under the green belt adjoining my house. It got damaged for the second consecutive year and a crater formed nearby. The MC should find a concrete solution for the problem and replace the decade old lines which pose grave danger to the lives of residents.”Similarly, the sewer line at Kaka marriage palace road was damaged for the second time in the last three years, resulting in a major road cave-in . The same line was damaged in 2011 and a truck driver died after the road caved-in. In 2013, an 80-feet long rater formed near Dhami eye hospital after the sewer line collapsed.An official, pleading anonymity, said,”Apart from major road cave-in incidents which catch the eyes of residents, minor incidents take place on this stretch almost every year as the lines were installed in 1970s. They collapse after sewer lines are overburdened during rainy season.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu said,”I am aware of the problem and the old storm sewer lines in different parts of the city are being replaced under Smart City Mission at a cost of around Rs 80 crore. Most of the times, roads cave in due to underground laying of wires which damage sewer lines . Civic body officials have also been told to keep a check on this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-four-decade-old-storm-sewer-lines-caused-4-road-cave-ins-in-3-years/story-iOJUjLaMX0fpWwyUc6aw6J.html

On this, he told the court that being a practicing lawyer in Chandigarh he could get his vehicle registered there.When he served a legal notice, he was told that BS-IV vehicles were to be registered before April 1 and now, registration of the vehicle would amount to contempt of apex court order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-asks-chandigarh-admn-whether-date-for-registration-of-bs-iv-vehicles-can-be-extended/story-O0ntiPRqlF1BZA17nP96LM.html

11-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ambience Mall case: HC referred to two apex court judgments while ordering CBI probe||The Punjab and Haryana High Court (HC) on Friday referred to two Supreme Court (SC) judgments pertaining to Haryana land matters when it ordered a CBI probe into the approval granted for the construction of Ambience Mall on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway in Gurugram.While ordering the probe, the HC also quashed three government orders -- one of October 18, 2001 by which eight acres of land permitted to build a residential project was taken out from the purview of the residential housing license, another of October 16, 2001 which gave license to build a commercial project on the eight acres, and the third of September 1, 2010 allowing another 3.9 acres of the residential project for commercial purpose.Justices Rajan Gupta and Karamjit Singh of the HC said the state government’s decision to de-notify the land that was under acquisition led to unjust enrichment of individuals and revealed unholy nexus between the builder and the state authorities.In the Manesar land release case, 688 acres acquired for the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation for creating residential and recreational utilities in the Industrial Model Township (IMT), Manesar, was dropped from the acquisition process in 2007 on the orders of the former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. In 2018, the SC set aside the government order to drop the acquisition proceedings.Mentioning this case, the HC said the state had enabled the builder to enter the field after initiation of acquisition to seek colonisation of the land covered by acquisition defeating the objective for which the land was acquired.“... where power is conferred to achieve a particular purpose, same has to be exercised reasonably and in good faith. Where power is exercised for extraneous or irrelevant considerations, it would unquestionably be a colourable exercise of power,’’ the HC said.In 2016, the SC quashed land release orders and transferred all licences granted granted to private builder to HUDA. The licences were given to a private builder who had sought to develop a colony on 280 acres that was initially being acquired for residential and commercial sectors in Rohtak by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (Huda).Referring to this, the HC said it is a settled proposition of law that fraud on power vitiates the state action. “If state seeks to do some action indirectly though it has no power to do it directly, such action cannot be sustained,’’ the HC said.“We are exploring legal options in this matter and the court order is being studied in detail by the legal team. We will approach the higher court to seek relief in this matter,” said Raj Singh Gehlot, chairman and managing director, Ambience Developers, which has developed the Ambience Mall on Delhi Gurgaon expressway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ambience-mall-case-hc-referred-to-two-apex-court-judgments-while-ordering-cbi-probe/story-0DbWrql4AAX6MjZyAdFuBP.html
11-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab-origin Pritam Singh is leader of oppn in Singapore||Punjab-origin politician, Workers’ Party chief, Pritam Singh, 43, was elected as the leader of opposition by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who won 83 out of the 93 seats in the recently concluded Singapore general election.Singh is a Singaporean with Punjabi ancestry and a practicing Sikh. He is married to Loveleen Kaur Walia, a Singaporean theatre practitioner, and the couple has two daughters.In a statement on Facebook, Singh said: “I refer to PM Lee Hsien Loong’s press conference early this morning. I look forward to serving as the leader of the opposition and will carry out my duties to the best of my abilities. I will endeavour to ensure that The Workers’ Party under my leadership will remain loyal to Singapore and all Singaporeans. On behalf of all WP candidates at GE2020, and on a more personal note, thank you to all our families and loved ones, who have marched in step with us, through all the highs and lows over many years.”Singh has been in active politics since 2011. “Pritam has spoken on a wide range of issues, including foreign affairs and defence, and job disruption faced by PMET workers. In 2020, he called for giving seniors above 60 greater access to their Medisave to settle inpatient and outpatient bills,” the Workers’ Party website says, adding that he assumed chairmanship of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council and oversaw significant improvements in estate and compliance matters.Singh joined the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in 1994, and served as an officer from 1997 to 2002 having achieved the commissioned rank of Major.Earlier, Singapore’s Prime Minister assured it is “only right” that Workers’ Party’s Indian-origin secretary-general Pritam Singh be “formally designated” as the leader of the opposition, and that he will be provided with “appropriate staff support and resources to perform his duties”.Singh, whose Workers’ Party team retained Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC), will have 10 elected MPs now, up from six previously. His fellow member also retained the Hougang single member constituency seat.It was Singh’s first outing as party chief, and he had entered the election aiming to defend the party’s home turf, but by the wee hours of the morning on Saturday, it became clear that he had led his party to another breakthrough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-origin-pritam-singh-is-leader-of-oppn-in-singapore/story-ZrVvwvKwWUHSRREJEs3lOK.html

The 35 ft mural was built by a private bank in the memory of Chawla, who is called ‘Karnal’s daughter’, as she was from the city. Karnal Municipal Corporation Mayor Renu Bala Gupta said the mural will be visible to every person entering the city and that she is an inspiration for the younger generation. Chawla was the first woman of Indian origin to fly a space shuttle and she was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003.“The mural was inaugurated soon after its completion,” the Mayor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugam-girl-students-to-get-passport-with-graduation-degree-from-institution-says-khattar/story-QL0gjHOOmsUGwn5bgk0xUJ.html
11-07-2020||Chandigarh||New technologies, localising components will pave way for boycotting Chinese products: Hero Cycles chairman||A week after cancelling a ₹900-crore deal with China, chairman of Hero Cycles, Pankaj Munjal, spoke to Hindustan Times about alternatives being explored and how investing in indigenously-made cycle components is the future. Talking about the road ahead, Munjal said they are localising components with domestic vendors as well as resourcing from European makers.“Our supplier base has shown great support in this initiative and are now investing in indigenous development of the parts that we would generally import. They understand this needs to be done in an accelerated manner. Our most recently added research and development centre in Berlin is leading the charge in this. Secondly, we are now looking at Germany, which is also our European base, as the alternative source. There are many high-quality suppliers in Europe that already work with our group company, HNF GmbH in Germany, and are more than keen to partner with us for India,” he said.Munjal admits that it was easy to send product teams to China, get quotes and then order. “But it was not right,” he adds. “With German R&D support, we are committed to introduce new technologies to India which would be a credible alternative to the China where IPs and patents remain insecure.”Talking about the impact of the cancellation of deal with China on the price of cycle parts, Munjal says negotiations with European parts suppliers are underway for this. “In many models, our approach is to upgrade the product with higher quality and better functioning German component which may increase the price a little but will tremendously increase value offered to customers by making the product superior in its class,” he added.Talking about the ₹900-crore deal that has been cancelled, Munjal said the time frame for the deal was around five years, which included life cycle of existing models and new models under development for next year. The deal included import of some high-end bicycles and e-bikes which would be readily substituted with German products without much cost impact.It January this year, the R&D centre in Berlin was added, which is part of Hero’s acquisition in Germany, he adds.“Components such as complex alloy frames, bicycle drivetrain, E-bike motor, battery and controllers, wheels and rims and disc brakes are all being imported from China and we are actively looking at indigenisation of these components,” Munjal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/new-technologies-localising-components-will-pave-way-for-boycotting-chinese-products-hero-cycles-chairman/story-auRBolUQywcIW0X1jGDwbP.html
11-07-2020||Gurugram||Haryana class 10 results: Gurugram district topper scores 99%||Seventeen-year-old Gaurav from Government Model Senior Secondary School in sector 4/7, urban estate, topped in Gurugram in the Board of School Education Haryana (BSEH) examinations for class 10, results of which were declared on Friday. Gaurav, who goes by a single name, scored 495 out of 500 marks in the examinations that were held in March. Of the 14,190 students who appeared in the examinations from Gurugram district, 9680 students passed while 1,409 will have to give the examination again. The number of students who did not qualify stood at 3101. The city recorded a pass percentage of 68.22. An ecstatic Gaurav said that the result was much better than what he had expected. “I was hoping to top the school but never expected that I would top the district as well. My parents are extremely happy,” he said.He credited his parents and teachers for their support. “Despite meagre resources, my parents have always encouraged me to focus on my studies. They are overwhelmed with the results and happily sharing the news with everyone,” said Gaurav, who has opted for the Science stream and aspires to pursue engineering after school. He has secured a perfect 100 in math that also happens to be his favourite subject. His father is a carpenter while his mother is a domestic help. The family is from Jharkhand. He has already started preparing for the IIT-JEE examination, “I am studying at home. IIT-JEE is a tough examination and I need to start early since we cannot afford coaching or tuition of any kind.”In an unprecedented academic year marred by the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Haryana board had called off examinations in some subjects after the lockdown was imposed. The board took into account the average of monthly tests for marking the remaining papers. “The declaration of the result was delayed a lot. We were on tenterhooks throughout since earlier also there had been false alarms about results getting declared. There was a lot of uncertainty since we were unsure if the remaining paper would be conducted or not and if we should be preparing for the exam or not,” said Gaurav. Suman Sharma, Gaurav’s principal, said that the school had consistently improved its pass percentage. The overall result of the school was above 94%, she said. “We had started preparing for the boards from last August itself and laid special focus on relatively weaker students,” said Sharma.District education officer Indu Boken said that the district had improved its performance due to the efforts of students and teachers. “The district is on the fifth spot within the state (on pass percentage). We will continue to put more effort in the coming years,” said Boken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-class-10-results-gurugram-district-topper-scores-99/story-6cwDzQQxT1CDVaIJlNTTZI.html
11-07-2020||Gurugram||Second RT-PCR machine installed in the city||Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday inaugurated the second reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test machine in Civil Hospital, sector 10, via video conferencing. With this, the Gurugram government lab’s capacity to test the Sars-CoV-2 virus nucleic material, which causes Covid-19, will rise to 500 samples a day from 200. RT-PCR testing is the gold standard frontline test for Covid-19. Seven private labs in the can conduct up to 500 to 600 RT-PCR tests a day. “The results will be delivered in 24 hours. If required, we can test up to 700 samples every day,” said Dr. Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer. On Saturday, 2345 samples were collected, of which 1789 were taking by health department, including the antigen test. At least 556 samples for RT-PCR were taken by private labs. Since March, more than 60,000 people in the city have been tested for Covid-19. “Since June 24, more than 30,000 tests have been conducted in the city,” said Yadav. Out of them, 16,109 samples were through antigen detection kits, while the remaining 13, 891 are being tested through RT-PCR in both government and private labs. Testing has increased in the last two weeks. Earlier, on an average 1000-1500 tests were being done in a day, which this week increased to almost 3000.Gurugram initially sent its samples to All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS) Delhi for testing. As the cases increased, samples were getting tested in PGIMS -Rohtak, Sonepat Medical College, and private labs too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/second-rt-pcr-machine-installed-in-the-city/story-iAQxWRD7S03gIkP3EOnFzJ.html
11-07-2020||Gurugram||170 new Covid-19 cases confirmed||On Saturday the district had 170 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total count of cases to 6,748, out of which 1,036 are active cases, and 5608 have recovered till now. In the last 10 days (July 1- 10) there were 1,231 new Covid-19 cases, an 18.4% rise from that of the previous 10 days (June 21-30) when it was 1040. Before that it was 1761 (June 11-20), 1772 (June 1-10_ and 535 (May 22 to 31). The health department and district administration officials attribute the latest spike to increased testing.Dr. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of the district, said, “The cases will continue to emerge as more testing is done through rapid antigen kits and reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). But at the same time, recovery rate is almost 83%. The city’s current positivity rate is 11%. Ideally, it should be around 5% as per the World Health Organization ( WHO), but through our interventions in large outbreak areas and containment zones, we are trying for 8% to 10%.”Experts who have been monitoring Gurugram and state Covid-19 data said that the spike is due to unchecked transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 infection. “In the last 10 days, Gurugram saw 18.4% rise in the coronavirus cases detected in the city, when compared to the data of the previous 10 days from June 21 to 30. More testing leads to higher detection of so far undetected infection in the community. But at the same time it also points at the unchecked transmission of the coronavirus among susceptible hosts. Tests are detecting only a portion of such infected lot,” said Dheeraj Singh, data scientist who has been monitoring district’s Covid-19 data. Gurugram currently has the highest number of cases among the 22 districts in Haryana. The total count of the coronavirus cases has crossed the mark of 20,000 in the state to record 20,582 with 648 new cases. Out of these, 4891 are active cases, while 15,394 have been discharged, according to the state bulletin. The Covid-19 death toll in the state stood at 297, out of which 104 are reported alone in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/170-new-covid-19-cases-confirmed/story-w3QLrofLI6BUJfndkFbE2J.html
11-07-2020||Gurugram||In four weeks, active cases in GGM reduce by 50%; recovery rate at all time high||Even as the district’s total Covid-19 case tally rose to 6,748 with the addition of 170 new cases on Saturday, the number of active patients in Gurugram has almost halved over the past month from its peak of 1,999 on June 14, shows health department data. While officials said the trend indicated that surveillance and containment measures in the region have been effective, experts said the apparent turnaround notwithstanding, the district should be cautious.Active cases dipped to 1,036 on July 11 (a 48% decrease). During the same period, the number of reported infections more than doubled, from 3,294 cases on June 14. The district has 30% of Haryana’s total 20582 cases, and 21% of the state’s 4,891 active cases.Gurugram’s recovery rate (at 82%, up from about 50% in mid-June), has helped prevent a rapid build-up of active cases, leaving enough resources to treat those in need of medical interventions. Simultaneously, health department officials explained, surveillance efforts have slowed down the growth of new positives.Dr. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “In early June, the recovery rate was stagnant at 50%. As soon as we increased our testing capacity, it improved to 83% within three weeks. That’s because our surveillance has been able to find and isolate new positives more quickly now, leading to less severe cases of Covid-19 and quicker recoveries. We have also been able to slow down the growth of new positives, which naturally has a positive bearing on the number of active cases.”According to Dr. Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program’s (IDSP’s) district surveillance officer, antigen tests, which is highly specific, have played a key role.“While RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, considered to be the gold standard in testing for Covid-19) tests take at least 24 hours to produce a result, rapid antigen tests have allowed us to isolate over 300 positive cases within 30 minutes of being tested. If the same people had been tested via RT-PCR, they would have continued to spread the virus for a whole day before their results came. From over 200 infections a day in early June, we are now finding closer to 100 new positives daily, suggesting that we have been able to cut the chain of transmission,” said Dr. Prakash.Antigen tests, which have tripled the district’s testing capabilities, have also driven down Gurugram’s test-positivity rate (or TPR, which is the number of positives per 100 tests in percentage), from 23.9% in June to 5.5% in the first week of July. Tests have also increased to close to 2,000 per day, up from an average of 925 tests per day in the last two weeks of June.A reducing TPR with increasing tests, officials said, also indicated that transmission among the community has been curbed, to some extent.“These are the three main numbers which, when viewed in relation to each other, suggest that our response to Covid-19 is on the right track: high recovery rate, reduction in active cases, and a reduced positivity rate. If our response had failed somewhere, we would be seeing much more positive cases through antigen tests,” said Dr. Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, Gurugram.Officials added that, with the drop in active cases, Gurugram’s health care infrastructure is sufficiently equipped to handle a future surge, if it arrives. “At the current rate, we are expecting between 700 to 1000 active cases in Gurugram by the month end, which is manageable. Most will be asymptomatic and will require home isolation or, at worst, secondary care,” said a doctor with the IDSP in Gurugram, seeking anonymity.While he was reluctant to corroborate this, Dr, Ram Prakash said, “There is little chance of our health system becoming overwhelmed in the near future.”“Antigen tests produce more false negatives than RT PCR tests. Since they are making up the bulk of testing in Gurugram at the moment, it’s important to remember that the district’s improvement is based on data from tests that are inherently less reliable than the RT PCR method,” said Dheeraj Singh, a city-based data scientist tracking Covid-19 data in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/in-four-weeks-active-cases-in-ggm-reduce-by-50-recovery-rate-at-all-time-high/story-gmhueX2qWSezfcZnjCK97H.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||AI sacks 200 cabin crew, refuses to withdraw resignations of 50 pilots||National carrier, Air India has terminated 200 of its cabin crew, and has refused to accept the withdrawal of resignations of 50 pilots. These cabin crew were recently inducted in the airline on a contractual basis.As on April 2020, the national carrier had around 4,000 cabin crew and around 1,800 pilots.However, the Air India spokesperson refused to comment on the issue. “These are internal issues on which we won’t like to make any comment,” he said. Airline sources said the 50 pilots had resigned as they had secured a job in private airlines. However, due to lockdown and the current pandemic situation, private airlines did not hire them. Hence, they have put forth their request of wanting to return to Air India.The airline, however, refused to withdraw their resignations and asked them to continue serving their notice period. Top Air India sources said the decision was taken before the management and ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) officials met the airline pilots on July 8.A senior airline pilot said, “We knew about this step by the airline, hence we had written to them and even discussed in the meeting that they should not lay off only the frontline warriors, but deal with all employees, across all the departments equally.”HT had reported that pilots affiliated to two unions (Indian Commercial Pilot Guild and Indian Pilots Guild) representing the narrow and wide-body aircraft, after writing a letter to their chairman Rajiv Bansal on Monday, had asked the management to give percentage cut on gross salary as per individual’s income and implement leave without pay (LWP) for all the employees of the airline on monthly basis.The pilots, in the meeting on July 8, had told the management and MoCA to clear their long-pending 25% dues immediately and allow them to quit Air India with immediate effect in case they fail to implement the LWP for employees.A senior airline official said lay-offs were bound to happen due to the current situation. “The letter from pilots has set things into motion. Otherwise, the airline management was contemplating since March. The appointing authority [heads of the departments] have failed to handle the situation and stand for the employees who are being asked to leave,” the official added.“Since only a few flights are operating due to Covid-19 pandemic making the situation worse, the management should study the non-operating and operating departments and should reduce the workforce accordingly, since its getting difficult for the airline to function as there is no money to run Air India,” said a retired airline official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ai-sacks-200-cabin-crew-refuses-to-withdraw-resignations-of-50-pilots/story-EE9RKZI0aisQGcVwcYI6hJ.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||Homeless man killed for stealing another’s crutches, selling it for liquor||Selling his friend’s pair of crutches to buy liquor cost a 40-year-old homeless man his life. The owner of the crutches along with an accomplice, both of them homeless, allegedly stabbed the man to death and crushed his face in with a stone on a pavement near a park in north Delhi’s Mori Gate on Thursday. Police said after killing the man, the duo slept next to his body as they were drunk and were not in a position to remove and dispose of the body.The crime came to light on Friday when a sanitation worker spotted the body on the footpath and called the police. Both suspects, identified by their first names Karan,32, and Satish,26, were arrested and the knife used in the crime along with their bloodstained clothes were recovered, said deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj. The dead homeless man was identified by his first name, Anil.“The arrested men told us that Anil used to bully them. Anil had allegedly sold off Karan’s crutches in order to buy liquor for himself. The two were angry with Anil over this,” DCP Bhardwaj said.A senior police officer associated with the probe said Karan and Satish hatched a plan to kill Anil. On Thursday, the duo purchased liquor and invited Anil to join them. They drank on the footpath near the park. When Anil became inebriated, the two allegedly stabbed him and then crushed his face with a stone.“The two men then attempted to flee the scene. However, a night patrolling police team spotted them loitering on the road and asked them to stop wandering about. The two returned to the crime spot and slept next to the body on the footpath,” the officer said, requesting anonymity. He said the policemen were unaware of the murder or the body on the pavement.The two men later escaped from the scene early Friday morning. Around 7.30am, the sanitation worker spotted the body and informed the police. A murder case was registered and the man’s identity was established.During the probe, Karan and Satish emerged as suspects in the case. The two were questioned but they denied their role. “It was only when the night patrolling team identified them as the same men who were loitering around the crime scene the previous night that they broke down and admitted to the crime,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/homeless-man-killed-for-stealing-another-s-crutches-selling-it-for-liquor/story-mLSWStg4RMQUztbdvShmQJ.html
11-07-2020||Chandigarh||33 govt primary schools in Ludhiana dist show no improvement in enrolment||The new academic session at government schools started with online classes three months ago amid the Covid-19 outbreak, but, over 33 government primary schools in Ludhiana have shown no improvement in enrolment.There are 993 primary schools in the district and some of those situated in blocks including Macchiwara-1, Sidhwan Bet 1 and 2, Delhon- 2 and Mangat 3 have shown zero progress in enrolment since last year. Of the 33 schools, 13 are from Macchiwara-1 block.The reasons cited by primary education officers are many of these schools are run by a single teacher and population of the village is less compared to others.Government Primary School, Shekh Kutab, situated in Sidhwan Bet 2, has only nine students from pre-primary to Class 5, which is the same as last year. Harbhajan Singh, block primary education officer, Sidhwan Bet 1, said, “This school is run by a single teacher who is making efforts to increase enrolment. But, a private school nearby is providing transport facility and villagers also prefer sending their children there. In many villages, the population is very low due to which government schools have few students.”“I have told teachers of these schools to enhance enrolment and send the report by Monday”, he added. District education officer (elementary), Rajinder Kaur, said, “We have been able to increase enrolment in government primary schools of the district by 28% and schools with low enrolment have been motivated through video conference meetings to improve their student strength. We are gathering data on schools which have enhanced enrolment and require more teachers and rooms to take classes. This will be sent to the state education department to provide the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/33-govt-primary-schools-in-ludhiana-dist-show-no-improvement-in-enrolment/story-ymhYlzZQoown1ZvLzzfCaN.html
11-07-2020||City||Nilje RoB open for traffic after repairs||The Nilje rail overbridge (RoB) on the busy Kalyan-Shilphata stretch, which was closed for repairs on June 15, was reopened for small vehicles on Saturday, by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC).“We completed the repair work in 15 days and the bridge was opened to vehicles on Saturday morning. Although the repair work was completed, we could not open the RoB without proper inspection. We conducted a load test to ensure that it is safe,” said an MSRDC official. The budget for repair work was pegged at ₹24 lakh.According to a notification by the Thane traffic police, heavy vehicles will not be allowed to ply on the bridge.A safety audit of the 50-year-old bridge by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) revealed that the structure is unsafe and recommended authorities to close the RoB immediately for the safety of commuters.The work was carried out in three phases. During the repairs, MSRDC, along with Central Railway engineers, strengthened the concrete slab and steel girders of the bridge. The rusting on the girders were also checked and repaired.The traffic police put a height barrier on the bridge to ensure that heavy vehicles do not ply on it. Heavy vehicles heading towards Shilphata and Navi Mumbai from Kalyan and Dombivli will not be given entry at Katai Naka and will instead have to take the Khoni village route to reach their destination.“Heavy vehicles coming from Shilphata and Navi Mumbai to Kalyan and Dombivli will be stopped at Kalyan Phata and diverted to the Taloja Cement Road,” informed an officer from Kolsewadi traffic police unit.After the lockdown restrictions were eased last month, the closure of the bridge caused traffic snarls on the Kalyan-Shilphata stretch as the vehicles on the RoB was diverted to the parallel bridge, leading to congestion during peak hours. The 21-km-long Kalyan-Shilphata Road connects Kalyan, Dombivli, Bhiwandi, Thane and Navi Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nilje-rob-open-for-traffic-after-repairs/story-7wPvSE1BXBTZ7PsBWVSHNI.html
11-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana industrialists seek quarantine waiver for labourers||As the state government recently issued guidelines regarding the entry of people from other states, industrialists demanded to ease norms for interstate movement of labourers without insisting on 14-day quarantine.The industrialists demanded that the government should allow entry of labourers in the state by screening them and without placing them under 14-day quarantine.President, Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), Upkar Singh Ahuja said, “The industry is working with only 40% workers and production has been badly hit as lakhs of labourers have gone to their native places during the lockdown period. The government should allow them to enter the state by screening them.”Former president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), Charanjit Singh Vishwakarma said, “The new directions issued by the government would further inculcate fear in the minds of migrants who may not return to factories. With production going down, it would also have an impact on the revenue collection of the government.”The industrialists rued that markets have been opened and a huge rush of visitors can be seen at the vends installed on roadsides, but the state government is not paying heed to labour shortage being faced by the industry.President, Dhandari Industrial Welfare Association, Satnam Singh Makkar said, “Every sector has been opened and the government should also allow movement of migrants to the state. If necessary, they can be kept in a quarantine facility for three to four days and should be allowed to work in factories after screening. The government should rather help the industry at this time of crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-industrialists-seek-quarantine-waiver-for-labourers/story-u6CDPOssTLuU3yIj55DX3N.html

He said drones would be pressed into service within a fortnight.Drones would help in giving real-time information in case of pilferage or any untoward situation in the pipeline network for prompt action.“Since the cases of oil thefts are more in the National Capital Region (NCR), it was decided to roll out the pilot project in Delhi-Panipat to ascertain its efficiency. On the basis of the success of the project, aerial monitoring will be extended on the entire Mathura-Jalandhar belt,” said Kumar.The petroleum products to defence installations along the international border with Pakistan and China are met through the Mathura-Jalandhar pipeline.“Any interruption in the supply of petroleum products for civilian and defence requirements would be drastically hampered in case of any damage to the supply line,” said an official. The IOC suffered huge losses due to incidents of pilferage. However, undermining the financial losses incurred in oil thefts, the public sector company said the safety of human lives and the environment was of much higher importance for them. “Plugging oil pilferage is certainly significant, but any incident of leakage and sabotage can lead to losses beyond imagination. There were instances in Haryana when gangs dug a tunnel and stole oil. The IOC wants to give a firm answer to such instances,” said Kumar.Most of the pilferage sites in the NCR were located in agriculture fields, near abandoned water drains, panchayat grounds and forest lands.The IOC said that if pilferages go wrong, they could be a great safety and fire hazard and create environmental pollution, damage to water bodies, spoil natural drinking water facilities, soil and could be harmful to even public property and human life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pilferage-drones-to-keep-vigil-on-mathura-jalandhar-oil-pipelines/story-Njyg1pqelBsQcrZxTUYVhK.html
11-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Testing suffers due to weekend restrictions||On the first day of the weekend restrictions imposed by the UP government, the Ghaziabad police on Saturday said that the city roads wore a deserted look while the restrictions at the borders with Delhi continued. However, officials of the health department said that the testing activities suffered on account of the two-day lockdown.The UP government on Thursday had announced the lockdown which started at 10pm on Friday and will continue till 5am on Monday.“Due to restrictions announced by the government, the traffic on the roads was minimal. There was intensive checking by the police at the borders while barricades were put up on all major roads like done previously during the nationwide lockdown period. Those not wearing masks or moving around without any valid pass were challaned,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).According to the police, about 770 challans were issued to different persons for not wearing mask on roads.“At the borders, we allowed only those persons who had valid identity cards/passes or were engaged in essential services. The movement to Delhi was also restricted as July 11 being a second Saturday,” Mishra added.Meanwhile, the health officials said that only 1,104 samples were taken for Covid-19 test on Saturday during the ongoing drive due to the weekend restrictions. The sampling drive will end on July 12.“This is because the residents did not come out to our camps for testing due to restrictions in place. On Saturday, we could collect only 1,104 samples for Covid test. Generally, we are doing about 3,000 tests per day at present,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.The state government during the restriction period had also asked the local authorities to take up sanitization in different areas in order to prevent Covid-19 spread.“As many as 10 fire tenders were deployed in two shifts of four hours each for spraying of sodium hypochlorite in different areas. We covered 255 areas, including highrise buildings, major markets and public places like railway stations, bus stands, auto stands, etc. On Sunday, we have plans to cover areas of containment zones,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer.In his order issued for weekend restrictions, the UP government on Thursday had stated that all offices, urban and rural haats, markets, grain markets, and commercial establishments will remain closed. All essential services, however, will stay open as before and there will be no restriction on movements of people delivering such services.The government, in a revised order on Friday, had directed that all the industrial units in urban and rural areas will continue to function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-testing-suffers-due-to-weekend-restrictions/story-2G2dcogMXTX61s4ZLU8nIN.html
11-07-2020||City||Maximum cost of Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals in Noida, Ghaziabad capped||The Uttar Pradesh government, in an order issued Friday, fixed price caps for coronavirus (Covid-19)-related treatments provided by private hospitals across the state. The government fixed per day charges which hospitals can levy – Rs 8,000 to Rs 15,000 – for different categories of treatments for moderate, severe, and very severe Covid-19 symptoms. However, there is some confusion as the government order does not mention whether the per-day charges include cost of medicine, laboratory tests or consumables. Costs of treatment differs in private hospitals of tier A, B and C cities, as per the order, which identifies Noida area, Ghaziabad city, Meerut, Kanpur, Lucknow and Agra, among some others, as tier A cities.According to the order, issued by Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (ACS - health), the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH)-accredited super-specialty hospitals are allowed to charge Rs 10,000 (including cost of Rs 1,200 for PPE kit) for moderate sickness (which includes isolation beds including supportive care and oxygen); Rs 15,000 (including Rs 2,000 PPE cost) for severe sickness (which includes ICU without need for ventilator care); and Rs 18,000 (including Rs 2,000 cost of PPE kit) for very severe sickness (which includes ICU with ventilator care).The rates for non-NABH accredited hospitals were stated to be Rs 8,000, Rs 13,000 and Rs 15,000 for moderate sickness, severe sickness and very severe sickness, respectively.“We have received the government order and it has been implemented and forwarded to private hospitals providing paid Covid-19 treatment. However, there is no clarity about charges on medicines, consumables, etc. We will write to the state government on whether the charges include other costs or not,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.In Ghaziabad, the health department has given permission for paid Covid treatment to eight different hospitals which are now contributing with 544 paid Covid beds, overall.For the notified hospitals, the state government pays up for per day treatment at the rate of Rs 4,500 for an ICU bed, Rs 2,700 for high dependency units and Rs 1,800 for general ward to the acquired hospital.“For acquired hospitals, the government pays hospitals directly but for the patient, all Covid-19 treatments are free of cost in government or government-acquired facilities. We now have eight hospitals with 544 beds for Covid-19 patients, on a paid basis, and the cost is to be borne by the patient. The order for the price cap has no specific mention about other charges,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.The district wing of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), however, was of the view that the prices of medicines are perhaps left out of the order due to the variations in prices of individual medicines or lab tests. “We are presuming that rates of medicines, laboratory investigation, etc., are excluded from the prices mentioned in the government order. If such items are included, the price capping will not be feasible for private hospitals as there are many medicines which have high rates and inclusion of their prices will not be feasible,” said Dr VB Jindal, president, IMA, Ghaziabad.The order further states that super-specialty hospitals in tier B and C cities can charge 80% and 60%, respectively, of the charges specified for tier-A cities. The order also mentions that the hospitals will have to reserve 20% of the number of beds for government officers/employees and for patients registered under the Ayushman Bharat Yojna.The state government on May 1 had allowed private hospitals to impart paid Covid treatment where cost was to be borne by the patient in case the hospital is not acquired by the state government.In another government order on Friday, the state government gave temporary permission to private medical colleges to run Covid-19 wards and also fixed charges for different wards for different categories of private medical colleges.Unlike the order issued by the ACS (health), another order issued by Rajnish Dubey, additional chief secretary (medical education), however, specified different charges.The order stated that the package rates will be all inclusive, and will include bed, food, amenities, doctors’ consultation, nursing charges, consumables and all other treatments, including oxygen, blood transfusion, supportive care and physiotherapy.“The package will include medical management of underlying co-morbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cardio-vascular illness and chronic pulmonary/kidney/hepatic diseases. This will include emergency management procedures such as acute haemodialysis, if needed, and non-invasive ventilation such as high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP),” Dubey’s order had stated.The price capping of private hospitals in the state is based on the recommendations of a committee formed under Dr VK Paul, member, Niti Ayog. After complaints of overcharging against private hospitals, Union home minister Amit Shah in June constituted a committee under Dr Paul to fix rates charged by private hospitals in Delhi for isolation beds, ICUs without ventilator support and ICUs with ventilator support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maximum-cost-of-covid-19-treatment-at-private-hospitals-in-noida-ghaziabad-capped/story-CC5rxGMIZEdwYoHavngb9N.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||Heavy rain forecast for next week in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar: IMD||After four days of light sporadic showers across isolated areas in the city and suburbs, the weather bureau on Saturday predicted heavy rain for next week.A yellow alert (forecast for heavy rain at isolated places) was issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar for Monday to Wednesday while the same has been predicted for Thane for Sunday as well.“After a reduction in rain activity as compared to the first week of July, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) can expect more intense showers as monsoon conditions are likely to be active for the Konkan coast from July 12 and north Konkan coast from July 13,” an IMD official said. “Weather systems in the Arabian Sea will intensify westerly winds, which would draw moisture leading to rain increase.”Between 8.30am and 5.30pm Saturday, 4.8mm rain was recorded in the suburbs and 0.2mm rain in south Mumbai. Over 24 hours 8.30am Friday to 8.30am Saturday, south Mumbai recorded 14 mm rain and the suburbs recorded 1.3mm. So far Mumbai has recorded 73% of its July average rain and received 47% of its seasonal average rain.Independent meteorologists said rain will gradually increase from Sunday. “Owing to an increase in the moisture content, intermittent light to moderate showers are expected till Tuesday. A monsoon low-pressure system is expected to develop over east India along with a vortex over north Maharashtra in the mid-week. This could enhance rain in MMR between Tuesday and Thursday,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.Monsoon will be active for Mumbai again from July 15, with heavy widespread rains possible around July 17, said Professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. “The city can expect mostly moderate showers (40-50 mm for 24-hours per day over the next three days) with some places witnessing short spells of heavy rains till July 15. These showers won’t cause much inconvenience. These are likely to be short 15-20 minutes heavy bursts and that too only in isolated areas, and not widespread. Monsoon is still in a mini-break phase over North Konkan,” he said.On Sunday, the city and suburbs could expect cloud cover with few spells of light to moderate rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/heavy-rain-forecast-for-next-week-in-mumbai-thane-and-palghar-imd/story-sqUi7XwlHrXeGjWkwkjM6L.html

The girl has now revealed that she ran away from the house as her father, a cab driver, molested her. The police have now sent the girl to a children’s home and are investigating the matter.According to police, the girl has recently finished her class 10 and stays with her parents and two sisters. Her father works as a cab driver and her mother is house help. The girl, on Tuesday morning, stepped out to buy chocolates and did not return.

He returned to the city by Tuesday evening.The crime branch’s anti human trafficking unit (AHTU) officials came across the girl’s missing poster on social media and started a probe, to help trace her.“We traced her location in Pune on Wednesday after which we brought her back. She has claimed that she ran away as her father molested her. We are inquiring with him and also trying to verify if his other daughters have the same complaint,” said an officer from the crime branch.Since the girl has alleged molestation, she was not handed over to her parents and sent to a children’s home. She will appear before the child welfare committee following which, a further course of action will be decided, said an officer.

However, the flow of traffic at the city borders was smooth, the police said.Police officials have said that only the movement of people involved in essential services will be allowed, along with those holding valid passes, while no new passes will be issued during the two-day lockdown.“Traffic movement was smooth today. The volume was less due to it being a weekend, and only essential services people were allowed to pass through. Those who didn’t have the necessary documents were asked to return. With three lanes open at DND, the traffic was managed properly,” said Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Zone 1.Commuters, too, said that there was less traffic on Saturday morning.“It seemed better than most days. There was checking of our papers, but it took us only a few minutes to pass through DND compared to half-an-hour it takes normally,” said Bulbul Singh, a resident of Sector 75 who works in Delhi.On Saturday, the Noida police registered 18 cases of violation and arrested 62 people, while a total of 1,950 vehicles were checked. Of these vehicles, 973 were challaned, while four were seized, the police officials said, adding that Rs 40,650 was collected in fines. The police are checking 200 barricaded points across the city.The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday had announced for the weekend lockdown starting from Friday night till Monday morning owing to the surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state.Under the guidelines, movement of people will be restricted both within and out of the district. While industries will continue operations, markets will remain shut.“We are monitoring the situation. There is increased police patrolling since Friday night. Our teams will stay on alert and we will continue challaning people for violations as has been happening since the lockdown began in March,” said the DCP.Police personnel also used drone cameras across Gautam Budh Nagar district to maintain vigil and will continue doing so on Sunday as well, the officials said.GB Nagar’s borders with Delhi have been closed since April and the district has maintained its status quo despite relaxations in the lockdown guidelines, the officials said. Traffic snarls, specially during peak hours, have been a concern for daily commuters for the past two-and-a-half months.Nearly 10,000 people had been booked in the district for various violations under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) during the nationwide lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/weekend-lockdown-noida-borders-see-smooth-flow-of-traffic/story-gWzf4lB7A3q9OmX7Tfn3BM.html
11-07-2020||Noida||Noida expedites work on big development projects||The Noida authority will soon start work on several important development projects in the city that got delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic. These projects include ₹100-crore integrated system for traffic management and upgradation of sewage treatment plants, officials said.On Saturday, the Noida authority chief executive officer, Ritu Maheshwari, conducted a review of several projects and issued directions to expedite work on them.“We have reviewed and decided to execute all these projects at the earliest so that residents can benefit from them,” said Maheshwari.For better traffic management, the authority has to put 80 busy traffic intersections under electronic surveillance. Initially, the authority will install high-definition cameras at 80 spots, including traffic intersections, main roads and internal roads. In the second phase, the authority will install cameras on all traffic junctions. All these sites will be connected to a control room, from where e-challans for traffic violations will be issued, the officials said.In October last year, the authority had started tendering process to hire a private agency that can work on the e-surveillance project.“For the e-surveillance project, three private companies have submitted bids. We will finalise one of them at the earliest and start the work soon so that traffic management and policing can be improved in the city,” said Maheshwari.Besides, the authority has to upgrade the 40 million litres per day (MLD) sewage treatment plant (STP) in Sector 168 to 100 MLD capacity and 35 MLD Sector 123 STP to 80 MLD.“As the tendering process is complete, the upgradation work will be started at site from July 31. Once completed, the STPs will treat more sewage, and teated water will help irrigate green areas and save the ground water,” said a Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.Besides, the authority will also focus on making Sector 18 vehicle free zone, installing more LED lights across the city, and starting ‘cycle on rent’ facility at Metro stations on 29.7km Aqua Line that connects Noida with Greater Noida, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-expedites-work-on-big-development-projects/story-IHYuD4MdYLv9gcLu0cIT5O.html
11-07-2020||Noida||Noida govt bodies begin deep sanitisation drive||All government bodies in the Gautam Budh Nagar district – including the development authorities of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway, among others – conducted a ‘deep sanitization’ drive to contain the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, across the district. According to officials, in deep sanitisation, a layer of sodium hypochlorite solution will be sprayed on to all surfaces in public areas, including benches, vehicles, roads, walls, etc., which help kill the virus.The move comes after the government ordered a two-day, state-wide ‘weekend’ lockdown beginning July 11 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease. The government had also directed, in the order, agencies in each district to carry out deep sanitization – a three-day drive which began on Friday – in containment zones, where the risk of infection is higher, said officials. Apart from this, following government instructions, authorities have also started a special cleanliness drive as a preventive step in anticipation of vector-borne diseases which accompany the monsoon in India due to water logging and infestation of disease-causing bacteria and mosquitoes in them, said officials. Commencement of monsoon for this part of the country was announced late last month. The season typically lasts till September.“All industrial as well as municipal bodies are engaged in deep sanitisation for three days in containment zones across the district. The sanitization, crucial to break the chain (of the Covid-19) disease) will be conducted in all areas where active cases are located,” said BN Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.There are 257 containment zones in category I, mostly multi storey buildings, where active Covid-19 cases are located. There are 56 containment zones in category II which are located in sectors with plotted houses. According to officials of the Noida authority, it is focusing on at least 200 containment zones, which are important due to the number of cases from there, apart from other Noida areas. For this, the authority has deployed at least 400 people along with 40 tankers, six fire tenders and some small machines to carry out sanitisation with sodium hypochlorite solutions.“We are conducting deep sanitization in all areas, which are part of containment zones, including multi-storey buildings, slums or villages. We have also sanitised commercial areas, particularly Sector 18, where footfall is higher as compared to other areas. Shopping malls, offices and other buildings are to be sanitised by building owners,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer of the Noida authority.The Greater Noida authority has deployed at least 200 staff members, 10 tankers, four fire tenders and other machines to sanitise around 50 containment zones.“We have directed the staff to maintain proper cleanliness in all villages, sectors and multi storey towers. Sanitisation in containment zones is a priority to contain the spread of Covid-19,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) has also started a sanitisation and cleanliness drive.“We have deployed two sanitisation workers each in 80 villages and also taken up the sanitisation drive as per government instructions,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of the Yeida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-govt-bodies-begin-deep-sanitisation-drive/story-EX5088bx6biQZIvKrIS2JM.html

In the second incident yesterday at the same spot, at 10.45pm, a truck carrying chemical drums overturned as driver lost control over vehicle due to over speeding.Santosh Kadam, chief of resident disaster management cell, said, “These accidents happened near Nagla Bunder at a sharp turn. The chemicals were not hazardous therefore there was no need to worry but we have informed Thane traffic police and Kasarwadwli police to keep a check post over there so that vehicle will slow down while taking a turn. The roads are empty due to the lockdown and therefore these drivers come in speed and lose control of the vehicle and toppled.”According to Kasarwadwli police officers due to Covid-19 lockdown the barricades were removed but they were put again on Saturday with the traffic police and Kasarwadwli police bandobast. “We were short staffed due to the pandemic and had removed the barricades, however after the three accidents the barricades are now installed at the spot to ensure that the drivers slow down and avoid a major tragedy,” an officer from Kasarvadavli said.

I thank you for giving me the opportunity to work for the party,” Bhat posted on his Facebook account.Bhat said over the phone, “We can sacrifice our lives for the nation, but not of our children. I have been attacked twice in the past, yet nothing has been done about it. I have not been given even a single personal security officer.”The politico informed that he would send his formal resignation to J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina in due course of time.“They (militants) are not only targeting us but our families too. We have not been given any security and accommodation in a secured place. Now, our families are at risk,” he said.Bhat claimed that many BJP leaders like him in north and south Kashmir were scared after what had happened to Sheikh Waseem Bari and his family.“We have got small children.

The past one week has seen the highest number of cases and deaths in the Valley, creating lack of hospital beds and shortage of space as currently 38,509 are under home and administrative quarantine.SKIMS (Bemina) chest medicine department head Prof Javaid Malik, who is also a member of the apex council, said they had sent several recommendations to the administration regarding medicines and other things. “We have recommended home isolation of asymptomatic patients and once the same is approved, it could be implemented across J&K,” he said adding that it is crucial to observe how the virus would behave in the next two to three weeks, especially in Kashmir.“I have conveyed to higher officials that we should try home isolate asymptomatic patients to reduce the burden on quarantine infrastructure and the same should be done at the earliest,” said Dr Syed Masood, superintendent, Baramulla Government Medical College and Hospital.He said they were creating additional 40 beds with oxygen and other facilities to meet the demand. “We had created 110 beds at Baramulla indoor stadium. It has been occupied completely and almost all the patients have no symptoms,” he added.Earlier this week, after space at Covid-dedicated hospitals in Srinagar got exhausted, additional 140 beds were arranged at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital, however, still the patient load, especially those with bilateral pneumonia, has increased and the doctors are worried. They have asked people not to ignore the SOPs.A senior consultant at Government Medical College and Hospital, Srinagar, said asymptomatic cases need to be at home. “Our beds are being occupied by asymptomatic patients, while sick patients are being referred from one place to another. The authorities should change the rules soon or the circumstances would force them to do that and things would get more complicated,” the consultant warned.People, however, are blaming the administration for not taking things seriously in Kashmir.“When the cases are rapidly increasing, the administration is watching like a mute spectator. People are not wearing masks and nobody fines them. Also, parks and gardens have been thrown open and at many places religious functions are being organised. This is adding to the problem,” said Bilal Ahmad, a social activist.Meanwhile, two deputy commissioners from Baramulla and Kupwara districts of north Kashmir have announced closure of shops and business establishments at several places in the districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/facing-space-crunch-doctors-urge-j-k-admn-to-home-quarantine-asymptomatic-patients/story-Q3eih46qd8gBtKHPhJj3kM.html
11-07-2020||City||Indian heritage: 4 centuries of priceless art with royal family on display in UK||London Priceless paintings and manuscripts from India gathered as gifts and other acquisitions during centuries of British engagement will be on display at a unique exhibition in Edinburgh from July 23 to January 21, the Royal Collection Trust said on Friday. Held in the Royal Library in Windsor Castle, the Royal Collection contains one of the finest south Asian paintings and manuscripts in the world, including the Mughal era ‘Padshahnama’, Tipu Sultan’s Quran and the story of Prahlada from the Bhagavata Purana, 1775–90, by the Nainsukh family workshop. Most of the items will be on display for the first time in Scotland in the Queen’s Gallery in the Palace of Holyroodhouse in the exhibition titled ‘Eastern Encounters: Four Centuries of Paintings and Manuscripts from the Indian Subcontinent’. “Tracing more than 400 years of literary and artistic output, the exhibition offers new insights into the shared history of the British monarchy and the Indian sub-continent”, the trust said. The items include those from the beginning of the British engagement with India, with the formation of the East India Company in 1600. The 17th century was a period of instability for the British monarchy, but in south Asia the Mughal empire was at its zenith, richer and stronger than any European power, the trust noted. It said: “The extraordinary splendour of the Mughal court was captured by artists in intricate paintings and manuscripts. George III was given a number of these magnificent works, forming one of the greatest collections of South Asian works on paper outside the subcontinent”. “In 1798, Lord Teignmouth, Governor-General of India, presented the King with six volumes as gifts from the Nawab of Awadh. Among these was the mid-17th-century Padshahnama (‘Book of Emperors’), an illustrated chronicle commissioned by the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah-Jahan as a celebration of his reign and dynasty, described by Teignmouth as ‘the most splendid’ Mughal manuscript he ever saw”. The rise of the East India Company was reflected in the gifts of manuscripts presented to successive British monarchs on behalf of the company and by company officers. Detailed architectural drawings were commissioned from local draughtsmen by Colin MacKenzie, the Scottish Surveyor-General of the Company. A pen and ink drawing from 1800 shows an elevation of the temple at Srirangam, one of the most important Hindu pilgrimage sites in India. The collection includes a posthumous portrait of Maharajah Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Punjab, 1842, was sent to Queen Victoria by his successor, Sher Singh, in an unusual jewel-encrusted gold frame with a letter of belated congratulations on her marriage and the birth of her first son. It will be displayed in the exhibition alongside a sketch of his son, Maharaja Duleep Singh, by Queen Victoria. She received many books written about or dedicated to her from India, including a volume of her own published journals, The Queen’s Travels in Scotland and Ireland, translated into Hindi by the Maharajah of Benares. During Queen Mary’s visit to India in the early 20th century, she acquired numerous works of art, including Queen Tissarakshita, 1911, by Abanindranath Tagore, founder of the Bengal School of Art, and several Pahari paintings, which will also be on display.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indian-heritage-4-centuries-of-priceless-art-with-royal-family-on-display-in-uk/story-zAjCPrHEWZcFWDdvcPwqmN.html

Figures from the police department reveal while eight people were killed before the lockdown, between January 1 and March 22, the number of those murdered rose to 27 with 19 more homicides.Among these 19 cases, seven victims (37%) were allegedly killed by their own family members, including their husbands, wives and fathers, whom they were isolated at home with.Police investigation found marital discord behind five of these seven cases, including three uxoricides, where men killed their wives on suspicion of infidelity.In another case, a man stabbed his wife to death with a pair of scissors on June 30 after she moved court against domestic violence on June 30. A woman had strangled her husband to death after he tried to rape their daughter in drunken stupor in Sundar Nagar on the intervening night of May 23 and 24. She was arrested.A 75-year-old retired Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO) official was killed by his wife and son following a disagreement in C Block of the posh BRS Nagar on June 10. Police had arrested his wife and son.In a case of filicide, not pitching in house chores had led to the murder of a 22-year-old man by his 65-year-old father, who attacked him with a pan and a wooden log in Jagir Colony of Tibba on June 6. The accused had also tried to burn the body to conceal the crime.Police had solved a Rahon Road case where an elderly man had his nephew murdered by hiring a contract killer following a monetary dispute. All accused were arrested.City-based psychiatrist Dr Rajiv Sharma attributed the diminishing marital ties to increase in time being spent on social media. “Like others, couples are also spending long periods of time on social media, instead of giving each other attention, which leads to differences and even suspicion,” he said.“The police investigate all murder cases thoroughly to establish the motive. There are many factors for rise in murders within the family, including doubt on partners and depression, which cause rift between couples,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP, Headquarters) Akhil Chaudhary.MURDERS DRIVEN BY MONEY Eyeing easy money, two teenagers had kidnapped their 16-year-old friend on July 8 for Rs 50,000 in ransom, but bludgeoned him to death with bricks after things didn’t go as they planned. They were tracked and arrested after they called the victim’s father anyway for the money. They were booked for murder by the Salem Tabri police.Three people were killed in separate cases of robbery during the lockdown.KILLED BY CO-WORKERSThe lockdown also saw two cases of murders by co-workers, where liquor was involved.On March 2, a courier company employee had bludgeoned his colleague to death with a bamboo stick and iron rod at their office at Gill Road. The duo had consumed liquor together before the incident. More recently, on July 7, a sewing machine factory worker murdered his co-worker for chiding him to coming to work in an inebriated condition in Guru Gobind Singh Nagar.In other cases, police had established old enmity as the driving factory behind two murders, while a Salem Tabri woman was killed after she was attacked with bricks by her neighbours in a case of road rage.UNSOLVED CASESMystery shrouds two murders, including that of a 42-year-old woman of Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar, a tony locality in the city. The woman was alone in her rented accommodation, while her husband was stuck in Nanded, Maharashtra, due to the countrywide lockdown. Police are still looking for clues behind the murder as nothing was stolen from the house. The discovery of a 52-year-old labourer’s body in Gonspur Road, Humbran, also remains unsolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-saw-murders-treble-in-ludhiana-seven-victims-killed-by-kin/story-E09TzuWYH8gvTUmPhC1PhP.html

Two AK rifles and war-like stores were also recovered from the encounter site,” said Kalia.A pistol, four grenades and Pakistani currency were also seized at the site, he added.A senior police officer said, “We have identified one militant as 23-year-old Idrees Ahmad Bhat of Kupwara. He had gone to Pakistan via Wagah border. The other militant is yet to be identified.” Idrees has been associated with Lashkar-e-Toiba.The area where the encounter took place falls under the jurisdiction of strategic 19th Infantry Division, and the forests of Naugam, due to proximity with LoC, are being used as infiltration routes by the militants, especially during summers. The area has recently witnessed ceasefire violations more than three times.19th Infantry Division GoC Major General Varendra Vats said there are indications that launching pads in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir are active and 250 to 300 militants were waiting to infiltrate into the Indian territory.Some senior officers claimed that several times, under the cover of ceasefire violations, the infiltrators have sneaked into the Valley from across the LoC.So far, eight to ten youths, including Idrees, who crossed over to Pakistan from Wagah border and returned as militants, have been killed in different operations in the Valley, officials said.Local militant Abid, who police claim was involved in the killing of BJP former district president Wasim Bari and his family members in Bandipora, had also gone to Pakistan through Wagah and joined Lashkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-infiltrators-killed-in-north-kashmir-s-naugam-sector/story-I1jOk7moSUPPZRLMDK4WDK.html
11-07-2020||City||21-year-old stabbed to death, cop suspended for not registering a case||New Delhi: A 21-year-old call centre employee, who was also pursuing his BA degree through correspondence from Delhi University (DU), died at a government hospital in central Delhi on Thursday, eight days after he was stabbed by a group of robbers near Pratap Nagar Metro station in north Delhi.A sub-inspector (SI) has been suspended while the station house officer (SHO) of the Gulabi Bagh police station was removed from his post for not registering a first information report (FIR), police said. The call centre employee was robbed of R1,200 and stabbed at least three times in his thigh and abdomen by the robbers.Joint commissioner of police (central) Suvashis Choudhary, said, “Instead of filing an FIR and taking prompt action against the robbers, the sub-inspector closed the matter just because the complainant and his family members gave in writing that they did not want to pursue the case, as he won’t be able to identify the robbers. The SI should have taken suo-moto cognizance. The SHO has been sent to district lines since supervision of crime-related calls and registration of cases were his responsibility,” said Choudhary. The dead man, Lakhan (identified only by his first name in police records), lived with family in Shastri Nagar in north Delhi and worked at a call centre in Anand Parbat. His family has alleged that the police did not register a case when the crime took place on July 1. The FIR was registered and the suspects were arrested only after Lakhan succumbed to his wounds at the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital on Thursday (July 9).The family has also alleged that Lakhan was not given proper treatment at Aruna Asaf Ali hospital, where he was admitted after he was injured in the attack on the intervening night of July 1 and 2. They blamed the doctors for discharging him after stitching his wounds.Lakhan’s father Pooran, who works as a salesman in a departmental store, told media persons that his son was returning home from office when he was attacked and robbed. “We had got a call from the hospital that our son was injured. We reached there and Lakhan told us about the robbery and attack. We asked the doctors to operate him but they discharged him after preliminary medical attention,” Pooran told the media persons.When contacted, Dr Sumant Sinha, medical superintendent (MS) of Aruna Asaf Ali hospital, refuted the allegations and said that the doctors cleaned the wounds and gave requisite injections and medications.“The patient’s family was asked to bring him to the surgery OPD the next day (July 2) so that a senior doctor can see the case. However, the patient was not brought to the hospital. His wounds dressing was done probably by a quack or an inexperienced doctor because of which infection spread to his body and damaged a kidney. The patient was brought to the hospital on July 7 when his condition had deteriorated. We cleaned the wounds, started intravenous antibiotics and sent blood sample for investigation. Since a surgery followed by dialysis was required and dialysis facility is not available in our hospital, we referred the patient to RML hospital in an ambulance” said Dr Sinha. The family alleged that the local police was informed about the crime and Lakhan’s injuries by the hospital authorities. They alleged that a sub-inspector reached the hospital, enquired about the incident but did not register a case.On allegations of police inaction, deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said, “We suspended the sub-inspector after the allegations were found true.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/21-year-old-stabbed-to-death-cop-suspended-for-not-registering-a-case/story-KJge2ITEMdZ2HSbsLLImCI.html

11-07-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Promote students automatically? Now is the time for innovation in education||The Chandigarh education department is planning to reduce the course load of students amid the Covid-19 lockdown for Classes 1 to 8 in government and aided schools of Chandigarh. The Central Board of School Education (CBSE) has already announced a 30% cut in the syllabus for classes 9 to 12. UT district education officer (DEO) Harbir Anand has said that the department is planning to “reduce the syllabus for Class 1 to 8 to minimise the load of students in the lockdown.”A committee, comprising school heads, teachers and education department officials, will be constituted to recommend the sections of the syllabus that can be omitted this year.One needs to view the scenario as an unprecedented one, requiring careful manoeuvring with one objective in mind: That of the welfare of students. How will they derive the maximum benefit from this situation?Even if it is a pruned syllabus, they should be taught the basics of each subject in the quickest possible time to ensure all bases are covered, and that they lose out on nothing in the short time they have left to complete the courses.Encouraging them to do simple experiments at home with more focus on learning and observing, getting them to debate with teachers or classmates, watching informative documentaries related to their subjects on YouTube or educational TV programmes will help. Assignments can be delivered online and through post/courier to assess their performance.Peer learning processes too can be adopted.The focus should not be on how quickly they cover a truncated syllabus, but how much knowledge they absorb and grow at a time when lives have been turned upside down because of the pandemic.Innovation is key. Children have been locked up at home for months now. A short and smart curriculum that also focuses on their mental and creative development and allows them to have fun while learning should be drawn up with the advice of academic experts.To reduce stress, options to automatically promote students to the next class at the end of the session should be explored. In their free time, help them with yoga classes, exercises, quiz contests and spelling bees with attractive prizes to keep the competitive spirit alive.Parents and guardians should also be involved in the entire learning process this year to academically cover as much ground as possible.Schools in Chandigarh have been closed since March and many students have been facing an added challenge as they do not have the facilities to attend online classes. Roping in NGOs, retired teachers to take additional classes online or through social distancing in community centres can also be considered.Lives are precious, young lives more so. This year, the focus should be on them, their mental health and their safety, even if it means not opening schools at all this year.CLASS ACTWhat’s the best way to help students this year? Should students be promoted automatically this year in unprecedented Covid times? How can they cover all bases and have fun while learning even if the syllabus is pruned?

To my mind, it is not only the most ancient but also the most challenging among the sculptural techniques.” Professor Tirthinkar said, “Roshan’s imagination has the wings of freedom. His being in the constant company of children as an art instructor has helped him not lose his creativity and observation with child-like simplicity.”NTU-PU identify research areas for joint initiativesAn online meeting was held between the University Institute of Engineering and Technology(UIET), PU, and Nottingham Trent University (NTU) for taking forward the activities of the Science and Technology Partnership Centre(STPC) that was inaugurated at UIET on February 4 this year.The objective was to plan future research initiatives through the NTU-PU STPC. As many as 11 faculty members from NTU and 10 from PU attended the meeting. Some of the areas that were identified for synergy in the research included implantable medical devices, smart sensing prosthesis, wearable external devices, body part regeneration and engineering, systems biology, and functional foods. Given the current limitations, the consultative group will converge the twin-university teams around these subjects and conduct area-specific online meetings through the next three months.Indo-US webinar: Safe lab work with SARS-CoV-2 operations discussedThe department of biotechnology, PU, and Sandia National Laboratory, USA, in collaboration, organised an Indo-US webinar which covered issues such as how to strategise responses to lab emergencies while working with Covid virus; risk communication to tackle infodemics; and ways to transport the virus samples safely across research labs and national and international borders.

11-07-2020||Chandigarh||Fund-starved MC puts Chandigarh’s first pet dog park on hold||Residents hoping to enjoy the day with their pets at the city’s first pet dog park will have to wait longer, as the municipal corporation (MC) has stalled the project due to severe financial crunch.Announced in February, the facility, touted as a dog recreational facility, was to come up on 1.5 acres in Sector 42 at a cost of around Rs 50 lakh.But, with the civic body running a deficit budget and struggling to meet even its establishment costs, it has decided that no funds can be spared for the ambitious project.Confirming this, MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “MC doesn’t have adequate funds to start any new project. MC will not be taking up the dog park project because of financial constraints.”The facility, which would have been north India’s first dog park, was mooted by Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore.As per the 2019 animal census of the UT animal husbandry and fisheries department, there are around 11,100 pet dogs in Chandigarh, up from 9,800 in the 2012 census.Figures collected from MC reveal that it has so far registered around 8,000 pets ever since the bylaws came into force in 2010. Though the city has 1,800 small and big neighbourhood parks, pet dogs are not allowed there. Hence, the dog park was planned as an exclusive park for them.The park’s concept, based on one in Hyderabad, incorporates a number of facilities, like swimming pool and swings meant for pets, equipment to train pets and veterinary doctor for vaccination, besides the facility for pet dog registration. Depending on the success of the first dog park, MC had planned more in other sectors of the city.MC, however, has not permanently junked the idea. “The project is still workable, but not in this fiscal, unless, additional funds are allocated for it,” Yadav said.MC FLOATS TENDER FOR DOG STERILISATION To restart dog sterilisation in the city after a gap of nearly eight months, the civic body has floated fresh tenders for the animal birth control programme with a few changes to elicit better response.Since August last year, MC has floated tenders thrice, inviting private companies to undertake sterilisation of dogs. The tender floated in August last year found no takers. The one in December 2019 got only one bidder. Similarly, only one applicant qualified in the tender floated in February this year.Stating that tender conditions had been tweaked to attract more applicants, Dr Amrit Warring, head of the sanitation department and medical officer of health (MoH), said, “Earlier only NGO recognised by the Animal Welfare Board of India could participate in the programme. But now, veterinary doctors with degrees can also participate.”Meanwhile, as per an MC General House resolution, MC’s in-house staff has been deputed to carry out the sterilisation programme till a private entity is roped in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fund-starved-mc-puts-chandigarh-s-first-pet-dog-park-on-hold/story-UrNZD6CSeaPMhuIg2XQvcL.html

The DHS Punjab suggested that a WhatsApp group of doctors from PGIMER as well as from Punjab and Haryana should be made so that any Covid-19 emergency case can be discussed on the phone and necessary consultation can be provided, which was agreed upon.Recently, the UT administrator had ordered that the PGIMER director should hold a meeting with Punjab and Haryana to finalise a protocol for admission of patients coming from other states. PGIMER director Jagat Ram said, “After Punjab governor’s intervention, the decision of referring patients of other states after consultation with the institute’s nodal officer was taken primarily for Covid-19 patients. Other sick patients can also be referred after taking PGIMER’s doctors opinion. Around 30-40% of emergency patients in PGI are from Punjab, and 20% patients are from Haryana.”The PGIMER director has time and again raised the issue that patients who do not require tertiary care medical facilities are flocking to the institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-to-appoint-nodal-officer-to-deal-with-referrals-from-punjab-haryana/story-6OTGsD5UrTvHMsvBbnX0aL.html
11-07-2020||Patna||Kanhaiya Kumar to campaign for Bihar assembly polls from August, says CPI leader||Amid indications that the Left parties are keen to join the Grand Alliance for the forthcoming Bihar Assembly polls, the Communist Party of India (CPI) has begun preparations to launch former JNU students’ union president Kanhaiya Kumar for campaigning from August.The party is also keen on using the 33-year-old leader’s star power to bargain for a bigger share of seats to contest the Bihar assembly election.State secretary of CPI, Satyanarain Singh, confirmed that Kanhaiya Kumar, who is out on bail after being arrested on sedition charges in February 2016, will campaign for the party in the forthcoming polls.Singh said the Grand Alliance must recognize the youth leader’s popularity among the youth. In early February, Kumar had undertaken a statewide tour of Bihar called the ‘Jan-Man-Gan’ yatra to oppose the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).“Kanhaiya Kumar is a big draw among the youth and has the ability to garner votes. We feel the Grand Alliance would benefit from his popularity during campaigning. He will come to Bihar in August,” he said.Kanhaiya had contested the Lok Sabha polls of 2019 from the Begusarai seat and had finished second by polling 2.69 lakh votes against BJP’s Giriraj Singh, who won the seat eventually.Hints of the CPI joining the Grand Alliance initially came after the recent meeting of Congress’s Bihar in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil and Singh in Patna. Sources said the CPI was set to put forth a demand for 40 assembly seats from the Grand Alliance.In the 2015 Assembly elections, the party had contested on 81 seats and garnered only 1.4% votes. The CPI has no MLAs in the state but has two MLCs.“We are keen on joining the Grand Alliance to defeat the NDA. But we want a respectable number of seats,” Singh said.Asked whether the Grand Alliance would consider giving 40 seats to the CPI, the party’s state secretary said the RJD-Congress combine had already paid a big price by not aligning with it in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “Kanhaiya had come second in the Begusarai parliamentary seat whereas the RJD candidate came in third. In 1990s, we had a strong presence of 26 MLAs in the RJD-led government,” Singh said.The CPI-ML (liberation) and CPM too are said to be in negotiations with the Grand Alliance leaders. “We will hold talks with the Grand Alliance leaders on seat sharing after July 20. The process has got delayed due to the lockdown in Patna,” said CPI-ML’s state secretary Kunal. A delegation of the party had met RJD’ state president Jagdanand Singh 10 days back for formal talks on the alliance but nothing concrete has come up so far.Evidently, the demand for a bigger share of seats from Left parties is going to throw up a new challenge for the RJD in stitching a broader alliance amid the growing rift in the Grand Alliance over demand for a co-ordination committee and resistance against Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as the chief ministerial face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/kanhaiya-kumar-to-start-campaign-for-bihar-assembly-elections-from-august/story-rwxaOVMC0ZEoVTalO03VXO.html

Twelve former ITI students were placed in GS Auto International Limited, GT Road Dhandari and seven have been shortlisted by the company. Pan Engineers situated in Bhai Himmat Singh Nagar, Ludhiana hired 14 students and shortlisted one in the virtual job fair.Amid the pandemic, shortage of labour was a major concern in industries and to provide employment to ITI students, the virtual job fair was conducted through Zoom and WhatsApp video calls.Sukhjinder Singh, 26, said, “After completing my course from ITI Ludhiana in 2018, I started a welding shop but due to the lockdown, it remained shut. However, I was informed by the ITI principal regarding the virtual job fair and I decided to appear in the interview. Luckily got selected by Hero Ecotech as a welder.”A former student of ITI, Ludhiana, Rohit said, “I completed the fitter two-year course in July last year and then did CNC programming course. Due to the lockdown, I was unable to look for a job. Last month, I participated in the virtual job fair and got hired as a fitter by Farm Parts.”ITI principal, Baljinder Singh said, “In the times of Covid-19, it was important to conduct virtual job fairs so that our students can get employment. We took this initiative and around 90 employers participated in the first round of the fair held last month. So far 325 students have got job offers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-325-former-iti-students-get-job-offers-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-C94oq9sppRBni8lEB3z7qN.html

The committee, comprising officials of the border security force (BSF), customs, intelligence bureau (IB) and the Land Port Authority of India (LPAI), had conducted a trial after a detailed review meeting.“The trial was conducted in the presence of senior officials of various agencies, who had come from New Delhi, but it failed to produce a successful result. A truck packed with various goods, and concealed narcotics and weapons, was scanned, but the scanner didn’t detect the concealed items,” said a senior customs official.LPAI’s in-charge Sukhdev Singh said, “Some technical errors were detected during the trial on Friday. Two engineers from New Delhi will now come to fix the glitch.”The ₹23-crore project was announced in March 2017 by the then Union minister of state for home affairs, Kiren Rijiju. Of the five truck scanners imported from the US, the first one was installed here.Last year too, the customs officials had expressed dissatisfaction over the working of the scanner. Since the foundation stone of the ICP was laid in 2010, there has been a demand for a scanner as manual checking of vehicles by customs officials and sniffer dogs is not 100% error free, and has sometimes led to clearing of contraband.In July last year, the special cell of Delhi police had seized 50kg heroin from a cold storage located in Haryana’s Sonepat. The consignment had reportedly entered India through Attari ICP in a truck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/23-cr-truck-scanner-at-attari-proves-a-dud-fails-to-detect-narcotics-weapons/story-9RrxOtDVOkG0BjIaGYDWdI.html

The first patient, a 72-year-old man from Pathankot, was admitted to the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H), Ludhiana, on June 20 with moderate symptoms and respiratory issues, while the second patient from Jalandhar was admitted to the hospital on June 21. Both were suffering from comorbidities and were kept on ventilator support. After assessing their condition, it was decided to administer plasma therapy. The plasma was arranged from a Patiala-based donor through Government Medical College, Patiala. “Their condition improved with the help of plasma therapy and supportive care,” said Dr Bishav Mohan, member of Covid task force constituted by the state government.While the first patient is set to be discharged from the hospital, the second patient was still under observation, he added.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said that the two patients undergoing treatment though plasma therapy had recovered. “The proposal for creating a plasma bank is in the pipeline. We have kept a log of patients who have recovered from Covid-19, and are eligible to donate plasma,” said Bagga. He said that besides DMC&H, Christian Medical College and Hospital and SPS Hospital were also offering plasma therapy.Dr Mohan said that the government had decided to set up a state-level plasma bank in GMC, Patiala, and had asked other districts to create a plasma bank. “I believe this would immensely help in the treatment of severely ill patients,” he said.Dr Rajesh Mahajan from DMC&H said, “We have all the equipment (separator) in place and we are expecting that soon cured patients will come forward to donate plasma. However, not every Covid-19 positive patient can be a donor. ”Dr M Joseph John, head of the department of the clinical haematologist at Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC&H), said, “In the present situation, plasma it is the only treatment available for Covid-19.”Ludhiana’s first Covid-19 patient to be administered convalescent plasma therapy was ACP Anil Kohli. However, the treatment failed and his condition deteriorated, said Bagga.In plasma therapy, the antibody-rich plasma from a recovered patient is extracted and administered to a patient. The blood of a convalescent patient is rich in antibodies that are expected to help the critical patient recover||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-covid-19-patients-treated-with-plasma-therapy-recover-in-ludhiana/story-GkZvfQZ3STf134ZuBibDRN.html

11-07-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Russell’s viper causes maximum deaths||A landmark international research project analysing data across 20 years of snakebites in India has come to the conclusion that it was the Russell’s viper which accounted for the maximum number of bites followed by kraits and cobras. The research estimated that in the period 2000-2019, a staggering 1.2 million people had died in India due to snakebite, a very neglected tropical disease, or at an annual average of 58,000. As a comparison, official Covid-19 deaths in India have crossed 22,000.According to the World Health Organisation, which took on record the research study, India accounts for nearly half the globe’s snakebite deaths. “The WHO has set the target of reducing by half the number of (global) deaths due to snakebite envenoming by 2030 and India’s efforts to prevent and control this disease will largely influence this global target,” the WHO said. That official data does not reveal the scale of snakebite deaths is revealed by the fact that the government of India’s figures for the years, 2003-2015, show only 15,500 deaths in government hospitals. The government figures are one-tenth of the 1,54,000 snakebite deaths detected during the same period from public and private hospitals by the research project.The research study titled, Trends in snakebite deaths in India from 2000 to 2019 in a nationally representative mortality study, was conducted by the Centre for Global Health Research, University of Toronto, with Indian and UK partners including legendary herpetologist, Rom Whitaker, a Padma Shri awardee. The study was released to the public on July 7, 2020. Though snakebite deaths are prevalent in northwest India, the States of Punjab and Haryana fall in the lowest-risk category. Around 70% of the deaths occurred in limited low altitude, rural areas of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana), Rajasthan and Gujarat. “Snakes are a vital part of our ecosystem as rodent controllers and are important in religion and mythology. India’s tremendous snakebite burden is staring us in the face and we need to act now!” said Whitaker. Community education on snakebite prevention coupled with enhancement of rural health care could bring down the number of snakebite deaths. To repair the gross under-reporting of deaths in India, the study recommended that the government of India designate and enforce snakebite as a ‘notifiable disease’ within the integrated disease surveillance programme. Accurate snakebite data are essential if the government of India’s strategies to reduce snakebite deaths are to succeed.“The study shows the need of the hour is to strengthen rural health care and resources, an investment for the future, particularly at this challenging time of the Covid-19 pandemic,” adds Whitaker. UNICORN OF THE MORNI HILLSWhile Sambars are easily glimpsed by those travelling through the Shivaliks, the Himalayan Brown goral and the Barking deer remain elusive even to wildlife enthusiasts. While the Barking deer spurts off at great speed down nullahs, the goral darts around steep cliffs having caught a glimpse of humans a long way off. A goat-antelope as it is described by scientists and as Van Bakri by some Morni locals, a passionate wildlifer has procured a unique picture of a goral with one of its two swept-back horns missing. Haryana IAS officer and special secretary, home, Rajesh Jogpal, is habituated to forays at dawn or dusk around Panchkula for taking Nature pictures.“One fine evening after I came back from office, I took my camera and accompanied by a friend went on a long drive on the Panchkula-Morni Road. I saw two wild animals grazing on the hill. One of them was a goral and the other a female Sambar. I was amazed to see the goral with one horn, I felt it was a kind of the mythical unicorn. I enquired about the the goral’s one-horned condition from the director, Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, Dr Dhananjai Mohan, and renowned wildlife scientist and field biologist, Dr AJT Johnsingh. I was told by Dr Johnsingh that either a genetic deformity had led to the one-horned goral of Morni or that one of the horns had broken off and would subsequently grow back.”If the horn had broken off, then it could be because of an accident or fall while the goral was negotiating the rugged and precipitous terrain of the Shivaliks. The experience of gorals maintained in captivity at Chhatbir zoo reveals further that dominant males are compulsive head-butters and can break off a horn while waging aggression against rival males. One such male, which was confined in a solitary cell at Chhatbir to enable vaccination, got so annoyed that it broke one of its horns by repetitively banging its head against the door! Chhatbir zoo officials have also observed that in an estimated 40% of the female gorals in captivity, the growth in the two horns is mismatched and is not as even and prominent as the horn pairs of males.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-russell-s-viper-causes-maximum-deaths/story-QXqgLv7NiBHASqEEMnRfIN.html

A total of 14,716 people have recovered so far while 613 have died, according to the .stet health department.During this period hospitals facilities, groceries, milk, vegetables, medicines and other daily use items will be available, also already scheduled Medical exams will be held.Under Unlock 2.0 the Karnataka state government has already announced complete lockdown on five Sundays in the state starting from July 5 to August 2.The spike in Covid-19 cases had triggered speculations that the government was considering extending it to Saturdays too. The government aims to control the spread of the virus by restricting the movement of people.Despite the complete lockdown on Sundays, essential activities and marriages already fixed on those days have been permitted by the government.Hours before Yediyurappa’s statement , his deputy C N Ashwath Narayan said lockdown helps in restricting the movement of people. “But with lockdown you can only postpone the spread and not eradicate it,” he said, according to PTI.He also said that the government would also have to consider the impact of the lockdown on the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/complete-lockdown-in-bengaluru-urban-and-rural-districts-from-14-22-july-as-covid-19-cases-rise/story-TctwpLlf3Qo6gMi9IfZdrJ.html
11-07-2020||Chandigarh||Hindi Chini not Bhai Bhai||The other day I stepped out to do grocery shopping. As I walked through the market, I passed by a toyshop and my mind flew to our little seven-month-old granddaughter. And I thought of buying a sipping cup for her.The shopkeeper showed me a couple of sippers. All of them, though American brands, were ‘Made in China’. An alarm bell went off in my mind; it was saying, “Hindi Chini not Bhai Bhai.” I told the salesman, “I don’t want to buy anything Chinese. Can you give me an Indian brand?” He said, “Madam, I don’t think you will find it anywhere.” I left the shop disappointed and needless to say empty handed.Back home, I told my daughter-in-law that if there was no Indian sipping cup available, it would be better to start using a normal glass from the kitchen because I could not bring myself to buy a Chinese product. In my heart I felt miserable. The Chinese had taken over or should I say ruined our plastic industry among many other industries.My home is in Sector 18, the hub for buying electronics and crockery in Chandigarh. Most of the electric fittings like lights, switches, cables, chandeliers available in the market were made in China!A visit to a crockery store made me realise that there was nothing but made in China stamps on plates, glasses, tablemats, curios, decoration pieces, centre table pieces, crystal, trays, flasks… I realised that this was only the tip of the iceberg.Back home, I heard my children discussing huge Chinese investments in Paytm, Byju’s, Ola, Flipkart and Swiggy. I felt sick.I recalled that a few years ago I needed to buy small idols of Ganeshji and Lakshmiji for our office. I had found the right size idols made of POP/marble dust in a shop in Sector 19, but soon realised that something about them was different – the little traditional touches that an Indian artisan would put were missing. It was clear to me that these had been made by the Chinese, with moulds probably fashioned in their country, I opted to buy brass idols that resembled the Gods we pictured in our mind’s eye.Sadly, the Chinese have invaded our idol making market too, with images of Rama, Krishna, Shiva etc. I have not bought Chinese lights on Diwali for years. And on Holi I insist on buying only herbal colours.The day I heard the news that the Indian Government has banned 59 Chinese apps, I felt like someone had applied balm on my aching heart. I knew it was time each one of us resolved to stop buying Chinese products.Every bit mattered. It would take some time for us to weed out all the Chinese stuff which had entered out homes, but at least we could resolve not to buy more.Slowly I am sure India would be able to produce everything that we imported from China and we would become self-reliant. The intermittent phase could be difficult no doubt but what had to be done had to be done.The government could make policy decisions but unless the people fell in line the progress could not be manifest. That is because every drop goes to make the ocean! priya@tandonindia.comThe writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hindi-chini-not-bhai-bhai/story-OIfizgnyi6sUnfu47C0sVK.html

11-07-2020||Chandigarh||When girls swooned over Kapil Dev and other lessons learnt||The activity calendar in colleges today is packed with events, much in contrast to the scenario a few years ago when we used to have just three mega events – prize distribution, convocation and sports day. While the first two functions were solemn, academic in nature, the annual sports function in the Chandigarh college I taught in used to be a two-day extravaganza celebrated with much fanfare and zest. The opening day ceremony began with the march past by smartly turned out contingents of various classes to the tune of a military band followed by various track and athletic events.The end of the first day of the event was reserved for the much applauded staff race or musical chairs. As a member of the faculty, though I never won the coveted top position, I had the privilege of finding myself on the victory stand at the third place quite a few times.The second and the final day of the event used to be a formal affair when guests and dignitaries were invited. Besides other celebrities from various walks of life, eminent sports personalities such as the legendary Milkha Singh, superstar Kapil Dev and cricketer Dinesh Mongia graced the occasion from time to time.However, two events, exceptional and special, remain etched in my memory. Having led the Indian team to victory in the World Cup final in 1983, Kapil Dev was already a legend and a sports star when he was invited to preside over the annual sports day function. He was hesitant to be the chief guest, but agreed after much persuasion on the condition that he would be able to spare just two hours for the visit.Keeping in mind his tight schedule, the event was planned accordingly. Kapil Dev was expected to leave immediately after the function, but to our utter surprise he lingered on. After the kind of attention he got in an exclusive girls’ college from the adoring students, he seemed to be in no hurry to go.The college authorities had a tough time containing the students who swooned over him and mobbed him.I also can’t forget how we, the staff members, had to act as his security, cordon off the area to give him a safe passage and how our principal, Mrs Mahajan, heaved a sigh of relief when he left.Equally memorable is yet another sports day when Jaspal Bhatti, cartoonist, humorist and comedian, was the guest of honour. True to his television show, Ulta Pulta, all arrangements went topsy-turvy when a night before the final function, it rained heavily flooding the grounds. However, our energetic and dynamic principal decided to go ahead with the function and have it indoors.It was a unique, unforgettable sports day with the march-past and the guard of honor taking place not at the sports ground but in the corridors of the college building.The lessons learnt were: ‘Come what may, the show must go on.’ Life doesn’t always go according to plans. We must adapt to every situation and try to be happy.Coming to the present day scenario, the pandemic has brought upheaval in our lives, but we need to ‘re-invent’, ‘re-learn’ and ‘re-adjust’ to the new way of working. We must follow the new norms: Maintain social distance, wear masks and ensure hand hygiene, but the work must go on.rama_1177@yahoo.co.inThe writer is a Chandigarh-based freelancer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/when-girls-swooned-over-kapil-dev-and-other-lessons-learnt/story-GSOYk0HUlA2UCYZlAqBXZI.html

The health department is suggesting the residents avail temporary contraceptives for birth control.Dr Rajesh Kumar Bagga said that Punjab health and family welfare department is celebrating Population Stability Fortnight in the state from July 11 to 24. This fortnight aims to promote reproductive health, and reduce maternal, neonatal and child morbidity and mortality. Dr Bagga said, “As patients are reluctant to visit the hospital for permanent treatment due to the spread of Covid-19, we have offered them a bucketful of alternatives for birth control.” He emphasised on adopting new methods of family planning like Chhaya pills, antra injection and IUCD.He said that this year’s theme stressed the need for stabilising population in the times of Covid. He added that the basis of a strong nation and family depends upon bringing stability to a growing population even during pandemic like this.He also encouraged eligible couples to adopt permanent family planning methods such as tubectomy and incisionless sterilisation for males also known as vasectomy and persons adopting these permanent methods are given adequate monetary compensation by the government.District family welfare officer Dr SP Singh said that every year July 11 is celebrated as World Population Day. This day is celebrated to raise awareness about the world’s growing population. At present, the total population of the world is 7.8 billion (780 crore). China is the most populous country in the world while India is the second-most populous country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/world-population-day-covid-19-restricts-birth-control-access-impacts-family-planning-campaign-in-ludhiana/story-Q4gdno1aVC99o67GbYQJDJ.html
11-07-2020||City||India will soon witness a myriad of possibilities emerging out of digital education: Patiala college principal||An online symposium on ‘Teaching Practices – Shifting Paradigms’ was conducted by the Gujranwala Guru Nanak Institute of Management and Technology, Ghumar Mandi on Saturday. More than 2,000 people including educationists, researchers and students from all across India and abroad participated in the event.President, Gujranwala Khalsa Educational Council (GKEC) and former vice-chancellor, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, SP Singh said that the platform intended to have deliberations on the inequities and challenges surrounding access to education amidst Covid-19 along with the viability and the pros and cons of the altered digital educational paradigms. Adjusting to the virtual classroom experience is less about adapting to the use of new technology, since most virtual learning platforms are fairly intuitive, and more about adjusting to a new style of learning, said Professor Manjit Singh Chhabra, director of the institute.Ronki Ram, fellow and dean (faculty of arts), Shaheed Bhagat Singh Chair Professor of Political Science, Panjab University, Chandigarh presented his views on virtual teaching vs classroom interactive sessions. He said, “Only when the virtual teaching provides the full range of instructional connection points available in a traditional classroom will it begin to be a viable educational model”. He added that in these challenging times, tools, resources and tips are plentiful, but it is important to find the ones that really work.While Khushwinder Singh, principal of MM Modi College, Patiala deliberated on the topic “Paradigm shifts in education”. He opined, “With the internet becoming far more affordable and accessible, going ahead, there will be greater convergence of digital and traditional teaching-learning mediums”. He added that with the government taking radical steps to come up with policies to boost the digital education market in the country, we are soon going to witness a myriad of possibilities emerging out of digital education to empower the youth of the country.Hardeep Singh from Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar while expressing his views on ‘ICT intervention in education in current times’ said that digital education is the future of learning in India that will take the country to a new pedestal of socio-economic growth and prosperity. He added that digital education is helping in pioneering the concept of collaborative learning where all the minds can converge to create a unique learning experience that transcends national boundaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/india-will-soon-witness-a-myriad-of-possibilities-emerging-out-of-digital-education-patiala-college-principal/story-8HxHwpOfme8TyVuAjDeuxN.html
11-07-2020||Chandigarh||Only the wise learn how to read between the lines||‘Meaning isn’t always found in the words themselves but rather in the spaces in between the lines,’ writes American writer Michelle Sandlin.No, I am not referring to reading between the lines as a literary device to decode the text but as an art and activity to be practised in our daily social interactions, and I learned this lesson the hard way.In the initial years as a college teacher I was staying in the college hostel with a few other faculty members, including the vice-principal, an elderly vivacious lady, who became a guide and guardian for us young faculty members.Just one month after I joined college I had to go home to Chandigarh for the August 15 Independence Day holiday. After submitting my station-leave in office, I was packing my bags when a peon from the college came with my application in hand asking me to see the principal in her office. The words, ‘Can’t allow, see me’ in green ink on my application stared at me. With great disappointment and trepidation, I left my packing incomplete and went to her office, wondering why she had summoned me and if I had done something wrong by submitting the station leave.Once in her office I placed the application on her table. Her stoic countenance made it difficult for me to ascertain her mood. “You see, it’s Independence Day tomorrow and there is going to be a flag-hoisting ceremony in college and the presence of the staff is mandatory. So I can’t allow you to leave the station,” she said.When I responded that I was required at home because of a family function slated for the day, she surprised me by saying: “But I can’t allow you,” and turning her face towards the window added, “You can go without telling me.”Failing to understand what she meant, I protested that I could not defy the rules and disobey her, to which she smiled, for a moment making me feel as if my naivety and vulnerability as a new entrant were ridiculed.As I stood there, wondering what to do, she gently pushed the application towards me and repeated, “I can’t give the permission, you can go without telling me,” as her smile grew broader. Disheartened, I dragged my feet back to the hostel and ran into the vice-principal at the entrance. To her question, “You are still here?” I choked and narrated the whole story to her. Laughing, she tore my application, and said, “Pick up your bag and run, you fool! What else is she trying to tell you?”That day I became a little wiser, understanding that one should be smart enough to read beyond the words because everything doesn’t get written down in black and white.On my return, after two days, I found the principal (who lived in the principal’s house next to the hostel) and the vice principal out for their evening walk.As I wished them “good evening,” both looked at each other and smiled as I peevishly rushed inside the hostel.njkaur1953@gmail.comThe author is a retired English professor based in Patiala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/only-the-wise-learn-how-to-read-between-the-lines/story-s7piJGq4P9SBavSatAtjsM.html

The decision to hold the meeting was taken on Friday after a delegation of SGPC members, including Kiranjot Kaur and Sewa Singh Sekhwan, met Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh and urged him to order an independent probe rather than having it investigated by SGPC members. Sources said the jathedar is now planning to hand over the probe to retired Sikh judges to ensure a fair probe. SGPC senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta said, “The 267 missing saroops will be the sole agenda of the meeting.”Some sources also said a resolution could be passed regarding the CBI’s plea against the investigation being conducted by the Special Investigation Team constituted by the Punjab government to probe sacrilege incidents in 2015. However, no functionary of the gurdwara body confirmed it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/267-missing-saroops-sgpc-emergency-meeting-today/story-fE6YCvyEx3ZV4Jad2U8YyO.html
11-07-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER to study common errors healthcare workers make while removing PPE||With the rise in Covid-19 cases among healthcare workers, the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research(PGIMER) has decided to study the common errors made by them in removing their personal protective equipment (PPE). Around 27 healthcare workers in the hospitals of Chandigarh, Panchkula, and Mohali have tested positive, many of who acquired it while tending to the Covid-19 patients. It takes 30 minutes each to put on and remove the PPE worn by healthcare workers looking after Covid-19 patients.The act of removing the PPE is more important than that of putting it on as it is a high-risk activity and needs to be done in enough time as a single breach in the procedure will directly bring the healthcare worker in contact with the virus.Sukhpal Kaur, a faculty member of PGIMER’s National Institute of Nursing Education (NINE) and a principal investigator of the project, said that they are studying the errors healthcare professionals usually make even after the live instructions are passed onto them.“The analysis is underway, but there are several mistakes which they can make like the sequence in which the PPEs should be removed and scrubbing and washing of hands, all these aspects will be covered which will help decrease the spread of the virus,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-to-study-common-errors-healthcare-workers-make-while-removing-ppe/story-8LrXoUG8wpQUF9RhsvQ0JJ.html
11-07-2020||City||Amritsar train tragedy: GRP SIT dilutes charges, gives clean chit to cops, MC and rly staff||The Government Railway Police (GRP)’s special investigation team (SIT), which was constituted to fix criminal responsibility in the Dussehra train tragedy, filed a chargesheet against seven organisers of the event, including a close aide of Navjot Singh Sidhu, without making their arrests.The SIT has diluted charges against the accused besides giving clean chit to the police, railways and the municipal corporation employees, who were indicted in magisterial and judicial probes, in the chargesheet, which was filed before duty magistrate Harpreet Singh on June 6.On October 19, 2018, a speeding train had mowed down 61 persons and injured more than 100 people who had gathered for Dussehra celebrations at Dhobi Ghat near Jaura Phatak in Amritsar. The GRP had registered a case under Sections 304, 304 (A), 337 and 338 of the IPC against unidentified persons.In the chargesheet, the SIT named Dussehra committee’s president and Congress councillor’s son Saurabh Madan alias Mithu Madan, general secretary Rahul Kalyan, cashier Deepak Kumar, secretaries Karan Bhandari and Kabal Singh, press secretary Deepak Gupta, and executive member Bhupinder Singh as accused under Sections 304 (A), 337 and 338 of the IPC.GRP Amritsar SHO Sukhwinder Singh, who is a member of the SIT, said, “During the investigation, the SIT had found that the accused didn’t commit the crime intentionally. So, Section 304 was removed.”Section 304-A of the IPC simply consists of imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or both. Contrary to it, Section 304 of the IPC contains imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine.According to law experts, the chargesheet filed in court without arresting the accused will be helpful in getting early bail. The court had summoned the accused on July 30.In the chargesheet, the SIT told court that “all accused are influential and possess political status. With arrest of the accused, disruption of law and order situation can’t be ruled out.”Advocate Sarabjit Singh Verka of the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO) said, “The chargesheet was filed secretly with a clear motive of saving the accused. To make the case strong, the SIT should have arrested the accused and interrogated them before filing the challan. Even, the chief guest of the Dussehra event Navjot Kaur Sidhu was not questioned in the probe. It shows that the accused are more powerful than the SIT.”He said, “The chargsheet, which appears to have filed in favour of the accused, has also not added any criminal charge against the police, railways and MC employees, who were held responsible for negligence in the magisterial probe.”A SIT member, on condition of anonymity, said, “Departmental action against seven policemen who were responsible for giving security clearance to the organisers, the then GRP SHO Balbir Singh, and four employees has already been initiated. They were not found to be criminally accused during the probe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-train-tragedy-grp-s-sit-files-chargesheet-without-arresting-accused/story-8Mhy3xa0ygGaXevQdgptlJ.html
11-07-2020||Chandigarh||Social distancing goes for a toss amid patient influx at PGIMER emergency, trauma centre||With a huge influx of patients at the emergency ward and trauma centre of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) amid the new relaxations, authorities are grappling to ensure social distancing. With more than 350 patients crunched into a space that can accommodate 150 patients at a time, the chances of infection amid the pandemic outbreak are high. PGIMER authorities say they have installed 30 cubicles each at the emergency ward and advanced trauma centre, besides segregating the area into red, orange, and green zones for triaging of patients; but due to the rush, these measures are rendered ineffective. The PGI Nurses Association had earlier written to the authorities for restricting the number of patients as social distancing between the patients’ bed was becoming impossible. PGIMER director Prof Jagat Ram said, “We have set up cabins to separate two patients from each other and maintain social distancing but there is a tremendous rush at the emergency ward. If one patient has Covid-19, the infection won’t be transmitted to another patient admitted there. As there is a space crunch due to the newly adopted approach, sometimes we accommodate two patients in a cubicle at a safe distance.”He added that the problem is more as patients from neighbouring states who can be treated at the district-level are reporting here. “They (district hospitals) should not send patients without consulting the institute doctors first. On a usual day, it is acceptable but since there is a pandemic outbreak, they should restrict the numbers and deal with the cases locally and only refer genuine cases to the tertiary care hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-amid-patient-influx-at-pgimer-emergency-trauma-centre/story-a4axtk8R2TVP8nnZ8oquBI.html

The waived loans were disbursed by the bank between January 1, 2019, and October 1, 2019. The court held that the issue of interest could be decided in a later hearing.The division bench of justice SV Gangapurwala and justice RG Avachat of the HC at its Aurangabad bench, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by agriculturist Kishore Tangade through senior advocate SB Talekar, was informed that the sowing season had commenced in June. Talekar submitted that thousands of agriculturists were eligible for loans but only 49.62% had been approved by the bank after they paid interest on loans taken the previous year.The bench was informed that though loans of the previous year had been waived off by the state government, the bank insisted on collecting interest accrued, and only those agriculturists who had paid the amount – some by selling their gold ornaments – had been disbursed a fresh loan amount.Talekar submitted that though the state government, under section 79A of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, had directed the banks to disburse loans to eligible agriculturists on January 17, 2020, the bank had not complied. As a result of this, thousands of agriculturists were unable to undertake sowing activities, which would result in no crops and future losses.The state, through government pleader DR Kale, reiterated the petitioner’s submissions and said that though the bank had already been compensated for the waived amount, it had held back disbursement of fresh loans. Kale further submitted that the bank was bound to comply with the January order of the government.The bank, however, submitted that it was considering challenging the January order of the government. Representing the bank, advocate RS Deshmukh submitted that the decision not to disburse fresh loans was taken by the board of directors. He claimed that if the interest was not collected and fresh loans were disbursed, the bank would suffer financial losses.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that as the January order was in force, the bank was bound to comply, even if it planned to challenge it. HC directed the bank to disburse the loans to eligible agriculturists, sought a compliance report and posted the matter for hearing on July 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-directs-aurangabad-bank-to-disburse-loans-to-farmers-for-kharif-season/story-V9vFzpK8lIVxXhJD31ZY6H.html

The incident had taken place on a vacant plot in Pandori Gola village. The victims were digging a pit to retrieve a dumped explosive consignment, when it went off. Rejecting the plea, principal magistrate Anuradha held that the bail is being denied in the best interest of the juvenile, as, if released, there is a likelihood of him being exposed to unknown criminals or moral, psychological or other influences that would defeat the ends of justice. “The Juvenile Justice Act is not only meant for the applicant/juvenile but also for upholding the interest of children in its care and protection,” read the order.The National Investigating Agency (NIA), which is probing the case, in its reply on the bail application, had stated, “The applicant is a member of a terrorist gang whose motive is to establish Khalistan. Such types of activities are a threat to national security and disturb the peace, integrity, unity of the nation. If the applicant is released on bail, he may be further exposed to these types of terrorist activities.” The NIA also submitted that the allegations against the applicant are of heinous nature and so bail should not be granted. Advocate Jaspal Singh Manjhpur, who filed the bail plea on behalf of the applicant, said, “This is unfortunate that Indian courts consider keeping Sikh children behind bars justice. Secondly, inclination toward a particular ideology is not the ground for denying bail to anyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2019-tarn-taran-blast-bail-plea-of-juvenile-accused-dismissed/story-DSw2xoAnzgHfZTF1UElIUK.html

The department had issued a show-cause notice to him on April 18, as he was not following the state’s guidelines. But he did not submit his reply.”“Also, he was not coordinating with his seniors. Dr Shiv Charan will now perform the assigned duties at Amritsar Dental College,” the notice adds.Reportedly, Dr Charan was the main complainant in the alleged personal protection equipment (PPE) kits scam, the inquiry for which is in process.The alleged purchase scam surfaced in April when doctors, nurses and other medical staff at the hospital refused to use the 2,000 kits saying they were substandard and did not have N-95 masks. They had also accused the authorities of paying around ₹41 lakh for the kits, which according to them should not have cost more than ₹7 lakh.Dr Charan had complained to then GMC principal Dr Sujata Sharma and said the kits were substandard and not fit for use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-gmc-s-covid-19-nodal-officer-suspended-after-court-stay-on-transfer/story-892SPTgXom58VgHanuHReO.html

This year, incidents of scab disease have been reported from Kullu, Mandi and Shimla. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to prevent the progression of the disease. The following advisory must be followed by the orchardists to effectively manage the diseases,” he said.Stating that the university is alert about the situation, Kaushal said it has been ensured that the scientists working in various departments, Krishi Vigyan Kendras and regional research stations located in the areas from where such incidents have been reported are providing required inputs to control the problem. “The scientists are also visiting the orchards,” he added.As per the advisory, mid-hill farmers have been asked to use sprays of propineb @0.3% (600gm/ 200L water) or dodine @0.075% (150gm/ 200L water) or metiram 55% + pyraclostrobin 5% WG @0.150% (300gm/ 200L water) among others for the management of apple scab, while metiram 55% + pyraclostrobin 5% WG @0.150% (300gm/ 200L water) or fluxapyroxad + pyraclostrobin 500 SC @ 0.01% (20ml/ 200L water) have been recommended for fighting premature leaf fall and alternaria leaf spot in apple.For low hills, orchardists have been advised to use sprays of propineb @0.3% (600gm/ 200L water) for the management of apple scab, while tebuconazole 50% + trifloxystrobin 25% WG @0.04% (80gm/ 200L water) is recommended for the management of premature leaf fall, and 20-25 days before harvest, the sprays of metiram 55% + pyraclostrobin 5% WG @0.1% (200gm/ 200 L water) will help with apple scab and alternaria leaf spot management.The university has advised the farmers to strictly follow the spray schedule recommended by it and take all safety precautions while undertaking the activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-orchardists-advised-on-managing-apple-scab-premature-leaf-fall/story-qmP06sntK9ieNQkvJt9qhM.html

Congress workers are sharing photos of the posters on social media, too. The poster announces a reward of Rs 1,100 for anybody who gives information about Kher. While the Congress camp wants to know why she does not attend the UT administrator’s war-room meetings on Covid-19, Kher rebuts their claims, saying she is very much in Chandigarh and working from home in these times of social distancing. In a video released on social media, she said she is in touch with the UT administration and working for the welfare of residents.Mohali’s Jawaharpur village back on the edge after Covid returnsDeclared Covid-free for a month, Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi sub division of Mohali district is back in the grip of coronavirus. Seven new cases in the past three days have put the spotlight back on the village on the Chandigarh-Ambala highway. Life was limping back to normal after 46 cases turned Jawaharpur into a containment zone and forced the district administration to impose strict restrictions in April and May. Residents are praying that the virus stays away for they don’t want to return to the dark old days.Jaswinder Kaur case has CBI and UT police at loggerheadsThe recent corruption case against Chandigarh Police inspector Jaswinder Kaur, who has been placed under suspension, has put the police and Central Bureau of Investigation at loggerheads.

On normal days, the track is occupied by vehicles loading and unloading furniture and related material or vehicles of customers or even display furniture, leaving cyclists with no choice but to squeeze in with the traffic. While in other parts of the city a fine of Rs 1,000 is slapped for parking on the cycle track, here there is no check on defaulters.Chandigarh mayor turns problem-solver on TwitterActive on Twitter in Covid times, Chandigarh mayor Raj Bala Malik has earned the reputation of being a problem-solver. For city residents, posting their complaints with pictures of garbage heaps and blocked water drainage, Malik gets the issue sorted out and even posts a picture of the spot after the work is finished much to the satisfaction of Tweeple.Fined for speeding, they don’t know where to pay upEven as the Chandigarh Traffic Police have started using the automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system to issue e-challans, some residents are still unclear about how to pay e-challans. The traffic police’s official website is set to be inaugurated soon and only fines of offences involving impounded vehicles are being accepted at the Traffic Lines in Sector 29. As a result, many who want to pay the fine for speeding are unclear on where to do so.Inputs by Hillary Victor, Munieshwer A Sagar, Shailee Dogra and Rajanbir Singh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tricity-buzz-ht-chandigarh-reporters-tracker-on-all-those-making-or-faking-news/story-YqnJjRjXZBcHOPUOc7qdQM.html

It was not possible to hold exams without any studies. So we have asked universities to cancel exams and promote students to next semester on the basis of past results or some other progressive method of evaluation,” he said.Sisodia said even though it was not possible to conduct final year examinations, providing degrees to students for jobs and future academic pursuits was necessary.“We have asked the universities to cancel final year exams and come out with some formula of evaluation for awarding degrees,” he said.Sisodia also hoped that the prime minister will take cognizance of the chief minister’s request to cancel exams of all central universities across the country and soon issue some direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-cancel-upcoming-exams-of-universities-under-it-due-to-covid-19/story-p3DZCd9XApKyjziHPSpJXK.html

11-07-2020||Mumbai||Proactive screening helped curb Dharavi’s coronavirus spread, says BMC||With the WHO lauding the efforts taken to contain the spread of the Covid-19 in Mumbai’s Dharavi, one of the world’s largest slums, the local civic body said proactive screening with the assistance of private doctors and community support helped it in the fight against the disease.World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had said during a virtual press conference in Geneva on Friday that there were many examples from around the world that have shown that even if the outbreak is very intense, it can still be brought back under control.“And some of these examples are Italy, Spain and South Korea, and even in Dharavi - a densely packed area in the megacity of Mumbai,” he had said.The Asia’s largest slum, which was once declared a Covid-19 hotspot, has managed to flatten the curve of the viral spread.Talking to PTI on Saturday, Kiran Dighavkar, Assistant Commissioner of the G North ward of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said the civic body had to change its traditional approach of waiting for patients, contact tracing, isolation and home quarantine to begin proactive screening instead.“Proactive screening helped in early detection, timely treatment and recovery,” he said.At least six to seven lakh people have been screened in Dharavi, while 14,000 persons were tested and 13,000 were placed in institutional quarantine with medical facilities and community kitchen for free,” the senior official said.The efforts taken by the civic authorities and the local participation is evident from the doubling rate of the virus in Dharavi, which is spread over 2.5 sq km and has a population of 2,27,136 per sq km.According to the official data, while in April, the doubling rate was 18 days, it gradually improved to 43 days in May and slowed down to 108 and 430 days in June and July respectively.As many as 2,359 Covid-19 cases have been recorded in Dharavi so far, of which 1,952 patients have recovered from the deadly infection, while there are only 166 active cases at present.However, achieving this monumental feat was not easy for the local authorities, who had to overcome their fair share of challenges.“At least 80 per cent of Dharavi’s population depends on 450 community toilets and the administration had to sanitise and disinfect these toilets several times a day,” Dighavkar said.Social distancing was next to impossible in Dharavi, where families of eight to 10 people live in 10x10 hutments and residents have to walk along narrow lanes lined with crowded tenements on either side, he said.Apart from the congested slum pockets, Dharavi, is also home to several small-scale leather, pottery and textile manufacturing units. The area has 5,000 GST-registered enterprises, 15,000 single-room factories and is a hub of international exports with an annual turnover of 1 billion USD. “Our approach to tackle the virus was focused on four Ts - tracing, tracking, testing and treating,” he said.Doctors and private clinics, as part of proactive screening and fever camps, covered as many as 47,500 houses, while 14,970 people were screened in mobile vans, the official said. Apart from this, special care was taken for the elderly residents and 8,246 senior citizens were surveyed, he said.Manpower was a major issue for organising fever camps and proactive screening in high-risk zones, Dighavkar said.“We mobilised all private practitioners. At least 24 private doctors came forward and the civic body provided them with PPE kits, thermal scanners, pulse oxymetres, masks, gloves, and started door-to-door screening in high risk zones and all suspects were identified,” he said.Later, all medical practitioners were asked to open their clinics and alert the civic body about suspected patients, he said, adding that all private hospitals were also acquired for treatment.The civic body also had to ramp up institutional quarantine facilities and used schools, marriage halls and sports complexes to house suspected patients, he said.“Under the guidance of municipal commissioner I S Chahal, a 200-bed hospital was set up in record 14 days with oxygen supply,” Dighavkar said.There was a strict enforcement of lockdown in the containment zones, during which only critical patients were moved out of the area to other hospitals and 90 per cent were treated in Dharavi itself, he added.Community participation was crucial to contain the spread of coronavirus in Dharavi and local community leaders were appointed as “Covid yoddhas” (warriors) to address the concerns, the senior official said.According to him, grocery kits and food packets were distributed in containment zones to prevent the movement of people and this helped in a big way.Taking to Twitter, the civic body thanked the WHO for acknowledging ‘Mission Dharavi.“We partnered with citizens to chase the virus from one of the most populous blocks of the city. With your guidelines and community efforts, we will beat Covid-19 one block at a time by tracing, tracking, testing and treating,” the BMC tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/proactive-screening-helped-curb-dharavi-s-coronavirus-spread-says-bmc/story-tHUGYGbnHC6TF4iALeeO3J.html

As many as 2,542 violations were recorded by the Indian Army till June 30.South of the Pir Panjal, the army lost nine soldiers in the Rajouri and Poonch sectors this year. A senior official, on condition of anonymity, said, “In 2016, Pakistan had violated ceasefire violations 228 times, in 2017 the violations rose to 860. In 2018, they almost doubled to 1,629. In 2019, there were a staggering 3,289 ceasefire violations.”“This year, till June 30, Pakistan has violated the ceasefire 2,542 times and we anticipate more violations,” he added.India and Pakistan, both of whom possess nuclear weapons, had mutually brokered a truce deal in November 2003, which of late has been left in tatters.Both countries have reiterated that in case of an issue, restraint will be exercised and the matter will be resolved through the mechanism of hotline contacts and border flag meetings at local commanders’ level.‘15-16 terror launch pads across LoC’“However, Pakistan has always backtracked from its commitment because it has to export terrorists from terror factories operating on its soil. There are around 150 terrorists in 15 to 16 terror launch pads across the LoC waiting to infiltrate to this side of the border,” said the officer.The 3,289 violations recorded last year were the highest in 16 years. The officer also said that in 2019 the Northern Command lost two officers, three junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and 72 other ranks along the LoC and in anti-terror operations in Jammu and Kashmir.“This year, we have lost nine bravehearts at the Pir Panjal range,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pak-intensified-ceasefire-violations-amid-indo-chinese-standoff-2-542-violations-recorded-till-june-30/story-kCqEYSgbsbPaCzAf0xM7DN.html

The offence of rape is on the minor. It is an offence against the state and society. The submission that the mother and the victim want to withdraw the complaint, as allegations are not true, is rejected,” observed the special court while rejecting the accused’s bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pocso-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-man-accused-of-raping-minor-daughter/story-KQouap3Oukjw26PcKdPcRP.html

11-07-2020||Chandigarh||More returnees, respiratory disorders, weather conditions contribute to increased Covid-count in Valley||Apart from the large number of returnees in Kashmir, population, lifestyle diseases and weather conditions are responsible for the spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths in Kashmir valley, which has comparatively fared worse than the Jammu region.Both regions have 10 districts each. As per the 2011 census, Kashmir has a population of 69.1 lakh and Jammu a population of 53.50 lakh.Till Thursday, Kashmir had recorded 140 deaths and Jammu 14 deaths. Similarly, the Valley had recorded 7,504 positive cases and Jammu 1,997 cases.With a testing rate of 25,000 per million and a doubling rate of 22 days, the Union territory, which has six Covid-testing laboratories, has done remarkably well in tackling the Covid-19 infection.Kashmir director health services Dr Samir Mattoo said, “Essentially, the people returning to Kashmir are far more and our testing rate is also very high. These are the basic reasons responsible for the increase in Covid-19 cases in Kashmir.”He, however, also said that weather conditions in Kashmir were also different from Jammu.“In Kashmir, respiratory diseases are also more and of course smoking can also contribute to it,” he added.Another senior doctor in Jammu said, “Different factors are responsible for fewer Covid-19 infections and deaths in Jammu as compared to Kashmir. The population of Kashmir is more than Jammu and its climatic conditions are different from Jammu. Lifestyle disorders are also higher in Kashmir. According to a study, their cholesterol levels are high and more people in Kashmir smoke as compared to their counterparts in Jammu,” he said.DOCTORS OBSERVE INCREASED PREVALENCE OF PULMONARY DISEASEThe doctor referred to a 2018 report published in Lancet, an international medical research journal, which brought the growing prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in J&K to the fore.The report had put J&K among the four top states and UTs in India with ‘alarming prevalence’ of respiratory diseases.‘THE SMOKING CAPITAL’In J&K, over 4,750 people per lakh suffer from COPD. Besides air pollution, the report had put the onus on a ‘staggering’ rate of smoking among the people.In 2015, the Voluntary Health Association of India (VHAI) had said in its report that J&K was fast emerging as the smoking capital of north India. At the time, J&K’s cigarette consumption was 12%, almost double the nationwide prevalence of 5.7%.It had recorded tobacco sales worth Rs 5,530 crore over seven years up to 2017-18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/more-returnees-respiratory-disorders-weather-conditions-contribute-to-increased-covid-count-in-valley/story-U7xhwKc7PqanzDJZ7yqTwK.html
11-07-2020||Lucknow||ED to register money laundering case against Vikas Dubey’s family, associates||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is set to file a money laundering case and probe alleged illegal transactions and tainted assets created by dead gangster Vikas Dubey, his family members and associates, officials said on Saturday. They said the agency’s zonal office in Lucknow has written to the Kanpur police in this context on July 6 seeking all FIRs and chargesheets filed against him and his linked persons and the latest update in all these cases. The ED, they said, will soon file a complaint under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to probe criminal proceeds of crime that were allegedly generated by Dubey, his associates and family members and if this money was subsequently used for creation of illegal movable and immovable properties. It is alleged that Dubey, through his criminal activities, amassed wealth in his and his family’s name, they said. Over two dozen named and ‘benami’ assets linked to Dubey and his family in Uttar Pradesh and some adjoining areas, bank deposits and fixed deposit receipts are under the scanner of the central probe agency, they said. Some police FIRs have been shared while some more information is being obtained by the agency, they said. It is also seeking details from other law enforcement agencies about possible undiclosed foreign assets of Dubey and others apart from seeking details of accounts from various banks, they said. They said even as Dubey is dead the scheme of PMLA enables the agency to continue criminal probe against accomplices of the prime accused in laundering the proceeds of crime and the properties acquired as a result of this criminal activity. Section 72 of the PMLA provides for “continuation of proceedings in the event of death or insolvency.” Dubey, 47, was shot dead on Friday by a team of UP police special task force (STF) who claimed he was trying to flee after the car carrying him from Ujjain overturned on an isolated stretch of the highway on the outskirts of Kanpur city. Dubey, officials have said, has about 60 police FIRs registered against him including the recent ambush killing of eight policemen after midnight on July 3 outside his home in Bikru village under the Chaubeypur police station area of Kanpur district. The police party was going to arrest Dubey in connection with a criminal case filed against him when they were trapped and shot with heavy gunfire from rooftops by Dubey and his henchmen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/ed-to-register-money-laundering-case-against-vikas-dubey-s-family-associates/story-Lyg1Sz73nqYdwIsDgpkeRJ.html
11-07-2020||Jaipur||Congress MLAs in Rajasthan claim BJP involved in horse-trading||At least 24 Congress members of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs), in a joint press release, have condemned the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for its bid to destablise the state government through corrupt means, hours after the police lodged a case against two others for their alleged attempt to poach lawmakers from the ruling party.The Congress MLAs late at night on Friday released a press release, alleging the BJP’s horse-trading bid to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led government in the desert state.The Congress MLAs condemned BJP’s undemocratic ploy to grab power.Earlier on Friday, a special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan Police had registered a case against two others for their alleged attempts to poach the Congress MLAs that would have destabilised the Gehlot government. They have been booked under Section 124A (sedition) and Section 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The press release, signed by Mahesh Joshi and Mahendra Choudhary, Chief Whip and Deputy Chief Whip of Rajasthan assembly, respectively, stated, “The BJP faced defeat in the Rajya Sabha (RS) elections, despite using corrupt tactics, because of the unity among the Congress, the Independents, BTP (Bharatiya Tribal Party), RLD (Rashtriya Lok Dal), and other lawmakers. But instead of learning a lesson, the BJP is conspiring once again to weaken the state government by resorting to similar tactics.”The Congress MLAs alleged: “We have clear information that BJP leaders are involved in this conspiracy, where Congress lawmakers and those supporting the government are being lured with temptations. But the Congress lawmakers and all those legislatures, who are supporting the government, will not let them succeed in their attempts.”The Congress MLAs have reposed full faith in the party.They said that it is their moral duty to believe in the party’s high command and lofty principles and policies for the welfare of the poor and serve them with utter dedication. Earlier, too, anti-democratic forces were taught a lesson in Rajasthan by exposing their conspiracies, and this time also they would be defeated because of the unity and solidarity among the Congress lawmakers, the release added.The lawmakers are firm in their resolve.“No matter how big is the temptation, no one can change our faith. The Congress government will be in power for its full five-year team. The Congress will again come to power in 2023 on the basis of fulfiling people’s expectations and good governance.”Lakhan Singh Meena, Joginder Singh Awana, Mukesh Bhakar, Indra Meena, Vedprakash Solanki, Sandeep Yadav, Ganga Devi, Hakam Singh, Wajib Ali, Babulal Bairwa, Rohit Bohra, Danish Abrar, Chetan Dudi, Harish Meena, Ramniwas Gawadiya, Jahida Khan, Ashok Bairwa, Johari Lal Meena, Prashant Bairwa, Shakuntla Rawat, Rajendra Singh Bidhuri, Govind Ram Meghwal, Deepchand Kheriya, and Rajendra Singh Gudda are the 24 Congress lawmakers, whose names figure in the press release. In the run-up to the Upper House polls held on June 19 amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, the Congress had alleged that the attempts were being made to lure its MLAs with Rs 25 crore each, including Rs 10 crore in advance.However, the BJP had refuted the “baseless” allegations.BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said by levelling these baseless allegations against the party, the Congress is trying to paper over the differences within its government’s ranks. They need to provide factual evidence to SOG, which is handling the case, he added.Chief Whip Joshi had lodged a complaint with the state’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB), and later with the SOG, alleging attempts were being made to topple the government through horse-trading ahead of the RS polls. However, he didn’t file a first information report (FIR) to take his complaint to a logical legal conclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/congress-mlas-in-rajasthan-claim-bjp-involved-in-horse-trading/story-QmBaTAjbHfbZqgPBgaW3gL.html

Antigen test can provide results within 30 minutes as compared to RT-PCR test that takes three-four hours, they said, adding that each testing kit costs about Rs 450. Detailing about the testing, Commissioner for Health and Family Welfare Pankaj Kumar Pandey said, “We have got one lakh antigen testing kits out of which 50,000 have been reserved for Bengaluru and the remaining 50,000 have been sent to various districts,” he said. “Out of the 50,000 for Bengaluru, we will immediately start with 20,000 in the city and the rest will be used in coming days, so that our testing capacity increases,” he said. Stating that antigen tests’ biggest advantage is that it would immediately be known whether the person is Covid-19 positive, Pandey said, “If a person is negative in antigen testing and is symptomatic his swab will be drawn for RT-PCR testing, while if a person is asymptomatic and tests negative, he is sent back home.” “Antigen test will bring down the load on our labs and it will help us in increasing the number of tests and isolating,” he added. As of July 10 evening, cumulatively 33,418 Covid-19 positive cases have been confirmed in the state, out of which of 15,329 infections are from Bengaluru. A total of 1,447 out of 2,313 fresh cases reported on Friday were from the capital city. A total of 7,79,209 samples were tested so far in the state mostly by RT-PCR method, out of which 19,228 were tested on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/20-000-antigen-tests-to-be-held-in-bengaluru-from-today/story-YjOCE31MlqWLQGEzQThvOL.html

The issue of bus fare hike was discussed informally but the final decision wasn’t taken,” said Thakur.He said the state government had been getting suggestions to increase the bus fares and transporters had also raised a demand in this regard.“However, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, different sections have suffered economic losses. The government will take a call keeping in view the welfare of every section of society,” he said.Public transport in Himachal Pradesh was stalled in March-end after the Covid-19 outbreak. The government allowed intra-state transport to resume on June 1 with 60% occupancy. However, most private buses remained off road due non-viability and operators demanded up to 50% hike in the fare.The government refused to increase the fare but allowed 100% occupancy in the buses during Unlock 2 that started this month.However, the private bus operators remain adamant and want the government to hike the fare due to increased fuel prices.The Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) had also recommended an increase in the bus fare.LAST HIKE TWO YEARS BACKAt present, the fare of ordinary buses in Himachal is ₹1.12 per km in the plains and ₹1.75 in the hills.Similarly, the fare of deluxe buses is ₹1.37 per km in the plains and ₹2.17 per km in the hills.For Volvo and air-conditioned buses, the fare is ₹2.74 per km in the plains and ₹3.62 in the hills.The minimum bus fare is ₹5.This is the second bus fare hike during the tenure of the Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government. Last time, bus fares were hiked by up to 24.44% on September 24, 2018. Buses are the only means of transportation in rural Himachal as the state lacks air and train connectivity in these areas.The HRTC has 3,300 buses in its fleet while there are 3,100 private buses in the state. At present, only 800 buses are operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fuel-price-hike-drives-himachal-pradesh-to-increase-bus-fare-by-25/story-o1lhFkGp9vrzqwVC8g9iZP.html

Since public transport is almost non-existent due to the Covid-19 effect, the mobility of students to their college will be severely affected,” the release said.The minister also mentioned in his letter that Maharashtra, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry have also taken the decision not to conduct terminal exams. “Even IIT Mumbai, Kharagpur, Kanpur, Roorkee have also cancelled their final semester exams,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-minister-urges-hrd-minister-to-re-examine-revised-ugc-guidelines/story-QelgqLFTKr9tSimIY3HuqI.html

The first of the three-part interview series was published in the Marathi daily on Saturday.Also Read: ‘I blame Congress, MVA for playing politics’, says FadnavisThis is for the first time that a non-Shiv Sena leader has featured in a marathon interview series in the party mouthpiece. It has so far published marathon interviews of late Bal Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray. Replying to a query over BJP’s defeat in the last assembly polls in the state, Pawar said, “In a democracy, you cannot think that you will remain in power eternally. Voters will not tolerate if they are taken for granted. Powerful leaders mass base with like Indira Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee had been defeated.“It means that in terms of the democratic rights, the common man is wiser than the politicians. If we politicians cross the line, he teaches us a lesson. Therefore, people do not like the stand that ‘we will come back to power’,” he said.“No politician should take people for granted. Nobody should take a stand that he would return to power. People thought that this stand smacks of arrogance and hence feeling grew among them that they should be taught a lesson,” Pawar said.Also Read: Fadnavis alleges state’s priorities are misplacedHe said the change of government in Maharashtra was not an accident.“People of Maharashtra voted in line of the sentiment prevailing in the country during the national elections. But the mood changed during the assembly polls. Even though BJP did well in the Lok Sabha polls, it fared poorly in assembly elections in different states. Even people of Maharashtra voted for a change,” he said. Replying to a query over his reported differences with CM Thackeray on the lockdown in the state, Pawar said, “Absolutely not. What differences? For what? During the entire period of lockdown, I have had excellent communication with the chief minister and continue to do so.” Pawar, who played a key role in bringing together the Sena, Congress and NCP for formation of government in the state in November last year, blamed the media and said sarcastically that the news gathering activity had been hit by the coronavirus-induced lockdown and they had the responsibility to fill the pages of newspapers.Also Read: BMC calls Fadnavis’ claims of reduced testing ‘baseless’“I have been reading reports of growing differences among the three allies, but there is not an iota of truth in that,” he said.Speaking about the style of functioning of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray, Pawar said, “Although Balasaheb was never in the seat of power, he was the driving force behind the power. He got power in Maharashtra due to his ideology.“Today, the government is not because of the ideology.But the responsibility of implementing that power now lies with Uddhav Thackeray,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/don-t-take-voters-for-granted-even-indira-atal-had-lost-pawar/story-MWWCk8sR6JvMMQSHsWdi5J.html

In a letter to defence minister Rajnath Singh, the unions said: “there will be serious labour unrest resulting in disturbance of defence production in case the consultants appointed by the defence ministry visits the ordnance factories and OFB headquarters.”The OFB is headquartered in Kolkata.The BPMS is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“The department of defence production in violation of the agreement reached before the chief labour commissioner (Central) on August 21, 2019, have arbitrarily issued a notification for appointment of a consultant …,” said the All India Defence Employees Federation, the Indian National Defence Workers Federation and the Bharatiya Pratikraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS) in a joint media statement.“The ordnance factories are properties of the government. How can private parties enter these establishments to assess their values? The workers will not tolerate this. We will not allow the government to stretch this issue any further,” Mukesh Singh, general secretary, BPMS, told HT.The workers observed a month-long strike last year against the proposed move of the government. On Friday, the unions said that workers would go on indefinite strike and the date would be announced shortly. The unions started a movement against corporatisation in last July. The agitation started soon after the Centre enforced Arms Rules 2016, which introduced new laws to facilitate the production of weapons by private players in collaboration with foreign partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/ordnance-factory-unions-threaten-stir-against-corporatisation-bid/story-EtGhwV4gNkgutEoDTFDqlI.html

The Congress government in Rajasthan will complete its five-year term,” the statement said.In the assembly of 200, the Congress has 107 MLAs and has the support of independent MLAs and legislators of other parties like Rashtriya Lok Dal, CPI (M) and Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP). Ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections for two seats in the state last month, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and government chief whip Mahesh Joshi had alleged that the BJP was trying to poach Congress and other MLAs to destabilise the government. Joshi had also filed complaints to special operations group (SOG) and the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) of Rajasthan Police, demanding inquiry and actions in the attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-congress-mlas-allege-bjp-trying-to-topple-ashok-gehlot-govt-by-luring-legislators/story-WVNHqn0s14ZMwlLxJ4XweJ.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwala: Amid despair, there’s hope||A new tea stall has opened. This is a miracle.The globe is in lockdown. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic is forcing big and small businesses to shut down across the world. Many of us have lost their jobs. Those who are still employed cannot take this status for granted. Everything is uncertain.Amid this gloom, a small ray of hope is sparkling in the form of a chai shop.“I started it a week ago,” says Lal Babu Ansari. The new stall is situated in a most extraordinary location. It stands outside the east-facing gateway of the Mughal-era Jama Masjid monument, in Old Delhi. The stall is almost attached to the outer wall of the twin Sufi shrines of Hazrat Hare Bhare Shah and Hazrat Sarmad Shahid. The establishment is extremely modest, however—just a rickety table crowded with a gas burner, two kettles, pans half-filled with milk, a bowl of sugar and a few jars crammed with tea things like fen and rusks.Mr Ansari concedes it is unusual to start a new business in these grim times. “Earlier, I was working in the tea stall under that peepal,” he says, vaguely gesturing towards a handful of trees some distance away. The owner hasn’t reopened that stall yet, and Mr Ansari eventually decided to launch his own. “I have to earn after all.”At this early hour, the stall is empty. In fact the entire area is empty except for a couple of devotees inside the shrine. “Nobody is coming to the stall so far,” admits Mr Ansari. He says he gets ikka dukka grahak (occasional clients) every hour. “This is the way things are right now.” Sometimes, visitors to the adjacent Sufi shrines stop by his stall on their way out “but very few devotees are arriving to seek blessings these days, and most of them don’t want to remove their face mask... so they chose to ignore my chai.”A native of Patna in Bihar, Mr Ansari is in his 30s and spent almost all his life in Delhi working through a series of tea stalls. But “this is my life’s first stall that I own,” he informs matter-of-factly.Gesturing towards a market in the narrow lane ahead, where stalls of clothes and sandals on either sides are shrouded in yellow and blue plastic sheets, he says that some of those would open later in the day — but they are hardly getting any customers.In the BC (Before Corona) era, this stretch of the Walled City would be over-crowded by this time with food stalls selling kebabs, Rooh Afza drinks and biryanis. In fact, a popular biryani hawker would be seen supervising his cooks and cauldrons in an open ground nearby. The gates to the ground are locked. Mr Ansari’s stall is actually stacked right against those gates.Right now, it is totally silent. Another tea shop nearby has been closed ever since the lockdown began.Minutes pass and no customer arrives. Then a long-haired fakir appears and sits on the pavement besides a stray dog. He asks for chai and becomes the day’s first patron. The stall opens daily from 8am to 9pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwala-amid-despair-there-s-hope/story-K58Cldcxrz8EjA3gwl7RgJ.html

11-07-2020||Jaipur||Case filed for alleged bid to topple Rajasthan govt||The Special Operations Group (SOG) of Rajasthan Police registered on Friday a case of sedition and conspiracy against unknown people on charges of attempting to topple the Congress-led state government.Additional Director of Police (SOG), Ashok Kumar Rathore, said a case was registered after substantial facts surfaced during a call interception of two phone numbers. He said two numbers belonged to “anti-social elements” who were being kept on surveillance. “The conversation on those numbers indicated that the two people [whose names have not been disclosed to media] and some others could be involved in trying to poach (the Congress and independent) MLAs,” he said.He added that both mobile phone numbers were registered in Rajasthan.Ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections on June 19, Congress leaders had alleged that attempts were being made to lure its MLAs and that they were being offered ~25 crore, including Rs10 crore as advance payment. The Bharatiya Janata Party called these charges baseless. Rathore clarified that the FIR was not on the complaint given by chief whip Mahesh Joshi on June 11, in which he had alleged that attempts were being made to topple the government before the Rajya Sabha polls and that money was being offered to MLAs. “That is being probed separately,” Rathore added. The Congress initially lodged a complaint with the anti-corruption bureau and later gave it to the SOG. “A complaint has been lodged with SOG so that investigation about those who are in the organised crime of money transfer,” said chief minister Ashok Gehlot on June 12 after Joshi lodged the complaint with the SOG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/case-filed-for-alleged-bid-to-topple-rajasthan-govt/story-k7Xs7MVt3KMVbP8kT0ngJK.html

11-07-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER Covid centre witnesses 80% recoveries in 100 days||A hundred days after a dedicated Covid-19 facility was set up at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), around 80% of the total 256 patients admitted here have recovered.Meanwhile, 3.94% of the total patients succumbed to the virus. The tertiary care hospital of the region caters to patients from across eight states, majority of whom are from Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana. A few patients from Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh are also treated here, an official spokesperson said.An analysis of Covid positive patients admitted here showed that the maximum number of patients from Punjab required ventilator support and had the highest fatalities.Additional medical superintendent Dr Vipin Khoushal said, “The aim is to save lives. The reason why maximum deaths (10) were reported from Punjab is because most of them were suffering from other fatal diseases.”On the other hand, only three patients from Chandigarh were put on a ventilator. Only two out of the seven deaths in UT were registered at PGIMER, while 34 required the admissions in intensive care units.The average stay of the patients was 17 days; 19 surgeries were conducted including a pacemaker implant on the positive patients.Dr GD Puri, dean (academics), said, “A robust system has been developed by the institute for clinical care of the patients, but that comes at a price of sleepless nights. There is constant round the clock remote monitoring of patients, and doctors here have treated over 250 of them in the age group of one month to 83 years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-covid-centre-witnesses-80-recoveries-in-100-days/story-Cbj240w3X1W8VHb7voNAhL.html

11-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police blocked 1,816 objectionable posts related to Covid-19 on social media: State to HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday disposed of a public interest litigation (PIL) which had complained that the Mumbai Police had violated the right to freedom of expression of citizens, by invoking section 144 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by prohibiting the use of social media platforms to disseminate information.After the state informed the court through an affidavit that the prohibitory orders had come to an end on June 8 and the order was justified as it had blocked 1,816 posts of objectionable content, the court refused to entertain the petition and disposed of it.A division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice NR Borkar, while hearing the PIL filed by four persons – a journalist, musician, occupational therapist and information technology professional – through advocates Aditi Saxena and Afreen Khan, was informed that Mumbai Police had violated the rights of citizens guaranteed under the Indian Constitution.In a bid to curb misinformation and rumours pertaining to the spread of Covid 19 in the city, Mumbai Police had invoked section 144 of the IPC on April 10 and restricted dissemination of information through various messaging and social media platforms. Aggrieved by the prohibition order and its extension on May 23, the petitioners had approached the court on June 1 seeking for it to be set aside. The court, in its earlier hearing on June 5, had directed the state to file an affidavit in response to the plea.On Friday, when the PIL came up for hearing, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni and government pleader Poornima Kantharia submitted the state’s affidavit and said that Mumbai Police has kept various social media platforms like under surveillance since the order was passed on April 10 to curb the spread of misinformation and rumours about Covid 19. Kumbhakoni submitted that information spread through these platforms was creating apprehension and panic among people, and hence, it was necessary to impose the prohibitory orders.Justifying the same, Kumbhakoni read out the affidavit filed by Pranay Ashok, deputy commissioner of police (operations), which said that there was “widespread dissemination of fake news, incorrect information, misinformation and other such objectionable content” on social media platforms.“Such type of content was found to have caused panic and confusion among the general public, inciting mistrust towards government functionaries and their actions taken to control the Covid-19 pandemic, and also to have created animosity towards various communities,” the affidavit further stated.It added that in the period from April 10 to June 8, police had blocked 1,816 posts of objectionable content.In light of these submissions and the fact that the prohibitory orders ended on June 8, Kumbhakoni submitted that as the grievances of the petitioners did not survive, the PIL should be dismissed.After hearing the submissions and perusing the affidavit, the court said that it was not inclined to entertain the PIL, and disposed of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-blocked-1-816-objectionable-posts-related-to-covid-19-on-social-media-state-to-hc/story-mk9z6AWUHqAr1jkgkahkzK.html

He added this is more pronounced in the drought-prone districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada, and will lead to farmers’ suicides. Tiwari pointed out that state data revealed that around five farmers commit suicide every day in MaharashtraTiwari pointed out that as on Thursday, nationalised banks disbursed less than 10% of their credit target to state farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada. “Despite the chief minister stressing on providing bank finance to all farmers, public sector and commercial banks are not disbursing credit to them. PM must empower chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as the chairman of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) to address the credit crisis as it is the only body that can evolve consensus to resolve the issue,’’ said Tiwari. He added that CM must be empowered to take criminal action against bank officials who are not responding to the state’s directives to disburse the loans. He also said that banks should not subtract crop insurance payments directly from the loan amount and must offer credit to around 11 lakh farm accounts.“The problem is severe, as owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, the farmers’ access to banks has been virtually cut off. Banks are refusing to give credit to around 11 lakh farmers, whose loan waivers are pending due to Covid-19 outbreak, despite the CM’s directives and the state’s guarantee. The situation will first push 80% of farmers to private moneylenders and then to the step of ending their lives,’’ added Tiwari.The crop loan target set by SLBC for 2020-21 is ₹62,458 crore, of which 70% credit is to be given by nationalised banks, while the remaining by district co-operative banks. The co-operative banks disbursed 69% of their target, but the commercial banks disbursed only 15%, said a senior co-operative department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pm-must-intervene-in-maharashtra-s-farm-credit-crisis-chief-of-task-force-formed-to-tackle-agrarian-crisis/story-KylmpQPFih1PRxAqzN4EsK.html

We are planning to declare the HSC results between July 15 and 20. For the SSC exams, the history papers are still being checked and we are working to complete the process to declare the results by July 31,” school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said.She also said that the answer sheets are being scanned for the re-evaluation process that needs to commence after the results are declared. “We are trying to make the [re-evaluation] facility available online, as it would be very difficult to complete it physically this year and the answer sheets are being scanned for the purpose. A decision regarding the process is yet to be taken,” Gaikwad said.The HSC exams were held from February 18 to March 18, even as the state went under a lockdown on March 23. However, the SSC exams, scheduled from March 3 to March 23, were affected, and the state decided to cancel the geography exam, which was the last paper. The history paper was held on March 21 and the paper-checking process was delayed owing to the restrictions imposed in the lockdown.By May-end, the state announced that the marks for the geography paper would be calculated based on the average marks received in other subjects of the exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hsc-ssc-results-to-be-declared-this-month-says-maharashtra-school-education-minister/story-MjNCHkNNo6cb0WKvupXITI.html
11-07-2020||City||ICSE, ISC results: Tough task ahead for Maharashtra education department||With all boards having different marking schemes due to the Covid-19 outbreak this year, achieving equivalence in scores for first-year junior college admissions is likely to be a tough task for the state education department.The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary education has decided to mark students for geography, the exam which was cancelled, as per the average for the remaining papers. For Class 10 students of CBSE, all papers were successfully conducted in the state and results would be declared as usual. ICSE students, meanwhile, have been marked for the cancelled papers on the basis of their best three scores and internals for the subject. Officials at the education department said no decision has been made on this. “No such meeting or discussion has taken place at the government level yet,” said a senior official from the department. In 2019, the Mumbai divisional board had received nearly 1.85 lakh applications from students for the general admission round. While 1.68 lakh of these were from the state board, the second highest number of applicants came from the ICSE board (7,881). With ICSE students scoring big, experts said the department needs to come up with a solution for state board students. “The government should come up with a method to ensure the state board students do not lose out on prominent colleges. It should be done systematically to ensure that no one challenges it in courts,” said Basanti Roy, former secretary of the Mumbai divisional board. Vaishali Bafna, who is a part of SYSCOM, a Pune based think tank, said, “The department needs to plan admissions well this year. The overall reservation for various categories is increasing year on year and there are fewer seats left for the open category. This will make competition for seats fiercer this year,” she said. This year, the government has decided to increase the quota for students with special needs to 4% from 3%, while the quota for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes(SEBC) has been reduced from 16% to 12%, in accordance with the state rules. A total of 50% seats in junior colleges affiliated to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation would be reserved for students of civic body schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/icse-isc-results-tough-task-ahead-for-maharashtra-education-department/story-UmkuOrcmjpn6xEF3wDnQXL.html

We are happy that in an unprecedented situation like this, wherein a few papers had to be cancelled, the board has come up with a good marking criterion that helped students score as per their potential,” said Kavita Sanghvi, principal, CNMS. This year, six papers of the ICSE exams were cancelled owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. An average of a candidate’s three best paper marks, along with the percentage of marks that the student got in the internal assessment of the cancelled paper were considered while coming up with marks for these exams. At Mahim’s Bombay Scottish school, over 71% of the class scored above 90% this year. “Most students have done exceptionally well in mathematics and science, despite both being difficult papers,” said Sunita George, school principal. She said most students felt they were scored well by the board, even for the exams the council could not conduct due to Covid-19. “The board has clearly given students the benefit of doubt and that’s very important because students shouldn’t suffer because of the ongoing situation,” she added.At Juhu’s Jamnabai Narsee School, 184 of the 269 students got 90% and above. “These are really exceptional results and we are happy for our students,” said Zeenat Bhojabhoy, school principal.

11-07-2020||Gurugram||Nearly 8% of new Covid-19 cases cannot be traced due to incorrect contact details||Nearly 8% of the new Covid-19 cases being reported in the city are going untraced due to incorrect contact details provided by patients, thereby hindering surveillance and contact tracing, said district administration officials, adding that there are more than 270 positive Covid-19 cases that cannot be traced till now.The task has become particularly challenging as the state government has directed the district officials to carry out contact tracing in nearly 80% of the new Covid-19 cases confirmed in a single day.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageKeshani Anand Arora, state’s chief secretary, in a meeting with district administration on Wednesday, directed the officials to finish contact tracing of nearly 80% of the newly detected cases in a day to break the chain of transmission, according to the press statement issued by the administration.On Friday, 111 new cases were reported in the district, taking the total tally of coronavirus infected persons to 6,578. Of these, 968 are active cases, while 5,507 patients have recovered till now. The Covid-19 toll stands at 103.“Every day, we have 5-8% cases of Covid-19 positive cases which cannot be traced,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) in a press meet on Friday.“Compared to previous months, the reporting by private labs has improved. The names of patients who cannot be traced due to incorrect contact details are forwarded to the police department,” said Singh. The MCG has been given the task of coordinating with the private and government labs for Covid-19 test reports.Once the reports are uploaded by the labs on the ICMR portal, teams deployed at the MCG segregate reports based on the four zones of the city. The list of the positive patient is shared with the nodal medical officer of that particular zone, who further coordinate with the PHC team (PHC) for a home visit or make a telephonic call to the person infected with Sars-CoV-2.According to officials of district administration, the issue of inadequate contact details is becoming challenging.The initial details of verification are going missing. Most of the time, the address is incomplete. Further, there are incorrect phone numbers. Somebody getting tested in Gurugram shares his/her domicile address given in the ID card. All these are making it difficult for the team to trace such people and their high-risk contacts, who can potentially transmit the virus to others, said officials.An ICMR study in April predicted that a Covid-19 patient can infect 406 people in 30 days if preventive measures such as social distancing are not implemented.The district health department issued notices twice in the last two weeks to seven diagnostic labs in the city for inadequate contact details of the suspected cases. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), on Thursday said that strict action will be taken against people who are sharing wrong information to get themselves tested as it leads to data mismanagement.“There are over 270 cases that cannot be traced. People are getting tested multiple times; sometimes labs are also lax in taking complete details. All these factors are creating hindrances in controlling the infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nearly-8-of-new-covid-19-cases-cannot-be-traced-due-to-incorrect-contact-details/story-DgHos70oRPl2qANK8IJZuO.html

The project would also include the construction of the 7km-long Pataudi bypass, which is likely to reduce congestion in Pataudi town. The 46-km long Pataudi-Rewari National Highway will cost Rs1,500 crore, said Gurugram MP and union minister of state Rao Inderjit Singh. Singh further said that this project had been stuck for a long time due to land acquisition issues but all these obstacles have been overcome and land needed for the road has been acquired, thus making it possible for the work to start. “This road project will greatly improve the connectivity between Gurugram and Rewari and make commuting easier,” he said. The 46km road will have two flyovers, one overbridge and three interchange connections, allowing people to leave the road or take it with ease at different points, said officials. Singh also said that project will also include the construction of a Pataudi bypass road, which has been a long-pending demand of the area residents. “The 7km- long Pataudi Bypass will ensure that traffic jams and congestion, which occurred daily in the township, will not happen anymore,” said Singh. A large number of residents of Rewari and Pataudi commute daily to Gurugram and Delhi and they have been demanding the early construction of this road project for the last few years. The construction of this road, locals said, is likely to reduce commuting time and also boost education and employment opportunities as local youth would be able to access NCR with ease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gadkari-to-lay-foundation-stone-of-1-500-crore-pataudi-rewari-highway/story-xR0soktiVvLsKz78s08xZI.html

In a departure from previous years, the council did not release a merit list in view of the exceptional circumstances. Earlier in March, the CISCE had cancelled board examinations owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. The remaining exams were rescheduled for July and eventually called off, after parents across the country demanded that the exams should be scrapped entirely in the interest of the health and well-being of students and teachers.The council created a new evaluation scheme for scoring the pending papers, under which an average of the marks of a candidate’s three best papers along with the percentage of marks that the student secured in the internal assessment of the respective subject was considered for ICSE students. For ISC students, the board calculated the average of the best three percentage marks along with the percentage obtained by the candidate in the project and practical work in the subjects concerned.In Delhi-NCR, students from 48 ICSE and 35 ISC schools appeared for the examination this year. For ISCE, 5,134 candidates appeared for the exams. These included 2,728 boys (53.14%) and 2,406 girls (46.86%). Similarly, 2,634 students appeared for the ISC exam. These included 1,357 boys (51.52%) and 1,277 girls (48.8%). The number of successful candidates for ICSE and ISC stood at 5,118 and 2,578 respectively. While no city-wise topper was declared, students in multiple schools clocked in high percentages, and many students obtaining a perfect score in multiple subjects. At Shri Ram School, Moulsari, Meher Joshi and Anya Patil were the top scorers in ISC from their schools with 99.5%. Joshi, a humanities student, said that she was relieved with the results. “It was getting really stressful for all the students. With uncertainty prevailing over the pending exams for the longest time, we didn’t know if we should be studying for the exams or not. Later, a new formula was put in place. I am happy with the results,” said Joshi, who plans to pursue graduation in economics from Ashoka University.At the Scottish High International School, the highest scorer and the school topper from the science stream, Tara Garg, achieved 98.75% in Class 12. Around 50% of students have secured 90% and above, while 72% of students have obtained 80% and above at the school. In Class 10, Anandita Misra and Aditya Misra were the top scorers with 99.2%. While 61% of students gained 90% and above, 94% of students secured more than 75%.“Our children have done very well. Diligent efforts of the students helped them get a commendable result in a difficult year,” said Sudha Goyal, principal of Scottish High International School.At MatriKriran School, Sector 83, 10 students appeared for the Class 10 board exams, and all 10 students scored above 80%. Out of these three students scored above 90%. The school topper was Nikhil Agrawal with 92.4%, confirmed school principal Jyoti Guha. Puneeta Chadha Khanna, mother of a Class 10 student, who was opposed to the board’s move of conducting physical exams for the pending papers, said that she was satisfied with the results. “I am happy with the results. My children have improved a lot. Moreover, my children are safe at home and relieved that the uncertainty surrounding the exams and results is over now. This is an unprecedented year and safety of children was of prime concern,” said Khanna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/results-of-icse-isc-board-examinations-out-no-merit-list-announced/story-z2cXw29BoxSh367UczaCwK.html
11-07-2020||City||‘Timely treatment needed for Covid’||Dr. Dhruv Chaudhary, head of pulmonary and critical care medicine department at PGIMS-Rohtak, who is also Haryana’s nodal officer for Covid-19, was in the city on Friday to streamline the auditing of Covid-19 deaths and to study the prospect of establishing a convalescent plasma bank in the Gurugram and Faridabad. Dr Chaudhary spoke to Archana Mishra about the necessity to get timely treatment and the limited community transmission in certain pockets of the city.Edited excerpts:You are part of the task force coordinating with doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi to analyse deaths of Covid-19 patients without co-morbidities in the state. What have you learnt so far?The study is ongoing. The initial data, however, shows a third of those who died without any co-morbidity, had obesity. Such patients had sudden death due to heart failure. They too reported of breathlessness and respiratory problems initially but there was sudden death. To get a better picture of the situation, reporting of deaths by hospitals has to be further improved.What are the issues with reporting deaths and how do you plan to improve it?It is critical to ascertain the root cause to reduce the toll count for which there has to be a uniform reporting pattern. We need to know when the patient was transported to the hospital, when the diagnosis and complications started. In the past, 10 patients were brought dead (to the hospital). Such a situation should not exist for which active interventions are required. Like there should be no delay in diagnosis. People are not reporting symptoms until they show any critical health issues. Minimising this time gap is also required. Also, people who are asymptomatic but have diabetes and hypertension should get themselves checked. If their blood pressure or blood sugar goes suddenly out of control, they should consult a doctor. It should be considered as a warning sign. Testing numbers have increased and so have Covid-19 cases. Are we seeing community spread of the infection?These tests are vigorously conducted for active surveillance, which is essential to check community spread of the coronavirus. For this, the central government conducted the sero-survey. In Haryana, especially in Gurugram, there is evidence that suggests infection was spreading at a fast pace. Certain pockets saw outbreak in large numbers. Because of the pro-active measures we have been able to contain it now. The multi-pronged approach which includes the three types of tests (RT-PCR, antigen and antibody tests) is helping us to gauge the total infection load in the city. What is the current status on setting up of convalescent plasma bank in the city? In Gurugram, a private hospital is offering plasma therapy. The service is not available in the government set up. The Covid-19 treatment has to be cost-effective. Teams are coordinating with Rotary blood bank and collection of people who can donate plasma has already started. The plan is to have a plasma pool, where real-time patients anyone can check the availability of the plasma. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is being prepared which will be soon shared with the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/timely-treatment-needed-for-covid/story-fu30KBe7bDNDwVpt5hEF9N.html
11-07-2020||Gurugram||Health department proposes to extend LOR curbs in Patel Nagar, Sohna||Ten days after the district administration announced strict curbs in eight large outbreak regions (LORs) in the city, the health department has proposed to extend these measures beyond the deadline of July 14 in Patel Nagar and bring Sohna under LOR, citing a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in these areas. The final decision in this regard will only be taken after a reassessment on July 13, said officials. The health department, on Friday, said it plans to extend the regulatory measures in some areas under Patel Nagar public health centre (PHC), including Patel Nagar, Jyoti Park, Madanpuri and Arjun Nagar, which have been designated as LOR since July 1. These areas fall under ward number 16 of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). In addition to this, it plans to bring Sohna under LOR due to a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in these areas. Patel Nagar recorded 73 cases of Covid-19 between June 30 and July 10, while Sohna reported 94 cases during the same period. It is because of this reason that the number of containment zones in Sohna was also increased to seven from four by the district administration on Friday evening. As per a government order issued on June 27, a large outbreak is defined as a localised increase in Covid-19 cases within a defined geographical area in a village, a town or a city. The cases may or may not be epidemiologically linked. For operational purposes, a region is notified as a LOR when there are 15 or more Covid-19 cases, while a containment zone has five or more cases.As per the June 27 order, eight wards in the city were designated as LORs, and strict curbs were imposed in these areas from July 1-14. According to the government order, industrial activities in LOR are only permitted if the workers stay on the factory premises. Only essential shops and commercial establishments are allowed to be opened in these areas. The movement of people outside and inside the LORs is strictly prohibited.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, on Friday, said that the number of Covid-19 cases in areas falling under the Patel Nagar PHC and Sohna have been found to be high. “We have therefore proposed to extend containment measures in Patel Nagar and bring Sohna under LOR. Further, we have increased the number of rapid antigen testing in these areas and have already held two camps. The final decision regarding the notification of the LORs would be taken by the district administration,” he said. Areas under Patel Nagar PHC, such as Patel Nagar, Arjun Nagar, Madanpuri and Jyoti Park, which are located in Old Gurugram, are high density areas, where social distancing is difficult to be enforced as people live in close quarters, said health department officials, adding that this is a major reason why there has been a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in these areas. HT VISITS PATEL NAGARA visit to the area by HT on Thursday revealed that while external boundaries of these colonies have been barricaded, the movement of people inside these zones was almost unrestricted. Shops were open and there was little social distancing among residents. More than half of the people in these areas were seen moving without masks. Although restaurants and other eateries are supposed to be closed, many were found to be open.Despite authorities putting curbs on movement of people, heavy traffic movement could be witnessed in several of these areas. In fact, in lane number 1 in Arjun Park, some local residents had even allegedly removed the barricade to access Basai Road. “The police have barricaded the entry and exit in these areas and health workers have also visited us. However, there is no restriction on the movement of people. Police officials are asking people to wear masks but it is more of a voluntary measure. Only movement outside the zones has been difficult,” said Deepak Kumar, an area resident. Another resident, however, said that due to barricading of external roads, the movement of traffic had become quite difficult and people were facing trouble. Devender Chotani, a senior citizen, said, “They (authorities) keep barricading more lanes every day. Accessing outside roads, especially Pataudi Road towards New Colony crossing, has been difficult and people are facing problems. How will an ambulance come to an internal lane from the main road in case of an emergency?“Police officials deployed in the area, however, said that their job was to ensure restriction on the movement of vehicles and they were allowing only emergency vehicles, ambulances and those carrying essential goods.Devender Kumar, sub inspector (SI), New Colony police station, who was deputed at a barricade in Madanpuri, said, “As per the norms, we are only allowing people to pass through if they have a medical emergency or need to purchase essential supplies. There are exceptions for health workers and waste collection staff. Trespassing is strictly prohibited. Often commuters request us to let them pass through, but we have to comply with the norms.”The district administration officials, when asked about the rampant violations of curbs in these areas, said that their focus was on containment without inconveniencing people and promoting voluntary enforcement by locals rather than penal action. “We are trying to create awareness among people about wearing masks and ensure social distancing. If required, the enforcement of curbs in containment areas can be made stricter and challans can also be issued in large numbers. But people in the containment zones and LORs will have to take responsibility themselves to stop the spread of this virus,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram. Khatri also said that they will reassess the situation in the LORs on July 13 and a decision regarding reducing or extending restrictions can only be taken after the reassessment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-proposes-to-extend-lor-curbs-in-patel-nagar-sohna/story-P8kPTrKUVJ1PyM9o1lXImJ.html
11-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram:16,109 people tested for Covid-19 antigen; positivity rate at 2.94%||Of the 16,109 people tested for Covid-19 in the city, through rapid antigen testing, a total of 475 people have been tested positive for the SARS-CoV2 so far. The antigen detection tests, which began in the city on June 24, have seen a positivity rate of 2.94%, said senior district administration officials on Friday. Health officials and experts said that the tests have been helpful in identifying individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus in certain parts of the city, including large outbreak regions (LORs) and neighbouring zones, where cases of Covid-19 have been gradually increasing. Rather than the conventional RT-PCR tests, the health officials have been using the rapid antigen testing kits in these areas to identify infected patients in a much faster way. At the same time, the government has also ramped up its overall testing numbers in the last three weeks. While in June, for instance, 1,500-2,000 daily tests were being conducted, the number has increased to 3,000 daily tests by the end of the first week of July. “Over 10,000 antigen detection tests have been conducted in large outbreak regions (LOR) in the last two weeks, while the remaining tests have been conducted in other Covid-19 affected areas of the city. On an average, 1,500 antigen detection tests are being carried out every day at the camps organised in the Covid-19-affected areas of the city. Since the test results are available within 30 minutes, we are able to identify and isolate positive cases in such areas to prevent further transmission of the infectious disease,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram. The antigen test looks for specific protein associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. Since the test is highly specific (99.3% to 100%), Yadav said that the positive result on the test is a “true positive” and does not need any confirmatory test. Results have shown the sensitivity of the test is 50.6% to 84% depending on the viral load. Therefore, those who test negative might still have the infection and are advised to go for a repeat test through the more reliable RT-PCR method if they show symptoms of the disease, said health department officials.As per health department officials, the rapid antigen testing has helped them to identify emerging Covid-19 clusters, where number of cases are gradually surging, apart from the already notified LORs in the city. The district administration has so far notified eight LORs in the city. “By using these kits, we are noting the prevalence of the infection in areas where the positivity rate is climbing up. In Sohna, out of 1,000 antigen tests, at least 10% people tested positive for Covid-19. Almost a similar trend is being seen in Patel Nagar,” said Yadav, during a weekly press meet on Friday. Senior district administration officials present during the conference hinted at notifying these areas as LORs after July 14.Experts, however, said that definitive conclusions cannot be derived by simply going by the total number of antigen tests done in the city. Lalit Kant, former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “Weekly data has to be studied to see the emerging pattern of the infection. It is important to figure out who all are being tested. If contacts of already confirmed cases or front-line health workers are being tested, then the number would be higher. If the general population is being tested, then the numbers will never be that high.”In order to ramp up antigen testing, the health department procured additional 8,000 antigen detection kits on Wednesday. The state government in June placed an order of almost 100,000 testing kits with a South Korean company manufacturing these kits in Manesar. Gurugram has received 8,000 kits in the last week of June and another stock 10,000 kits on July 4. Till now, the city has got 26,000 kits from the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-16-109-people-tested-for-covid-19-antigen-positivity-rate-at-2-94/story-BnLkuRB7qoLxVW7tmeRodN.html
11-07-2020||City||UMC mulls converting school buses into ambulances||With the number of Covid-19 cases increasing in the city, the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) is mulling over converting school buses into ambulances.UMC has so far recorded 3,434 positive cases and 61 deaths. For the past one week, the city is witnessing more than 150 new cases each day.A civic official said, “With schools being shut, the vans are lying unused; so we plan to convert them into ambulances. A transparent panel will be built behind the driver’s seat to assure safety. However, we will have to convert the benches and install certain emergency machinery inside the vans. We are still contemplating if this will be feasible.” Meanwhile the newly appointed UMC commissioner Dr Raja Dayanidhi has asked hospitals and clinics to ensure proper screening and treatment. “We have asked all doctors and hospitals to ensure patients get proper treatment irrespective of whether they are Covid patients or not. In all hospitals and clinics, 80% beds are for Covid-19 patients and the rest should be open for others. If we receive any complaint from locals, strict action law will be taken against such hospitals or clinics,” said Dr Dayanidhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/umc-mulls-converting-school-buses-into-ambulances/story-MnnQmxikRsvYOFJoUiPxZI.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||MoCA holds meeting with Air India management, pilots||Ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) officials held a meeting with the national carrier Air India’s management along with chairman and managing director (CMD) Rajiv Bansal and pilots on Wednesday to discuss the financial crises that the airline is facing.While pilots agreed to support the airline and its management during the Covid-19 pandemic phase, they insisted on quitting if Air India does not agree to give a percentage cut on gross salary as per individual’s income. Looking at market conditions, the pilots suggested compulsory leave without pay (LWP) on a monthly basis for all employees. This comes after the pilots, on Monday, had written to Bansal to not give 10% pay cut to category IV employees and suggested giving LWP to every other employee as only few aircraft have been flying due to poor demand. In a letter to fellow pilots after the meeting, Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) which consists of the airline’s Airbus pilots (narrow body aircraft), and Indian Pilots Guild (PG) that consists of Boeing pilots (wide body aircraft) said, “We informed MoCA to clear our long pending 25% dues immediately and allow pilots to quit Air India with immediate effect.’’The letter, sent on Thursday night, read, “We also requested the management not to instigate us into any unpleasant agitation at this crucial time. We are only standing by principle with a demand that any pay cut has to be across the board as per market standards for all employees.’Air India refused to comment. Air India Employees Union (AIEU), consisting of cabin crew, aircraft engineers, radio officers and flight officers, service engineers was, however, upset with the management on the unilateral decision of the management in dealing with unions representing a single category (pilots) and bypassing other unions which represent all other categories of employees of the company. “Please be informed that any decision taken with the unions under reference, will not be binding on our recognised union and its vast majority membership,” the union wrote to Bansal on Friday. The letter further read, “In the event the management continues with such meetings with the said unions under reference, and in our absence discuss/decide or try to impose such decisions on matters involving categories which the Air India Employees Union represent, we reserve our right to resort to any action deemed fit, which may be noted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/moca-holds-meeting-with-air-india-management-pilots/story-qWlBNmDdUWf3hkkwMlRVrM.html

The total number of cases in the city is 8,879 while death toll is 284, with six new deaths.The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) collected ₹6,43,040 in fines for violation of lockdown norms in the six days of complete lockdown in the city. The city has been under lockdown since midnight of July 3 which will end on July 13 midnight.NMMC commissioner Annsaheb Misal said, “Fine has been levied on residents and shopkeepers for not wearing masks, not maintaining social distancing, spitting in public area and other such violations.” He has appealed to the residents to follow the norms.Panvel City Municipal Corporation on Friday reported 181 cases, taking total positive cases to 3,511. The city also recorded two more deaths, taking the toll to 92.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-sees-highest-one-day-spike-with-361-cases/story-4LYd4YSWfYBwcUnob40J3L.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||Maha records highest 1-day rise of 7,862 Covid-19 cases||Maharashtra recorded its sharpest single-day spike of Covid-19 cases on Friday, with 7,862 fresh infections taking the state’s tally to 238,461. The state’s toll rose by 226 to 9,893 fatalities. Mumbai, the worst affected city in Maharashtra, crossed the 90,000 cases mark, with 1,337 infections in 24 hours taking its virus count to 90,461. The city’s toll rose to 5,205, with an addition of 73 deaths. State health department data revealed that Maharashtra has 95,647 active cases, while Mumbai has 23,035 such cases. The number of recovered patients in the state has risen to 132,625, pushing the recovery rate up to 55.62%. The case fatality rate (CFR) in the state, however, is 4.15% as against the national rate of 2.72%, and the positive rate in Maharashtra is 19.01%, with 238,461 of 1,253,978 samples testing positive. Meanwhile, the rising number of Covid cases in several cities and districts has forced local administrations to impose stricter lockdown rules. Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies on Friday decided to impose a 10-day lockdown from July 13, while Mumbai’s neighbouring Thane and Kalyan-Dombivali civic bodies, too, have extended its ongoing lockdown for seven more days till July 19. With state authorities expecting a rise in coronavirus cases over the next few weeks as a result of opening up of commercial and industrial activities since June, the government has introduced rapid testing across the state. It is expected to bring down the CFR. In a letter from the health department earlier this week, all district collectors and municipal commissioners have been directed to bring down the positivity rate to less than 10% and reduce CFR to less than 1%.“Number of daily tests, including RT-PCR, rapid antigen, TruNat and CBNAAT, should be at least 140 per million of population in every corporation and district. Utilise fullest installed capacity of Covid-19 testing. The district and civic authorities are expected to focus on these parameters,” the letter said. Mumbai and Thane municipal corporations have acquired more than 1 lakh rapid antigen test kits, which help in getting a result in 30-40 minutes. “Testing has increased greatly in the near past and we have gone up from 13,000 tests a day to 30,000 tests a day in about a fortnight. We have the biggest viral testing infrastructure in the country, almost all set up after the pandemic began, at the rate of around a lab a day. Our labs have a capacity of 40,000 tests a day. Maharashtra tests strictly as per ICMR guidelines, and therefore the testing is focused. This is reflected in our positivity rate, which is around 20%. We are also trying to implement the WHO Mantra of ‘Track, Trace, Test, Isolate’ in right earnest way. Centre wants testing to be at the rate of 140 a million a day, while we are much ahead with the rate of 200,” said Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary, medical education department, adding that although cases are rising, the health infrastructure is ready to take the load. Mukherjee said the government has strengthened treatment protocol, and now emergency authorisation of experimental therapies, such as plasma, is also allowed. “We have also instructed district chiefs to ensure that cases come early, at least by 48 hours of developing symptoms, as early diagnosis and treatment is one of the fundamental measures of reducing the death rate,” he said. Neeraj Hatekar, professor of Econometrics at the Mumbai University, said the reproduction rate of cases in Maharashtra is around 1.21, and it should come down to 1. “Before the relaxations given from the first week of June, the rate was constantly on decline, but now it has been hovering near 1.2, which is a worrisome factor. Mumbai has been successfully stabilised at 1.1, but the city cannot open up activities unless neighbouring cities do not control their spike. Besides the rest of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), in a few districts like Jalgaon, Solapur and Aurangabad, the cases are high for various reasons. The district administrations, which leveraged the community participation and created a chain of command, could control the containment. Kolhapur, Malegaon and Dharavi in Mumbai are classic examples of such endeavours,” said Hatekar, who has been studying the virus curve. He said the high rate of cases in the rest of MMR is also because of weak health infrastructure, which also leads to a high CFR as beds are not available at crucial times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-records-highest-1-day-rise-of-7-862-covid-19-cases/story-ayZA4SwT1pjGRTs4Pyjv8K.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||Aadhaar, prescription, Covid test report mandatory for buying drugs||The Maharashtra government on Friday made it mandatory for all medical shops to keep a record of Aadhaar card numbers, prescriptions and contact numbers of all those buying remdesivir and tocilizumab, which are being used to treat moderate and severe cases of Covid-19. The state has also set up a toll free number (1800222365) where people can report anyone hoarding the drugs or selling them at high prices.State home minister Anil Deshmukh and food and drug administration (FDA) minister Dr Rajendra Shingne held a meeting on Friday to regulate the distribution remdesivir and tocilizumab following complaints of the drugs being illegally hoarded and traded in the black market. The meeting was also attended by Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh and director general of police Subodh Jaiswal.“We have decided to make Aadhaar card, Covid test report, prescription and contact details mandatory for those who want to buy these drugs. This has been done in the wake of complaints that some are trying to buy them for black marketing,” Shingne said. “Cipla and Hetero have assured an increase in their supply of remdesivir. People don’t need to panic as sufficient stock will be available soon,” said the home minister. He also said action would be taken against all those found guilty of dealing the life-saving drugs in the black market.Shingne also announced a 24-hour helpline where people can report anyone hoarding the drugs or selling them at inflated prices. In such cases, action will be taken by both FDA and home department.At present, only medical stores attached to hospitals have the drugs. Shingne said only private hospitals ask relatives of patients to get the drugs from these medical stores because Covid-19 is being treated for free at civic-run facilities.Previously, Shingne along with officials from FDA’s vigilance department had conducted surprise checks at six hospitals in the city, including Masina, Sir JJ Hospital, Saifee and Bombay Hospitals. The minister personally checked purchase records at the pharmacies and bills given to customers at medical stores attached to the hospitals.FDA commissioner Arun Unhale confirmed that random checks at hospitals and medical stores have already started. “We have already started random checking to see if black marketing is going on. Those found guilty will be punished under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940,” he said.Shingne said another meeting would be held on Saturday, to see what else can be done to ensure these drugs are not traded illegally or hoarded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aadhaar-prescription-covid-test-report-mandatory-for-buying-drugs/story-MNyanw57auRvznD0Mcyg5H.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||Amid pandemic, uncertainty looms over EWS admissions in private schools in Delhi||With school campuses across the national capital being shut as a result of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, admissions to seats in private schools reserved for economically disadvantaged families have also been disrupted. While parents whose children were selected in the first list of selected candidates released by the Directorate of Education (DoE) in February said they could not complete the process due to the prevailing situation, many said they are still waiting for the second list to be made released.Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25% of all seats in private schools are to be reserved for families under the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Disadvantaged Groups (DG) in entry-level classes — nursery, KG and class 1. Starting in 2020, 3% of these 25% of seats have been kept aside for children with disabilities. This year, there were around 45,000 reserved seats available in around 1,700 private unaided schools in Delhi.The centralised admission process on these seats began on January 25, and the DoE declared the first list of selected candidates on February 29. However, Delhi schools were shut from March 19, as a measure to stem the spread of Covid-19, and have been closed since then.Four months since the academic session began, many parents from economically disadvantaged families said they could not complete their children’s admissions even after they were selected in the first list. Parents expressed concerns over their children being left out due to the delay in admission.Suman Kumari, a resident of south Delhi’s Jaitpur area who stitches clothes for a living, said her five-year-old son was selected for admission in KG in a private school in the neighbourhood. “I had submitted his documents on March 11 for admission under the EWS quota in Real View Public School in Jaitpur. After a few days, the lockdown was announced and all schools were shut. We contacted the school for the follow-up but they said they won’t be able to do anything before July. I waited for three months. Now they are saying that there are issues with our documents. They are telling me this after three months. I do not know how I will get documents changed amid the pandemic. How will my son catch up with other students in class if his admission is delayed further,” she said.Sumit Chandila, an accountant at the school, said, “The school could not start the process of verifying documents earlier, due to the lockdown. There are some issues like incorrect spellings and addresses in a few documents. We have asked the parents to get them fixed first as we cannot enrol anyone without proper documents.”Deepak Kumar, who runs a puncture repair shop in north-east Delhi’s Karawal Nagar said his five-year-old daughter was not selected for admission in nursery under the EWS category in any private school in the first list. “We had contacted the DoE and were told that some more lists would be announced in the coming months, but we are still waiting,” he said.Education activist Sumit Vohra, who runs an online portal on nursery admissions, said they received several complaints from parents whose children were eligible for admissions under the EWS/DG quotas. “Many parents have complained that schools are rejecting admissions on the pretext of incomplete documents. They are unable to get the certificates issued amid the pandemic. The schools should at least give them provisional admissions till they manage to get the requisite documents,” he said.Yogesh Pratap, deputy director of education (private schools branch) of the DoE, said the education department is yet to collect data on the number of EWS/DG seats filled under the first list. “We can only release the second list of selected students after we know the number of seats filled in the first list. The schools remained closed for over three months amid the Covid-enforced lockdown, and could not access the data. We will definitely release consecutive lists and fill the seats once the schools reopen physically,” he said.Pratap said the DoE had issued 10 lists last year to fill the EWS/DG seats, with three of them being released by this time last year. “The situation is unprecedented this year. But we will not let any seat go vacant. No school can deny admission after their children’s name appears in the list of selected candidates. We will also carry forward the vacant seats next year if required,” he said.Ekramul Haque, founder of Mission Taaleem, an NGO, said they have written multiple times to the DoE and the office of Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on the issue. “Three months of this academic session have already passed. How will EWS/DG students catch up with other students if their admissions get delayed for months like this? The government should release the second list of selected candidates and give admission. The students can at least start studying at homes till the schools reopen physically,” he said.A senior advisor in Sisodia’s office said, “The admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi government’s Sarvodaya Schools are also pending due to the prevailing situation. The DoE will surely release more lists of selected EWS/DG candidates. The government is monitoring the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-pandemic-uncertainty-looms-over-ews-admissions-in-private-schools-in-delhi/story-IoOHHS4S1N414nf3in6uoO.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||‘50K vials of remdesivir ordered, tie-up with firm for tocilizumab’||Stocks of anti-viral drug remdesivir and immunosuppressive drug tocilizumab are likely to improve from next week, according to manufacturing companies and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Families of Covid-19 patients and doctors have said that generic brands of remdesivir and tocilizumab are in short supply in Mumbai. The drugs are being used to treat moderate to critical cases of Covid-19 and are only available in hospitals. One city doctor, who is conducting clinical trials of remdesivir for a manufacturing company, said he receives approximately 1,200 requests for the drug daily from distressed patients. Bandra resident Salman Mujawar said, “Two of my uncles, who are senior citizens, have tested positive for the virus. On Wednesday, one was prescribed tocilizumab and the other remdesivir. Neither are available anywhere.”There are two licensed dealers of the drugs in the city. Hetero Healthcare on Friday announced that it will distribute 60,000 units of the Covifor injection, which is its generic brand of remdesivir, across the country between July 13 and July 20. Of these, 12,500 units will be distributed in Maharashtra. This is the second batch from the pharmaceutical company. Cipla, the other company permitted to manufacture the drug, started production of CIPEMI (remdesivir) on Monday. Around 80,000 vials will be available within the first month, said Nikhil Chopra, executive vice president and chief executive officer (India, business), Cipla. Chopra added that Cipla is also moving expeditiously to ensure supplies of tocilizumab. BMC said it has placed an order for 50,000 vials of remdesivir for a month, and will increase the amount in case of greater demand. It has also tied up with a pharmaceutical company to procure tocilizumab, said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health).However, doctors worry that the drugs may be needed in greater quantities. “These drugs are imported to India, although Indian pharmaceutical companies are doing their best to produce and launch internally,” said Dr Prashant Borade, head of the critical care unit of Global Hospitals, in Mumbai. “Several companies need to start producing these medicines in India to match the demand. Also, guidelines are needed regarding their use by the medical fraternity,” he said.BMC, however, denies there has been any shortage in supply and said a revised system is in place to arrest any leakage of drugs. “We are using the drugs judiciously and there is enough till July 31,” said Kakani.On Thursday, BMC directed deans of all civic-run hospitals and medical superintendents of peripheral hospitals to upload real-time information on the use of the drugs. “The hospital has to inform us about patient’s unique identification number, details and the number of vials administered to the patient. This will be cross-checked after the patient is discharged,” said Kakani. On May 20, BMC had placed an order for 3,500 vials of tocilizumab, most of which has been delivered. It also ordered 15,000 vials of remdesivir, of which 5,000 have been delivered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/50k-vials-of-remdesivir-ordered-tie-up-with-firm-for-tocilizumab/story-68qktuckgK4SKRbc00Sd7H.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||Mandis and localities inhabited by migrant workers get antigen testing centres||District authorities Friday further scaled up testing for Covid-19 across Delhi and set up rapid antigen testing centres at major markets, public spaces and localities largely inhabited by migrant workers.Rapid testing was also started in Delhi’s two biggest wholesale markets – the Azadpur mandi and the Ghazipur mandi -- in order to screen vegetable and fruit vendors, transporters and dealers. Friday’s expansion of the rapid testing also covered drivers of public and para-transit modes such as auto-rickshaws and taxis for whom special testing centres have been set up in Anna Nagar in IP Estate and Sanjay Amar Colony in Shahdara.The move comes after the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) on July 9 laid down a fresh plan to augment rapid antigen tests in the city. Before that, on July 8, the DGHS had also revised the plan to identify those who are to be tested. HT had reported about this modified approach to testing on July 5. Districts have to identify and test high-risk individuals living in areas having isolated Covid-19 cases for over 28 days, apart from those in containment and buffer zones. It has also asked authorities to start aggressive testing among ‘special surveillance groups (SSG)’ comprising drivers of rickshaw/auto, taxi, goods carriage and lorries; domestic helps; daily workers (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, etc); daily suppliers of food; and other delivery persons.Following these orders, on Friday, each of the 11 districts in Delhi began expanding their coverage of rapid tests. Rahul Singh, district magistrate (southwest) said mobile testing vans have been deployed in areas where stationary testing centres couldn’t be set up due to space constraints. “Earlier, we had 44 antigen testing centres, the most in any of the 11 districts (north district had the second highest at 26). This has been scaled up further what with all dispensaries also starting antigen testing. On Friday, we launched the SSG testing camps at the furniture market in Najafgarh and at the sabzi mandi (vegetable market) in Naseerpur,” he said.To screen high-risk persons in areas having isolated cases and also in areas largely inhabited by migrant workers and labourers, Singh said the district opened another centre at Bhagat Singh park in Valmiki mohalla in Chhawla area.Nidhi Srivastava, DM (Central), who has been tasked with running a campaign to test taxi, auto and goods carriage drivers, said she began the drive from Anna Nagar in IP district and Sanjay Amar Colony in Shahdara district.“Friday’s response, despite it being the first day, was very positive. Scores of auto and taxi drivers voluntarily came to get themselves tested. In the coming days, we will expand this to cover more areas across the city,” said Srivastava.To identify and screen all people falling in the SSG category, DM (north) Deepak Shinde said all districts are conducting a survey with the help of municipal corporations.“I held a meeting in this regard on Friday. Municipal officials and our district officials will together undertake a survey to identify such people. Apart from that, today (Friday) we have also started a testing centre at the Azadpur market,” Shinde said.For screening in areas from where isolated cases are being reported, all DMs said they are following the daily cluster reports to take necessary action. All districts are also following the detailed data being provided on maps by the GSDL (Geospatial Delhi Limited), the agency specialising in geo-spatial data, an official from the chief minister’s office said on condition of anonymity.DM (east) AK Mishra said 22 dispensaries in his district have been equipped with antigen testing facilities. “So each dispensary has been given a catchment area so that they are aware of the localities whose residents they are to test. Besides, the dispensary next to Ghazipur mandi has also been attached to the wholesale market so that traders are also tested,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mandis-and-localities-inhabited-by-migrant-workers-get-antigen-testing-centres/story-LYNgBVmAy3MKK9fuO0xQ3I.html
11-07-2020||Noida||Noida: Sector 26 residents raise objections to biogas plant coming up nearby||A biogas plant being built by the Noida Authority in Sector 26 is facing objections from some residents and a temple trust that fear that the plant, being set up in their vicinity, can lead to a mishap and its operations can result in an unpleasant smell in the area.A letter signed by several residents was handed over to the Noida authority requesting it to shift the plant to an alternate location. They also complained that the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) did not inform them and that any mishap in the future could affect them.“We are not against the plant but the location of the project. In other sectors, such plants are located away from residential buildings. We are bothered about issues such as stink from the garbage and dung to be used as fuel being dumped here. There are chances of mishaps, as it produces harmful methane and H2S gases,” said Ankush Jain, a resident Sector-26, who lives near the spot where the plant is to come up.The Noida Bengali Cultural Association – a temple trust of a 40-year-old Kali temple or Kalibari in the area – said the plant is being constructed at a nursery adjacent to the temple complex and may turn the place into a garbage segregation spot.“Officials said the plant would benefit the sector. We have told them about our issues and how the plant may become troublesome. There are alternative sites where the plant can be constructed. We have seen some examples where such plants turn the spot into a garbage segregation point and leak hazardous gases,” said Ashok Arya, president, Noida Bengali Cultural Association and Kalibari.The RWA, however, said that the plant is safe and that they are ready to resolve all grievances.“My house is also near that site and it’s just that the people from the temple trust want to grab that land. There are only a few residents who are opposing it because of misconceptions and we are ready to address each issue. The plant is safe and will not cause any stink,” said Govind Sharma, president, Sector 26 RWA.The Noida authority has already constructed 25 such bio-mechanisation plants across the city and is in the process of building 12 others to process biodegradable waste from nearby residential areas. The authority hopes to cover the whole city and in this case, Sector 26 would be serviced, officials said.“We have assured the residents that the plant is safe and asked them to think about it. The work has anyway been stalled for three days due to the weekend lockdown. We will look into their request and try to eradicate misconceptions, but will also not build the plant by force,” said Indu Prakash, officer on special duty (health) Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-sector-26-residents-raise-objections-to-biogas-plant-coming-up-nearby/story-CvDzxAAWTOO9ZkrGDI7bDJ.html
11-07-2020||City||Noida: Bike bot mastermind Sanjay Bhati denied bail for third time||Noida: The mastermind of the alleged Bike Bot ponzi scheme who had allegedly duped nearly 2.25 lakh investors was denied bail by the Surajpur district court for the third time.Sanjay Bhati (42), owner of Garvit Innovative Promoters Ltd who holds diploma in mechanical engineering, launched this fictitious company in 2010, which floated Bike Bot scheme in 2017 under which Rs 1500 crore was duped from investors. He was arrested following his surrender in Surajpur court in June 2019. The scam surfaced after a complainant Sunil Kumar Meena, a resident of Jaipur, filed an FIR against the Bike Bot operator at Dadri police station on February 14, 2019 against Sanjay Bhati and five directors of the company.Bhati has earlier been denied bail twice in October and November , 2019.During a hearing on Wednesday at the Surajpur district court, his defense attorney argued that Bhati had resigned from the company in November 2018.“The bike bot scheme was started in July 2017 but the suspect resigned as director on 18th November 2018 after he got a ticket to contest elections for 2019 parliamentary elections. The entire responsibility for the company fell on other directors and the client is being framed in this case,” said defense lawyer Pawan Kasana.They also said that police evidence does not suggest the amount of money invested by investors. The company only faced monetary problems which is a civil suit and not a criminal one. The client has no prior criminal history and has been in jail for almost a year,he added.Prosecution argued that Bhati has several such cases of fraud and cheating against him and other directors of the company have also denied been denied bail.“Based on the seriousness of the allegations the suspect does not qualify to be released and the bail application is being denied,” said the magistrate in his order.Bhati has nearly 40 cases against him regarding the same ponzi scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-bike-bot-mastermind-sanjay-bhati-denied-bail-for-third-time/story-95732DxPSr8ptv5bUWtGLL.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||WHO praises Dharavi’s Covid fight||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday acknowledged the city’s efforts to contain the outbreak of Covid-19 in Dharavi, India’s largest slum. Dharavi was a hot spot in June, but has seen a sharp drop in cases in July. WHO chief Tedros Adha-nom Ghebreyesus said Italy, Spain, South Korea and Dharavi have showed the virus could be reined in through aggressive action.“In the last six weeks cases have more than doubled,” Tedros told a virtual press conference in Geneva. However, “there are many examples from around the world that have shown that even if the outbreak is very intense, it can still be brought back under control,” said Tedros.“And some of these examples are Italy, Spain and South Korea, and even in Dharavi – a densely packed area in the megacity of Mumbai – a strong focus on community engagement and the basics of testing, tracing, isolating and treating all those that are sick is key to breaking the chains of transmission and suppressing the virus.”State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted, “This is huge for our very own Dharavi that has chased the virus. State Govt and @mybmc teams, along with NGOs, Elected Representatives and most importantly, Dharavikars! Let’s keep this going! Thank you @WHO for recognising their efforts, and will keep going on.”Experts say Dharavi managed to flatten the curve by the end of June. Throughout June, Dharavi recorded an average of 18 new cases daily, with the highest single-day spike in recorded cases on June 1 (34 new cases). Since July, the number of new cases has declined. On Tuesday, Dharavi recorded only one case, its lowest single-day figure in over two months. Subsequently, on Wednesday, it recorded three new cases and nine on Thursday. Twelve new cases were recorded on Friday. The total number of cases in Dharavi now stands at 2359, with 166 active cases.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of G (North) ward, which has jurisdiction over Dharavi, said, “Testing, massive screening, identifying patients and their high-risk contacts, and isolating them from the community has worked very well for Dharavi. The focus is to maintain this situation in Dharavi, so we will continue these efforts.”With inputs from AFP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/who-praises-dharavi-s-covid-fight/story-quFz7j1kyguZztFCwN8ZtK.html
11-07-2020||Noida||Noida: 4 police personnel put in home quarantine after coming in contact with Covid-positive suspect||At least four police personnel from the Sector 20 station were advised home quarantine after they came in contact with a coronavirus (Covid-19)-positive man who was arrested Wednesday night.The 19-year-old suspect in question had first been arrested on June 25 in preventive detention under Section 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, after which he was sent to jail. Police officials said that he had been undergoing treatment for coronavirus in Noida from July 2, from where he fled. He was once again apprehended on July 7 and sent to Greater Noida for treatment.“But he fled once more. On Wednesday night, we received a call from a security guard from Sector 6 about a break-in at a factory. A team was rushed to the spot and he was nabbed. However, they were not aware that he was a positive patient and it was on Thursday morning that it was found that he is the same person who had fled during treatment,” said RK Singh, station house officer, Sector 20 police station.The suspect was later sent to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida while four police personnel, who had come in contact with him, were sent for home quarantine.The SHO said that the premise has been sanitised and all necessary precautions have been taken. More than 50 police personnel have tested positive for Covid-19 in the district so far, of whom 30 have recovered while one 57-year-old diabetic constable lost his life.To keep coronavirus positive prisoners away from others in the Luksar jail, an interim jail has been created in the premises. So far, seven inmates have tested positive, of whom six have recovered while one is undergoing treatment at the NIMS multi-speciality hospital.“Last time, 148 samples were collected of which none came back positive. In case of a positive result, the entire barrack is sealed. When we move inmates from the interim jail, we keep them in 14 day isolation before moving them to the main barracks. In addition, we keep sanitizing the premises and provide kadha (herbal concoction) to all inmates as a precaution,” said jail superintendent Vipin Mishra.Luksar jail currently has almost 2,200 inmates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-4-police-personnel-put-in-home-quarantine-after-coming-in-contact-with-covid-positive-suspect/story-ZTnsrjnOjl6llBlC3VrMZP.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||72 foreigners who attended Tablighi Jamaat congregation freed||Seventy-two foreigners who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin in March were freed on Thursday after they entered a plea bargain and accepted the mild charges against them. Another court allowed bail to 82 other foreigners who had also attended the meet.All were accused of violating the lockdown and other government orders that banned religious congregations in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.With this, in the last three days, 249 of the 956 foreign nationals accused of attending the congregation have been granted bail, and 132 were freed.In the court of metropolitan magistrate Siddharth Malik, 61 Malaysians agreed to a plea bargain where they accepted the mild charges against them, in return for their freedom on payment of a ₹7,000 fine against each of them, said their lawyer S Hari Haran. On Thursday, 60 Malaysians were freed on the same grounds.A plea bargain is an arrangement between the prosecutor and accused whereby the latter pleads guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for a more lenient sentence, or an agreement to drop other charges.During the cognisance of the charge sheets on July 6, judge Malik was informed by the Investigating Officer (IO) that the 956 accused were also investigated for the charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and criminal conspiracy to endanger life or personal safety of others.“However, till date no evidence has come against the foreigners for these,” the investigation officer told the court.Instead, they have pleaded guilty to the violations of the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act, prohibitory orders, disobeying orders from a public servant and other sections of the Indian Penal Code, all of which attracts a maximum of six months in prison. The Centre had already cancelled their visa and blacklisted them. According to Hari Haran, the complainants in the case--Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Lajpat Nagar, Additional Commissioner of Police at Lajpat Nagar and Inspector at Nizamuddin—did not object to their plea bargain applications.Hari Haran also said that in case of the 11 other foreigners -- all Saudi nationals-- metropolitan magistrate Ashish Gupta accepted their plea bargain, also on the same lines as the Malaysians, and released them with a ₹10,000 fine.“As per the mutually satisfactory disposition between the state and the convict , the convict is found to be entitled to be lenient view while deciding the quantum of sentence,” Gupta’s order read.Later the, the Saudi nationals deposited the fine, following which Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur directed that they be deported to their country.In another case, a Delhi court also granted bail to 82 Bangladeshis on a personal bond of ₹10,000 each. Appearing for them, advocates Ashima Mandla and Mandakini Singh said that the accused have also moved for a plea bargain.During the hearing, the foreign nationals, who were staying at a hotel, were produced before the court through video.The police had filed charge sheets against 956 foreigners from 36 countries, including 122 Mayalsians, for violating visa rules, violating government guidelines issued in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and regulations regarding Epidemic diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and prohibitory orders under section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure.They were also accused of offences under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Foreigners Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/72-foreigners-who-attended-tablighi-jamaat-congregation-freed/story-NPU8WAayANScIZfs5qAdWL.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||Malaysian who attended Tablighi congregation found to be minor||Finding that one of the Malaysian nationals who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin in March was a minor, a Delhi court directed the city police to file a separate charge sheet before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) against the person.The juvenile, a Malaysian national, had moved a plead guilty application before metropolitan magistrate Siddharth Malik who transferred the matter to the chief metropolitan magistrate Gurmohina Kaur. The court, after perusing the passport, said that the person was 16 years old.An official of Malaysian High Commission, through video conferencing, confirmed this to the court.“Accordingly, let the charge sheet be separated and be filed before the concerned Juvenile Justice Board. IO is directed to file the separate charge sheet by Monday, July 13 as per law on completion of necessary formalities. Application disposed off accordingly,” said the court.By Friday, 121 Malaysians had been freed after accepting a plea bargain and agreeing to pay a ₹7,000 fine.

11-07-2020||Delhi||Capital’s second plasma bank to open at GTB hospital next week||Delhi’s second plasma bank will open at northeast Delhi’s Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) hospital in the coming week, senior officials in chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said on Friday. “We are in the process of opening up Delhi’s second plasma bank. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been monitoring the setting up of a plasma bank in GTB. Plasma therapy has proved to be life-saving in many corona cases. With this plasma bank, a number of patents will benefit,” said RS Rautela, medical director, GTB hospital.The first one at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) in Vasant Kunj was launched on July 2.A dedicated Covid-19 facility, of the 1,500 beds in the hospital, 206 were occupied on Friday evening.Dilip Pandey, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from Timarpur, who is charge of setting up Delhi’s second plasma bank, said it will be smaller than the one at ILBS.“Today a plasma extraction machine was installed at GTB. The only thing we are waiting for is getting approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). We applied and we are expecting to start the plasma bank from Monday or Tuesday if approval from DCGI comes by this weekend,” Pandey said.The AAP leader said the GTB bank will be able to extract plasma from 7-8 Covid recovered persons in 10 hours. “The set-up is relatively smaller than the one at ILBS, which has three plasma extraction machines compared to one in GTB, though we can increase it any day if demand increases,” he said.The reason for opening a plasma bank at GTB is accessibility, an official in the chief minister’s office said. “By opening the facility in GTB hospital, interested donors from northeast, east, and north Delhi won’t have to travel all the way to South Delhi to donate their plasma,” the official said.The scheme of providing a cab or reimbursing the donor’s transportation cost to and from the hospital will continue, the official added.The first plasma bank in Delhi, also India’s first, opened in ILBS on July 2. Since then, only about 100 persons have come forward to donate their plasma, creating a huge demand and supply gap.Kejriwal on Friday spoke to several plasma donors telephonically and thanked them for their contribution in saving lives. Taking to Twitter, he shared the audio of his conversation with plasma donors. To bridge the gap and to stock the bank with adequate plasma, the government issued several orders this week. It has made it mandatory for donors to replace plasma taken for therapy with equivalent units of plasma of any blood group. It asked all Covid hospitals to ensure all recovered patients fill up a feedback form to assess the “willingness to donate plasma at the time of discharge”. In another order, the government directed all hospitals to display flex boards outside their premises to encourage plasma donation.Therapy through transfusion of plasma – a component of the blood – has been on Delhi since April 22, weeks after global studies showed the technique improved chances of recovery among people with severe Covid-19 illness. Blood and plasma donations require specific matching of blood groups, which often makes the sourcing of plasma difficult, especially at short notice.According to government reports till June, plasma therapy trials in Delhi helped improve the health condition of 34 out of 35 Covid-19 patients in government hospitals and 46 out of 49 patients in private hospitals.To register for plasma donation, one has to call on 1031 or send a message on the WhatsApp number 8800007722. One can also register through the government’s delhifightscorona.in website.To donate plasma, a donor should be a person who was tested positive for Covid-19 through a test. Secondly, s/he must have fully recovered and must be free of any Covid-19 symptoms for 14 days. Only such persons between the age group of 18 and 60 years will be eligible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capital-s-second-plasma-bank-to-open-at-gtb-hospital-next-week/story-LYpiX7eyeBZgzUL1oFh2JI.html
11-07-2020||City||Lack of space forces Kalyan locals to wait for 15-20 hours for kin’s cremation||Residents of Kalyan-Dombivli have to wait for 15 to 20 hours for cremation of their loved ones due to lack of space to accommodate the increasing number of Covid-19 fatalities in the city. While there are five crematoriums in the city, the civic authority has claimed that some of the machines are prone to regular damage due to the burning of the plastic, in which bodies of Covid patients are wrapped. This, they claimed, has also increased the process of cremation from one hour to two hours for each body, which in turn results in the long wait.Authorities said they are looking for alternative cremation techniques. Recently, most residents who lost their loved ones to Covid-19 or other ailments have complained of long waiting hours for cremation.Mayuresh Kene, a 38-year-old Kalyan resident, had to wait for almost eight hours to cremate his friend’s body on Monday. He said, “My friend was declared dead around 2pm, and he was not Covid positive. However, a crematorium in Kalyan said their machines were not working and asked me to visit Dombivli. I went to two other crematoriums, but those had no space to accommodate my friend and I wsa asked to wait till the next day. Finally, I went to the crematorium near Shani Mandir and cremated my friend at 11pm.”There are five crematoriums in the twin cities in Shiv Mandir, Bailbajar and Lalchowki in Kalyan (West); Vitthalwadi; and Patharli in Dombivli (East). Rajat Rajan, 39, a social worker from Dombivli, visited a crematorium where the body he had was the 18th one of the day. He said, “There was only one person who cremated all 17 bodies in a day. We were told that bodies of Covid positive patients take more time to burn due to the plastic and that there was a lengthy cleaning process of the machine. Moreover, some of the crematoriums are defunct, thus adding pressure on the ones that are functional.”KDMC engineer Sapna Koli said, “It is true that the machines are giving us problem due to burning of plastic, however, we have to follow ICMR guidelines. Around 20 bodies are cremated each day. The process, which used to take one hour, now takes over two hours and the machines also get damaged regularly and need a lot of maintenance. Most of our employees, too, have tested positive. So, we are short-staffed which is further adding to the delay.”She added that they have started regular servicing of the machines and are also working on alternative methods. “Before Covid, we used to service the machines once in a while. However, with the increasing load, we have started regular servicing to ensure all machines are working. Our engineers are also looking for better technologies used in other cities to find a solution for the problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lack-of-space-forces-kalyan-locals-to-wait-for-15-20-hours-for-kin-s-cremation/story-0Tnu8zKvv2i9aBQYlrTFkK.html
11-07-2020||City||With rise in Covid-19 cases, biomedical waste in Ghaziabad increases by 390%||With the rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Ghaziabad, the biomedical waste (BMW) generated in the district has increased by about 390%. According to data by the Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB), the district generated about 3152.7 kilogram(kg) of BMW in April, 2,685.73 kg in May, and 12,321.2 kg in June alone. Officials said that majority of the BMW generated in the district was related to the treatment of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and its amount increased as more Covid facilities opened in the district.Before the outbreak, the district generated about 1,100-1,200 kg of bio-medical waste per month.“The spike in the generation of biomedical waste is a result of many Covid treatment facilities being opened in the district. Also, since the number of Covid-19 cases are rising, the amount of biomedical waste is also increasing. We have two private agencies which are collecting such waste, and they have been instructed to pick up the waste each day on time and take it to incinerators for its scientific disposal,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the pollution board.“We are carefully monitoring the lifting and disposal of the BMW related to Covid-19, and are also sending regular reports to the Central Pollution Control Board,” he added.The officials said that the BMW generation came down in the month of May as the district had less number of active cases and had a high discharge rate. According to official records, with a total of 305 cases till May 31, the discharge rate for the district was at about 76.39%.Till July 9, Ghaziabad had a total of 2,740 Covid-19 cases which includes 64 deaths, 1324 patients who were discharged, and the remaining 1,352 as active cases.According to officials, the amount of bio-medical waste also increased in wake of the revised guidelines issued on June 18 regarding Covid-19 related waste. “Till then, only PPE kits, face masks, etc. at hospitals were categorized as BMW. Later when the guidelines were revised, all the waste generated from Covid hospitals is considered to be BMW be it leftover food, water bottles among other things. Hence, there has been a considerable spike in the quantity in June,” said Sanjay Kushaik, regional manager (administration), Synergy Waste Management Pvt Ltd, one of the companies dealing in the disposal of BMW in Ghaziabad.“Since many Covid-19 facilities were opened up and Ghaziabad, the generation of BMW is also on the rise. In the month of July so far, an average of 750-800 kg of BMW has been collected per day,” he added.At present, seven hospitals in Ghaziabad are providing Covid treatment as the health department ropes in more hospitals for the job. Currently, the seven hospitals have 444 beds, while 150 more will be added in the district soon when two more hospitals start providing Covid treatment.“The waste management companies have already been working in Ghaziabad for safe disposal of BMW waste. Our officials are also tracking the lifting of BMW and that it is disposed off regularly without any delays. If the number of Covid cases rise, the generation of BMW will also increase in the future,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-rise-in-covid-19-cases-biomedical-waste-in-ghaziabad-increases-by-390/story-xD5CsiVRvBupRY06lDyktL.html

Locals shot a video and circulated it on social media following which hospital staffers found the patient after three hours. He later succumbed at the hospital. The patient had tested negative for Covid-19 on Tuesday, his second test report is awaited.According to staffers of the Covid hospital, the patient was admitted on July 7 in the intensive care unit (ICU) and fled on Thursday around 9pm. However, he collapsed on the footpath nearby. Locals gathered and shot a video which was then circulated on social media. In the video the patient wearing a mask was seen lying restless on the footpath. “Locals tried asking the patient about his whereabouts but he could not respond. Locals did not touch him suspecting he was a Covid patient. He was lying on the footpath for almost three hours. After locals called Shastri Nagar hospital, he was attended by a hospital employee around 12.30am. He was taken back to the hospital where he was declared dead,” said Mahesh Nimbalkar, a social activist, who shared the video on Thursday night.Suhasini Badekar, chief medical officer of the hospital, said, “The first test report of the patient came negative. On Thursday night when our staffers were busy handling two Covid deaths at the ICU, he managed to flee.”“When we couldn’t find him, we checked the toilets and the hospital premises. Later we got information about a man lying on the footpath nearby and found that it was the same patient. He was bought back to the hospital, but was declared dead on arrival. His Covid-19 test report is awaited,” she added.Earlier in April, a quarantined patient had fled from the toilet of the hospital.Kalyan Dombivli municipal commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi has assured to order an inquiry. “We will check and inquire about the incident and take needful action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patient-flees-from-hospital-collapses-dies/story-8xASd48yMibKoEhkDd30TP.html
11-07-2020||City||Weekend restrictions: Movement curbed at Delhi-UP borders, no new passes to be issued||Movement at the state’s border will be restricted and no new passes will be issued for commuting during the two days – Saturday and Sunday – when Uttar Pradesh goes for a ‘weekend’ restriction, starting 10pm, Friday, till 5am, Monday.“There will be restriction on movement of people at the border. If a person wishes to go to their office in Delhi, they will not be allowed. However, those already having passes or engaged in essential services will be allowed, as usual. We have also considered that vegetable/fruit vendors in localities will be allowed as they cater to essential supplies, but they will have to comply with social distancing norms,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.The state government announced the restrictions late Thursday, to contain the spread of Covid-19.UP chief secretary RK Tiwari issued the order which stated: “Considering the current situation and after a review from the state government regarding containment of Covid-19 and some other vector-borne diseases such as encephalitis, malaria, dengue and kala azar (black fever), the state government has imposed certain restrictions from 10pm on July 10 to 5am on July 13.”On Friday, the chief secretary issued a revised order in which he allowed functioning of industrial units in urban and rural areas, and asked them to ensure social distancing norms and setting up of mandatory Covid helpdesks.“Industrial units are now allowed as per the revised order. Further, we have received the notification of a penalty of Rs 500 to be imposed on persons not covering their faces or wearing masks. The police have been directed to act strictly against such persons. During the two days of weekend restrictions, all major roads will be barricaded like it was done earlier during the lockdown period,” Pandey added.Officials also said they have also issued directions to banquet halls, farmhouses, hotels and restaurants owners to comply with the restrictions.“They have been asked to not allow any new bookings for marriages, parties or functions, etc., for Saturday and Sunday. In case anyone already has previous bookings, they will be allowed to hold functions, etc. Hotel owners have been asked not to allow new guests but the existing occupants will be allowed,” said Prashant Tiwari, sub divisional magistrate.Listing the restrictions, the chief secretary’s order of July 9 says that during this period, all offices, urban and rural haats, markets, grain markets, and commercial establishments will remain closed. The Railways will continue to operate the way it has been and the UP roadways will make arrangements to operate buses to ferry train passengers to and from stations. However, barring these buses, no other public transport will be allowed to operate anywhere in the state.The order also says that transportation of goods will have no restrictions and traffic will be allowed on the national and the state highways.Tiwari in the order said that the state will run an extensive sanitization and drinking water supply consolidation drive, and that all the officers and employees related to the drive will be allowed to join, despite the restrictions.“The office identity card would serve as Covid-19 pass for people who are exempted from restrictions,” said Tiwari’s order.The ongoing large-scale construction activities — such as expressways, big bridges, road, PWD projects, government buildings and private projects – too shall continue work, the order said.The government has ordered all DMs and police officers to ensure adequate surveillance and patrolling for adherence to all restrictions.“The biggest sufferers of the weekend restriction will be the traders and shop owners in markets who already have restricted opening of markets on alternate days. Those whose turn it was to open on these two days will have to remain shut now. Although industrial units are allowed, workers will face issues on roads, with police restrictions. We don’t understand the logic why the two day restrictions have been put in place,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/weekend-restrictions-movement-curbed-at-delhi-up-borders-no-new-passes-to-be-issued/story-sg91x7CLlT7TfKVtvTUwjK.html
11-07-2020||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad private medical colleges can now admit Covid patients||The Uttar Pradesh government, Friday evening, gave temporary permission to private medical colleges to run wards for patients of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. The government, however, also fixed charges for different private wards for different categories of private medical colleges.In the order, issued by additional chief secretary (medical education) Rajnish Dubey, it has been stated that considering the requests of different medical colleges in the state and anticipating the need for more beds in the future, private medical colleges have been given permission to run the wards, at the stipulated rates.While private hospitals have been divided into two different categories - National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) accredited and non-NABH accredited, the patients have been categorised in three groups – those with moderate, severe and very severe sickness or symptoms. The rates for NABH-accredited hospitals vary from Rs 8,500 to Rs 15,300 per day, including the cost of PPE kits. For the non-NABH category, it varies from Rs 6,800 to Rs 12,750 per day, including the cost of PPE kits. “These rates will be applicable for grade-A cities. For grade-B cities, the cap will be 20% less than the higher level,” the order stated.The order further stated that the package rates will be all inclusive, and will include bed, food, amenities, doctors’ consultation, nursing charges, consumables and all other treatments, including oxygen, blood transfusion, supportive care and physiotherapy. “The package will include medical management of underlying comorbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cardio-vascular illness and chronic pulmonary/kidney/hepatic diseases. This will include emergency management procedures such as acute haemodialysis, if needed and non-invasive ventilation such as high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP),” the order stated.The order further said that same rates will be applicable to paediatric patients. “For pregnant women, costs for delivery (normal/C-section) and care of new-borns will be charged extra as per prevailing Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Programme (PMJAY). The rates do not include costs for RT-PCR or IL-6 assay,” it stated.Welcoming the order, a Sharda medical college spokesperson said: “With this order, patients now can choose wards as per their choices in our college,” he said.Meanwhile, with a short weekend lockdown starting from Friday 10 pm to Monday 5 am, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has decided to completely restrict the movement on the inter-state border.District magistrate Suhas LY said that during the lockdown, a special drive against communicable/vector borne diseases shall be carried out. “All shops, offices, commercial establishments, including shopping malls, shall be closed. Industrial establishments shall be open, but they will have to follow all preventive measures, including setting up of Covid helpdesks,” he said.Suhas further said that supply of essential goods and services shall be allowed through home delivery. “Supply of medical goods and services shall be allowed. Such categories of personnel, whose movement is permitted by the government order, will not require separate passes. The ID cards issued by respective organisations/industry shall be considered as valid permits for their movement. Movement to and from railway stations and airports shall not be prohibited,” he said.NOIDA DISTRICT TALLY OVER 3,200On the other hand, with 87 new cases of coronavirus reported in the district in the past 24 hours, the overall count of confirmed cases has gone up to 3,269 cases on Friday. According to the daily health bulletin released by the state control room, a total of 2,221 people have been cured and discharged, including 85 discharged on Friday, in the district so far. “So far, 31 Covid-19 positive patients have lost their lives in the district. As a result, the district now has 1,008 active cases,” the bulletin stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ghaziabad-private-medical-colleges-can-now-admit-covid-patients/story-rYDFkrDhy99RGBpuEiCGLK.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||Schools can refuse online class ID if parents can’t prove financial difficulty: HC||If parents are unable to satisfy the school regarding their financial difficulties, the school authorities can refuse to provide their wards ID and password for online education facilities, the Delhi high court has said.Justice Jayant Nath -- who was hearing a plea challenging a Delhi government circular directing schools not to deny ID and password for online classes to students who did not pay fees due to financial constraints -- also said the schools are free to issue notice to parents who defaulted in payment of tuition fees for more than two months.The court said if parents are able prove their financial problems, then no action should be taken against their kids.“In case the parents are able to convince/demonstrate to the petitioner (school) about their financial problems/financial incapacity to immediately pay pending fees, the petitioner shall not take any further steps for the time being against such parents,” the court said.“Where parents are unable to satisfy/demonstrate to the petitioner (school) regarding their financial difficulties, the school is free to so communicate the same to the parents and decline to provide them ID and Password for online education facility for the students,” the court said in its order passed on July 8. The court also said if parents have any grievance against such an order passed by school, they can approach the appropriate authority of the Delhi government.The court sought the government’s response on a plea filed by a private school through its counsel Romy Chacko, challenging its April 18 circular that says only tuition fees shall be charged from parents during the lockdown.Appearing for the Delhi government, its counsel said that according to the April 18 circular, schools are free to take steps, including issuing notice to parents of students who defaulted in payment of tuition fee.“An opportunity may be given to the parents to explain if they are suffering from any financial crisis. In case such parents are not able to satisfy/demonstrate the school regarding their financial problems, it is only in that eventuality that steps can be taken as per law by the school,” the counsel told the court.Following this, the court issued a slew of directions and posted the matter on August 15 for further hearing.Advocate Chacko said many students were “taking unfair advantage” of the circular’s provisions. About 40% students are defaulting in payment of tuition fee, resulting in a grave financial crisis to the institution that is “struggling to pay salaries of the staff and teachers”.The school urged the court to allow it to charge the actual expenditure incurred by it during the lockdown period in the form of fees from students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/schools-can-refuse-online-class-id-if-parents-can-t-prove-financial-difficulty-hc/story-512jhvCPYpkG0xIQOqP5CM.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||Business community demands waiver in fixed charges in electricity bills||As a Delhi government-appointed committee explores avenues for economic reform in the Capital, traders and industrial unit owners’ associations have asked the government to waive fixed charges in electricity bills for the lockdown period.Arguing that businesses were shut between March 22 and May 17, Sanjay Bhargava, president of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said “The trading community is already under tremendous pressures due to negligible business, even after markets have been allowed to open. When markets were not open, why should traders be made to pay fixed charges?”Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to repeated requests for comment.While economic activity has resumed, industrial unit owners in Delhi said production had returned to just around 40-50% of capacity so far. Several said the government will have to support businesses at least in the current financial year, arguing that demand is unlikely to revive completely over the next few months.Ashish Garg, secretary of Narela Industrial Complex Welfare association, said, “We have already suffered losses due to the lockdown. The government should waive fixed charges for the last three months because everything was closed. When other states can do it, why can’t Delhi?”They also said the Centre has given discoms financial assistance for losses incurred during the lockdown. Rajesh Garg, secretary of the Indian Council for Trade and Industries, who also owns a factory in Narela, said, “The government should support industries and traders for the economy to return to normal. The Centre has provided financial assistance to discoms. When they have got the benefit from the Centre, it should be passed on to consumers as well. As work will take time to pick up, we request the government to charge fixed charges as per actual consumption of electricity.”The Centre had, in May, announced Rs 90,000 crore liquidity injection into fund-starved discoms as part of a stimulus package to revive the country’s economy.When contacted, Brijesh Goyal, Aam Aadmi Party’s trade wing convener of the Delhi Unit and a member of the 12-member panel constituted by the government to explore economic reforms, said, “This matter was not discussed in the first meeting of the committee. Actually, we have not got any representation from traders and industrial unit owners demanding waiver in fixed charges in electricity bills. If we get any such request, we will definitely place it before the committee for discussion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/business-community-demands-waiver-in-fixed-charges-in-electricity-bills/story-x1QnvgCXKwIrgTnJtF0lzO.html
11-07-2020||City||Two hospitals served show-cause notice over report mix-up||A day after private hospitals in Kalyan mixed up a 35-year-old woman’s Covid-19 test results with those of a 45-year-old infected patient, the health department of Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) on Friday served a show-cause notice to the hospitals located in Kalyan (West), asking them to explain their side within 24 hours.“We have served notice to the hospitals asking for explanation after the family has complained about the mix-up of reports,” said Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.The 35-year-old patient, Nita Sawant, a resident of Adharwadi, Kalyan (West), is currently admitted at Meera Hospital in Kalyan (West). A representative from the hospital said, “The patient is stable and her treatment is underway.”Meanwhile, Mahatma Phule police called her family to record their statement on Friday.On Thursday, Sawant’s family had alleged that a hospital in Kalyan mixed up her Covid-19 test results with those of a 45-year-old infected patient and sent her for Covid-19 treatment to another hospital.The family realised there was a mix-up when the medical store where they went to buy some injections pointed out that the age of the patient mentioned on the test report does not match the age mentioned on the woman’s Aadhaar card.According to her family members, Sawant fell sick on July 3 and was taken to private hospital in Kalyan. On July 5, the hospital claimed her report to be positive and asked to take her to another private hospital in Kalyan, saying her condition was severe. The family has spent ₹1.5 lakh on her treatment.Sawant’s brother, Ajay, has since filed a complaint with Mahatma Phule police station and KDMC health department.“The police had called to record our statement on Friday. We have explained the entire incident to them,” said Ajay, 34.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-hospitals-served-show-cause-notice-over-report-mix-up/story-YXgGiGEws279s7nUGPgHpJ.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||OPD visits at AIIMS down to a fraction in post-Covid reality||It’s been two weeks since the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) reopened its outpatient clinics, after three months of keeping them closed due to the lockdown, but the eight-storey building is nearly empty on Friday. The 30 patients who had appointments were done with their consultations by 11.30 am.At the waiting areas outside consultation rooms at the new Raj Kumari Amrit Kaur OPD block at Masjid Moth, yellow squares are marked on the floor, and every alternate chair is blocked in bids to ensure social distancing — but there are no patients.Before it shut on March 23, around 13,000 patients would queue up for appointments at outpatient clinics every day. However, hospital officials said patients now stay away for fear of infection. Additionally, fewer patients are allowed to visit the campus, with most given tele-consultations.The 60-year-old hospital had, in February, moved its clinics to the sprawling new building with modern amenities, as part of a redevelopment plan.Outside the new building, a screening room has been set up to check every patient for symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Guards and volunteers at the gate check off the names of the patients against a list.“Patients have to first register for tele-consultation. They are given an appointment for the OPD if doctors ask to see the patient in person. We receive such a list every day, since no walk-in patients are allowed. Since the reopening, we’ve mostly been getting patients from the orthopaedics department,” said a volunteer on duty who asked not to be named.The hospital has been providing pre-registered patients with tele-consultations since April after the OPD was closed. The service has now been extended to new patients as well. At least 1,000 patients receive tele-consultations a day, hospital officials said.“With OPD services reopening, five or six departments have started registering new patients. Patients are called in only if the doctor thinks they need to see the patient in person to treat them. We have restricted our OPD services to about 15 patients a day for each department. However, we are receiving fewer patients than that. People are scared they will get the infection if they come to the hospital,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital.With almost half the patients at the hospital coming from other states, travel restrictions have played their part in keeping the visitor-count low.“Almost half our patients — about 48%, according to our data — travel in from outside Delhi, and they’re not able to travel because of the lack of inter-state trains and buses. This could be another reason for the low attendance,” said Dr Sharma.On Friday, the only busy area in the hospital was outside the cancer wing, where patients submitted medical files to a guard outside. Before the lockdown, the cancer centre used to receive around 600 patients in its outpatient clinics daily, which had gone down to about 250 during the lockdown.“With restrictions being lifted and travel allowed, the numbers are going up again now. Cancer patients cannot wait, they were coming to us throughout the lockdown,” said Dr Sharma. Another person called patients inside, one at a time. A microphone has been fixed to the railing outside the building with bandages to ensure that everyone can hear the call, including those sitting across the road.Fifty-four-year-old Mohd Ilias, a bladder cancer patient had travelled to the department for a quarterly screening. “I have already had surgery and chemotherapy, but I have to come here every three months to show the doctor my scans, to check if the cancer has returned. I have been waiting here for three hours now, but I have noticed that once their names are called, patients are immediately taken to the doctor’s cabin and come out within 10 minutes. There is no queue inside,” he said.“We kept the cancer centre open even during the lockdown because cancer is almost an emergency. It is potentially life-threatening if not treated in time,” Dr Sharma said.The palliative care centre — which provides morphine to cancer patients in pain — also remained open. “Opioids (strong and addictive pain medicines) cannot be prescribed after telephonic or vide consultations — the guidelines released by the health ministry are clear. So we kept the clinics running for patients in pain, asking new patients to come in for one consultation and providing adequate medicines to family members of our old patients. For those who travel from outside the state, we connected them to local hospitals where we have trained doctors from our centre,” said Dr Sushma Bhatnagar, head of the department of onco-anaesthesia and palliative care at AIIMS.The only queue was outside the hospital’s emergency department, where patients waited for their turn to be screened for Covid-19 before receiving care. A separate set of trolleys have been placed for patients coming in with Covid-19 like symptoms. They are taken into the hospital emergency through a separate screening area where the entire staff is in full personal protective gear.“The attendance at the emergency wing is also lower than we used to see. Most people are just not coming in. It’s the Covid ward that remains busy,” said a guard posted outside the hospital emergency wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/opd-visits-at-aiims-down-to-a-fraction-in-post-covid-reality/story-lpfMhCg48jb2LHIZJaFKeL.html
11-07-2020||City||From July 13, confirmatory RT-PCR testing only for symptomatic cases in Ghaziabad||Alarmed by the large number of people testing positive through RT-PCR tests after testing negative during rapid antigen testing in the district, the Ghaziabad health department on Friday said that starting July 13 it will only retest samples of symptomatic patients for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) through the lab-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for “true negatives”. To expand testing in the district, Ghaziabad administration had started rapid antigen testing on June 26 in containment and non-containment zones. The state government had also given the district a target of collecting 3,000 samples per day for antigen-testing under its special surveillance drive from July 2 to July 12. District health officials said that considering the directions for bulk testing, they had been conducting antigen tests for all, symptomatic as well as asymptomatic persons, during the 10-day long drive. They said they witnessed a high positivity rate of about 15% when RT-PCR tests of those who were found negative during rapid antigen testing were conducted.“During the special antigen testing drive, we received directions to undertake bulk testing. Hence, we were testing symptomatic as well as asymptomatic persons even during the RT-PCR test in order to find true negative after a negative antigen test. This led to an increase in the number of cases in the last 8-10 days. So, after July 12, we will now adhere to the ICMR guidelines strictly and conduct RT-PCR tests of only symptomatic patients who test negative during antigen testing, ” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.According to the ‘newer additional strategies’ for Covid-19 testing issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) on June 23, “A positive test should be considered as a true positive whereas all symptomatic individuals testing negative through the rapid antigen test should be confirmed with a real-time PCR test.”Antigen tests look for specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. The new test is highly specific (99.3% to 100%) — meaning a positive result on the test is a “true positive” and does not need any confirmatory test. The sensitivity of the test is between 50.6% to 84% depending on the viral load, meaning those who test negative are not “true negative” and might still have the infection and are advised to go for a test through the more reliable RT-PCR method if they show symptoms of the disease.“Between June 26 and July 9, we have conducted about 16,634 antigen tests and 477 of these were found positive (positivity rate at 2.8 %). For those found negative during antigen testing, we were getting the samples checked for true negative with the help of RT-PCR test. This was done for all, symptomatic as well as asymptomatic, patients. When we started with the subsequent RT-PCR tests, we found that out of 1,666 test reports received so far, as many as 263 cases have turned positive leaving us with a positivity rate of about 15.78%, ” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.The district had received a total of 19,000 rapid antigen testing kits before the bulk testing started and has only a few thousands kits left now. Health officials said they have information that 50,000 more antigen test kits will be provided to the Meerut division ( Ghaziabad included) soon, but the date when the additional kits will arrive is not confirmed.The district has so far conducted a total of about 46,439 tests which including testing methods such as RT-PCR, TrueNat, and rapid antigen kits. Till July 10, Ghaziabad has a total of 2,863 Covid-19 cases which includes 63 deaths, 1,459 discharged patients, and the remaining 1,341 active cases, including 124 cases added on Friday.The district’s current positivity rate is about 6.1% with the recovery rate at about 59.23 which is lower than UP’s overall recovery rate of 65.28% and the national recovery rate of 62.42% (issued by the union ministry of health & family welfare on July 10) The case-fatality rate in Ghaziabad is about 2.33% now.Since active cases have been on a constant rise, health officials for the last two days have been checking for the discharge status of patients who have recovered but are were still reflecting as active cases on the state portal.“In the last two days, we have been able to identify bout 400 such patients who had been discharged from hospitals but their entries were not uploaded over the state portal. After we started calling patients, rectifications are being made. Only July 9, entries of as many as 252 patients were rectified and shown as discharged over the state portal. So, the exercise will bring down our rate of active cases further and we will continue with it,” Dr Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-july-13-confirmatory-rt-pcr-testing-only-for-symptomatic-cases-in-ghaziabad/story-s1CExl6VZcac4V2eMxe3pJ.html

His wife, Minal, had tested positive five days ago.Patil, in a statement published on social media on Friday, shared that his family has been active in reaching out to people during lockdown. “After my wife tested positive, 10 members of my family also went for the swab test and seven of us tested positive; this includes my sons, nephew, daughter and daughters in law,” Patil said in the statement.“For almost two months after the lockdown was imposed, all of us were at home following social distancing and lockdown norms. However, as the number of cases increased in Bhiwandi, we stepped out to help locals with medical camps and providing aid. My wife and sons also joined in and we reached out to people in various areas of Bhiwandi, Kalyan and Shahapur as well,” he said. After Patil’s wife tested positive, 10 of his family members including Patil got swab tests done, of whom seven have tested positive. His wife is admitted to a private hospital in Mumbai whereas Patil is quarantined at home as he is asymptomatic. Confirming the news, a Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation official said, “As the family had visited many places and interacted with people, we are currently making a list of people who have been in close proximity with the family.”Bhiwandi recorded 59 positive cases on Friday taking the total to 2,501 cases and 141 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-mp-6-family-members-test-positive/story-sbNYTKLdRCL04IH6J2PCXL.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||To decongest busy ITO junction, traffic police seeks a detailed study from PWD||With an aim to decongest central Delhi’s busy ITO intersection, the traffic police has written to the public works department (PWD) to conduct a comprehensive study of the stretch and adjoining areas to assess traffic volume and accident count so that tailor-made solutions can be found. Traffic unit’s deputy commissioner of police (central range) Anita Roy on Tuesday wrote to PWD officials asking for a detailed study of the ITO junction and the area in a 4-5km radius around it. “ITO is a very important junction, considering that it is the primary connecting point between central and east Delhi. Our plan is to make this stretch a model one for the rest of the city. For this, understanding the issues plaguing the area will be the first step,” Roy said. The traffic police has asked the PWD to assess details such as the vehicular volume at the intersection during normal as well as peak hours. The traffic police has also asked for information on how traffic volume is affected during VIP movements, sports events, exhibitions and protests. Details of pedestrian counts and parking requirements in nearby areas have also been sought as a part of the study.Shashi Kant, PWD’s engineer-in-chief, said the department will take up the study and all required aspects would be looked into. He, however, said he was yet to “officially receive” the communication from the traffic police department.Before asking the PWD for the study, the traffic police department, along with Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) and two road safety NGOs, had conducted a series of inspections of the area before the lockdown was imposed on account of Covid-19 on March 25.A senior PWD official, privy to the development, on condition of anonymity said the outcome of the ITO decongestion plan, along with the ongoing Pragati Maidan redevelopment project, which includes a traffic circulation plan around Mathura Road, Purana Qila Road, Bhairon Marg and the Ring Road, will result in holistically decongesting all these stretches. Ranked among the busiest intersections in the national capital, ITO daily sees serpentine jams, which worsens during the rush hour. However, no effective solution has been implemented by authorities to ease commuter woes. In 2015, the Delhi traffic police, with the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre, has come up with a one-way plan for the intersection. During the evening rush hour, when vehicles coming from east Delhi were directed towards Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Marg, and from there made to take a right towards Gandharva Mahavidyalaya to join Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg via Kotla Marg. Similarly, vehicles coming from Minto Road and Connaught Place are made to take a left from DDU Marg towards Kotla Marg. Senior traffic officials said even though this one-way plan had helped take away some traffic from the main intersection, the problem was more deep-rooted. S Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, CRRI, who was part of the inspection team, said no recent study has been conducted to assess the problems of ITO. “We have been taking measures to regulate traffic in the area based on a study from 2017 which estimates that nearly 4.5 lakh vehicles pass through the junction throughout the day, but that study does not give exact data about traffic flow at different timings,” he said.Velmurugan said measures such as the construction of a 1.2km tunnel between Purana Qila Road and the Ring Road along with six underground U-turns on Mathura Road, Bhairon Marg and the Ring Road will decongest ITO crossing and W-point near Pragati Maidan. “These measures should come up at the earliest. Delay only aggravates the problem,” he said.The PWD is constructing this ₹777-crore project to ease travel to India Gate and parts of central Delhi from different corners of the city, especially from east Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said, “With limited public transport modes, and a fear of safety, commuters are likely to depend on private vehicles and this will add to the vehicular load. Preparing for the worst will help agencies manage this actuality in the coming months,” Roychowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-decongest-busy-ito-junction-traffic-police-seeks-a-detailed-study-from-pwd/story-FvUVfsi6nlfAm3lRI2AAVK.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi begins plantation amid a shortage of workforce and fund crunch||The Delhi government’s forest department and other road-owning agencies, such as the four municipalities (east, north, south Delhi municipal corporations and New Delhi Municipal Council), the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Public Works Department (PWD), are to begin the annual task of planting trees across the city. However, this year, the agencies are struggling to meet these targets because of a major shortage of workforce and funds.The state forest department has set a mammoth target of planting 3.1 million saplings this season. However, senior officials said that during the Covid-19 lockdown, several contractual gardeners and outsourced labourers left for their villages, which is likely to affect the plantation process.“We depend a lot on outsourced labour to meet the plantation target, but this year, we are facing a major labour crunch. Our own staff cannot handle such a massive target. Hopefully, in the next few weeks, labour will return and we will be able to meet the target,” a senior forest department official said.The official explained that even though most saplings were prepared for this season in nurseries months in advance, they need an additional workforce to shift these saplings to the required locations without damaging them.“Because these saplings are generally planted on the sides of the road, the possibility of them being damaged is higher if we directly plant them on the site. This is why we first let the saplings gain some strength in the nurseries before moving them,” the official said.Every year 6,000 to 8,000 people are engaged by the department. From July 10, the department started its plantation drive, and this annual exercise will continue till the end of September (the end of the monsoon).Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai, who inaugurated the plantation drive for the rest of the season on Friday, said that these plantation targets were decided after a detailed consultation with departments.“We aim to plant as many saplings as we can to improve Delhi’s green belt. We are going to not only meet our targets, but surpass them,” Rai said.Other road-owning agencies, responsible for increasing the city’s green cover, are also facing similar hurdles that are likely to impede the plantation drive this year.A senior official of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said that Covid-19 will have an impact on the plantation drive, which is to start next week. He said that apart from the labour crisis, a fund crunch has hit the municipality.“Due to the unavailability of labour this year, we couldn’t manage to grow the desired number of saplings in our nurseries. We will now have to rely on NGOs and the forest department to donate plants to us as we are unable to buy them due to a fund crunch,” the official said, requesting to not to be named.He said that the civic body is yet to receive a plantation target from the forest department. At present, there are around 1,250 permanent gardeners with SDMC.A senior official of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation also said that due to a lack of funds, the civic body could not procure semi-grown canopy plants and will have to depend on a limited number of low-height saplings. He said that semi-grown plants’ survival rate is better than the small saplings’.He said that there are around 1,600 to 1,700 gardeners available with the civic body, but an additional workforce might be required for a massive plantation drive. He said that this year’s target is to plant 50,000 trees and one lakh shrubs.Jai Prakash, mayor, north Delhi, said, “We will optimally use our existing workforce to successfully achieve our plantation target. Due to the lack of funds and a workforce, we will not conduct a big ceremonial plantation drive. Since we could not buy plants due to shortage of funds, we will request the forest department, NGOs and corporate houses to donate saplings for the cause.”The officials of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation also reiterated similar problems and said that they would try to make the plantation drive a success using limited resources. Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which has a target of planting 9.4 lakh saplings, said they are yet to begin the plantation drive and if such problems are encountered in the process, they will look for solutions.“There is no doubt that there is a shortage of labour these days, not just for plantation but for all development projects. But we are hoping that with migrant labour now returning to cities, we will be able to get ample labour to efficiently complete our target,” a DDA spokesperson said.The officials of PWD’s horticulture department said that there was a shortage of labourers for plantation. “There are nearly 700 permanent gardeners with the department and we will require an additional workforce to meet the target in time. Every year, contractual staff, as well as permanent staff, is engaged in the exercise, but this year due to Covid-19, many contractual workers have gone to their hometowns,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/city-begins-plantation-amid-a-shortage-of-workforce-and-fund-crunch/story-zMZU4rQScAaGBY5SzHKCyK.html
11-07-2020||Delhi||SDMC likely to look at open-air dining proposal at next meeting||Residents of the city will have to wait a little longer to enjoy the open-air dining experience at restaurants in south Delhi as the Standing Committee of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Friday postponed a discussion on the proposal. The committee members have asked the officials to broach the matter in the next meeting, likely to be scheduled later this month, saying that they need more time to discuss the draft policy.The move was envisaged after restaurant owners approached the civic body with a request to allow open-air dining on the terraces and lawns of restaurants, citing losses due to Covid-19.According to SDMC officials, the policy allowing restaurants and eateries to serve food in open spaces is more relevant during the Covid-19 crisis as there is a lower risk of the virus spreading in open areas than in closed rooms with air conditioning.“We have placed a draft policy before the standing committee which has not been passed today. It has been postponed until the next meeting,” the official said.Under the policy, the municipality plans to allow open-air dining at restaurants under its jurisdiction with certain riders. There are nearly 2,000 restaurants and eateries in south Delhi. A senior SDMC official said that according to the draft policy that open-air dining would be allowed only at those restaurants which own open areas or terraces so that there is no encroachment on public land or pavements. “The policy does not allow cooking or barbecuing in the open. The food should be cooked in closed kitchens and only be served in the open. Light music can also be played in an open-air dining area, but it should not be beyond permissible decibel levels. Live band performances will not be allowed under such as arrangement,” the official said.He added that under the policy, liquor would only be permitted at licensed terraces and the restaurant owners would have to install view cutters and high parapet grilles to ensure that there is no inconvenience to others. The official said that the licensing fee is yet to be fixed but it is likely to be around ₹100 per square ft for normal restaurants and ₹200 per square ft for four-star restaurants and hotels. “We have postponed the matter to the next meeting as there are several points, such as licensing fee, which are to be discussed in detail,” a member of the SDMC standing committee said. The officials further said that, under the policy, the only restaurants that would be allowed to have open-air seating arrangements would be those that already have a health trade license and a NOC from the fire department.Commenting on the matter, Sandeep Khandelwal, the president of the Delhi Hotel and Restaurants Association, said, “There is no point in delaying the policy to allow open-air dining at restaurants. Such a move is more relevant during the pandemic because there is a smaller chance of the virus spreading. The move is also aimed at benefiting traders, as due to Covid-19, people do not want to visit restaurants. The open-air dining system is already in place in many counties, so the authorities should allow such a practice here also. Such a move will also bring more revenue to the corporation. It should be implemented at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sdmc-likely-to-look-at-open-air-dining-proposal-at-next-meeting/story-fw2pFDzUSzDQmLPRhTBfCP.html

11-07-2020||Mumbai||Lack of community toilets in Shivaji Nagar slums pose greater Covid risk||More than a year after the state human rights commission took suo moto cognisance of reports on lack of community toilets in the slums of Shivaji Nagar in Deonar, nothing has changed on-ground, says NGO Apnalaya, an organisation working in the slum clusters.In November 2018, the NGO calculated the ratio of people per toilet seat as being 145:1, a far cry from the Swachh Bharat Mission norms which states that there should be one toilet seat for every 25 people.The ratio is more troublesome in the current pandemic, especially in areas that have the worst health indices in the city. As per the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Covid-19 report for July 9, M-East ward has reported 3,427 cases and 277 deaths.According to the Mumbai Human Development Report 2009 of United Nations Development Programme, the average life expectancy in M-East ward (which includes Shivaji Nagar) is 39 years. The same report puts M-East on the lowest rank among the city’s 24 wards in terms of human development index. Another 2017 situational analysis by Apnalaya found that 44% of children in the ward are underweight while 57% are stunted. Around 88% of pregnant women here are anaemic.The lack of community toilets forces people to stand in long queues or resort to open defecation. Rehan Shaikh, a resident of the area, said, “The queues are always long. The doors of the functional toilets are often broken, and the toilets are dirty. It becomes very difficult during the rains.”Poornima Nair, director (health and disability) at Apnalaya, said, “The human rights commission took suo moto cognisance when the report was published in 2018. Still, the situation is the same. The long-term impact of this is that people get regular bouts of diarrhoea and other ailments, especially during monsoon.”Sunita Choure, program in-charge at Apnalaya, said, “People with disabilities, pregnant women and senior citizens find it more difficult to access the toilets.”While Sudhanshu Dwivedi, ward officer of M-East was not available for comment, Shaera Khan, a councillor from electoral ward 134 of Shivaji Nagar, said, “In the last one and a half to two years, BMC has given approval for 25-30 community toilets in every electoral ward, but the work has been very slow. Now, the lockdown and monsoon have further affected the work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lack-of-community-toilets-in-shivaji-nagar-slums-pose-greater-covid-risk/story-C6l3BZG22wnuGYTVBRkgsN.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||SGNP residential quarters declared containment zone after 16 positive cases reported||The entire staff residential area at Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) has been declared a containment zone by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) after 16 Covid-19 cases were reported there.Over the past two months, seven SGNP employees tested positive while the remaining cases were of family members and neighbours who had contracted the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, over the past few weeks, said SGNP officials.So far, one death has been reported during the last week of May from Dam pada, located close to SGNP’s boating area. On May 8, the area was declared a containment zone – the first one inside the national park.“The most recent case was reported on Thursday, taking the case count to 16, of which 10 are active. All 10 are at Covid-19 care centres,” said a senior SGNP official. “Cases are scattered, but we are observing a pattern. Every two weeks, there is one positive case, followed by two to three associated ones. The area is then declared a containment zone.”A medical officer from BMC’s R-North ward confirmed the entire staff colony and hamlets such as Dam pada, Chinch pada, and Chuna pada inside SGNP, and Damu Nagar in Kandivli, Appa pada in Malad, Mulund’s Khindi pada and a few more areas along the park’s periphery were declared containment zones.Though the park has been shut for visitors since March 18, BMC has placed a sign at SGNP’s entrance cautioning citizens about containment zones inside the park. SGNP has over 2,000 families with close to 35,000 tribal residents living across 56 hamlets.SGNP assistant conservator of forests Sachin Repal said, “BMC directed us to ensure that all residential areas within the park are identified as containment zones even if there are no cases in the area. This is to ensure no further spread of the coronavirus due to an increasing trend. With help from Mumbai Police and BMC, we are able to provide all essentials, including rations, vegetables, and medicines to residential quarters and tribal hamlets.”Repal added that all waste from the residential quarters and hamlets is being carefully collected. “We are in close proximity to animals, and open garbage could have adverse effects on wildlife,” he said.Meanwhile, all 102 residents of the staff quarters employed in animal care at the lion and tiger safari, and leopard rescue centre continue to report for work.“None of them have tested positive or have any symptoms. Regular thermal testing, sanitisation is conducted, and protective equipment is being used,” said Vijay Barabde, superintendent of safaris and range forest officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sgnp-residential-quarters-declared-containment-zone-after-16-positive-cases-reported/story-WmkgerUq3DMIZs96mre18J.html
11-07-2020||Mumbai||Rapid antigen kits, tests without prescription may push up cases in Mumbai||At a time when the city crossed 90,000 Covid-19 cases, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is expecting a spike in the number of daily cases owing to the increase in tests to 5,000 daily and the permission to conduct tests without a prescription. BMC is also using 1 lakh rapid antigen kits that give results in 30 minutes to increase the testing strength. As of July 9, 3.79 lakh tests have been conducted in Mumbai, with a positive rate of 23.39%, according to BMC data. In May, the average daily tests conducted by BMC was 3,800, followed by 4,300 in June, and going up to nearly 5,000 tests daily. The figure includes both RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said it would be difficult to predict a spike or decline in cases. “We can’t claim cases have saturated or peaked or we will see a downward trend now. We have made preparations to cater to a spike in the number of cases for the coming days. With liberalised testing guidelines and use of rapid antigen kits, we might see a spike in the coming days, but we will have to wait for a few more days for the impact to be seen.”Also Read: WHO praises Dharavi’s Covid fightKakani said, “We are already conducting around 5,000 tests daily, and this number will go up further to 6,000 or 7,000. However, we can’t tell how many tests will be conducted daily. It depends [on various factors]. We have been using rapid antigen kits for which we are floating bids to appoint private laboratories to carry out tests on a larger scale.”Currently, BMC has tested 2,000 samples using the rapid antigen kits, and 5% of those have come positive. However, the kits are majorly being used in the suburbs, where cases are rising at a faster pace, and among frontline workers.BMC in a circular issued on July 7 said any person who thinks he was in close contact with a patient who tested positive and is a high-risk contact, irrespective of the age, can get tested. BMC has also asked ward officers in western suburbs to use antigen kits and conduct at least 250 tests daily. Private laboratories are anticipating a surge in queries, while many said they are getting double the number of queries now.Also Read: Lack of community toilets in Shivaji Nagar slums pose greater Covid riskMetropolis, a private laboratory in a statement, said, “We have witnessed an increase in queries from patients, almost double the number of daily queries. We ensure details such as symptoms or high-risk contacts are captured. Our team is geared up to handle the spike and our goal is to issue reports within 24 hours. We have the capacity to conduct a few thousand tests per day.”Ravi Aggarwal, regional COO, SRL Diagnostics, another laboratory involved in conducting Covid-19 testing, said, “It is evident that the government is now trying to adequately scale up testing – a measure that alone could hold the key to beating the outbreak. Being one of the few labs in Mumbai that has the highest testing capacity, we are well prepared to cater to the volumes which are likely to go up. We have a 24x7 operation set-up which has been further reinforced in anticipation of the increased patient flow. The process so far has been appointment-based as well as walk-ins without prior appointments, however, as we foresee an increase in volumes, we would suggest and urge patients to make prior appointments, so that we can implement social distancing norms for everyone’s benefit.”Also Read: Covid positive MBBS students can confirm postgraduate admission onlineSiddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant, said, “There is no doubt that daily testing has increased, but we need to scale it up. We already have 1 lakh rapid antigen kits in our hand. We should set a timeline wherein a certain number of additional tests should be conducted using these kits in the next two weeks.”Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , who has been criticising BMC, tweeted on Friday: “In a city like #Mumbai where 89,124 patients got diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, why is the number of daily tests so less especially when 24% of the total tests are positive? It is difficult to win the war against corona without increasing the number of tests.”The city has been witnessing cases between 1,000 and 1,500 on a daily basis since the last week of May. On Friday, Mumbai recorded 1,337 fresh cases and 73 new deaths. City’s case tally rose to 90,461 while the toll touched 5,205. The total number of discharged patients in Mumbai is 61,934, with a recovery rate of 68.46%. Further, active cases stand at 23,305. The fatality rate as of Friday was 5.75% and the doubling rate was 49 days. One hot spot that has shown signs of drastic improvement – Dharavi – recorded 12 new cases on Friday, bringing the area’s case count to 2,359, of which 1,952 have been discharged. Meanwhile, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar visited the Covid-19 ward in Sion hospital on Friday and interacted with the patients. Pednekar also requested the patients to donate their blood plasma after recovery to save others’ lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rapid-antigen-kits-tests-without-prescription-may-push-up-cases-in-mumbai/story-TCaJlKvRNINfdQz3xnbVlJ.html

I stayed away from social media platforms though,” she said.Rishita’s father Naresh Kumar is an assistant auditor in the Haryana government’s cooperative department and is posted in Jind, while her mother is a primary teacher at Tagore Senior Secondary School, Narnaund, where she is studying.WANTS TO BECOME A DOCTOR TO SERVE IN RURAL AREASThe Class 10 topper said that she wants to become a doctor to serve rural Haryana.“ I want to be able to save lives. Many people die in rural areas due to lack of medical care. I want to serve them. I want to make a true connection with people by saving their lives,” she said.She urged students to simply focus on their studies and not think about the result. “I never dreamt I would be the state topper. In fact, I played badminton regularly except during the exams. My mother and father are my heroes,” she said.Rishita’s father Naresh Kumar said that he never pressurised his daughter to study. “She was focused and used to study till late at night. I support her decision to opt for medicine and will help her realise her dream of becoming a doctor.

11-07-2020||Pune||BJP reduced Pune civic body’s GST share when in power in state, alleges Maha Vikas Aghadi||As the state government has increased the Goods and Service Tax (GST) share of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to Rs 153 crore per month in this financial year, political leaders from Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have started the ‘blame-game’ over the difference in the share amount.PMC’s per month GST share was Rs142 crore in the financial year 2019-20.The state government has given Rs11 crore growth per month, which means PMC will get Rs132 crore additional amount per annum, according to officials.The leaders from the Maha Vikas Aghadi allege that despite the BJP being in power in the PMC the state government has increased the share for the civic body. On the contrary when BJP was ruling in the Centre, state and municipal corporation, instead of giving a hike in GST share the government had reduced it.Chetan Tupe , city unit president and MLA , Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP), said, “Despite additional financial burden due to Covid-19 pandemic the sate government has given the due amount to the civic body even when BJP is in power in the PMC. The present state government does not want to involve politics with the development works in Pune.”“On the contrary when BJP was in power in the state the GST share for PMC was less, as they should be four to eight per cent hike every year,” said Tupe.“Now as the BJP is in power in the Centre it is biased while distributing funds to Maharashtra and Delhi,” said Tupe.Hemant Rasne, BJP leader and standing committee chairman, said, “It is true that the state government has released the GST dues for April, May, June and July. It has given a hike as compared to previous year, but when we were in power in the municipal corporation and state we were following up with the issue.”When asked why the previous government did not give a hike in the GST share, Rasne said that it is mandatory to give a hike of four to eight per cent every year, but refused to elaborate the issue.While abolishing the Local Body Tax (LBT), the state government had decided to give share from GST to every municipal corporation. As per that amendment, all the municipal corporations get GST share from the state government every month.GST share from state government to PMCYear/ Rs in crore per month2018-19/ 1452019-20 /1422020-21/153||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-reduced-pmc-s-gst-share-when-in-power-in-state-alleges-mva/story-Rj18UGUW0NlBsDc2uL16qI.html
11-07-2020||Pune||12 IAS officers swing into action to handle Pune Covid crisis||With the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Pune, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar appointed 12 Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers in Pune to handle the Covid situation in the city. There were three IAS officers working in Pune including municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad and two additional municipal commissioners Rubal Agrawal and Shantanu Goyal. The state government has appointed nine additional senior IAS officers who would work in the municipal area for handling the Covid-19 situation.Last week, Pune district guardian minister Pawar chaired a meeting with senior IAS officers and raised concern over the increasing number of Covid-19 positive cases. Pawar said in the meeting that the cases in Mumbai started decreasing but why was it not happening in Pune. He also warned officers to act speedily or face action. In the same meeting, Pawar instructed to appoint dedicated officers for testing and other works.After Pawar’s instructions, divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar appointed five IAS officers in the city on Monday.Mhaisekar appointed the director-general of Maharashtra council of agriculture education and research Vishwajeet Mane and gave him the responsibility of Covid testing in the city. Mane will be responsible for monitoring both government and private laboratories.Sports director Omprakash Bakoria was deputed for contact tracing. He will follow up on contact tracing of positive cases and try to find an early detection.The tribal research and training institute commissioner Pavneet Kaur will concentrate on bed availability and co-ordination. If complaints start flowing in on unavailability of beds, Kaur will be responsible to follow up and coordinate on any shortages or arrangements.Agricultural commissioner Suhas Diwase will coordinate with non- governmental organisations and invite public participation for handling the Covid-19 crisis.PMPML chairman and managing director Nayana Gunde was appointed as the in-charge for ambulance availability and coordination.Along with these five IAS officers, last month chief secretary of Maharashtra appointed four IAS officers in the city who are already working with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).

11-07-2020||Pune||Universities in Pune hit a roadblock on campus placements||Amidst clashes over final year exams between the central government’s Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry and the Maharashtra State government, universities and colleges in Pune are finding it difficult to deal with corporate companies where students have already been placed through campus interviews.Corporate companies are now demanding a proper result for students, asking for early joining of those placed and some, even cancelling campus appointments.According to Prashant Dave, registrar of MIT World Peace University (WPU), corporates are not accepting the joining of students.“Corporate companies are not accepting our students, they are asking for provisional certificates and several other things to join. There are certain concerns which corporates have about new joiners, and so not conducting the exams will impact on the placements of students. There were few corporate companies who officially wrote to us asking whether we are taking the exams or giving average marks to students. We were requesting them to wait for a while as there is no clarity yet about taking final year exams. Our placed students are on the bench, they have not yet got any induction or training started,” Dave said.Savitribai Phule Pune University’s vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said, “The placements of students or promises to take final year students were done by corporate companies prior to Covid period. But now the situation has changed and many industries are minimising their employment. So even the offers made earlier to students may be rolled back. But we hope that this will be a short term thing and we are expecting that a hike in employment in the fourth quarter of this academic year 2020-21. We are hoping that there will be a complete rise in the industrial sector. So in that point of view, we are keeping our students ready, through our employment cell we are keeping our students engaged in webinars and other activities.”Talking about this issue M M Salunkhe, vice-chancellor, Bharati Vidyapeeth said, “This is a big challenge for us to get our students placed, we already have good campus placements in management and engineering from our colleges. But the companies are demanding for joining the students before July ends. Our problem is that without results declared we cannot send our students for joining, so we are going to write official letters to these companies requesting them to give us more time to relieve our final year students once we conduct the exams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/universities-hit-a-roadblock-on-placements/story-lRrGgM51zcBWalbFIneRLP.html
11-07-2020||Pune||155 Ayurvedic doctors to handle Covid care centres||The Pune Municipal Corporation has appointed 177 doctors on a temporary basis for handling the Covid-19 situation in the city. Among them, most are Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) doctors who specialise in Ayurveda.PMC municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “As the PMC is creating more Covid care facilities, it is requiring additional medical and paramedical manpower. Recently, the PMC published an advertisement for recruiting doctors on a temporary basis. PMC has given an appointment order for 177 doctors.”150 doctors among the 177 hired temporarily are BAMS graduates and they will be serving at the Covid care centres across the city, according to Gaikwad.In its efforts to conduct 1 lakh antigen tests for quick Covid results, the PMC also appointed a pathologist on contract basis who will conduct the test at various places.The PMC was also facing a shortage of manpower for swab testing, which will also be done by the pathologist.The PMC has begun a two-day training program for its newly recruited pathologist at the Naidu hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/155-ayurvedic-doctors-to-handle-covid-care-centres/story-BRsCYURwxMLAkPbLtuW8iN.html
11-07-2020||Pune||Pvt hospitals: Bed shortage after asymptomatic patients occupy space||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has a bed availability of 18,856, and the number of active cases at the present is 8,809 – however, there have still been incidents of private hospitals denying patients treatment due to the shortage of beds. The reason for this, according to civic officials and private hospitals is the unwillingness of Covid-19 positive patients to go to a Covid care centre and asymptomatic patients insisting on reserving hospitals beds which are reserved for those with moderate or severe symptoms.The civic body has now directed to discharge asymptomatic patients in five days if they do not show any Covid symptoms and also deny admission to any asymptomatic patients and redirect them for home isolation.Dr H K Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital said, “We have started encouraging asymptomatic patients to isolate themselves at home for those who can afford to be isolated. If they cannot, then redirect them to the nearest Covid care centre. We have preserved more than the promised beds for Covid-19 at regulated prices but still, there is a shortage of beds. People do not trust civic-run facilities for various reasons which is why we have to insist on home isolation. However, it is also observed in some cases that a person who is asymptomatic in the previous five days may report symptoms later like what happened in the case of Boris Johnson. So home isolation needs to be monitored properly and only then it will be successful.” Johnson, the British Prime Minister was infected with Covid-19 and recovered after being in a critical condition for a long period. Despite being in self-isolation for a week with mild symptoms, his condition began deteriorating. Sahyadri Hospital general manager Dr Sunil Rao said, “In the meeting, we were told that the civic body will take strict action if any hospital is found to admit asymptomatic patients who unless must be admitted only in a Covid care centre. If any asymptomatic patient is found to be admitted in any hospital during inspections then the hospital will face severe action.”As of July 9, there are over 8,809 active patients in the city who are still undergoing treatment for the infection and there are 2,017 patients who are in home isolation.Dr Abhijit More, Jan Arogya Morcha member said, “There is no point in admitting a patient for five days and then discharging them. Even an asymptomatic patient is a potential carrier. He may infect the vulnerable family members. People are reluctant to go to civic-run facilities and the civic body needs to work on them because it is difficult to keep track if those in home isolation are following the norms. However, it is also true that asymptomatic patients must not occupy hospital beds and must be directed towards the care centres.” More further questioned the housing societies across the city, “Will the housing societies who do not even allow housemaids to enter the society let a positive patient live there?”The civic body has further stated that from here onwards it would push for home isolation as a policy decision. PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “As a policy we are encouraging home isolation for positive patients. Even though we have enough beds at our Covid care centres, over 900 beds in Balewadi, 300 beds in NICMAR and over 600 beds at COEP are vacant right now, the shortage of beds is for those who require oxygen or those who are critical patients because the isolation beds are occupied with asymptomatic patients. People are reluctant to go to our Covid centre because they fear they may be adversely affected by another patient and so home isolation is the solution.” The PMC which has a low contact tracing of about only 9 .91 persons per positive patient is now further pushing for home isolation for asymptomatic patients given that they have all the required facilities for isolation.Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Pune said, “The turnover time for ICU and ventilator beds is more than isolation beds. It may take 10-14 days or even more if the patient is critical and thereby resulting in a shortage of critical care units. Earlier, it was noticed that asymptomatic patients are occupying beds in hospitals but not now. We have started an indicating system for vigilance and all asymptomatic patients must be admitted to either the care centre or prefer home isolation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pvt-hospitals-bed-shortage-after-asymptomatic-patients-occupy-space/story-Rxw0N5ZOfeuDmcEXK2xlpI.html

Many false cases had been registered against him and he was later acquitted by the court, he added.Since Bishnoi is apprehending arrest in two cases, he pleaded before the court to direct the investigating officer to handcuff him and provide “special security” so that he is not killed in police custody. The gangster has also filed for anticipatory bail in two firing cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fearing-fake-encounter-gangster-lawrence-bishnoi-demands-to-be-handcuffed-when-brought-to-chandigarh-court/story-4qbHjZ90A3u37nMwwB0ONI.html
11-07-2020||Pune||Is Lockdown 3.0 necessary and will it help Pune’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic?||That was the question that dominated the press briefing, post the high-level meeting at Council Hall on Friday, chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, where the decision was taken.On the direction of Pawar, the meeting, also attended by divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar; district collector Naval Kishore Ram; Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad; Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar; and Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham, decided that Pune will be under a strict 10-day lockdown from July 13 to July 23, instituted in two phases; phase one, will be Lockdown 1.0 redux, with nothing but medical essentials and milk sale allowed; and then, five days later, phase 2, with essentials like groceries and fruits and veggies being allowed.What preparations have been made during Lockdown 3.0 to enhance medical facilities? What about the livelihood of those on or below the poverty line?The media queries came thick and fast, also pointing out that the rest of the world was primarily in an unlock phase.Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said, “It is true that administration does not have all the answers immediately, but in the present situation, to break the chain of infection and the speed of the virus spreading, a lockdown is the better option.”District collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “People are not following guidelines and roaming without taking enough care. We are not claiming that after lockdown cases will come down, but it gives us a chance to break the chain of infection. Authorities will get time to manage the availability of hospital beds.”Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said, “Anyone can check the number of positive cases number before lockdown and after. Considering this, the step has been taken.”The district collector said, “We are in the planning process now and will issue detail guidelines on Saturday.”Naval Kishore Ram said, “The decision about Hinjewadi IT Park and Chakan MIDC has not been taken yet. After consulting with the industrial departments, guidelines would be issued for same.”On trains and air services operating the divisional commissioner and the collector both said that the number of trains arriving is few and the administration would ensure commuters are in home quarantine.Municipal commissioner Gaikwad said that detail guidelines would be issued on July 8 as regards the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/is-lockdown-3-0-necessary-and-will-it-help-pune-s-fight-against-the-covid-19-pandemic/story-Vf8dw3XzsCYMXCPkE44BcO.html
11-07-2020||Pune||Traders’ association against 10-day lockdown||The decision to implement a lockdown for 10 days by the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporation (PCMC) has not gone down well with the federation of traders association of Pune.The traders’ body has opposed the lockdown imposed by the local administration, and written a letter expressing dissent to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar, Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram, and PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad.The association has appealed, against a complete lockdown in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. According to the federation, businesses were closed from March 16, and after the relaxations swung in, traders have been facing problems due to the P1 and P2 rules. Most of the businesses have been only able to work an entirety of 15 days; however, they have paid a full month’s rent and drawn 30-days salary for their employees.“The traders are already frustrated. For the first eight to 10 days no customers came to the shops, now there has been some movement in the last week and PMC again wants a lockdown which is completely illogical,” said Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary of the federation of traders association of Pune.Pitaliya wants the onus on the police to take appropriate action on people who are flouting social distancing norms and not wearing masks.The traders association has also demanded to scrap the P1 P2 rules.“Keeping businesses closed is not a solution for controlling the spread of Covid-19. PMC should be strict against people who are sipping tea standing in front of shops which are banned,” said Pitaliya.The federation has assured PMC that traders who flout norms, the association will take action against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/traders-association-against-10-day-lockdown/story-PW7QR9Rz8S7Q4xwVyMnTUO.html

The chief minister and deputy chief minister Mansh Sisodia found the report prepared by the health department inadequate. They asked the principal secretary (health) to work on the analysis further with more data and update the report,” said an official in the chief minister’s office.The official said the government has identified a private company to outsource the task of tele-counselling of Covid-19 patients under home isolation. “The tender process is over and the firm has been identified. The name of the firm will be provided as soon as the final formalities are over,” the official added.The report was to give a detailed analysis of age, gender, health conditions and presence of comorbidities in those who died of Covid-19, to help the government to further devise ways to bring down mortality.Around 60 deaths were being recorded every day across the city last week. So far, 3,300 people have died of the infection in the city. This puts the case fatality rate at 3%, slightly higher than the national average of 2.72%.Delhi on Friday recorded 2,089 new cases, taking the total count to 109,140.Last month, the Centre had alleged that people were dying of Covid-19 in Delhi in two days as home isolation guidelines were not being followed properly. To reduce the mortality, the Delhi government started providing pulse-oximeters to ensure people could check their oxygen saturation and reach hospitals as soon as it dipped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-reviews-covid-death-analysis-wants-more-data/story-LY9WSGuuhde7VQL9cpLK3M.html

After she was informed about the encounter, Devi, along with her younger son Deep Prakash’s wife Anjali, locked herself in at their Lucknow residence.“A police team was sent to inform Vikas Dubey’s family about his death in police encounter. She refused to go to Kanpur stating that she has nothing do with him and his deeds,” said Deepak Kumar Singh, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Krishna Nagar.“She later locked herself in with her daughter-in-law Anjali and her two children at Indra Lok colony under Krishna Nagar police station limits” the ACP said. A day earlier, Devi said that she will have no regrets if her son was gunned down for being responsible for an act which claimed the lives of eight policemen in the raid last week. On Thursday, soon after Dubey was arrested from Mahakaal temple in Ujjain in a dramatic turn of events, Devi had said that Lord Mahakaal saved her son’s life but also said that government can do whatever they want to do with him.Devi said Dubey was involved in criminal activities from a young age and did not change his path despite repeated requests by his family members.Vikas did not have amicable ties with his family members, including his younger brother. The relationship Dubey shared with his younger brother was strained and the differences were so grave that the family did not live under one roof. “Vikas’s relations were strained with his younger brother due to which he stayed in separate house,” Devi said. The mother had moved in to live with Deep Prakash’s family while Vikas, along with his wife Richa Dubey and two kids, stayed in the separate house in the same locality in Lucknow.Dubey’s younger brother is still untraceable by the UP police force. “Fearing arrest following the Kanpur ambush, he went into hiding,” Singh said. Some police personnel had been deployed outside the house for security reasons, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/have-nothing-to-do-with-him-his-deeds-gangster-vikas-dubey-s-mother-refuses-to-attend-last-rites/story-6yHjCjNKLk8pxzvrvbRwEM.html

The rural development and panchayats department has signed an agreement with the school education department undertaking asset creation and upgrade of existing infrastructure in schools.The pact will allow the school education department access to funds to the tune of Rs 150 crore, under the flagship rural job guarantee programme, for improvement of facilities in schools, according to sources. There are 9,000 primary and upper primary government schools in rural areas of the state. The department has also been designated as an independent implementing agency for carrying out construction work in schools under the programme.The school education department also gets funds under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan after approval from the Union ministry of human resource development, but delays in the release of its share by the cash-strapped state government have been a constant problem.Seema Jain, financial commissioner, rural development and panchayats, and Krishan Kumar, secretary, school education, have, in a joint letter to all the deputy commissioners-cum-district programme coordinator on Thursday, MGNREGS, asked them to personally monitor the sectoral programme of convergence of the scheme with the school education department by holding regular fortnightly review meetings for its effective implementation. “This drive will create transformational changes in school infrastructure,” they wrote, defining roles and responsibilities of officials of the two departments.The scheme funds will also be used for the construction of anganwadi centres, plantation works, deployment of van mittars, and a few other activities in rural schools.Krishan Kumar said the department is trying to tap maximum funds under the programme. “We have already sought proposals from rural schools for improvement of facilities as per the permissible norms,” he said.The school education department has been asked to carry out the work by using manual labour and not machines as far as practicable. “No contractors are to be involved at any stage and only registered job cards holders to be employed on the MGNREGS component of the convergence project,” said a rural development department official, citing the programme guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-to-tap-into-mnregs-funds-for-infra-upgrade-in-rural-schools/story-5vpEsbi6PP8prJ3uWuhcUP.html

Over the last two days cases are increasing in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and the rural areas. Cases are emerging in industries. We know that the lockdown is not the only solution, but it is one of the main tools to break the chain of infection.”Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad added, “A detail lockdown order will be issued on Saturday, July 11, with detail guidelines.”Shravan Hardikar, municipal commissioner, Pimpri- Chinchwad said, “We received demands from elected members and citizens to re-introduce the lockdown. We will close industries in Pimpri-Chichwad and only those industries which were allowed to function in the first lockdown will remain open.”Police commissioner Venkatesham said, “The police will issue online e-passed for essential services.

11-07-2020||City||Royal dispute: 12 detained for attempt to take possession of Faridkot Raj Mahal||At least 12 persons were detained for allegedly trying to take possession the Raj Mahal, a disputed property, of the erstwhile Faridkot royal family on Friday.This comes days after 23 members of the Maharwal Khewaji Trust were booked for forging the will of Harinder Singh Brar, last ruler of the erstwhile princely state, in favour of the trust. The complaint regarding this had been made by Brar’s daughter Amrit Kaur.The trust’s chief executive officer Jagir Singh Sran said that Friday’s incident took place at the behest of Amrit Kaur. “They had taken the main entrance in their possession, but the police acted swiftly and removed them from the property. We have submitted a complaint against them for trespass at the Faridkot city police station,” said Sran. The 12 persons were detained and later released on bail.Superintendent of police Bhupinder Singh Sidhu said, “We have told them if they want possession of the property, it has to be as per law. They should get an official order from the deputy commissioner otherwise it is an illegal activity.”The high court had upheld a Chandigarh court’s order last month, awarding a majority share in the ₹20,000-crore property of Brar to his two daughters —Amrit Kaur and Deepinder Kaur. As of the will in the dispute, the court observed that trustees conspired to create the will to take over the property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/royal-dispute-12-detained-for-attempt-to-take-possession-of-faridkot-raj-mahal/story-r6mYj2OcsD2WIsCo2LSWVP.html

Our Bihar parliamentary board meeting verified the booth list for 94 seats and it would be completed for the remaining 149 seats also soon,” he tweeted.The meeting was held Thursday in New Delhi.“However, due to the pandemic, the common man as well as the Central and state governments are financially strained. Under these circumstances, election will put additional burden. All the parliamentary board members also expressed concerns over it,” he tweeted.In another tweet, Chirag said the Election Commission should take any decision only after looking into all the aspects. “It should not happen that a big population is pushed into further danger due to elections. Election in the midst of pandemic could also lead to very low poll percentage, which will not be good for democracy,” he said.With the Covid-19 spreading to new areas in the state, including VVIP areas, the RJD had last week accused the state government of caring little for the people while focusing more on preparations for assembly elections and had called for postponing the elections altogether.“This is not the right time for election. There has been unprecedented increase in Coronovirus infection in the state, but the government seems unconcerned. The entire government seems too busy with elections. The government is hiding figures. If it doesn’t wake up, the situation may become explosive by August-September,” RJD leader Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav had said.Chirag has been quite critical of the way Bihar government handled the pandemic and migrants’ issue in recent months and the JD-U has been upset with it.Reacting to the LJP leader’s tweets, JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said his party believes the Election Commission has taken a decision after consultations with all political parties to hold the elections on time. “The Janata Dal (United) has made its preparations keeping in mind the possibility of the elections being held on time,” he said. The JD(U) leader said timely elections would be in interests of “good governance and will help Bihar get its due respect on the national stage”.State BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said the EC was already working on modalities to ensure not only free and fare but also safe elections in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. “If the EC is satisfied with situation, elections will surely be taking place on time,” he said in a statement.“Any political party is free to express an opinion but conducting the election is the sole prerogative of the EC. We will go by the decision of EC related to Bihar elections due in October- November 2020,” he said.Former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM-S said it favoured holding elections as scheduled. “The party is in favour of holding elections in Bihar on time. Our workers are ready and the EC can hold elections whenever it wants,” said its spokesman Danish Rizwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chirag-joins-tejaswhi-s-call-for-putting-off-bihar-polls/story-URA5RBU4T4cn9IEyotqciM.html

The visitors include agents and residents not following Covid-19 social distancing norms.The staff fear of contracting the virus. Dinesh Tawre, zonal officer, A ward, has not taken leave for the last three months.“Police promise to visit the office but do not turn up. Their presence will help visitors follow social distancing and wear masks while coming to the office,” said Tawre, who has been posted at the ration card office, Nigdi for the past two years and 11 months.“I have appealed to people to follow prevention norms. As the office is functioning in a PCMC building, I have also complained to the municipal commissioner. I have written 3-4 letters to the police to file complaint against one agent who submitted a bogus form,” he said.Since the announcement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of free ration till November, people in large numbers are visiting the office asking for ration.“People rush to the office after the PM’s message. They should understand that it is just an announcement, we are yet to receive any written orders. From the Centre, general resolution (GR) will come to the state then it goes to the collector before reaching us. The process will take at least 15 days,” said Tawre, who has requested for police presence from Nigdi police station at the office to manage crowd.“Our staff will have to undergo quarantine if any of the visitor is carrying the virus. As people are not listening to us, we are demanding police bandobast,” said Tawre.Ganesh Jawadwad, inspector from Nigdi police station, visited the ration card office on Friday to assess the situation.“There has been no formal complaint against any agents till now by the ration card office, Nigdi.

11-07-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana cabinet okays drafting of ordinance to provide 75% quota in private jobs||The Haryana cabinet on Monday approved drafting of an ordinance to provide 75% reservation in private sector jobs for eligible candidates of state domicile, leading to concerns among private firms that said the move could gravely hamper post-Covid economic recovery. The draft of the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Ordinance, 2020, will be put before the next meeting of the council of ministers, an official statement said. According to the statement, the ordinance will provide “75% of the new employment to local candidates for jobs having salary of less than Rs 50,000 per month in various privately managed companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, partnership firms, etc., situated in the state of Haryana”.However, employers will have the option to recruit local candidates from one district to the extent of only 10%. The proposed law will also contain an exemption clause if suitable local candidates are not available for a particular category of industry.This was the second time in the last five months that the cabinet discussed the issue of reservation in private jobs, which was one of the key poll promises of the Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), the coalition partner of the BJP. Manas Fuloria, founder of a city-based IT-firm and spokesperson for NASSCOM, Haryana, said, “At present, there is not much clarity on the specific terms of the ordinance. We are ourselves trying to ascertain whether it applies only to unskilled labour, or skilled jobs as well. If the ordinance is passed as a blanket reservation, many private companies may choose to relocate their employees to other cities, at least on paper. It will be possible for a lot of companies to work remotely in the current scenario. But I think industries like manufacturing and real estate will be hit hard by these constraints.”Last year, the Andhra Pradesh assembly had passed a bill to provide 75% reservation to locals in private jobs, becoming the first state to take such a step. The bill has been challenged on the grounds of constitutional validity in the Andhra Pradesh high court.Officials said the proposal was approved after being vetted by the Haryana law secretary, who had earlier raised questions over the constitutional validity of such a legislation. They said the cabinet had sent the proposal to the law secretary on January 31. The senior law officer had then raised objections on the grounds of violation of Article 14 [equality before law] and Article 19 (1)(g) [protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business] of the Constitution.Senior government officials said once the cabinet approves the draft of the ordinance, the assembly will have to pass it and send it to the governor. Once the governor clears it, the law will have to be sent for Presidential assent since labour-related matters are in the concurrent list of the Constitution, they said. Speaking after the cabinet meeting, deputy CM Dushyant Chautala said, “Today is a historical day as now this would be mandatory for the industries or companies in private sector to give 75% jobs to Haryana youths.” He said the BJP-JJP government is committed to provide employment to the people of Haryana.Under the Haryana State Employment to Local Candidates Act 2020, all private industries, units, firms and employment providers which would have more than 10 employees in its premises would be covered in this Act. These rules would apply to recruitment after the date of notification of this ordinance, Chautala said.The deputy CM said a domicile certificate would be mandatory for the candidate to avail of benefits under this scheme, which would be implemented by the labour department.He said all those companies covered under this Act would have to register the entire data of employees on the portal.Private companies would have to inform the labour department if they are unable to find the employees according to their requirement, after which they would be permitted to give jobs to the people belonging to other states. Private employers in Gurugram expressed their dismay at the Haryana government’s plan. The move can fundamentally change the economic landscape of the city, which employs people from across Haryana, Delhi-NCR, India and even the world, stakeholders said.A senior employee of a prominent real estate firm in Gurugram, seeking anonymity, said, “We have been relying on skilled workmen from states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh for years. To train locals from scratch is an investment that we cannot make as we are in a period of economic downturn. This ordinance will make Haryana a less attractive location for private firms to do business. Once the draft ordinance is made public, we can put up our objections to it.”Employers in the manufacturing sector also appeared worried at the prospect of such an ordinance being promulgated into a law. Pankaj Yadav, president of the Gurugram Udyog Association, said, “At this point in time, jobs are already scarce. Industries should be allowed to hire at their discretion for the next few years at least. This is not the time to be putting such constraints on us in an already reeling economy. We have no issues with hiring locals, but finding people with the right skills and qualifications will become much harder, and possibly more expensive as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-cabinet-okays-drafting-of-ordinance-to-provide-75-quota-in-private-jobs/story-wlyVglZPv1xPZv3InMLFfO.html

11-07-2020||World||British pilot to fly home after 4-month coronavirus battle in Vietnam||A British pilot who spent more than two months on life support in Vietnam after contracting Covid-19 was on his way home Saturday, astounding doctors who gave him just ten percent chance of survival.Stephen Cameron, 42, was the sickest patient medics have had to treat during the coronavirus outbreak in the Communist nation, which has recorded no official deaths following a fast and aggressive response to the pandemic.Little more than six weeks ago, they warned that Cameron would need a double transplant for his lungs, which were only functioning at around 10 percent.But after nearly four months in hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, including 10 weeks on a ventilator, the Vietnam Airlines pilot from Motherwell, Scotland was discharged Saturday and was due to fly back to the UK within hours.“I’m overwhelmed by the generosity of the Vietnamese people, the dedication and professionalism of the doctors and nurses... the odds say that I shouldn’t be here so I can only thank everybody here for what they’ve done,” Cameron said as he left Cho Ray Hospital.“I go home with a happy heart because I’m going home but a sad one because I’m leaving so many people here that I’ve made friends with.”Tran Thanh Linh, deputy head of ICU at Cho Ray Hospital, said “huge effort and energy” had gone into saving Cameron, who was given the country’s best equipment and whose case had captured the attention of everyone from doctors to government officials. Just a few weeks after arriving in Vietnam in early February for a new role with the national carrier, Cameron spent an evening at the popular “Buddha Bar” in Ho Chi Minh City. He tested positive days later, on March 18, for Covid-19.Known as Patient 91, Cameron became the focus of huge media attention as the country’s top medical minds met to brainstorm treatment options.The news that he would need a lung transplant was met with 59 donation offers, according to the health ministry.But after waking from a coma at the end of May, there were small signs of improvement -- a thumbs-up sign for an attentive doctor, a trip on to the balcony to catch some sunshine and a video of him holding a Motherwell Football Club scarf aloft. Every step towards recovery made headlines.Finally on Saturday -- as state media said his treatment bill had reached at least $150,000 -- he was well enough to catch a special repatriation flight to London, accompanied by three doctors, state media added. His return home comes as Vietnam celebrated 85 days with no community transmission of the coronavirus.The country has just 370 virus confirmed cases and zero deaths, but its borders remain largely shut. More than 10,000 people are currently in mandatory quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pilot-to-fly-home-after-4-month-coronavirus-battle-in-vietnam/story-fSLnPvIHSXo6iYineaO55J.html
11-07-2020||World||Veteran BBC broadcaster Kailash Budhwar passes away||Kailash Budhwar, who had a distinguished career in BBC in London since 1969, became the first Indian to head any BBC section in 1979 and mentored a generation of journalists over the decades, has died aged 88, his former colleagues said. Hailing from Kanpur, Budhwar was the head of the BBC’s Hindi service and a prominent figure among listeners in India and the UK. A theatre buff, Budhwar was described by colleagues as an inspiring presence in the newsroom.Vijay Rana, senior journalist who worked with Budhwar from 1982-1992, said: “Sitting with him was an education in itself. He became very popular among listeners in India due his factual reporting during the Emergency. He was a doyen of Hindi journalism”.Speaking to Hindustan Times in 2016 on changes in Fleet Street over the years, he said an Indian journalist in a leading role in London was such a novelty in the 1970s that when he was appointed the first Indian head of any BBC section in Bush House in 1979, it became national news.Also read | Stop press: India never far from romance of Fleet Street“There was no space for us Indians on Fleet Street. The BBC in fact held a press conference to announce my appointment as the head of Hindi service, it was reported widely. Until then, Indians were only contributors, not at the top editorial level,” he had said.Budhwar, who retired from BBC in 1992, was a prominent figure in Indian community circles, striving to uphold Indian perspectives in BBC news discourse in relation to anti-India elements based in the UK, and attending independence day and other events of the Indian high commission.Budhwar leaves behind wife Binodini, three daughters and one son.Budhwar often oversaw elections of the Indian Journalists Association (established May 1947), besides actively participating in its engagements.IJA president Rupanjana Dutta said: “He was one of our most prominent and senior members. We remember him as an ever-smiling and pleasant person, often regarded as a beacon of knowledge. It is a great loss for IJA today”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/veteran-bbc-broadcaster-kailash-budhwar-passed-away/story-B3FFU6RLTuu5Ke7XwwcNNK.html
11-07-2020||World||Donald Trump working on merit-based immigration order, and DACA||The White House on Friday said President Donald Trump was working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system and offer a path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, without offering them amnesty.The president has been pushing for a merit-based immigration system which offers US citizenship on the basis of the applicants qualifications and skills, in order to benefit the country, and less through familial connections, which currently account for roughly half of the 1 million Green Cards given annually. First lady Melania Trump’s parents were among millions who have benefited from family-based immigration, which the president has derisively called “chain migration”.No details were forthcoming, or the timeline.The White House statement came after President Trump told Telemundo, a Spanish-language TV channel, he was working on an executive order that would include provisions for DACA — the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the 2012 Obama-era protection from their deportation.“I’m going to do a big executive order. ... And I’m going to make DACA a part of it,” Trump said. “We’re going to have a road to citizenship.”There are an estimated 644,000 undocumented immigrants in this category, also called DREAMERs, including at least 2,500 from India.A White House spokesperson said, “As the President announced today, he is working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system to further protect US workers.”On DACA, the spokesperson said the president was willing to work with congress to find “a negotiated legislative solution to DACA, one that could include citizenship, along with strong border security and permanent merit-based reforms”.“This does not include amnesty,” the spokesperson added.The Trump administration has been trying to rescind the Obama-era protections and its most recent attempt — an order from the Department of Homeland Security — went up to the Supreme Court, where it was rejected by justices who called it “arbitrary and capricious”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-working-on-merit-based-immigration-order-and-daca/story-NZpEiQVkUXhFyi2ClAqYGM.html
11-07-2020||World||Indian heritage in UK: 4 centuries of priceless art with royal family on display||Priceless paintings and manuscripts from India gathered as gifts and other acquisitions during centuries of British engagement will be on display at a unique exhibition in Edinburgh from July 23 to January 21, the Royal Collection Trust said on Friday.Held in the Royal Library in Windsor Castle, the Royal Collection contains one of the finest south Asian paintings and manuscripts in the world, including the Mughal era ‘Padshahnama’, Tipu Sultan’s Quran and the story of Prahlada from the Bhagavata Purana, 1775–90, by the Nainsukh family workshop.Most of the items will be on display for the first time in Scotland in the Queen’s Gallery in the Palace of Holyroodhouse in the exhibition titled ‘Eastern Encounters: Four Centuries of Paintings and Manuscripts from the Indian Subcontinent’.“Tracing more than 400 years of literary and artistic output, the exhibition offers new insights into the shared history of the British monarchy and the Indian sub-continent”, the trust said.The items include those from the beginning of the British engagement with India, with the formation of the East India Company in 1600. The 17th century was a period of instability for the British monarchy, but in south Asia the Mughal empire was at its zenith, richer and stronger than any European power, the trust noted.It said: “The extraordinary splendour of the Mughal court was captured by artists in intricate paintings and manuscripts. George III was given a number of these magnificent works, forming one of the greatest collections of South Asian works on paper outside the subcontinent”.“In 1798, Lord Teignmouth, Governor-General of India, presented the King with six volumes as gifts from the Nawab of Awadh. Among these was the mid-17th-century Padshahnama (‘Book of Emperors’), an illustrated chronicle commissioned by the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah-Jahan as a celebration of his reign and dynasty, described by Teignmouth as ‘the most splendid’ Mughal manuscript he ever saw”.The rise of the East India Company was reflected in the gifts of manuscripts presented to successive British monarchs on behalf of the company and by company officers.Detailed architectural drawings were commissioned from local draughtsmen by Colin MacKenzie, the Scottish Surveyor-General of the Company. A pen and ink drawing from 1800 shows an elevation of the temple at Srirangam, one of the most important Hindu pilgrimage sites in India.The collection includes a posthumous portrait of Maharajah Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Punjab, 1842, was sent to Queen Victoria by his successor, Sher Singh, in an unusual jewel-encrusted gold frame with a letter of belated congratulations on her marriage and the birth of her first son.It will be displayed in the exhibition alongside a sketch of his son, Maharaja Duleep Singh, by Queen Victoria. She received many books written about or dedicated to her from India, including a volume of her own published journals, The Queen’s Travels in Scotland and Ireland, translated into Hindi by the Maharajah of Benares. During Queen Mary’s visit to India in the early 20th century, she acquired numerous works of art, including Queen Tissarakshita, 1911, by Abanindranath Tagore, founder of the Bengal School of Art, and several Pahari paintings, which will also be on display.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-heritage-in-uk-4-centuries-of-priceless-art-with-royal-family-on-display/story-BfZH5A9d3e7BWDoYyjBTHO.html
11-07-2020||World||WHO urges aggressive virus measures as flare-ups spark new closures||The World Health Organization has urged countries grappling with coronavirus to step up control measures, saying it is still possible to rein it in, as some nations clamp fresh restrictions on citizens.With case numbers worldwide more than doubling in the past six weeks, Uzbekistan on Friday returned to lockdown and Hong Kong said schools would close from Monday after the city recorded “exponential growth” in locally transmitted infections.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on countries to adopt an aggressive approach, highlighting Italy, Spain, South Korea and India’s biggest slum to show it was possible to stop the spread, no matter how bad the outbreak.The health agency’s comments came as US President Donald Trump was forced to cancel an election rally in New Hampshire, citing an approaching storm.Trump has pushed to hold large gatherings against health advice as epidemiologists warn of the dangers posed by the virus moving through the air in crowded and confined spaces.- Lashing out at China -On a visit to Florida on Friday, Trump hit out at Beijing over the pandemic.“(The) relationship with China has been severely damaged. They could have stopped the plague.... They didn’t stop it,” he told reporters.The virus has killed at least 556,140 people worldwide since it emerged in China last December.More than 12.3 million cases have been registered in 196 countries and territories, triggering massive economic damage.The United States, the country worst hit by the illness, reported almost 64,000 new cases Friday and the death toll now stands at just under 134,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.Brazil, the second-hardest hit, surpassed 70,000 deaths and reported 45,000 new infections, the health ministry said.In Uzbekistan, citizens were from Friday facing lockdown restrictions again that were originally imposed in March but lifted gradually over the past two months.The Central Asian country’s return to confinement followed a decision by Australia to lock down its second-biggest city Melbourne from Thursday.A police officer manning a checkpoint on the outskirts of the former Soviet republic’s capital said only drivers with “a good reason” to enter Tashkent -- such as delivering food or other vital supplies -- could pass.Restaurants, gyms, swimming pools and non-food markets have all shut their doors until at least August 1.Private transport within cities will be limited to morning and early evening journeys and essential purposes such as travelling to work and purchasing food or medicine.In Hong Kong, the spike marks a setback for the city after daily life had largely returned to normal with restaurants and bars resuming regular business and cultural attractions reopening.Despite being right next to mainland China where the virus first emerged, the city had managed to quash local transmission in recent months.But new clusters have started to emerge since Tuesday, including at an elderly care home that reported at least 32 cases and a housing estate with 11.- ‘Turn this pandemic around’ -“Across all walks of life, we are all being tested to the limit,” the WHO’s Tedros told a virtual news conference in Geneva.“From countries where there is exponential growth, to places that are loosening restrictions and now starting to see cases rise.“Only aggressive action combined with national unity and global solidarity can turn this pandemic around,” he said.Elsewhere, French officials warned of rising cases in metropolitan France as the death toll topped 30,000.In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted a decision to allow businesses, including bars and event spaces, to reopen may have been made “too soon”.The Middle Eastern country recorded its highest number of infections over a 24-hour period, at nearly 1,500.In Australia, meanwhile, authorities said they would slash by half the number of people allowed to return from overseas.From Monday, only 4,000 Australian citizens or permanent residents will be permitted to enter each day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-urges-aggressive-virus-measures-as-flare-ups-spark-new-closures/story-7yInexwOIxl7BaagpHAndL.html
11-07-2020||World||In India-China crisis, an India-US bonanza in view||A border clash has plunged ties between India and China to their lowest point in decades. But one beneficiary looks clear -- the US-India relationship.Experts say India could finally end equivocation about openly aligning itself with the long-eager United States, although there will still be disagreements -- which, paradoxically, are now mostly due to Washington.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that China “took incredibly aggressive action” in a hand-to-hand battle in the remote Himalayas on June 15 that killed 20 Indian soldiers.The hawkish Pompeo characterized the violence as part of a broader strategy by Beijing to challenge all of its neighbors.Jeff M. Smith, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has written a book on the India-China rivalry, said the United States is known to offer border intelligence to India, which is now likely to pick up the pace on defense acquisitions.But Smith said that India has asked the United States to be publicly circumspect -- in part to show the domestic audience that New Delhi does not need help.India also does not want “to feed Chinese propaganda narratives that this is all a component of the China-US rivalry and that India is working at America’s behest,” Smith said.Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, cautioned that neither India nor China wanted a complete rupture and said that both still saw some common interests, especially in international organizations.“But make no mistake: This current India-China crisis is a watershed for the geopolitics of Asia, and the US-India relationship will be one of the main beneficiaries,” he said.“Previous Indian concern about antagonizing China if it moves closer to the US is starting to melt away.”- ‘Transactional’ ties -The United States has been seeking warmer ties since the 1990s with India, which insisted during the Cold War on being “non-aligned” on the global stage.President Donald Trump has appeared to form a bond with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow nationalist who warns of the threat of radical Islam, and the pair have held two joint mega-rallies.But Trump, his eyes at home ahead of elections, has also taken action detrimental to India, including last year kicking it out of a preferential trade status under which it had exported billions of dollars in goods.Trump, citing the coronavirus pandemic, more recently has suspended high-tech visas and threatened to expel international students, moves with significant impacts on Indians.India is happy to see Trump’s tougher stances on China as well as historic adversary Pakistan but also feels demands, especially on trade, said Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute’s Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia.“It is a semi-transactional relationship. It is not a strategic relationship, as it was in earlier years,” she said.Trump, who has frequently sparred with Western allies, may not even want a more committed relationship with India, she said.“I wouldn’t say there is as much reluctance on the Indian side. That has calmed down,” Pande said.“The two are closer than they have ever been. But are the two ready to take that extra step?”- Warmth regardless of election -In another recent shift, US lawmakers, mostly Democrats, have openly criticized India on human rights, including Modi’s revocation of autonomy and controls on the internet in Muslim-majority Kashmir.Anthony Blinken, a close aide to presidential candidate Joe Biden, said that the Democrat, if he defeats Trump, would seek to “strengthen and deepen” the relationship with India. But Blinken shared concerns on freedoms.“You’re always better engaging with a partner, and a vitally important one like India, when you can speak frankly and directly about areas where you have differences,” Blinken said at the Hudson Institute.Trump has stayed mum on rights and has offered, with little detail, to mediate between India and China.But John Bolton, Trump’s former national security advisor who recently published an explosive memoir, doubted Trump understood the border situation.“He may have been briefed on it, but history doesn’t really stick with him,” Bolton told Indian news channel WION.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-india-china-crisis-an-india-us-bonanza-in-view/story-XkAm8LwamHujaH4RaZVdkL.html
11-07-2020||World||Coronavirus, jobs and economy: Fact-checking Donald Trump’s tweets and claims||If saying things 100 times could make them true, President Donald Trump’s account of how the U.S. is doing with the coronavirus would be true.Covid-19 testing would be the envy of the world, the economy would be on the cusp of roaring back, the threat would be receding in a pandemic that has sickened more than 3.1 million Americans and killed more than 133,000.But repetition doesn’t make for reality. The U.S. is taking a disproportionate hit from the coronavirus globally and does not have it under control.A look at how rhetoric from the past week compares with the facts on various fronts:VIRUSTRUMP: “For the 1/100th time, the reason we show so many Cases, compared to other countries that haven’t done nearly as well as we have, is that our TESTING is much bigger and better. We have tested 40,000,000 people. If we did 20,000,000 instead, Cases would be half, etc. NOT REPORTED!” — tweet Thursday.THE FACTS: His notion that infections are high only because the U.S. diagnostic testing has increased is false. His own top public health officials have shot down this line of thinking. Infections are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down.It’s true that increased testing also contributes to the higher numbers. When you look harder, you’re going to see more. But the testing has uncovered a worrisome trend: The percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country.That’s a clear demonstration that sickness is spreading and that the U.S. testing system is falling short.“A high rate of positive tests indicates a government is only testing the sickest patients who seek out medical attention and is not casting a wide enough net,” says the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, a primary source of updated information on the pandemic.Americans are being confronted with long lines at testing sites, often disqualified if they are not showing symptoms and, if tested, forced to wait many days for results.___TRUMP on the coronavirus: “We have the lowest Mortality Rate in the World.” – tweet Tuesday.THE FACTS: This statement is wholly unsupported.An accurate death rate is impossible to know. Every country tests and counts people differently, and some are unreliable in reporting cases. Without knowing the true number of people who become infected, it cannot be determined what portion of them die.Using a count kept by Johns Hopkins University, you can compare the number of recorded deaths with the number of reported cases. That count shows the U.S. experiencing more deaths as a percentage of cases than most other countries now being hit hard with the pandemic. The statistics look better for the U.S. when the list is expanded to include European countries that were slammed early on by the virus but now appear to have it under control. Even then, the U.S. is not shown to be among the best in avoiding death.Such calculations, though, do not provide a reliable measurement of actual death rates, because of the variations in testing and reporting, and the Johns Hopkins tally is not meant to be such a measure.The only way to tell how many cases have gone uncounted, and therefore what percentage of infected people have died from the disease, is to do another kind of test comprehensively, of people’s blood, to find how many people bear immune system antibodies to the virus. Globally, that is only being done in select places.___TRUMP: “Deaths in the U.S. are way down.” — tweet Monday, one of at least a half dozen heralding a drop in daily deaths from the virus.THE FACTS: It’s true that deaths dipped even as infections spiked in many parts of the country. But deaths lag sickness and the spikes have not played out.“It’s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday. He advised Americans: “Don’t get yourself into false complacency.”___ECONOMYTRUMP: “Job growth is biggest in history.” — tweet Wednesday.THE FACTS: Yes, but only because it is following the greatest job losses in history, by far.The U.S. economy shed more than 22 million jobs in March and April, wiping out nearly a decade of job growth in just two months, as the viral outbreak intensified and nearly all states shut down nonessential businesses. Since then, 7.5 million, or about one-third, of those jobs have been recovered as businesses reopened. Even after those gains, the unemployment rate is 11.1%, down from April and May but otherwise higher than at any point since the Depression.___TRUMP: “Economy and Jobs are growing MUCH faster than anyone (except me!) expected.” — tweet Wednesday.THE FACTS: Not really. It’s true that May’s gain of 2.7 million jobs was unexpected. Economists had forecast another month of job losses. But most economists projected hiring would sharply rebound by June or at the latest July, once businesses began to reopen. The gains kicked in a month earlier than forecast.Now, though, coronavirus cases are rising in most states, imperiling the climb back. In six states representing one-third of the economy — Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, and Texas — governors are reversing their reopening plans, and the restart is on pause in 15 other states. Such reversals are keeping layoffs elevated and threatening to weaken hiring.___TRUMP ON BIDENTRUMP campaign ad, playing out a scenario where a person needing help calls the police in a Biden presidency and gets a voice recording: “You have reached the 911 police emergency line. Due to defunding of the police department, we’re sorry but no one is here to take your call.” The ad closes with the message: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”THE FACTS: Biden has not joined the call of protesters who demanded “defund the police” after Floyd’s killing. He’s proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.“I don’t support defunding the police,“ Biden said last month in a CBS interview. But he said he would support tying federal aid to police based on whether “they meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community.”Biden’s criminal justice agenda, released long before he became the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, proposes more federal money for “training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths” and hiring more officers to ensure that departments are racially and ethnically reflective of the populations they serve.Specifically, he calls for a $300 million infusion into existing federal community policing grant programs.That adds up to more money for police, not defunding law enforcement.Biden also wants the federal government to spend more on education, social services and struggling areas of cities and rural America, to address root causes of crime.Democrats, meanwhile, have pointed to Trump’s repeated proposals in the administration’s budget to cut community policing and mediation programs at the Justice Department. Congressional Republicans say the program can be effectively merged with other divisions, but Democrats have repeatedly blocked the effort. The program has been used to help provide federal oversight of local police departments.Despite proposed cuts, Attorney General William Barr last month said that the department would use the COPS program funding to hire over 2,700 police officers at nearly 600 departments across the country.___REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE email: “In the wake of rioting, looting, and tragic murders ripping apart communities across the country, Joe Biden said ‘Yes, absolutely’ he wants to defund the police.” — email Wednesday from Steve Guest, RNC’s rapid response director.THE FACTS: That’s misleading, a selective use of Biden’s words on the subject.The email links to an excerpted video clip of Biden’s conversation with liberal activist Ady Barkan, who endorsed Biden on Wednesday after supporting Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries. A full recording of that conversation, provided by the Biden campaign to The Associated Press, shows he again declined to support defunding police,Barkan raises the issue of police reform and asks whether Biden would funnel money into social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing to help reduce civilian interactions with police.Biden responds that he is calling for increased funding for mental health providers but “that’s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police” and that both approaches are needed, including more money for community police.Asked again by Barkan, “so we agree that we can redirect some of the funding,” Biden then answers “absolutely yes.”Biden then gives the caveat that he means “not just redirect” federal money potentially but “condition” it on police improvements.“If they don’t eliminate choke holds, they don’t get (federal) grants, if they don’t do the following, they don’t get any help,” Biden replied.“The vast majority of all police departments are funded by the locality, funded by the municipality, funded by the state,” he added. “It’s only the federal government comes in on top of that, and so it says you want help, you have to do the following reforms,.”___BIDEN ON TRUMPBIDEN: “President Trump claimed to the American people that he was a wartime leader, but instead of taking responsibility, Trump has waved a white flag, revealing that he ordered the slowing of testing and having his administration tell Americans that they simply need to ‘live with it.’’ – statement Wednesday marking the rise in U.S. coronavirus infections to more than 3 million.THE FACTS: To be clear, the government did not slow testing on the orders of the president.Trump at first denied he was joking when he told a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally on June 20 that he said “to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please’“ because “they test and they test.” Days later he said he didn’t really mean it.In any event, a succession of his public-health officials testified to Congress that the president never asked them to slow testing and that they were doing all they could to increase it. But testing remains markedly insufficient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-jobs-and-economy-fact-checking-donald-trump-s-tweets-and-claims/story-32tCrNKRnB5JsvpxMje0NL.html
11-07-2020||World||Dozens of US Marines in Japan’s Okinawa get coronavirus||Dozens of U.S. Marines have been infected with the coronavirus at two bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa in what is feared to be a massive outbreak, Okinawan officials said Saturday, demanding an adequate explanation from the U.S. military.Okinawa prefectural officials said they could say only that a “few dozen” cases had been found recently because the U.S. military asked that the exact figure not be released. The outbreaks occurred at Marine Corps. Air Station Futenma, which is at the center of a relocation dispute, and Camp Hansen, Okinawan officials said.Local media, citing unnamed sources, said about 60 people had been infected.“Okinawans are shocked by what we were told (by the U.S. military),” Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki told a news conference. He questioned disease prevention measures taken by the U.S. military and renewed his demand for transparency regarding the latest development.Okinawan officials asked the U.S. military on Friday to provide the number of cases and other details in order to address growing concerns among local residents, Tamaki said.The Marines said in a statement Friday that the troops were taking additional protective measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus and were restricting off-base activities. The statement said measures are “to protect our forces, our families, and the local community,” without providing details on the infections.Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact, and the residents are sensitive to U.S. base-related problems. Many Okinawans have long complained about pollution, noise and crime related to U.S. bases.Okinawans also oppose a planned relocation of the Futenma air base from the current site in a densely populated area in the south to a less populated area on the east coast.Local media reported that the Okinawan assembly adopted a resolution Friday protesting the U.S. military’s lack of transparency about its outbreak on base, and that local officials were considering demanding shutdowns of Futenma and Camp Hansen.Okinawa has about 150 cases of the coronavirus. In all, Japan has about 21,000 cases and 1,000 deaths, with Tokyo reporting more than 200 new cases for a third straight day Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-us-marines-in-japan-s-okinawa-get-coronavirus/story-rc99e72UNCpJ9jpoGoxprN.html
11-07-2020||World||Coronavirus cases up sharply in Africa, India as inequality stings||South Africa’s confirmed coronavirus cases have doubled in two weeks to a quarter-million, and India on Saturday saw its biggest daily spike as its total passed 800,000. Inequality concerns are growing as health workers seek better protection while some among the rich are hoarding equipment at home.Globally more than 12 million people have been infected by the virus, according to data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine. More than a half-million have died. Shortages of testing materials and poor data collection in some countries mean the true numbers are unknown.Some of the worst-affected nations are among the world’s most unequal. South Africa leads them all, with the pandemic exposing the gap in care.In Johannesburg at South Africa’s epicenter, badly-needed oxygen concentrators, which help people with Covid-19 breathe, are hard to find as private businesses and individuals are buying them up, a public health specialist volunteering at a field hospital, Lynne Wilkinson, told The Associated Press.Meanwhile South Africa’s struggling public hospitals are short on medical oxygen — and they are now seeing a higher proportion of deaths than in private ones, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases says.South Africa now has more than 250,000 confirmed cases, including more than 3,800 deaths. To complicate matters, the country’s struggling power utility has announced new electricity cuts in the dead of winter as a cold front brings freezing weather. Many of the urban poor live in shacks of scrap metal and wood.And in Kenya, some have been outraged by a local newspaper report citing sources as saying several governors have installed intensive care unit equipment in their homes. The country lost its first doctor to Covid-19 this week.“The welfare, occupational safety & health of frontline workers is a non-negotiable minimum!!” the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union tweeted after her death. On Saturday, the union and other medical groups called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to implement a promised compensation package to ease the “anxiety and fear that has now gripped health care workers.”More than 8,000 health workers across Africa have been infected, half of them in South Africa. The continent of 1.3 billion has the world’s lowest levels of health staffing and more than 550,000 cases, and the pandemic is reaching “full speed,” the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.Many parts of the world are now struggling with trying to reopen their economies and facing a fresh wave of infections.In India, which reported a new daily high of 27,114 cases Saturday, nearly a dozen states have imposed a partial lockdown in high-risk areas. A surge in infections saw cases jumping from 600,000 to more than 800,000 in nine days. The total is now 820,916.Infected people are packing India’s public hospitals as many are unable to afford private ones that generally uphold higher standards of care.In Australia, the beleaguered state of Victoria received some good news with health officials reporting 216 new cases in the past 24 hours, down from the record 288 the previous day. It hopes a new six-week lockdown in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city with a population of 5 million, will curb the spread.And in Latin America, where inequality is sharp and Brazil and Peru are among the world’s five most badly hit countries, the Covid-19 pandemic is sweeping through the continent’s leadership, with two more presidents and powerful officials testing positive in the past week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cases-up-sharply-in-africa-india-as-inequality-stings/story-dXO7n6DObsq9Hz8kDboOAO.html
11-07-2020||World||Virologist who fled to US from Hong Kong accuses China of coronavirus cover-up||At a time when Covid-19 has infected over 12 million people across the globe, a scientist from Hong Kong has revealed that China knew about the deadly virus well before it claimed it did, in an extraordinary claim about cover-ups at the highest levels of government.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn an exclusive interview to Fox News on Friday, Li-Meng Yan, who has specialised in virology and immunology at the Hong Kong School of Public Health, said that China likely had an obligation to tell the world, given their status as a World Health Organisation (WHO) reference laboratory specialising in influenza viruses and pandemics, especially as the virus began spreading in the early days of 2020.She added that her supervisors, renowned as some of the top experts in the field, also ignored research she was doing at the onset of the pandemic that she believes could have saved lives.Yan, who says she was one of the first scientists in the world to study Covid-19, was allegedly asked by her supervisor at the University/WHO reference lab, Dr Leo Poon, last year to look into the odd cluster of SARS-like cases coming out of mainland China at the end of December 2019.“The Chinese government refused to let overseas experts, including ones in Hong Kong to do research in China,” she said.Yan said very soon she and her colleagues across China discussed the peculiar virus but that she soon noted a sharp shift in tone. Doctors and researchers who had been openly discussing the virus suddenly clammed up. Those from the city of Wuhan--which later would become the hub of the outbreak -- went silent and others were warned not to ask them details.The doctors said, ominously, “We cannot talk about it, but we need to wear masks,’“ Yan said. The numbers of human-to-human transmission cases then began to grow exponentially, according to her sources.Yan made the decision to leave. She packed her bags, sneaked past the censors and video cameras on campus, and boarded a Cathay Pacific flight to the United States, on April 28.She had her passport and her purse and was about to leave all of her loved ones behind. If she was caught, she knew she could be thrown in jail -- or, worse, rendered one of the “disappeared”.Yan, now in hiding, claims that the government in the country where she was born is trying to shred her reputation and accuses “government goons” of choreographing a cyber-attack against her in hopes of keeping her quiet.She divulged to the media that the Hong Kong government swarmed her hometown of Qingdao and that agents ripped apart her tiny apartment and questioned her parents. When she contacted her parents, they pleaded with her to come home, and told her that she did not know what she was talking about, and begged her to give up the fight.Yan believes her life is still in danger. She fears she can never go back to her home and lives with the hard truth that she will likely never see her friends or family there again. Still, she says, the risk is worth it.“The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of Covid,” she told Fox News from an undisclosed location.She added that if she tried to tell her story in China, she “will be disappeared and killed”.Meanwhile, the University of Hong Kong has also taken down her page and apparently revoked access to her online portals and e-mails, even after she says that she was on an approved annual leave.In a statement to Fox News, a school spokesperson said that Yan is not currently an employee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virologist-who-fled-to-us-from-hong-kong-accuses-china-of-coronavirus-cover-up/story-GOG3ndRfM9PGHjqsNwp3lK.html

Nnearly 90% of Covid-19 patients who were discharged from a hospital in Rome were still not back to normal an average of two months after becoming ill, researchers said.The doctors studied 143 adults who had been hospitalized on average for two weeks in the hospital, news agency Reuters reported.It was found that after an average of 60 days after reporting their first coronavirus symptoms, 87.4 percent of patients still reported at least one symptom - particularly fatigue and shortness of breath. Most of these patients suffered from pneumonia and one in five patients needed help to breathe.Also read: ‘Unknown pneumonia’ in Kazakhstan could be Covid-19, says WHOMore than half of the patients reported three or more symptoms while about one in four still had joint pain and about one in five experienced chest pain.

Many cities and counties around the state have recently reinstated restrictions that had been lifted in May, when cases seemed to drop.All of Disney’s Orlando parks closed in mid-March in an effort to stop the virus’s spread. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando closed around the same time but reopened several weeks ago after instituting similar rules to protect employees and customers from the virus.Disney’s new rules include mandatory masks and social distancing. Visitors will need reservations to enter a park, and they won’t be allowed to hop between parks. Both visitors and employees will receive temperature checks when they enter. Fireworks shows and parades have been suspended to prevent drawing too many people together.Disney has been opening its parks back up around the globe for the past two months. In May, the company opened Disney Springs, a complex of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues in Lake Buena Vista.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masks-social-distancing-are-mandatory-disney-world-to-reopen-as-coronavirus-cases-surge-in-florida/story-hdQtoKT08hL3UDgr5MJneJ.html
11-07-2020||World||Cold weather, premature reopening may escalate Brazil’s Covid-19 spread||Two days after Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro tested positive for Covid-19, he said the looming economic crisis is worse than the virus and urged mayors and governors to reopen their states, again. With a premature reopening of the country and the oncoming winter, experts are concerned that the coronavirus will spread in the country unabated.The president has been fighting virus-related restrictions since the beginning of the pandemic, which he has called a “small flu”. The country is now a hotspot in Latin America and with more than 1.7 million registered cases since the pandemic began, Brazil is also the second-worst affected country in the world.“There is a false dichotomy between the economy and health,” Dr Leticia Kawano Dourado, a respiratory physician at Hospital do Coracao, Sao Paulo, tells HT. “Many cities have now reopened without fulfilling the WHO criteria for it.”ALSO READ | Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro tests positive for Covid-19WHO Americas director Carissa Etienne had warned in June, as Brazilian cities, including the capital, Brasilia, reopened that coronavirus cases Latin America had yet to peak, recommending that Brazil and other countries in the region continue strengthening social distancing and reopening of the economy be done slowly and carefully.The capital is now seeing an explosion of cases. It now has more infections per capita than any other major city in Brazil, with 2,133 confirmed cases per 100,000 people. That is more than two times higher than metropolitan Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, according to health ministry statistics.“They’re reopening everything without a clear plan, saying that getting sick is inevitable,” according to Brasilia resident Ana Lustosa da Costa. With her two of her two nephews testing positive, she is worried about her elderly parents who are in the at-risk group.“Despite the epidemic spreading through the country, the economy has been reopened. Social distancing measures are declining and people are moving around carrying the virus. No state has seen an infection rate lower than 1,” says Dr Paulo A Lotufo, professor of medicine at the University of Sao Paulo.According to a team of researchers at the university, Brazil has sixteen times more cases than the official numbers indicate. Meanwhile, Researchers at the Federal University of Minas Gerais have suggested it has eight times more cases, Washington Post reported. Nonetheless there is a general consensus that the official figures do not reflect the real cost of the epidemic in the country. “Testing is lacking big time, especially among the less privileged,” says Dr. Dourado.Add to this, the onset of winter in South America has PAHO worried that serious cases of Covid-19 will rise further. Winter “fuels respiratory infections—like seasonal influenza and pneumonia—that can rapidly spread in colder climates,” Etienne has said.“Winter is a cause for concern because people spend more time in closed spaces. Plus, the cold weather also brings other viruses,” Dr. Elnara Marcia Negri, a pulmonologist at Hospital Sírio-Libanês in São Paulo, tells HT. A potential spike in seasonal flu could overwhelm hospitals already straining under the coronavirus pandemic.Health ministry officials said on Wednesday that there are confirmed virus cases in 96.4% of Brazil’s municipalities and the country is still far from reducing the pandemic’s spread. “Brazil is paying the price for the government’s inadequate response to the crisis,” Dr Negri adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cold-weather-premature-reopening-may-escalate-brazil-s-covid-19-spread/story-u6ECiGtxmSClolyQFmMvdM.html

He added that many pneumonia cases were likely to be Covid-19 and “just have not been diagnosed correctly.” Ryan says WHO was working with local authorities to review X-rays and look at the pattern of pneumonia cases to see if they were consistent with Covid-19.“While we believe that many of these cases will be diagnosed as Covid-19, we keep an open mind,” says Ryan, noting a WHO team was already in Kazakhstan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unknown-pneumonia-in-kazakhstan-could-be-covid-19-says-who/story-7G4aarcmVbVjy5jWRy7Z4O.html

The shark attack left him with severe injuries to his legs.Several surfers came to the aid of the boy and helped him to shore for medical attention. Despite CPR efforts to revive him, he died at the scene.Jim Simmons, mayor of Clarence Valley shire, said visitors had flocked to the region for the school holidays and there would likely have been many people in the water.“What’s happened there this afternoon would shake everybody,” Simmons said. “It’s terribly shocking. All of our sympathies, from people in the area, go out to the boy’s family.”Last Saturday, a 20-year-old scuba diver who was spear fishing died after being attacked by a shark off the coast of Australia’s Queensland state. The man was attacked near Indian Head on the eastern side of Fraser Island.The attack happened not far from where 23-year-old Queensland wildlife ranger Zachary Robba was fatally mauled by a great white shark in April.A 57-year-old diver was killed off Western Australia state in January, and a 60-year-old surfer was killed off Kingscliff in New South Wales state in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teenage-surfer-killed-by-shark-2nd-in-australia-in-a-week/story-RrDDDnt0CkXvuOf6V2QM5N.html

They are hoping to get at least 170,000 to take part in the vote on Saturday and Sunday and select candidates from each district to run in September’s Legislative Council election.Police searched the offices of the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute on Friday evening and seized its computers, said Au Nok-hin, an organizer of the primary. They had a warrant and didn’t make any arrests, Au said. The institute is a widely cited pollster helping the pro-democracy movement with the primary, which a top government official has said may violate Beijing’s new national security law for the city.Voting for the primaries was delayed until noon as a result of the raid, the organizers said. Police were seen visiting some of the 250 polling stations.A police spokeswoman said officers from the cyber security crime bureau conducted Friday’s search after receiving complaints from members of the public about leaked information, including that of police officers’.The opposition hopes to ride a decisive victory in last November’s district council elections to secure a majority in the legislature that would give it the power to block Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s agenda -- and even theoretically force her to resign by rejecting her budget proposals. However, the new security law has compounded risks that the Beijing-backed government will disqualify pro-democracy candidates to keep them from winning enough seats.“The primary election is our first time to let Beijing know Hong Kongers never bow down to China,” pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was cited by RTHK as saying ahead of the opening of the polls. “We urge the world to put Hong Kong under the global spotlight.”Secretary for Mainland and Constitutional Affairs Erick Tsang on Thursday suggested that participation in the primary could run afoul of the law. If convicted by the courts, violators would be barred from seeking or holding public office for an unspecified period. Another top Hong Kong official last month advocated for the invalidation of candidates who expressed opposition toward the legislation, which is raising questions about the city’s autonomy from China.Tsang said that planning and participating in primaries could violate the law’s articles of secession, subversion and collusion, as well as its Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance. Though democrats refuted the government’s remarks and continued canvassing support for the primary, they also worry that authorities’ suggestions of illegality -- and a warning that district council offices shouldn’t be used as primary polling stations -- would dampen voter turnout over the weekend.Hong Kong Democrats Fear Disqualifications Ahead of Election“Surely that’s our worry, whether the new national security law will deter people from coming out to participate in a legally organized and lawful activity,” legal scholar and organizer Benny Tai said at a briefing earlier this week. He argued that the primary was not an act of “secession” or “collusion” because it didn’t have an agenda to split the country and wasn’t sourcing funds externally.Opposition BracesHong Kong, which is seeing a spike in locally transmitted coronavirus cases, has also reimposed social-distancing restrictions that go into effect Saturday and could dissuade some residents from coming out to vote.Pan-democrat organizers held media briefings in the past week to bolster public support and appeal for funds to cover expenses, but as of Friday had achieved only half their monthlong crowd-funding goal of HK$3.5 million ($450,000). Candidates -- including Wong -- have set up street booths in their respective districts in a last-ditch effort to secure votes ahead of the primary.If the total voting turnout is lower than the goal of 170,000, the camp would have to regroup and discuss who to put on the ballot, Tai said.Democrats had braced themselves for further disqualifications even before the law was handed down on the last day of June, as Lam’s government and its supporters criticized activists by name for a range of actions and political views that could put potential candidates in jeopardy.The government has blocked nine candidates from running over their support for Hong Kong independence and self-determination since 2016, when it first took the then-unprecedented step of banning politicians from running for Legco due to their political views.“Authorities want to use the rule of fear to suppress any different views and exactly how we can counteract the rule of fear is by doing the things we believe to be right,” Tai said. “The more people coming out to vote, it will give more legitimacy to the whole process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-pro-democratic-opposition-starts-voting-in-primaries/story-jsdo8KGsMI8rnnwOO4mLCN.html

I think everybody’s taken the ‘stay at home if you can’ (advice). I think now we should say ‘go back to work if you can.’“Britain’s economy shrank by 25% over March and April as the coronavirus pandemic escalated and the government ordered entire sectors to shut down.On Wednesday, finance minister Rishi Sunak said the government would pay bonuses to employers who bring temporarily laid-off staff back to work among other measures aimed at slowing an expected surge in unemployment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-to-tell-firms-to-order-staff-back-to-workplaces-report/story-RHDya30YokpczCwLG0BmzM.html
11-07-2020||World||Foreign students weigh studying in person vs losing visas||International students worried about a new immigration policy that could potentially cost them their visas say they feel stuck between being unnecessarily exposed during the coronavirus pandemic and being able to finish their studies in America.Students from countries as diverse as India, China and Brazil told The Associated Press they are scrambling to devise plans after federal immigration authorities notified colleges this week that international students must leave the US or transfer to another college if their schools operate entirely online this fall.Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a lawsuit this week to block the decision, and now California and Washington state are seeking injunctions against enforcing the new visa policy.“Shame on the Trump Administration for risking not only the education opportunities for students who earned the chance to go to college, but now their health and well-being as well,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Thursday.Some said they may return home, or move to nearby Canada.“I’m generating research, I’m doing work in a great economy,” said Batuhan Mekiker, a Ph.D. student from Turkey studying computer science at Montana State University in Bozeman. He’s in the third year of a five-year program.”If I go to Turkey, I would not have that,” he said. “I would like to be somewhere where my talent is appreciated.” Mathias, a Seattle-based student who spoke on condition his last name not be used for fear of losing his immigration status, said he is set to sell his car, break his lease, and get his cat Louis permission to fly back to his home in Paris in the next two weeks.“Everyone’s very worried,” he said. “We have our whole lives here.” Seven students from China and Germany who attend universities in California sued Friday to block enforcement, alleging potential threats to their health and “financial calamity.” The policy “treats them as pawns for the president’s politically motivated decision,” Mark Rosenbaum of nonprofit Public Counsel, which filed the suit, said in a statement.Many American universities have come to depend on the revenue from more than 1 million international students, who typically pay higher tuition. President Donald Trump has insisted they return to in-person instruction as soon as possible, alleging that schools are being kept closed to harm the economy and make him look bad.The guidance was released the same day Harvard announced it would keep all undergraduate classes online this fall. Harvard said the new Trump directive would prevent many of its 5,000 international students from remaining in the US.The University of Southern California sent a letter to students and faculty, saying it is “deeply troubled” and that the “the policy could negatively impact countless international students.” Like other universities, USC said it was pushing back and working to ensure students’ academic careers aren’t harmed, while exploring ways for students to safely study in person if they wish.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the directive could inflict “significant harm” on colleges, students, the business community and the economy.A U.S. State Department press release said the policy “provides greater flexibility for non-immigrant students to continue their education in the United States, while also allowing for proper social distancing on open and operating campuses.” A day after Harvard sued, the university notified the court that immigration authorities appear to be already enforcing the policy. A lawyer for Harvard urged the judge to suspend the rule, saying that a first-year student from Belarus was turned away from his flight at a Minsk airport. There is another hearing Friday.“This is very dangerous and cruel,” said Jessie Peng, a Chinese graduate student in analytics at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology.“We have nowhere to go,” said Peng, 27. “Either risk our lives and go to school or we risk our lives flying back to China.” Jasdeep Mandia, a doctoral candidate from India studying economics at Arizona State University, said he has breathing problems that could worsen if he gets sick from Covid-19.Mandia, 35, originally planned to conduct all his fall studies online. He says the Trump directive puts the shaky standing of international students on display.“It has never been a level playing field,” he said. “But this makes it more apparent.” At Indiana University, American scholar Dakota Murray wrote in the school newspaper about his uncertainty over how the guidance would affect him and his wife, a fellow doctoral candidate who is from South Korea.Murray, 27, said he and his wife had discussed going to live in South Korea or maybe Canada, where she has relatives. He spoke on condition that his wife’s name not be used because she is trying to obtain a green card that will let her work and reside in the U.S. after she finishes her studies.Vanderbilt University student Safa Shahzad went home to Manchester, England, for a visit in March but got stuck there when the U.S. imposed travel restrictions to slow the spread of the virus.Still in England, the 19-year-old, who is double majoring in politics and computer science, completed her freshman year from afar after the university transitioned online.Although Vanderbilt has said courses will be a hybrid of online and in person this fall, Shahzad cannot travel to the U.S. until the Trump administration lifts the travel restrictions.“I’m just kind of waiting,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-students-weigh-studying-in-person-vs-losing-visas/story-UrLg7iflZPEYr68FIBepfN.html

11-07-2020||World||Many ‘flavours’ of Covid-19: Study finds multiple immune responses to coronavirus||A latest study has found that the Covid-19 has many “flavours”. The molecular study has arrived at findings that may allow targetting specific molecular changes in coronavirus patients for treatment in the future. The researchers found at least five different types of immune response against coronavirus - not just “mild” and “severe,” news agency Reuters reported. A team of experts set out to explore what makes the virus affect some people more severely than the others. For the purpose, patients’ “blood transcriptome” was studied which is the complete set of genes that are activated in immune cells in the blood. Also read: Covid-19 vaccine unlikely before 2021, TB vaccine shows promise in reducing deaths“In other words, there are different flavours of the disease,” just as there are different types of cancer, study co-author Dr Joachim Schultze of the University of Bonn told Reuters. An understanding of molecular mechanisms in Covid-19 patients can help design tailor-made therapies, Schultze said, adding that it could also help predict which drugs would likely benefit the patients. The experts cited steroid dexamethasone as “prominent” candidate in the fight against Covid-19 which has already shown promise in some coronavirus patients and pointed to the “surprising” discovery involving granulocytes  - a type of white blood cell. “Granulocytes, cells that are not really known to be major players in the fight against viruses, play a major role in severe Covid-19 disease,” Schultze said. The new findings “will help us to find better therapies and also will guide vaccine development,” he added. Another study suggested the role of a patient’s immune response in Covid-19 death. The study, an excerpt of which was published in science journal, ‘Nature’, suggested that immune responses, rather than the virus itself, are responsible for death in Covid-19 patients.“Numerous studies have suggested that the immune system contributes to the organ damage seen in some severe cases of Covid-19,” the paper read.Covid-19 has infected over 12 million people across the globe while more than 5 lakh people have succumbed to death globally. Over 7 million people have recovered from the deadly contagion worldwide.

We have to increase our capacity so that when necessary with full strength we can enter the market and revive our market share,” said Zanganeh. Hit by reimposed US sanctions since Washington exited Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal in 2018, Iran’s oil exports are estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 barrels per day, down from more than 2.5 million bpd that Iran shipped in April 2018.

The teachers union in the nation’s second-largest school district on Friday recommended keeping school campuses closed when the semester begins on Aug. 18.Simply calling for physical distancing and asking children and teachers to wear masks will not be enough, said Del Hierro. Her eight-year-old son, for example, complains that it is difficult to breathe through a mask, and tends to take his off.She said she is also worried that if something upsetting happens at her son’s school in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, teachers will not be able to properly console children from six feet away.“I wish they would just focus on distance learning and making it better,” said the stay-at-home mom, 33.Jennifer McAfee, who teaches English at Dotson Middle School in Rancho Palos Verdes, said with just six weeks left before the start of school, there is too little time and too few resources to plan a safe re-opening.Even something as simple as a ride on the school bus needs to be reimagined, she said, to make sure children obey distancing and mask guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-just-doesn-t-feel-safe-us-parents-teachers-worry-about-reopening-schools/story-m6WyAzjy4wnf1gOCUy1kBK.html

I don’t think about it now,” Trump told reporters on Friday from Air Force One when asked about the trade deal. Earlier in the year, the Trump adminstration had signed a mega phase one deal with China, after intense negotiations between the two countries. Relations between Washington and Beijing have spiralled downward since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. US President Donald Trump has questioned the Asian powerhouse’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The two countries have also sparred over China imposing a new national security law in Hong Kong, restrictions on American journalists, treatment of Uyghurs Muslims and security measures in Tibet. “Relationship with China has been severely damaged. They could have stopped the plague, they could have stopped it, (but) they didn’t stop it. They stopped it from going into the remaining portions of China from Wuhan province. They could have stopped the plague, they didn’t,” Trump said. The coronavirus, which first emerged in China’s Wuhan city, has claimed over 1,30,000 lives in the US with 3.1 million confirmed cases. The virus toll in China stands at 4,641 with nearly 85,000 confirmed infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-rules-out-phase-2-trade-deal-with-china/story-zaqXFQB2A9tfsSdY2JeeGJ.html

11-07-2020||World||Working on order to establish merit-based immigration system: Trump||US President Donald Trump is working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system, the White House has said. The White House statement came soon after Trump, in an interview with Telemundo News channel, said he is working on an executive order on immigration that will include a “road to citizenship” for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme. Responding to a question, Trump said his action on the DACA is going to be part of a much bigger bill on immigration. “It’s going to be a very big bill, a very good bill, and a merit-based bill and it will include DACA, and I think people are going to be very happy,” the president. “One of the aspects of the bill is going to be DACA. We’re going to have a road to citizenship,” Trump said, drawing sharp criticism from quarters in his camp. Senator Ted Cruz described the move as a mistake. “As the president announced today, he is working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system to further protect US workers,” the White House said in a statement. “Furthermore, the president has long said he is willing to work with the Congress on a negotiated legislative solution to DACA, one that could include citizenship, along with strong border security and permanent merit-based reforms,” the White House said. “This does not include amnesty. Unfortunately, Democrats have continually refused these offers as they are opposed to anything other than totally open borders,” said the White House in a statement. During the interview, Trump alleged the Opposition broke the deal with him on the DACA. “I had a deal with the Democrats and they broke the deal. The DACA could have been taken care of two years ago, but the Democrats broke the deal. All of a sudden they just broke it for no reason. Actually, they had a court case that slightly went their way, and they said, ‘Oh, let’s not talk about the deal anymore,’“ he said. Trump said the recent Supreme Court ruling gave the president tremendous powers when they said that you could take in, in this case, 700,000 or so people. “Based on the powers that they (SC) gave, I’m going to be doing an immigration bill. One of the aspects of the bill that you will be very happy with, and that a lot of people will be, including me and a lot of Republicans, by the way, will be the DACA. It will give them a road to citizenship,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/working-on-executive-order-to-establish-merit-based-immigration-system-says-trump/story-2S01AfGmn7yu0kqwbjLA3I.html

Covid-19 has claimed more than 5 lakh lives globally while 7 million people have recovered from the deadly contagion worldwide. With a rapid surge in coronavirus cases across the globe, scientists and researchers are also ramping up effort to arrive at the potential Covid-19 vaccine. Gilead Sciences Inc., Oxford experts and American biotech company Moderna are at the forefront of vaccine development for Covid-19. In an interview with HT, Oxford University professor Sunetra Gupta had said that by the end of this summer, “we should have proof that the vaccine works”.Here are the latest developments on Covid-19 vaccine • On Friday, Gilead Sciences Inc said an analysis showed its antiviral remdesivir helped reduce the risk of death in severely ill Covid-19 patients. It, however, added that rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm ita benefit. • Germany-based biotechnology company, BioNTech SE, could seek approval for its coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, Wall Street Journal reported. The experimental vaccine, BNT162b1, showed promise against coronavirus in early-stage human testing and is expected to move into a large trial involving 30,000 participants this month, pending regulatory nod. Also read: Psoriasis injection okayed for limited use to treat Covid-19 patients• Moderna Inc is expecting to begin late-stage trials of its vaccine later this month. Its vaccine was among the first to be tested in humans in the US. In a small trial conducted on a group of healthy individuals, the vaccine was found to produce protective antibodies. The company has signed an agreement with Spain’s Laboratorios Farmacéuticos Rovi SA to scale up the manufacturing and production of its potential Covid-19 vaccine for markets outside the US.• A tuberculosis vaccine routinely given to children in countries with high rates of that bacterial disease might be helping to reduce deaths from Covid-19, researchers reported on Thursday. The findings were published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.• A parliamentary panel on Friday informed the government of India that a vaccine for Covid-19 is expected only by early next year. Presentations were given by the Department of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the principal scientific adviser to the government before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Climate on the Centre’s Covid-19 preparedness.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-covid-19-vaccine-unlikely-before-2021-tuberculosis-vaccine-shows-promise-in-reducing-deaths/story-O4rQnBnnFXm3kZF8DqSyhM.html

This is how the president and his allies describe Mueller’s investigation into the Russian interference. As a 67-year-old man with medical conditions, he would be “put at serious medical risk in prison”, the statement added.“He was treated very unfairly, as were many others in this case. Roger Stone is now a free man!”Stone, a long-time Republican operative who shot to fame for his work for President Ronald Reagan’s campaign, had been convicted of seven charges including lying abut his role in alleged Trump campaign’s collusion with the Russian interference, withholding information and threatening an associate to not cooperate with the investigation.Stoner had publicly lobbied for presidential commutation of sentence in recent days as a quid pro quo for not implicating the president. “He knows I was under enormous pressure to turn on him,” he told Howard Fineman, a journalist who tweeted about his conversation with Stone shortly before the White House announcement. “It would have eased my situation considerably. But I didn’t.”Meanwhile, critics of the president wondered if Stone has a piece of information that he leveraged to get a commutation.“No other president has exercised the clemency power for such a patently personal and self-serving purpose,” said a statement issued by Representatives Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House oversight committee, and Carolyn B. Maloney, both New York Democrats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-commutes-long-time-friend-roger-stone-s-jail-term/story-EpywOKSo99VtPZG9tQVbcK.html
11-07-2020||World||Most adults infected with Covid-19 in South Africa are asymptomatic cases: Official||Of all adults infected with Covid-19 in South Africa, 50 to 66 per cent are asymptomatic cases, with many infections going undetected, a health official has claimed. The coronavirus, which first emerged in China’s Wuhan city, has claimed 3,860 lives in South Africa with over 2,50,000 confirmed cases.  “The majority of Covid-19 infections are going unnoticed,” said Dr Shabir Mahdi, who is heading the University of Oxford’s vaccine trials in South Africa.  In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Mahdi said the high number of asymptomatic cases was causing difficulties in vaccine trials. The enrolment process has shown that far more people are asymptomatic than what was previously believed, Mahdi said. He estimated that only about 10 per cent of all Covid-19 cases are being officially reported. Mahdi said around 80 per cent of all children who are infected are asymptomatic. The clinical trials require people who have not been infected by the virus. Part of the enrolment process for the Covid-19 vaccine trial involves the screening of individuals. Qualifying participants are randomly allocated into one of two groups -- vaccine group or placebo group. Madhi said the results on whether the vaccine works as protection against Covid-19 would be available by the end of November this year, but the trials may be extended into the second quarter of next year. He warned against ‘undue’ optimism, reminding that only 10 per cent of vaccines that go into clinical trials are eventually licensed for use. “Right now there are approximately 200 vaccines that are being developed (around the world) for Covid-19,” he said. “It would be a huge accomplishment if, over the next 12 to 18 months, we are successful in showing that even one out of every 20 of the vaccines that go into human studies are safe and provide some protection against Covid-19,” he said. Madhi said for the next year at least the only reliable protection against Covid-19 would be the non-pharmaceutical interventions of handwashing, sanitisation and social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-adults-infected-with-covid-19-in-south-africa-are-asymptomatic-cases-official/story-JLXOykppdgkpRrZZLeGZ4M.html
11-07-2020||World||UN fails for a 2nd time to agree on extending humanitarian aid to Syria||A divided UN Security Council failed for a second time Friday to agree on extending humanitarian aid deliveries to Syria’s mainly rebel-held northwest from Turkey as the current UN mandate was ending, leaving nearly 3 million people at risk of losing aid.Russia and China vetoed a UN resolution backed by the 13 other council members that would have maintained two crossing points from Turkey for six months. A Russian-drafted resolution that would have authorised just one border crossing for a year failed to receive the minimum nine “yes” votes in the 15-member council, with only four countries voting in favour while seven voted against and four abstained.Diplomats said Germany and Belgium, who insist two crossings are critical especially with the first Covid-19 case just reported in Syria’s northwest, circulated a new text. That resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would extend the mandate through the Bab al-Hawa crossing for a year and the mandate for the Bab al-Salam crossing — which Russia wants to eliminate — for three months to wind up its activities.Council members continued discussions Friday night and diplomats said a meeting was possible Saturday to vote on the German-Belgium draft as well as likely Russian amendments.German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen said the Russian vote should be “a last-minute wake-up call” for Security Council members to resolve their differences. He said Germany, which holds the rotating council presidency, was “ready to work around the clock,” and he urged council members to think of the millions of Syrian waiting for them “to decide their fate.” “To leave this weekend without a solution would send a signal of disappointment and despair to the people in the region,” Heusgen said,.The actions Friday capped a week of high-stakes rivalry over cross-border aid.Russia, Syria’s closest ally, has argued that aid should be delivered from within Syria across conflict lines. But the UN and humanitarian groups say aid for 2.8 million needy people in the northwest can’t get in that way.The initial German-Belgium resolution authorising two crossings for one year won support from 13 of the 15 council members on Tuesday but was vetoed by Russia and China.A Russian draft resolution authorising one crossing for six months failed to get the minimum nine “yes” votes on Wednesday. And a similar Russian amendment to the latest German-Belgium resolution was dramatically rejected Thursday, getting only two “yes” votes — from Russia and China.In January, Russia scored a victory for Syria, using its veto threat to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution reducing the number of crossing points for aid deliveries from four to two, from Turkey to the northwest. It also cut in half the yearlong mandate that had been in place since cross-border deliveries began in 2014 to six months.US Ambassador Kelly Craft tweeted Friday: “Russia & China are using politics to prop up the Assad regime while more than 3 million people are in desperate need of aid. We cannot allow the Bab al-Salaam border crossing, where 30 per cent of UNICEF’s aid enters Syria, to close. The lives of 500,000 children are at risk.” The president of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, said reducing aid deliveries to just one crossing point “would cut essential health supplies to one million people, and leave the UN unable to scale up in response both to Covid-19 and deteriorating food security.” “Today is yet another example of the age of impunity, where two countries can veto with full knowledge, but utter disregard, for the impact it will have on civilian lives, all against the backdrop of an unprecedented and devastating global pandemic,” Miliband said.Without waiting for Friday’s announcement of the result of voting on the German-Belgium resolution and signaling its intent to use its veto, Russia announced late Thursday that it had circulated a new resolution that would authorise just one crossing from Turkey for a year.Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, tweeted that Bab Al-Hawa “accounts for more than 85% of total volume of operations.” “We categorically reject claims that Russia wants to stop humanitarian deliveries to the Syrian population in need,” he wrote, urging Western nations to “seize this opportunity” and support the Russian draft which adapts “to the situation on the ground.” “If they block our compromise proposal they will be responsible for the consequences,” the Russian envoy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-fails-for-a-second-time-to-agree-on-extending-humanitarian-aid-to-syria/story-4Sbfqea5e1dHZKsOJ4ygRI.html

That study showed a trend toward better survival for remdesivir but the difference was not statistically significant.In the latest analysis, Gilead said it analyzed data from 312 patients treated in its late-stage study and a separate real-world retrospective cohort of 818 patients with similar characteristics and disease severity. Gilead’s late-stage study evaluated the safety and efficacy of five-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in hospitalized patients. The study did not have a placebo comparison.Dr. Susan Olender from Columbia University Irving Medical Center said in the Gilead statement that the analysis draws from a real-world setting and serves as an important adjunct to clinical trial data even as it is not as vigorous as a randomized controlled trial.However, Dr. Walid Gellad, a professor at University of Pittsburgh’s medical school, called it “a joke” to compare clinical trial data with observational data and conclude anything definitive about mortality. “The mortality in the remdesivir trials has generally been lower for both control and intervention groups than other trials and other real world cohorts I’ve seen,” Gellad said in an email.“The real world patients are taken care of at different hospitals than those in the trial and potentially different adjunct treatments. They’re different.” Findings from the analysis showed that 74.4% of remdesivir-treated patients recovered by Day 14 versus 59.0% of patients receiving standard of care, the company said. The mortality rate for patients treated with remdesivir in the analysis was 7.6% at Day 14, compared with 12.5% among patients not on remdesivir.The US government trial in April showed that patients given remdesivir recovered 31% faster than those given a placebo. Gilead’s shares rose 2% to $76.27 in afternoon trading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilead-analysis-shows-remdesivir-reduced-covid-death-risk-but-more-trials-needed/story-0mk2aKvLmITkrr1xWCZzvJ.html

Hindustan, HT’s sister publication, reported that a child born at RML Hospital to a woman, who recovered from Covid-19 recently, has been found positive for the infection. Dr Rahul Chaudhary, an assistant professor with RML’s department of neonatal diseases, said the mother had recovered after contracting the virus at the time she delivered her baby. But after the child was born and her sample was sent for examination after six hours, the newborn tested positive for Covid-19.Chaudhary claimed that the birth of a coronavirus-infected child from the corona negative mother’s womb is the first case in the country. He said research in China had shown that a child can be infected with Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19, through the umbilical cord, although there was no solid evidence regarding it.“A woman giving birth to her child after being cured of coronavirus disease suggests that the corona infection can also reach the baby from the mother’s umbilical cord. However, it is very unlikely,” Dr Chaudhary was quoted as saying by Hindustan.The 25-year-old woman, a resident of Nangloi, was pregnant and was admitted to RML Hospital last month. She was tested for coronavirus disease on June 11 and was found to be infected. After this, her husband was also tested positive. The woman was again found positive after a repeat Covid-19 test on 25 June and on July 7 when the doctors conducted the RTPCR examination for the third time, the report came back negative. Dr Chaudhary said the woman’s delivery was done the next day after the report came negative and the child was examined only after six hours. Doctor Kirti, an assistant professor of the hospital’s department of microbiology, said coronavirus is present in the baby with high viral load. The baby is in the hospital.Scientists, in an editorial in the American Journal of Perinatology in June, have said that the spread of Sars-Cov-2 from a mother to foetus had not been well-established. The researchers at the University of California Davis Health, however, said it could happen in multiple ways including viral transmission from the mother to the foetus or intrauterine transmission.The transmission from mother to baby during or directly after delivery and superficial exposure to Sars-Cov-2 are also possible, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baby-born-to-delhi-woman-cured-of-covid-19-tests-positive-doctors-claim-first-such-case-in-india/story-Pwg66OnIzSqaxskSImWsPN.html

The authorities had previously attributed most new cases to people returning from overseas.“It will get worse before it gets better,” Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews told a televised news conference.“We will see more and more additional cases. This is going to be with us for months and months.”“Nobody is enjoying being locked at home. It is frustrating, it is challenging, but the strategy will be successful if we all play our part.”There were 100 separate outbreaks in Victoria, the state’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, told the news conference.Australia has avoided the high Covid-19 casualty numbers of other countries after closing its borders and going into nationwide lockdown in March. The country has recorded about 9,200 infections and 107 deaths, including the death of a man in his 90s in Victoria overnight, Andrews said.The country’s other states have been relaxing restrictions on movement but tightened their border closures to Victoria. Victoria, home to a quarter of the country’s 25 million people, has also become the first state to ask people to wear masks.Neighbouring New South Wales, the most-populous state, reported just seven new cases as of late Friday, including a man who had visited a Sydney pub that has been linked to two other infections. The authorities set up a pop-up testing clinic at the pub, which has been closed for cleaning, and urged recent patrons to take be tested.Though there is no proven vaccine or cure for the coronavirus, Australia gave provisional approval to Gilead Sciences Inc’s remdesivir as the first treatment option for virus, joining the United States and the European Commission which have given it conditional clearance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-victoria-state-records-another-day-of-high-covid-19-infections/story-BfBzfT8jirDPvxxPYkGzjL.html
11-07-2020||World||Tropical Storm Fay weakens after landfall in New Jersey||Fast-moving Tropical Storm Fay made landfall in New Jersey on Friday amid heavy, lashing rains that closed beaches and flooded shore town streets.The storm system was weakening as it moved over New Jersey and was expected to continue doing so overnight, the US National Hurricane Center said in its 8 p.m. advisory. The storm is expected to bring 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain, with the possibility of minor coastal flooding from New Jersey to Rhode Island as well as flash flooding. That’s down from earlier forecasts of about 3 to 5 inches (8 to 13 centimeters) of rain.The storm made landfall along the coast of New Jersey about 10 miles (15 kilometers) north-northeast of Atlantic City, according to national forecasters and was around 45 miles (72 kilometers) north-northeast of that city and 50 miles (80 kilometers) south-southwest of New York City as of the latest advisory.Several beaches in Delaware had been temporarily closed because of the storm. And police in Ocean City asked drivers to avoid southern parts of the tourist town because flooding had already made some roads impassable. Some streets in the New Jersey shore towns of Sea Isle City and Wildwood were flooded, according to social media posts. Seaside Heights, New Jersey, reported a sustained wind of 37 mph (60 kph) and New York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport reported a wind gust of 45 mph (72 kph), said forecasters.A tropical storm warning remained in effect from Great Egg Inlet, New Jersey to Watch Hill, Rhode Island. The warning area includes Long Island and the Long Island Sound in New York, forecasters said. Heavy rain was falling in New York City on Friday afternoon as the centre of the storm moved northward toward upstate New York and western New England.“We expect some pretty heavy winds, and we need people to be ready for that, and some flash flooding in certain parts of the city,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a briefing Friday morning.The summer storm’s impact on the city was expected to be ”pretty limited,” but de Blasio said it would be a bad night for outdoor dining — the only sit-down service allowed at city restaurants because of the pandemic.“If you were going to go out tonight, instead order in and keep helping our restaurant community,” he said.The shoreline town of Old Saybrook, Connecticut, was preparing to open the local high school as a 2,000-person shelter. In a nod to the coronavirus outbreak, Police Chief Michael Spera they will be handing out masks and will not be sending residents to the gym or other common areas.“They will actually be escorted into individual classrooms,” he said. “If you take a school and make pretend that it’s a hotel, we’ll be using individual classrooms like individual hotel rooms.”He said families will be allowed to stay together in one room. People who indicate they have symptoms that might be associated with the virus will be segregated to a separate area of the school.President Donald Trump said the storm is being monitored and that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was poised to help if needed.“We’re fully prepared. FEMA’s ready in case it’s bad. Shouldn’t be too bad, but you never know,” Trump told reporters while departing the White House for Florida.Trump postponed his Saturday rally in New Hampshire due to the weather, Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said.The storm was moving north Friday evening at about 14 mph (22 kph) and producing top sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph), forecasters said. Earlier observations showed it moving at 8 mph (13 kph) with top sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph).Fay is the earliest sixth-named storm on record, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. The previous record was Franklin on July 22, 2005, Klotzbach tweeted.Two named storms formed before the official June 1 start of the hurricane season. None of this season’s previous five named storms strengthened into hurricanes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-fay-weakens-after-landfall-in-new-jersey/story-AwUJqD4Akwv9H77GVKDjpK.html
11-07-2020||World||Jair Bolsonaro picks evangelical pastor as the new education minister of Brazil||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro announced on Friday his second pick to head the education ministry in 11 days, naming a college professor and church pastor to the post.Milton Ribeiro, a former deputy dean of Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo who preaches at a Presbyterian church in Santos outside the metropolis, will be in charge of one of the government’s most desired jobs.Religious groups supporting the president say the education ministry is key to boosting Christian values in Brazil and casting aside what they contend is leftist influence in the schools.Ribeiro’s predecessor, economist Carlos Alberto Decotelli, left June 30 after only five days on the job amid multiple allegations that he had embellished his academic credentials.Decotelli was Bolsonaro’s first Black minister and replaced Abraham Weintraub, who has been targeted in an investigation into a network that purportedly spread defamatory and threatening social media posts about Supreme Court justices. Weintraub resigned June 18 and went to the United States.Last Sunday, a candidate interviewed by Bolsonaro said he had rejected the education minister job, without giving more details. Renato Feder, an education secretary in the state of Paraná, said he appreciated the offer.Feder’s decision highlighted the difficulty the far-right president has faced in naming members of his administration. An interim health minister, Gen. Eduardo Pazuello, has led the country’s efforts against the coronavirus pandemic since May 15.Bolsonaro took office in 2019 with promises to appoint Cabinet ministers with technical expertise rather than dole out positions to curry political favor.Evangelical conservatives are a key support to Bolsonaro, who has faced headwinds and political isolation due to his handling of the Covid-19 crisis, which has killed more than 70,000 people in Brazil. The president announced Tuesday he also has the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jair-bolsonaro-picks-evangelical-pastor-as-the-new-education-minister-of-brazil/story-S1caCOgingXH3qwdrB5eZP.html
11-07-2020||World||Hundreds try to storm Serbian parliament as protests against govt heat up||Police fired tear gas at hundreds of demonstrators who tried to storm Serbia’s parliament on Friday, the fourth night of protests against the Balkan country president’s increasingly authoritarian rule.Demonstrators — who were defying a ban on mass gatherings amid a spike in virus infections — threw bottles, rocks and flares at the police guarding the domed parliament building in central Belgrade and removed the metal fences in front of it. Smoke rose above the entry stairway.Police first used their shields to push back the protesters and prevent them from entering the building. But after repeated attacks, they fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, and then ended up in running battles with demonstrators.Several people were arrested, and many reporters were injured, mainly in attacks by the demonstrators.Some opposition leaders have said the violence was the work of far-right nationalist demonstrators controlled by the government — with an aim to discredit the peaceful protests that began in response to President Aleksandar Vucic’s efforts to reimpose lockdown restrictions against the virus. But, they have mushroomed into an expression of wider frustration with his hard-line rule.Vucic has denied that “hooligans,” who were seen beating up the peaceful protesters earlier this week, are under his control, claiming they were brought in by the opposition. On Friday evening, he told pro-government Pink TV that all those who were attacking the “brave” policemen will be arrested.“The masks have fallen,” Vucic said, describing the protesters as a mix of tycoons and bullies “who want to take over power.”Earlier in the day, Vucic said he wasn’t worried about losing political power amid the protests, considered the most intense since the overthrow of former Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. He instead expressed fear about the spread of the virus by the demonstrators.“It is so irresponsible to call upon people to gather and demonstrate when we are faced with the most horrific numbers of infections from the coronavirus,” Vucic told reporters during his state visit to France.“I beg people, please let’s keep our health safe. Nobody is going to take power by force. Power is taken at the elections. You can protest as much as you want when the epidemic is over,” he said.The Serbian prime minister announced the highest daily number of deaths, 18, on Friday since the start of the pandemic in the Balkan country. She said 386 new confirmed were recorded cases in the past 24 hours. That brings the total to over 17,300 confirmed cases and 352 deaths since March.Friday’s unrest came after a peaceful protest on Thursday — though there was also violence earlier this week.The protests started on Tuesday when Vucic announced that Belgrade would be placed under a new three-day lockdown following a second wave of confirmed coronavirus infections. They have continued even though Vucic suspended his plans to enforce the lockdown. Instead his government has banned gatherings of more than 10 people in the capital.After initially handling the pandemic relatively well, Vucic and his government have been accused of allowing the crisis to spin out of control in order to hold a June 21 election that tightened his grip on power.During his nearly three years in office, Vucic has consolidated a tremendous amount of power in the presidency, a role that previously was only ceremonial.Opponents blame the president for contributing to the large spike in deaths and new cases after he entirely lifted previous very tight lockdown measures. Mass gatherings at soccer and tennis matches and at nightclubs were allowed despite warnings by experts that this could lead to a spike in infections.Serbian officials denounced the protests as an attempt to overthrow the government and weaken Vucic’s position in the European Union-mediated negotiations on Kosovo, a former province whose 2008 declaration of independence Belgrade doesn’t recognize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-try-to-storm-serbian-parliament-as-protests-against-govt-heat-up/story-i7fqbzyxtVPFAgZk9SAZxO.html
11-07-2020||World||US sets record for new Covid-19 cases third day in a row at nearly 69,000||New cases of Covid-19 rose by nearly 69,000 across the United States on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, setting a record for the third consecutive day as Walt Disney Co. stuck to its plans to reopen its flagship theme park in hard-hit Florida.A total of eight US states - Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Ohio, Utah and Wisconsin - also reached records for single-day infections.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn Texas, another hot zone, Governor Greg Abbott warned on Friday he may have to impose new clampdowns if the state cannot stem its record-setting caseloads and hospitalizations through masks and social distancing.“If we don’t adopt this best practice it could lead to a shutdown of business,” the Republican governor told local KLBK-TV in Lubbock, adding it was the last thing he wanted.California announced on Friday the state will release up to 8,000 inmates early from prisons to slow the spread of Covid-19 inside the facilities. At San Quentin State Prison, outside San Francisco, half of the facility’s roughly 3,300 prisoners have tested positive for the virus.The Walt Disney Co. said the theme parks in Orlando would open on Saturday to a limited number of guests who along with employees would be required to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. The park also cancelled parades, firework displays and events that typically draw crowds.Disney’s chief medical officer said earlier this week she believed the rules would allow guests to visit the park safely.Roughly 19,000 people, including some theme park workers, have signed a petition asking Disney to delay the reopening. The union representing 750 Walt Disney World performers has filed a grievance against the company, claiming retaliation against members over a union demand that they be tested for Covid-19. Other theme parks opened in Orlando in June, including Comcast Corp’s Universal Studios Orlando and SeaWorld Entertainment Inc’s SeaWorld.Florida remains one of the worst hotspots for the virus in the nation and is among a handful of states where deaths are rising, based on a Reuters analysis of fatalities in the last two weeks, compared with the prior two weeks. On Thursday, the state reported a record 120 deaths and added another 92 on Friday. It recorded 11,433 new coronavirus cases on Friday, just short of the state’s record, and nearly 7,000 hospitalizations.Antiviral drug to FloridaMore than four dozen hospitals in Florida have reported their intensive care units were full.This month, Florida has repeatedly reported more new daily coronavirus cases than any European country had at the height of their outbreaks. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, angered some residents and medical experts by calling the spike a “blip.” On Friday, DeSantis said that the state would receive more than 17,000 vials of the antiviral drug remdesivir from the US government, adding: “That’ll be something that will hopefully help to improve patient outcomes.” Scott Burkee, a 43-year-old former Disney employee from Davenport, Florida, said DeSantis “has shown zero effort to control the spread, he only becomes concerned when Trump does. The virus is clearly out of control.”Trump, a Republican, travelled to Florida on Friday for an event at the US military’s Southern Command and a campaign fundraiser.The president has sparred with state and local officials and teachers unions over the reopening of schools and said on Friday the Treasury Department would re-examine the tax-exempt status and funding of those that remain closed.Trump previously vowed to cut federal funding to the schools and eject foreign students attending universities in the United States unless their schools offer in-person classes. Most education funds come from state and local coffers.The number of confirmed US infections is over 3 million, according to a Reuters tally, stoking fears that hospitals will be overwhelmed.More than 133,000 Americans have died, a toll that experts warn will likely surge along with the rise in cases.Overall, coronavirus cases are rising in 44 American states, based on a Reuters analysis of cases for the past two weeks compared with the prior two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sets-record-for-new-covid-19-cases-third-day-in-a-row-at-nearly-69-000/story-zCQi8vr9DMwXz6kDSCdt0H.html
11-07-2020||World||Singapore’s PAP retains power but has weakest showing ever||Singapore’s ruling party retained a firm grip on power but suffered its weakest performance in 55 years in office in an election on Friday, with the economy badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. The result could shake up politics in the city-state, leading to more populist policies.The opposition Workers’ Party won a record 10 seats and secured two group representation constituencies. The ruling party won 83 seats -- or 89% of those up for grabs, according to an official count by the Elections Department. That allows it to amend the constitution, pass laws and set policies without major obstacles.Even so, it’s a setback for the People’s Action Party, which has always won at least 93% of parliamentary seats since Singapore became an independent nation in 1965. The result could potentially disrupt Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s succession plan. It may also spur the government to adopt more reactive policies as it did in the wake of the 2011 election, when the opposition tripled its seats to six.“It is not as strong a mandate as I’d hoped for, but it’s a good mandate,” Lee said in a media briefing early Saturday. “The results reflect the pain and uncertainty that Singaporeans feel in this crisis.”The outcome is a warning to other governments which have faced questions over their handling of a pandemic that has crippled economies around the world. Increasingly administrations are under pressure to provide greater safety nets for workers and spend more on things like health care and aged care. That means taking on higher levels of debt for longer in countries which have historically been wary of doing so.This “signals a new normal in Singapore politics, that the previous narratives of voters responding largely to bread and butter concerns may no longer hold water,” said Leonard Lim, Singapore country director for regional consultancy firm Vriens & Partners. “It’s a much more sophisticated electorate, one that isn’t afraid to send a signal to the PAP about its displeasure over the government’s performance even when economic worries weigh heavily on their minds.”Lim said the “remarkable” results show many voters cast ballots motivated by a desire for diverse and credible parliamentary representation.Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, who has been tipped to succeed Lee, won a tight race in the East Coast group constituency.In the briefing, Lee again reaffirmed an earlier promise to hand over Singapore “intact” and in “good working order” to the so-called “fourth generation” of party officials, who have helped spearhead the government’s response to Covid-19. The prime minister has signaled he would step aside by the time he turns 70 in 2022.Lee spoke about the loss of income, anxiety over jobs, and disruption caused by more than two months of restrictive measures to curb the pandemic. “This was not a feel-good election, but one where people are facing real problems and expect more rough weather to come,” he said.‘Sobering Reality Check’“It’s a flight from the status quo rather than a flight to safety -- a vote for change,” said Eugene Tan, a political analyst and law professor at Singapore Management University. “The 4G has their work cut out for them. They have little time to rebuild the trust and confidence of Singaporeans. They are not in a comfortable position and how they respond to this sobering reality check is crucial.”The next government will face the task of leading Singapore through one of its most tumultuous periods after it became one of Asia’s hardest-hit countries in the coronavirus pandemic with more than 45,000 cases, mostly migrant workers. Officials project Singapore’s gross domestic product will contract as much as 7% this year while employment fell in the first quarter by the most on record. That’s despite the government earmarking about S$93 billion in special budget support.Besides the Workers’ Party, which won six seats in the last election, others struggled. Progress Singapore Party, a newcomer led by former PAP stalwart Tan Cheng Bock and supported by the prime minister’s brother, Lee Hsien Yang, failed to win any seats. Tan lost narrowly in his West Coast district, getting 48% of the vote.Along with the 10 elected seats, the opposition will get two additional representatives under a designation called the non-constituency member of Parliament, or NCMP. Lawmakers approved the scheme via a constitutional amendment passed in 1984 after the PAP swept the previous four elections. It was increased to 12 from nine in 2016, when NCMPs were given the same voting rights as elected MPs.‘Social Inequality’Campaigning has been vigorous despite one of the shortest election cycles in the world at just nine days. The PAP has sparred with the opposition on everything from housing issues to the standard of living and goods and services tax, to the use of non-elected members of parliament.Some polling booths saw long lines amid a high turnout as election officials took special precautions such as temperature screenings, the use of disposable gloves and safe distancing rules.“It shows us that there is dissatisfaction about some things that Singapore has done -- whether it be the leadership renewal, the way the virus was managed, or holding the election in the midst of a pandemic,” said Felix Tan, associate lecturer in international relations at SIM Global Education. “It’s a changing landscape. Young voters are not necessarily concerned with job security, they are also concerned with issues such as social inequality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-s-pap-retains-power-but-has-weakest-showing-ever/story-oOV7We1EGzGg37Crj8lSfK.html
11-07-2020||World||Trump commutes longtime adviser Roger Stone’s prison sentence||President Donald Trump on Friday commuted the sentence of his longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, sparing him from prison after he was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election.“Roger Stone has already suffered greatly,” the White House said in a statement. “He was treated very unfairly, as were many others in this case. Roger Stone is now a free man!”Stone, 67, was scheduled to report by Tuesday to a federal prison in Jesup, Georgia, to begin serving a sentence of three years and four months for lying under oath to US lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election. A commutation does not erase a criminal conviction as a pardon does.The veteran Republican political operative’s friendship with Trump dates back decades.Stone was among several Trump associates charged with crimes in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 race to boost Trump’s candidacy.In announcing its clemency decision for Stone, the White House took aim at Mueller’s investigation and the prosecutors who brought the case against Stone. The White House said Stone “is victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump Presidency.”“There was never any collusion between the Trump Campaign, or the Trump Administration, with Russia. Such collusion was never anything other than a fantasy of partisans unable to accept the result of the 2016 election,” the White House said.Trump’s decision to commute Stone’s sentence marks his most assertive intervention to protect an associate in a criminal case and his latest use of executive clemency to benefit an ally.Congressional Democrats and other critics have accused Trump of undermining the rule of law by publicly complaining about criminal cases against associates including Stone, former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff condemned Trump’s action, saying: “With this commutation, Trump makes clear that there are two systems of justice in America: one for his criminal friends, and one for everyone else.”A Washington jury in November 2019 convicted Stone on all seven criminal counts of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to Congress and tampering with a witness.Stone was convicted for lying to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee about his attempts to contact WikiLeaks, the website that released damaging emails about Trump’s 2016 Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton that US intelligence officials have concluded were stolen by Russian hackers.The US Constitution gives a president the “power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” Trump’s use of this executive clemency often has benefited allies and well-connected political figures.He pardoned hardline former Arizona county sheriff Joe Arpaio, former Republican White House aide Lewis “Scooter” Libby, conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza and convicted “junk bond king” Michael Milken. He also commuted the prison sentence of Democratic former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been a contestant on Trump’s former reality TV show.Stone has been a fixture in American partisan battles dating to the 1970s. Stone, a colourful figure known for his natty attire, has labelled himself an “agent provocateur” and famously has the face of former President Richard Nixon tattooed on his back. Trump repeatedly lashed out on Twitter about Stone’s case, accusing prosecutors of being corrupt, the juror forewoman of political bias and the judge of treating his friend unfairly. Late on Friday, the US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia denied Stone’s request for a delay in reporting to prison. (Reporting by Steve Holland and Sarah N.

11-07-2020||World||Covid-19 surge visible across Texas: ‘The tsunami is here’||Urgent calls for field hospitals. Cars lined up for hours at drive-thru testing centers. Bars boarded up and grocery stores enforcing masks.Texas today resembles the state in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Except now, the outbreak is far worse.Records for Covid-19-related deaths and hospitalizations are set almost daily and Texas, the state that embarked on one of America’s fastest reopenings, is in retreat. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who on Friday extended a statewide disaster order first issued in March, is now telling the public to brace for what’s ahead.“Things will get worse,” Abbott told Lubbock television station KLBK. “The worst is yet to come as we work our way through that massive increase in people testing positive.”On Friday, Texas surpassed 10,000 hospitalized patients for the first time, capping a week of grim markers that also saw the state exceed 10,000 new cases in a single day. And it has been the deadliest week of the pandemic in Texas, with 95 new deaths reported Friday.“Several months ago, I warned of a potential tsunami if we did not take this more seriously,” said Hidalgo County Judge Richard Cortez, the top official in one of the largest counties on the Texas-Mexico border. Since Monday, at least 31 people there have died due to Covid-19 — more than in Houston or San Antonio.“The tsunami is here,” he said.The crush of patients at border hospitals is one alarming new sight in Texas. In rural Starr County, which has one hospital and no intensive care unit, County Judge Eloy Vera said Friday that doctors were down to two ventilators and that the local health director was calling around the country looking for places to send their most severe virus patients. “There aren’t any hospitals in Texas that would take them, so he was looking at maybe sending them to New York. It’s bad,” Vera said.He said the county is also seeking a refrigerated trailer to store the dead because the local funeral home already had seven or eight bodies waiting to be processed — more than it could handle at one time.The escalating crisis led members of Texas’ congressional delegation to ask Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar for a field hospital in the Rio Grande Valley as soon as possible. Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas also signed the letter, writing there was “no indication that case counts will level out soon.”“Our healthcare providers remain wholly overwhelmed,” the letter says.During the early weeks of the pandemic, overflow medical shelters were quickly set up in Dallas and Houston, but they closed in April without ever housing a single patient. Abbott announced at the end of that month that Texas would begin reopening after just a few weeks of stay-at-home orders. Mayors in Texas’ big cities and health experts winced at the speed, saying it was too soon.Bars reopened in May, but were ordered shuttered again a month later as Texas cases began climbing again. Abbott on Friday urged the public, again, to wear masks and warned of another shutdown if the spread isn’t stopped.“The next step would have to be a lockdown,” Abbott said. “The last thing I want to do, the last thing anybody in Texas wants to do is see another lockdown.”A resurgence of long lines for virus tests in Texas has also been accompanied by delays in getting results. Veronica Seever, co-owner of Leaf Landscaping Supply in Austin, said she and her family received their Covid-19 test results Tuesday after a 14-day wait.Seever went with her husband and 16-year-old son to get tested at an urgent care clinic east of Austin after two of their employees tested positive. She said all three of them had to miss eight days of work during their 14-day self-isolation period, with no results in sight.“That was a big frustration for us,” Seever said. “We are trying to be socially responsible and make sure we are not out in public or at work spreading, but when it takes that long to get a test, people are missing work that don’t necessarily need to be missing work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-surge-visible-across-texas-the-tsunami-is-here/story-5pWMmqR5Yn0CNy36dhVrYO.html

The privacy violations were exposed by Apple and independent program developers, according to the suit.Developers and testers of Apple’s most recent mobile operating system, iOS 14, found LinkedIn’s application was secretly reading users’ clipboards “a lot,” according to the complaint. “Constantly, even.” Apple’s clipboard often contains sensitive information users cut or copy to paste, including photos, texts, emails or medical records.“LinkedIn has not only been spying on its users, it has been spying on their nearby computers and other devices, and it has been circumventing” Apple’s clipboard timeout, which removes the information after 120 seconds, according to the suit.LinkedIn didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Adam Bauer of New York City, who says he routinely used the LinkedIn App on his iPhone and iPad.The suit seeks to represent a class of users based on alleged violations of federal and California privacy laws and a breach of contract claim.LinkedIn’s information collecting was reported earlier this month by outlets including the Verge and Forbes.The case is Bauer v.

11-07-2020||World||Amazon says email sent to employees asking to delete TikTok was an error||Roughly five hours after an internal email went out to employees telling them to delete the popular video app TikTok from their phones, Amazon appeared to backtrack, calling the ban a mistake. “This morning’s email to some of our employees was sent in error. There is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok,” Amazon emailed reporters just before 5 p.m. Eastern time. Spokeswoman Jaci Anderson declined to answer questions about what happened. The initial internal email, which was disseminated widely online, told employees to delete TikTok, a video app increasingly popular with young people but also the focus of intensifying national-security and geopolitical concerns because of its Chinese ownership. The email cited “security risks” of the app. An Amazon employee who confirmed receipt of the initial email but was not authorized to speak publicly had not seen a retraction at the time of Amazon’s backtrack. Amazon is the second-largest US private employer after Walmart, with with more than 8,40,000 employees worldwide, and moving against TikTok would have escalated pressure on the app. It is banned on employee phones by the US military and the company is subject to a national-security review of its merger history. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that the government was “certainly looking” at banning the app. Chinese internet giant ByteDance owns TikTok, which is designed for users outside of China; it also makes a Chinese version called Douyin. Like YouTube, TikTok relies on its users for the videos that populate its app. It has a reputation for fun, goofy videos and is popular with young people, including millions of American users. But it has racked up concerns such as censorship of videos, including those critical of the Chinese government; the threat of sharing user data with Chinese officials; and violating kids’ privacy. TikTok said earlier in the day that Amazon did not notify it before sending the initial email around midday Eastern. That email read, “The TikTok app is no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email.” To retain mobile access to company email, employees had to delete the TikTok app by the end of the day. “We still do not understand their concerns,” TikTok said at the time, adding that the company would welcome a dialogue to address Amazon’s issues. A spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment Friday evening. TikTok has been trying to appease critics in the U.S. and distance itself from its Chinese roots, but finds itself caught in an increasingly sticky geopolitical web. It recently named a new CEO, former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, which experts said could help it navigate U.S. regulators. And it is stopping operations in Hong Kong because of a new Chinese national security law that led Facebook, Google and Twitter to also stop providing user data to Hong Kong authorities. Pompeo said the government remained concerned about TikTok and referred to the administration’s crackdown on Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE. The government has tried to convince allies to root Huawei out of telecom networks, saying the company is a national-security threat, with mixed success; Trump has also said he was willing to use Huawei as a bargaining chip in trade talks. Huawei has denied that it enables spying for the Chinese government. “With respect to Chinese apps on people’s cell phones, I can assure you the United States will get this one right too,” Pompeo said, and added that if users downloaded the app their private information would be “in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.” A U.S. national-security agency has been reviewing ByteDance’s purchase of TikTok’s precursor, Musical.ly. Meanwhile, privacy groups say TikTok has been violating children’s privacy, even after the Federal Trade Commission fined the company in 2019 for collecting personal information from children without their parents’ consent. Amazon may have been concerned about a Chinese-owned app’s access to employee data, said Susan Ariel Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University and a data governance and national-security expert. China, according to the U.S. government, regularly steals U.S. intellectual property. Part of Amazon’s motivation with the ban, now apparently reversed, may also have been political, Aaronson said, since Amazon “doesn’t want to alienate the Trump administration.” Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, are frequent targets of President Donald Trump. Bezos personally owns The Washington Post, which Trump has referred to as “fake news” whenever it publishes unfavourable stories about him. Last year, Amazon sued the U.S. government, saying that Trump’s “personal vendetta” against Amazon, Bezos and the Post, led it to lose a USD 10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon to rival Microsoft. Meanwhile, federal regulators as well as Congress are pursuing antitrust investigations at Amazon as well as other tech giants.

11-07-2020||World||WHO sees infections rise by record 228k in one day||The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Friday, with the total rising by 228,102 in the last 24 hours.In the US, which is driving the global surge in numbers, President Donald Trump has decided to no longer resist wearing a mask even as the country continued to witness a rise in new Covid-19 infections, which went up by a record 65,551 in one day.Trump told Fox News that he will wear a mask during a likely visit to the Walter Reed military hospital in Bethesda, in the adjoining state of Maryland, on Saturday. “You’re in a hospital, so I think it’s a very appropriate thing (to wear a mask),” he said.The US president had been refusing to use a facial covering since early March.  The US has a total caseload of more than 3.1 million, with at least 133,000 deaths. Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir reduced mortality risk for Covid-19 patients by 62% compared to standard care, according to a new analysis of trial data released by the drugmaker.The analysis compared late-stage trial data with real-world treatment. Gilead will present the findings at the Virtual Covid-19 Conference as part of the 23rd International AIDS Conference.The analysis showed the death rate for patients treated with remdesivir was 7.6% on day 14 compared with 12.5% among patients not taking remdesivir. The analysis found 74.4% of remdesivir-treated patients recovered by day 14, as against 59% of patients receiving the standard of care alone.The WHO said on Friday that it is still possible to bring coronavirus outbreaks under control, even though case numbers have more than doubled in the past six weeks. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the examples of Italy, Spain, South Korea and India’s biggest slum showed that however bad a outbreak was, the virus could still be reined in through aggressive action. “In the last six weeks cases have more than doubled,” Tedros told a virtual press conference in Geneva. However, “there are many examples that it can still be brought back under control”, said Tedros.In Singapore, a general election was held on Friday under the cloud of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-sees-infections-rise-by-record-228k-in-one-day/story-8snLIembFYRlTXonn3KFAK.html

Last week, Trump had tweeted saying the mural was a “symbol of hate”. Similar Black Lives Matter murals are planned in each of New York City’s five boroughs and have appeared across the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyc-mayor-activists-paint-black-lives-matter-outside-trump-tower/story-YQogfrdTvHpDn8YeL0t3TI.html

11-07-2020||India||To ease burden on hospitals, Telangana govt plans home treatment kits for Covid-19 patients||With suspected Covid-19 patients flooding both government and private hospitals for admission and treatment, the Telangana government has come up with an idea to encourage people with mild symptoms to undergo treatment in their respective homes by supplying home isolation kits free of cost.The decision was taken by Telangana medical and health minister Eatala Rajender at a meeting with health department officials on Friday. “Though there are sufficient numbers of beds available in government hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients, we are advising Covid-19 positive patients having mild symptoms not to come to the hospitals but get treatment in their respective homes,” the minister said.In a bid to persuade patients with mild symptoms to go in for home-quarantine, the medical and health department will deliver these “home isolation kits” at their doorstep, so that they could get the treatment as per the prescription attached with the kit.Each kit comprises 34 Vitamin-C tablets, 17 Zinc tablets, 17 B-Complex capsules, six cloth masks, a sanitiser, a liquid hand wash, two pairs of gloves and a bottle of sodium hypochlorite solution.“Besides, there will be a booklet comprising details of what the patient should and should not do during the 17-day isolation period. If necessary, the doctor who tests the patient will also prescribe necessary antibiotics, anti-histamine and antacid tablets to the patient,” an official in the medical and health department said.The kit also has the details of the local health centre along with the contact numbers of medical officers, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and ASHA workers and also that of municipal officials.According to an estimate, out of the total number of 12,600-odd active Covid-19 positive cases in the state, around 10,000 patients having mild symptoms have been undergoing treatment at home. “Even if there is more than one patient at home, all of them would get the home isolation kits,” the official said.He said most of these patients are cured with these medicines in home isolation. If they develop any moderate to severe symptoms, they can call up the local medical or civic authorities of ANMs or even dial the toll-free number, so that they could be immediately shifted to the hospital, he said.The Andhra Pradesh government, too, is said to be planning a similar scheme of supplying home isolation kits to Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment at home for mild symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-ease-burden-on-hospitals-telangana-govt-plans-home-treatment-kits-for-covid-19-patients/story-OOgVLVKtcF7j8syIDiXugK.html
11-07-2020||India||Requests for probe into gangster’s death reach SC||The Supreme Court has so far received four requests for setting up a CBI probe or a judicial enquiry into the encounter killing of gangster Vikas Dubey in Uttar Pradesh.The Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), which had filed a petition in the top court in 2018 against the growing number of encounter deaths in UP, moved a fresh application highlighting the deaths of Dubey and his accomplices, Amar Dubey and Prabhat Mishra. Citing news reports, the application said that all three encounters followed a similar modus operandi. In two instances, the petition said, the criminals tried to escape after snatching a police pistol, attacked the police party and were shot dead in retaliatory firing.The PUCL application said, “That the police version of the encounter raises many serious questions, in particular, whether they are simple administrative liquidations.”The application said since January 1, 2017 till March 31, 2018, over 1000 encounters took place in the state resulting in 49 deaths and injuries to 370 persons. By October 2018, the number of encounters doubled and in 2019, the police claimed to have killed 103 criminals in 5178 encounters.The application further stated that only a judicial probe can expose the role of the state behind such crimes. It said, “Police encounter or administrative liquidation is a serious crime – murder/culpable homicide and is an offence against the entire society. If such a crime is committed with the support of the State or where the State condones such an offence, it takes a very serious dimension….”PUCL’s 2018 petition is still pending consideration with the apex court. Pointing to an alleged police-politician-criminal nexus behind Dubey’s encounter, another petition has been filed by advocate Anoop Prakash Awasthi. In the petition, he has said that “trigger happy” officials in the Uttar Pradesh police consider themselves above the law and if this goes unchecked, it will pose a serious threat.In addition, the office of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) has also received a letter from lawyer Atal Bihari Dubey, demanding an independent probe into Dubey’s encounter.Hours before Dubey’s encounter, the apex court had also received a petition by a Mumbai-based lawyer Ghanshyam Upadhyay seeking probe into the death of Dubey’s aides. In his petition, Upadhyay said he suspected that Vikas Dubey too would be killed in similar manner. Following the encounter, Upadhyay has asked the SC Registry to list his case urgently.So far, there has been no direction from the SC Registry to list any of the above-mentioned matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/requests-for-probe-into-gangster-s-death-reach-sc/story-FvIDfRJzwzPx4KuZoW3auJ.html

What is the market rate for PPE kit, gloves, sanitizer, thermal scanner, and other equipment brought and how much has the state government paid for each one of them and the companies from whom they have purchased? How many food kits have been provided and to whom and at what cost? Similarly what was supplied to migrant laborers returning to their native places and at what cost? How much has been spent on Covid patients till date,” the Congress leader asked. Deputy chief minister CM Ashwath Narayan said the government would provide all details on the money spent on a later date since the focus right now was to fight the pandemic. He, however, stressed that all the purchases made by the state government are above board and transparent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappa-opts-for-7-day-lockdown-to-curb-bengaluru-s-covid-spike/story-IlBzzusFjvRWdyEKplyX6L.html

This is the first ‘man-eater’ leopard killed this year in Badrinath forest division.“On June 29, when the leopard made its second kill, I wrote to the chief wildlife warden requesting the leopard to be declared a man-eater. The permission for this was received on June 30. On Saturday, the leopard was shot by shooters hired by the forest department at Narayanbagar range of Badrinath forest division,” Singh said.The leopard had first killed a person on May 28 in Gairbaram area of the division, the DFO said.On July 8, a leopard which killed a two-year-old child in Udal area of Almora forest division, was also declared a ‘man-eater’ by the state forest department. The department has roped in two hunters from Uttar Pradesh to hunt down the ‘man-eater’ leopard that killed two people in two days this week, said forest officials.60-year-old attacked by leopard in Nainital diesIn a separate incident, a 60-year-old woman from Nainital district died in a leopard attack on Saturday morning, forest officials said.This is the second incident in Kathgodam area within 20 days when a leopard killed a woman who went to the forest to collect fodder.

11-07-2020||India||Two arrested in Rajasthan for ‘attempts’ to topple government, political slugfest continues||Rajasthan police’s special operations group (SOG) has announced the arrest of two individuals, Bharat Malani and Ashok Singh, and said that they were involved in efforts to topple the state government. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) also filed a preliminary enquiry against three Independent MLAs for alleged attempts to bribe Congress MLAs ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls last month in a bid to destabilise the state government.According to the SOG FIR, the arrested accused were allegedly talking about the rift between the chief minister and the deputy chief minister and also about toppling the Congress government by poaching MLAs. The SOG claimed to have gained the information from phone intercepts. Further questioning of the accused is taking place.Earlier today, the ruling Congress party and the principal opposition party, the BJP, traded serious allegations and counter-allegations over the issue.It all started with chief minister Ashok Gehlot accusing the BJP’s state and central leaders of conspiring to topple his government using money power, reported PTI.“BJP leaders are playing the game at the behest of central leaders. MLAs were offered money... Rs 10 crore in advance and Rs 15 crore after the government is toppled,” the chief minister alleged and added that the BJP wants to convert the state’s politics into a goat market, reported PTI.Gehlot also named leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, his deputy Rajendra Rathore and BJP state president Satish Poonia for allegedly executing the agenda of their party’s central leadership by indulging in horse-trading.Congress MLAs in Rajasthan claim BJP involved in horse-tradingOn Friday night, over 20 Congress MLAs had also issued a joint statement alleging that BJP was trying to topple the Congress government in the state by “luring” legislators, reported the agency.The BJP responded by daring Gehlot to prove his allegation or quit politics, and claimed that the CM was targeting the opposition party since he had failed to stop the infighting in the state unit of the Congress party.Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat alleged that Gehlot’s allegations of horse-trading were nothing but a “cooked up story” aimed to defame Congress’ state president and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot to gain an upper hand in state politics.“The chief minister himself was the script writer, producer, director, actor and villain of this film,” said Shekhawat. He also challenged Gehlot to release the list of the MLAs, who he considered to be “saleable”.Also Read: Case filed for alleged bid to topple Rajasthan govtLeader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria asked Gehlot to handle his party’s internal crisis instead of levelling “false” accusations against the BJP.“I challenge the chief minister to prove his allegations against the BJP. If the allegations are proved then I will quit politics and if the charges are not proven, then chief minister Gehlot should quit politics,” Kataria was quoted as saying by the agency.The matter further intensified when Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) convener Hanuman Beniwal alleged that the state government was involved in tapping the phones of MPs and MLAs through the SOG. Beniwal, whose party is an NDA constituent, also alleged that attempts were made by Gehlot to poach three RLP MLAs during the Rajya Sabha elections last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-arrested-in-rajasthan-for-attempts-to-topple-government-political-slugfest-continues/story-GTI76bfOgjLdT1hbdbHy9L.html

The incident, reported to have occurred on Friday, came to light on Saturday when the photograph of the body being transported in autorickshaw was shared on the social media and was played up in the local television channels.The picture shows the body placed horizontally at the bottom of autorickshaw’s rear seat, protruding from either side of the vehicle, as it was driven through the streets of the locality. Neither the driver of the autorickshaw, in which the body was transported, nor the person sitting beside him in the front seat were sported wearing personal protection equipment (PPE), which is mandatory for the people disposing the bodies of Covid-19 patients.According to the guidelines issued by the state government, two GHMC vehicles with supporting staff in full PPE gear are liable to accompany the transportation vehicle, with COVID safety material and power spraying cans. A COVID Liaison Officer (CLO) of the designated coronavirus hospital is delegated to interact with the family and make required provisions, the state guidelines read. District collector C Narayana Reddy said he has ordered an inquiry into the incident and terminated the services of contract municipal employee, who took the body of Covid-19 victim to the graveyard in an autorickshaw.“There are only two ambulances in the Nizambad hospital which are meant for disposing the dead bodies. On Friday, four people, including three Covid-19 patients, died. While two ambulances had already left with two bodies, the other two bodies completely packed were kept ready for disposal,” the collector said.Reddy said the hospital had informed the relatives of the patient to wait for one hour for the ambulance arrive, but they preferred to carry the body in their own autorickshaw. “So, the hospital authorities arranged for contract municipal employee to accompany the body to the graveyard,” Reddy said.Nizamabad hospital superintendent Dr Nageshwar Rao was not available for comment. Terming the violations in the process of cremation as serious issue, director of medical issue Dr Ramesh Reddy ordered a detailed enquiry in the matter . “The hospital superintendent has been instructed to file criminal cases against those employees who were involved in handing over the body.

11-07-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling case: Two key accused including Swapna Suresh held in Bengaluru||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday detained two key accused in Kerala gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair, from Bengaluru in a swift operation after tracking some of the calls they made from their phones, said officials privy to the development.The two accused were on the run for the last six days after the Customs Department seized 30 kg of gold from an air cargo consignment that had arrived from the United Arab Emirates and was marked to the country’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram, last Sunday. They will be brought to Kochi in the early hours of Sunday, said an official. It is, however, not clear how the duo slipped out of Thiruvananthapuram, which is under a triple lockdown with an aim to contain the spread of coronavirus disease, and reached Karnataka. The NIA had taken up the case on Friday and filed first information reports against four persons in the case. In the FIRs, Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the consular office, who is now in the custody of the customs, is named first accused; Swapna Suresh is the second; elusive UAE-based smuggling-kingpin Fazil Pareed is the third; and Suresh’s friend Sandeep Nair is the fourth accused. The FIRs were filed under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).It is the first time that the premier agency, which handles cases related to national security and terror, is investigating a gold smuggling case. In the FIRs, NIA said the accused were part of a well-entrenched smuggling racket and that the first accused and Suresh were actively involved in arranging the diplomatic papers for the delivery of the consignment. It also said a good portion of money generated through smuggling was used to fund some anti-national activities.Also Read: 88 new Covid-19 cases take Kerala’s tally to 7,438, hike in locally-infected patients worryingSuresh, who was working as the operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT ministry, had gone underground after the seizure.

11-07-2020||India||Air India terminates 200 cabin crew members, refuses withdrawal of resignations of 50 pilots||National carrier, Air India (AI), has terminated 200 of its cabin crew, and refused to accept the withdrawal of resignations of 50 pilots amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak that has roiled the civil aviation sector. These 200 cabin crew were recently inducted in the airline on a contractual basis. AI has had around 4,000 cabin crew and 1,800 pilots on its rolls until April.The 50 AI pilots had resigned from the airline after securing jobs in private airlines before the pandemic struck India.Their job offers were withdrawn because the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions led to the suspension of domestic and international flights since end-March and adversely impacted the civil aviation sector.The domestic flights have since resumed limited operations.The 50 AI pilots wanted to withdraw their resignations, but the national carrier’s management turned down their proposal and asked them to serve out their notice period.The decision was taken after the AI management met representatives of the pilots’ unions met on Wednesday (July 8).A senior airline pilot said, “The management needs to look at these employees with some compassion amid these hard times.”Earlier, HT had reported in May that the wide-body (Boeing) pilots union, Indian Pilots Guild (IPG), the narrow-body (Airbus) pilots union, Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), had questioned AI authorities about the measures taken while operating cargo flights during lockdown restrictions to ensure the generation of maximum revenue.On July 6 (Monday), the unions wrote a letter to Rajiv Bansal, the interim chairman-cum-managing director (CMD), urging the management to ensure that a fixed percentage is cut from an employee’s salary based on the income and also implement a monthly leave without pay (LWP) for all the staff because of truncated operations due to the viral outbreak.The unions also demanded that 25% of their pending dues be cleared immediately and they are allowed to quit their jobs with immediate effect in case the LWP is not implemented for all the employees.A senior airline official said layoffs were a new normal because the pandemic has heightened AI woes.“The letter has set things in motion. The heads of departments have failed to tackle the situation and stand up for the employees, who have been asked to leave,” the official added.“The crisis has deepened because a limited number of flights are operating due to the pandemic. The management needs to study the non-operating and operating departments and reduce the workforce accordingly amid an acute cash crunch,” said a retired AI official.AI spokesperson, however, refused to comment on the stand-off between the employees and the management.“These are internal issues on which we won’t like to make any comment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-terminates-200-cabin-crew-members-refuses-withdrawal-of-resignations-of-50-pilots/story-HuZwfO7Mt2P9VUguTCW3mI.html

11-07-2020||India||Disengagement between India and China is ‘work in progress’: S Jaishankar||The disengagement and de-escalation process between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a “work in progress”, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday.Jaishankar’s remarks, made during an appearance on India Global Week, a three-day virtual event organised by a UK-based media house, reflected the differences that persist between the two sides despite the decision made by them almost a week ago to pull back troops from key friction points along the LAC.Asked by the moderator of the event about the border standoff with China, Jaishankar said: “What’s just happened is that we have agreed on the need to disengage because the troops on both sides are deployed very close to each other.Also read: How PM Modi called China’s bluff in Ladakh, writes Shishir Gupta“So there is a disengagement and a de-escalation process which has been agreed upon. It has just commenced. It’s very much work in progress. At this point, I really wouldn’t like to say more than that.”During the third virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on Friday, India and China said they would push forward efforts aimed at complete disengagement and easing of tensions along the LAC even as differences persisted on key issues such as Beijing’s claim on Galwan Valley.The corps commanders of the two sides are set to meet next week for the fourth time since the standoff began in early May to decide on the next steps of the disengagement and de-escalation process.Though both sides have pulled back their troops and created so-called buffer zones at key friction points, the presence of large numbers of Chinese troops and structures at places such as Pangong Lake continues to be a concern for the Indian side.China’s envoy to India, Sun Weidong, on Friday said the two sides need to find a “fair and reasonable” solution to the border issue through peaceful negotiation and also work together to maintain peace and tranquillity along the disputed frontier till an ultimate settlement is reached.Also read: Arriving at a new normal in India-China relations | OpinionJaishankar also spoke on India’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, relations with key countries such as the US, the UK, Australia and Singapore and the emerging post-Coronavirus world order.India is conscious of the Covid-19-related challenges ahead and the next few weeks and months will be “tough”, he acknowledged. With India the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, the country will have a role in making any vaccine for the Coronavirus “accessible and affordable and available to the rest of the world”, he said.Referring to the UK, Jaishankar said India and Britain need to work together at a time when multilateralism is under stress and there is greater multi-polarity. Both countries have a shared world view and India sees the UK as “one of our natural partners” as it prepares for a stint in the UN Security Council from next year and takes on the chair of the G20 in 2022, he said.In the US, four presidents with very different outlooks – Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump – all agreed on the importance of India and the need to strengthen the bilateral relationship, he said. India’s ties with the US are now “one of our key relationships”, and this will become more important in future, he added.Also read | A timeline: India-China’s deadliest border clash since 1975 explainedLooking forward to the post-Covid-19 era, Jaishankar said he expected the political trends seen during the Coronavirus crisis to accelerate. A lot of countries are “behaving more nationalistically” and people are “looking out for themselves”, he said.“I do see a world where many arguments will sharpen, I think there will be issues of trust, there will be questions on resilient supply chains.

Among the fresh Covid-19 cases, 234 are locally-infected and the Indian Medical Association Kerala chapter has said community transmission has taken place in the state and there is no point in hiding it.With 488 fresh Covid-19 cases, the state’s total went up to 7,438 – out of this 2,680 patients are under treatment and 3,965 people have recovered, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The state has reported two deaths taking the death toll to 31. With the increase in locally-infected cases containment zones also increased to 168. But the CM said community transmission is yet to take place in the state.Pinarayi Vijayan said in view of the rising cases the government will restrict protest rallies to avoid further spread of the disease. The state has been witnessing a series of protests seeking the resignation of the Chief Minister in connection with the gold smuggling case.The Customs Department had seized 30 kgs of gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates to the country’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. Swapna Suresh, who was working as an IT consultant under the state IT Ministry, had gone underground after the seizure. Later, the CM had transferred his principal secretary M Sivasankar who was reported to be close to Suresh.The Union Home Ministry had later handed over the probe to the National Investigation Agency and the CM had welcomed it. But the opposition is on the warpath saying he was aware of the ‘shady dealings’ that took place right under his nose.“Everyone has the right to protest. But the situation is different now as we are going through a serious pandemic crisis. There is no distancing and masks in some of these protests. They are endangering lives of policemen also,” said the CM adding the protests were politically-motivated. The government has also decided to ban fishing in view of the hike in Covid-19 cases in coastal hamlets. In state capital, Thiruvananthapuram triple lockdown will remain in containment zones only but in other areas it will be a normal lockdown, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/88-new-covid-19-cases-take-kerala-s-tally-to-7-438-hike-in-locally-infected-patients-worrying/story-09iFQW9llh70Lfj3Lwg0AN.html
11-07-2020||India||‘Issues of trust’ will rise in a ‘more difficult’ post-Covid world: S Jaishankar||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday predicted a post-Covid world where differences and issues of trust between countries will sharpen along with a rise in nationalistic approach leading to an “acceleration of a trend seen before” the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.The comments made by the external affairs minister came during the three day India Global Week 2020 event which is an attempt to trace India’s role and place in a post-Covid world order on all fronts, including economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had highlighted Indian government’s policy of self-reliance combined with compassion for the entire world, as a possible solution to challenges presented by exigencies like coronavirus, while delivering the opening address at the event on Friday.Jaishankar said that a post-Covid world could pose several challenges including questions on “resilient supply chains”.“I see a world where arguments will sharpen. I think there will be issues of trust which have been raised. There will be questions on resilient supply chains. It is going to be a more difficult world,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Jaishankar’s comments come close on the heels of a protracted border conflict with China which led to the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in clashes with the Chinese Army, along with an unspecified number of Chinese casualties. While the militaries of the two countries are now engaged in disengagement and deescalation from the conflict zones, the clashes have led to a popular sentiment of mistrust of India’s neighbour. Amid the heightened intension between the two countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had cautioned that the era of expansionism was over. The comment was widely interpreted to be directed at China.Commenting on the ever evolving global dynamics, Jaishankar added that several trends seen before Covid 19 outbreak could become even stronger in the post-Covid world.“A lot of trends that we saw before coronavirus, they could accelerate in the post Covid world. Even in response, in six months, for example, we have seen a lot of countries behaving more nationalistically,” ANI quoted Jaishankar as having said at the summit.His comments come in the backdrop of friction seen on issues of trade and protectionism between the United States and several other countries including China and India. The US under President Donald Trump has also been accused of tightening immigration norms citing his government’s America First policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/issues-of-trust-will-rise-in-a-more-difficult-post-covid-world-order-s-jaishankar/story-MWmgj4pdXzUN4FJsF8yp2M.html

He had been arrested in Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday morning, a week after he and his gang members ambushed a police team killing eight policemen.On Wednesday, police arrested suspended Chaubeypur station officer Vinay Tiwari and sub inspector KK Sharma on the charge of conspiring for the attack on the police team by tipping off Dubey.Kanpur’s senior superintendent of police Dinesh Kumar P said the investigation found that Tiwari and Sharma leaked information about the raid to Dubey. Earlier on Tuesday, former Kanpur SSP Anant Deo Tewari and the entire staff of the Chaubeypur police station comprising 68 police personnel, were transferred.Anant Deo Tewari allegedly did not take action on complaints of slain DSP Devendra Mishra against Vinay Tiwari. Mishra had led the police raid against Dubey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-to-probe-connivance-of-local-police-with-slain-up-gangster-vikas-dubey/story-KjnzQX9OBPorg5H1cCLv2K.html

We must take proper care of their physical and mental well-being. They should not feel upset,” she wrote.The chief minister wrote the letter citing the ongoing crisis and the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country.West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar too has called a meeting with all vice chancellor of state run universities on July 16. He said he would also talk with Banerjee.He tweeted on July 8: “Student worries are reflected in inputs to me. After Virtual Conference with VCs on July 15, I will take initiative in engaging @MamataOfficial@itspcofficial for redressal of concerns. If required would also engage #UGC and Union HRD Minister.

11-07-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee writes to PM Modi, says let states decide on holding final year examinations||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting that states be allowed to take independent decisions on the issue of holding of final year university examinations given the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic.Banerjee has asked for rescinding a directive issued by the ministry of human resources and the University Grants Commission (UGC) to compulsorily hold terminal examinations by the end of September this year and said that this will inconvenience the students and parents in West Bengal, who support state government’s decision to evaluate students on performance in their previous semesters.“I would therefore request you to get the matter re-examined immediately and restore the earlier advisory of UGC. This will facilitate the state governments to implement its decision, taken on the basis of the guidelines of UGC issued on 29.4.2020 to protect the interest of the students at national/international levels,” her letter states.Banerjee was referring to UGC’s revised guidelines issued on 27.06.2020, which she claims is contradictory to the governing body’s April advisory, which was made the basis for Bengal’s decision to not hold examinations. Her letter says that the Bengal government’s decision in this regard was issued on June 27 after consultations with all Vice Chancellors and other stakeholders and reversing it may lead to various complications.“It may be stated here that the Universities/Colleges aided by the State government have already taken steps as per the advisory issued by the Higher Education Department (of the state). The students, their parents and other stakeholders have overwhelmingly appreciated our advisory dated 27.06.2020,” she says in her letter before adding that her office is receiving hundreds of emails from the students and teaching community raising concerns over the new UGC revised guidelines mandating holding of final year examinations.Bengal is the latest state to protest against the UGC advisory, Maharashtra, Punjab and Delhi have also asked the Centre to reconsider the UGC directive citing the risk posed by coronavirus. Maharashtra, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry have already decided not to conduct final examinations.Some states have also cited the logistical challenge of holding examinations online due to limited access to computers and internet in rural areas and highlighted that some of the higher education institutions have been temporarily converted into Covid 19 management related facilities.Earlier today, the Delhi government decided to cancel all examinations in state-run colleges, institutions and universities and the Delhi CM urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and cancel examinations in Central universities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-writes-to-pm-modi-says-let-states-decide-on-holding-final-year-examinations/story-4E4pOuiDXzKYkOq50l0WQJ.html

The FIR lodged on Friday and based on mobile conservation between the arrested men said the attempt to topple the government was being made since before the Rajya Sabha polls held on June 19.“BJP leaders tried to topple the Rajasthan government at a time when the entire administration was busy in tackling the coronavirus outbreak. When all of us should have been focused in fighting the virus, the ministers, legislators and leaders had to divert attention to saving the government,” Gehlot said, while addressing a virtual press conference on Saturday.Gehlot said Rajasthan did not have a tradition of horse trading but the BJP leaders have become brazen and were promising Rs 10-15 crore to MLAs to switch allegiances and destabilise his government.“The BJP leaders have crossed limits of shamelessness. The BJP is trying to do politics by trying to buy MLAs like goats from a market,” he said. The CM said the BJP was successful in “buying” seven Congress MLAs in Gujarat and winning two Rajya Sabha seats. “But we thwarted their similar game plan in Rajasthan and won two seats and taught them a lesson. But, they are shameless and are still trying their machinations,” he said, claiming there was no threat to his government, which will complete its full term.Gehlot also attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah.“Mod ii and Amit Shah ji cannot tolerate me or my government. The conspiracy is being carried out by BJP leaders in the state who are trying to buy legislators,” he said.Gehlot claimed that the BJP was different when Atal Behari Vajpayee was prime minister between 1998 and 2004. “During (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee’s time, this was not the case but since 2014 the arrogance in the BJP has come out in the open. They are dividing people on religious and caste lines and murdering democracy. Their (BJP’s) thinking is fascist,” he said.BJP leaders, however, said the chief minister and Congress had laid out the entire game plan of accusing BJP of horse trading ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections to hide its own internal divide.Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia said, “This is Congress’s own fight. The entire strategy was worked out by the chief minister to prevent factionalism from coming out in the open.”“In the press conference, the CM did not name any betrayer who could switch sides. He was only trying to hide the divide and friction within the Congress party and is using BJP as a scapegoat which is not justified.”Poonia said Gehlot had crossed limits of political decency by using derogatory words for the legislators and BJP central leaders.“He termed the MLAs as goats and referred to BJP leaders in the state and Centre as shameless. This has never happened in Rajasthan politics,” Poonia said in a virtual press conference. Poonia said Gehlot was trying to emerge as a national leader by attacking Modi and Shah.The BJP president also refuted Gehlot’s charge that the BJP was a divided into several groups in Rajasthan and the state unit has not been able to form its executive because of differences between group led by leaders such as Satish Poonia, former chief minister, Vasundhara Raje and leader of opposition in Rajasthan assembly, Gulab Chand Kataria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-offering-mlas-rs10-15-cr-to-topple-my-govt-says-ashok-gehlot/story-EWaNBsKZIWsU5llfaKXz3K.html

11-07-2020||India||‘It’s scary but taking all precautions!’||Loaded with confidence and armed with full precautions ‘Swaragini’ and ‘Devanshi’ fame actor Helly Shah is back to shoot her latest venture. “Thoda sa darr hai abhi…,’ though we are taking all necessary precautions but still there is lot of fear around,” she said.The actor follows strict dos and don’ts. “I have made a rule that no one is allowed inside my room and if something has to be conveyed it will be through 2-3 close associates only. It’s bit tough for female actors as we have so many people around for hair, make-up, outfits and jewellery and then again someone to dress-up in case we have to wear a saree,” said Helly over the phone.Helly is largely using her own stuff. “I am using my personal beauty products as much as possible but then we have to take help with precautions. The sets are sanitised but if I had to touch a property, I make sure it is purely sanitised again.”To boost her immunity Helly is following her mother’s tips. “My parents didn’t comment on me resuming shoot but surely they are apprehensive and loaded with advice. My mother knows that I am responsible enough to take care of myself but then my immunity is bit low and season change is challenging for me so she always give these ‘desi nuskhas’.”She explains it further, “On reaching home I wash/sanitise each and everything I have taken with me. Before going to bed, I take turmeric-dry ginger power in lukewarm water. Besides, I am only consuming warm water throughout the day which works well for me. Earlier, we used to eat on sets or order something from outside but now it’s a big no. Now, I carry my own food and water.”Chinese food is what she craves for. “Since last many days I want to try Chinese food but I know it will not be possible for a long time now. Instead, I think one day I will cook it myself! However, I don’t enjoy cooking much and during lockdown have barely cooked 2-3 times.”In her upcoming show ‘Ishq Mein Marjaawan’ she is playing a simple girl with plenty of emotions. “Early in the year, we shot in Goa and now we are shooting in Naya Gaon.”Despite the OTT boom she says not much will change on TV. “Audience for both medium is very different. Also both mediums are going steady in their own space. Nothing is going to change overnight. Also, I feel that the TV audience have different likes and dislikes and a sudden change in any department won’t be accepted by the viewers.”The actor was in Lucknow last year and hopes to return again to go on a shopping spree to buy more chikankari dresses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-scary-but-taking-all-precautions/story-3OlGU4Les0fgFSDvV9g2kN.html

The cloth merchant, identified as Aquil Shaikh, had come to Mumbai in end-June flouting prevailing lockdown restrictions, which were imposed since end-March in a bid to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, to catch a glimpse of actor Amitabh Bachchan.He was staying on a footpath near the actor’s bungalow Jalsa in Juhu.On July 4, the two accused, identified as Sanjay Gopi Kharwa alias Rajendra alias Khidki (25), a resident of Bhayander, and Suresh Kanji Kharwa (20), a resident of Matunga labour camp, spotted Shaikh sleeping on the footpath and targeted him.“Initially, the accused asked Shaikh to drink liqour, which he refused. Then, they took him to an isolated location and again insisted that he drinks liqour. An altercation followed between Shaikh and the two accused, and they started beating him. One of the accused then took out a knife and stabbed him in his hand, chest and stomach,” said Pandharinath Wavhal, a senior inspector at Juhu police station. The accused also robbed his mobile phone and cash and fled from the spot, he added.Locals spotted an injured Shaikh and rushed him to Cooper Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment.Police have registered a first information report (FIR) based on Shaikh’s statement under Sections 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt), Section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and Section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The suspects were identified after Juhu Police station authorities scanned the closed-circuit TV (CCTV) footage of the area.Harish Biradar, sub-inspector, Juhu Police station, and the investigating officer (IO) of the case, said, “Sanjay had a criminal past, as eight cases of robbery are registered against him. We, through our informants, learnt that they would be coming to Juhu. The accused were arrested from Pushpa Park in Juhu on Saturday. Now, we are on the lookout for an accomplice of the accused.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amitabh-bachchan-s-fan-who-came-from-up-to-see-him-stabbed-at-juhu-two-arrested/story-R7hAsLvEkHZyhRRO49PiVI.html
11-07-2020||India||‘I always knew that like my father, music is my world too...’||Celebrated singer Javed Ali made the most of lockdown days. During the phase he recorded for 10-12 projects from his home. “At present I have no set up but my phone helped me to fulfil my work commitments including a jingle for AR Rahman sahab. I now plan to have a music set up at my place too as I think it’s a mandatory add on for me. Earlier, I never thought about it because I enjoy creating songs with the team at a studio but after the ongoing crisis, I think it’s required.”Javed is known for soulful melodies including ‘Kun Faya Kun’, ‘Arziyan’, ‘Jashne Bahara’, ‘Tu Hi Haqeeqat’ and many more. The trained classical singer got umpteen time to practice music. “See I believe that formal training in music is a must. And age is no bar for learning music, I am still learning and will continue to do so always. I pick up little things from singers be it young or old, even from kids for that matter. One should practice regularly. Earlier, because of work I sometimes gave my riyaz a miss and ‘ab dekhiye roz hi riyaaz hai.’ At the same time, now we need to go back to work too. Hopefully studio recordings will start soon and we would be busy making music like before,” he said over the phone.Talking about his early days, he said, “I am fortunate that I was born in a musical family where music was already a part of life. I have learned so much from my father Ustad Hamid Hussain who was a gifted singer. That’s where I knew, that like my father, music is my world too. But I had to start from scratch. I took up whatever came my way as being associated with music was my priority. It was tough but that struggle is there in every field so I am glad and thankful to all who supported me in my musical journey.”The singer is all set to be back on TV as a reality judge. “I love music and enjoy being associated with it in any capacity and my association with the show goes back to 2011. Also getting back with Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Li’l Champs is like a homecoming for me and as the shoot is on, I am glad to be on the sets. In this period of new normal, we want to take viewers on a musical ride. Also joining me in the panel as mentors will be Himesh Reshammiya and Alka Yagnik for the eighth season. Also, I’m extremely emotional towards kids, so while taking care of their feelings, we will together take the show forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-always-knew-that-like-my-father-music-is-my-world-too/story-kyAH4NgSV8bh3mCmMoUeEO.html

Uddhav’s comments follow a similar commendation by World Health Organisation (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Dharavi is a densely populated slum area in Mumbai with around 10,00,000 people squeezed in an area spanning 2.5 square kilometers, making it highly vulnerable to spread of contagions such as Covid-19. Yet active surveillance and containment measures including intense screening, testing, sanitation and isolation of Covid patients and suspects has led to a continuous tapering off in the number of new infections in the area. This is all the more impressive given the high rate of infection in the rest of Mumbai and other cities of Maharashtra.Maintaining social distance is a challenge in Dharavi, which is spread over 2.5 sq km with population density of 2,27,136 per sq km. Not just that, according to a senior BMC official, at least 80 percent of its population depends on 450 community toilets and the administration had to sanitise and disinfect these toilets several times a day.The WHO director general cited Dharavi’s example to say that only aggressive action combined with national unity and global solidarity can turn the pandemic situation around.“And some of these examples are Italy, Spain and South Korea, and even in Dharavi - a densely packed area in the megacity of Mumbai - a strong focus on community engagement and the basics of testing, tracing, isolating and treating all those that are sick is the key to breaking the chains of transmission and suppressing the virus,” he had said.In a statement reflecting he shared the sentiment, Thackeray said, “Dharavi is an inspiration for the world on how to curb the spread of a pandemic.”Thackeray highlighted that 82 percent of patients in Dharavi have recovered from the disease and the number of active cases had dropped sharply in the area to 166. He underlined self discipline and community efforts as key to success achieved in Dharavi.2,359 Covid-19 cases have been recorded in Dharavi so far, of which 1,952 patients have recovered from the deadly infection. Maharashtra as a whole, on the other hand, has registered 2,38,461 coronavirus cases so far.Late last month, the central government had acknowledged the efforts put in by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in bringing down the infection rate in the area.Basking under the glory, the civic body on Saturday told news agency PTI that it had to change its traditional approach of waiting for patients, contact tracing, isolation and home quarantine to begin proactive screening instead, which paid rich dividends.Also Read: Proactive screening helped curb Dharavi’s coronavirus spread, says BMC“Proactive screening helped in early detection, timely treatment and recovery,” Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G North ward of the BMC was quoted as saying.He added that at least six to seven lakh people in the area have been screened so far and 14,000 persons have been tested apart from 13,000, who were placed in institutional quarantine that provided community kitchen apart from medical care for free.According to the official data, while in April, the doubling rate in Dharavi was 18 days, it gradually improved to 43 days in May and slowed down to 108 and 430 days in June and July respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dharavi-inspiration-for-the-world-uddhav-thackeray-lauds-covid-19-containment-model-in-asia-s-largest-slum/story-MqQykcVqrvzyrPGT2izmGO.html

The temple was closed on March 19 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams authorities, around 2.63 lakh pilgrims had a darshan of the Lord till Friday, since June 11 when it was thrown open for pilgrims. “This is not even equal to the four days’ footfall of pilgrims during the normal days,” a TTD official said.The daily footfall in the temple before its closure in March was around 65,000-70,000 during the normal days and nearly one lakh during Brahmotsavams (annual grand festival of the Lord) and other festival days.The drop in the number of pilgrims has had a consequent effect on the revenue of the richest shrine in the country which has seen a substantial drop in the offerings by devotees in Hundi (a cash chest adjacent to the main temple, where devotees drop money).“In the last one month, the collections from the Hundi was just Rs 15.80 crore. This is not even equal to the five day’s collections during the normal days. On an average, the temple used to get Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 4 crore a day during the normal days and during festival days, it used to exceed Rs 5-6 crore a day,” the TTD official said.In fact, in its annual budget for 2020-21 presented in February this year, the TTD had projected an expected revenue of Rs 1,351 crore in the form of cash offerings by the devotees. The total revenue projected in the budget for the year was Rs 3,310 crore.“The hundi collections in April and May were absolutely nil and were partial in March and June. If the Covid-19 situation continues like this for a few more months, the TTD revenues will be abysmally low,” the official said.Andhra Pradesh endowment minister Vellampalli Srinivas who had the darshan of Lord Venkateshwara on Friday, said the TTD had been adopting a cautious approach in allowing pilgrims in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. “In fact, even pilgrims are cautious. Although 12,000 tickets were issued for darshan every day, only 10,000 were opting for darshan,” he said.The minister praised the temple authorities for the arrangements made to curb the spread of coronavirus infection, saying that fool-proof arrangements had been made at Tirumala for safe darshan of the Lord, as per the guidelines of the central government and the state government.“Masks and social distancing of two meters was made mandatory for all pilgrims coming for the darshan. All the crucial locations of the temple, including queue lines, guest houses and dining hall were being regularly sanitised,” he said.TTD trust board chairman Y V Subba Reddy said so far, there had been no complaints from the pilgrims with regard to darshan and other arrangements and there were no instances of any pilgrim with Covid-19 symptoms coming to Tirumala, because of stringent screening everywhere.“Around 70 people in Tirumala tested positive, but none of them is a devotee. Majority of those who tested positive were security persons and other temple staff, who were immediately shifted to hospitals so that the virus does not spread to the pilgrims. All of them are healthy and recovering,” Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirumala-temple-records-sharp-drop-in-footfall-revenues-due-to-covid-19/story-x9sl0wr3ZePZirqMkPcZsO.html

Based on severity of symptoms, Covid-19 can be categorised into three groups: mild, moderate and severe. “For moderate and severe cases, adequate oxygen support, appropriate and timely administration of anticoagulants and widely available and inexpensive corticosteroids, in accordance with the protocol, can be considered to be the mainstay of Covid-19 therapy. For mild cases, which are nearly 80% of the total cases, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been recommended. The standard of care treatment strategies have shown to yield positive results,” the Health ministry said in a statement.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.It also said the pursuit of an effective treatment for Covid-19 has also resulted in repurposing of several drugs which are not a part of the main Clinical Management Protocol but have been indicated as “investigational therapies”. The ministry said these drugs can be used in specific sub-groups of patients on the basis of informed and shared decision making with the patient before prescribing these drugs. “These drugs have still not been approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and are only permitted for restricted emergency use for Covid-19. The States as well as the Medical College hospitals designated as Centres of Excellence were reminded by ICMR and AIIMS that their indiscriminate use or use in conditions for which they are not desirable, may cause more harm than good.” The states were also told that the available evidence for Remdesivir suggests that it may decrease the time for clinical improvement when used in moderate to severe cases. “However, there have been no benefits in terms of reduced mortality. It has to be used with extreme caution due to its potential for serious adverse effects including liver and kidney injury. Similarly, for Tocilizumab studies have not shown any benefits in mortality reduction,” the ministry said.It also warned against rampant use of the drug. “However, If used for patients with severe conditions, proper informed consent is required. Rampant use is to be discouraged since the effect of the drug is directed at the cykotine storm,” the health ministry said.All the ‘investigational therapies’ are required to be carried out only in proper health care facilities where close monitoring of patients is possible so that potential complications can be managed. During the video conference, the ICMR also stressed on high quality supportive care, including mental health counselling for patients and families, management of pre-existing illness and palliation of symptoms||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-support-anti-coagulants-steroids-mainstay-of-covid-19-therapy-says-govt/story-gyj4gvlz3QuaKMWvZPCoIN.html

Earlier, the bank authorities had refused to disburse fresh loans, as they were seeking to recover interests accrued on loans, which were waived off by the Maharashtra government under the Mahatma Phule Karj Mukti Yojana.The move has come as a major relief for thousands of farmers in Maharashtra, who were fearing of being deprived of the fresh loan benefits amid the Kharif season that started from June.The bank had disbursed the loans between January 1 and October 1, 2019.The two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices SV Gangapurwala and RG Avachat, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Kishore Tangade, a farmer, through senior advocate SB Talekar, was informed that the Kharif season has started amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak that has battered the economy, including the agriculture sector.Talekar submitted before the court that many farmers were eligible for a loan, but only 49.62% got the money after they paid interests on their outstanding dues. The bench was informed that the bank was insistent on recovering interests on loans after October 1, 2019, and only those, who have settled their outstanding dues by selling their gold ornaments are eligible for a fresh loan.Talekar submitted that though the state government under Section 79A of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, had directed the bank to disburse loans to eligible farmers on January 17, the lending institution did not comply with the order.The bank’s move has denied many farmers sowing activities for the Kharif season and they are staring at massive financial losses amid the viral outbreak.Government pleader DR Kale reiterated the petitioners’ submissions and reminded the court that the bank is bound to comply with the state government’s January 17 order. However, RS Deshmukh, who represented the bank, stated that compliance of the government order would lead to acute financial losses.The court observed that the bank must comply with the state government’s order and sought a compliance report.The court will hear the PIL next on July 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-directs-aurangabad-district-central-cooperative-bank-to-disburse-loans-to-farmers/story-bITzWfB7KrEPJtgvYb4HJO.html

Election Commission is competent enough to take a decision,” he was quoted as saying in reference to Chirag Paswan’s advocacy of deferment of polls due to the coronavirus pandemic.709 fresh Covid-19 cases take Bihar’s infection tally past 15,000-markOn Friday, LJP president Chirag Paswan had said he was not in favour of impending elections in Bihar as it could pose a serious risk to a large population and also put additional burden on the exchequer. He said that the election commission should take a decision while keeping these facts in mind. He, however, added that his party was readying for the polls. His comments followed a meeting of the party’s parliamentary board held in Delhi on Thursday.“However, due to the pandemic, the common man as well as the Central and state governments are financially strained. Under these circumstances, elections will put additional burden. All the parliamentary board members also expressed concerns over it,” he had tweeted.LJP’s deferment suggestion had come close on the heels of a similar demand made by the leading opposition party, RJD. Leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Yadav had last week accused the Nitish Kumar led NDA government of caring little about the plight of people during the pandemic and focusing more on preparations for assembly elections. He had demanded that the elections be postponed.Also Read: Time to fight Covid-19, not polls: Prashant Kishor to Bihar CM Nitish KumarBJP had yesterday reacted to Chirag Paswan and said that the election commission was capable of holding free and fair elections while ensuring all necessary precautions are observed on ground to prevent further spread of the contagion. Sanjay Paswan, however, went ahead and attacked LJP leader and a Dalit icon Ram Vilas Paswan.“It seems it is part of the strategy and tactics of Ram Vilas ji to remain in power.

As a part of our “boycott Chinese campaign” which began on June 10, 2020, under our mission statement Bhartiya Saamaan-Hamara Abhimaan, we request you to please not allow Chinese state owned CRRC Corporation to participate in global tenders for semi-high speed indigenous Train 18 project of Indian Railways. The total worth of the project is more than Rs 1500 crore for 44 Vande Bharat Express Trains,” CAIT said in its letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times.ALSO READ | China-India joint venture only foreign bidder for Vande Bharat train setsThe JV was established jointly by China-based CRRC Yongji Electric Co. Ltd and Gurugram-based Pioneer Fil-med Private Limited in 2015.The other five bidders include: state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Bharat Industries, Sangrur, Electrowaves Electronics (P) Ltd, MEDHA Servo Drives Private Limited, and Powernetics Equipment India Private Limited.Indian railways’ Integral Coach Factory, Chennai had floated a tender for manufacturing 44 rakes or train sets of semi-high speed Vande Bharat trains on July 10.This comes at a time when India and China are involved in a tense border stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. A brutal brawl in Galwan Valley on June 15 led to 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers being killed. India has also decided to ban 59 apps, mostly having Chinese links.Railways has also scrapped a tender for thermal cameras meant for ‘Covid-19 surveillance’ after Indian firms alleged that the tender specifications favoured a Chinese company, Hindustan Times reported on July 1.The traders’ body had last month also requested the commerce minister to make it mandatory for e-commerce companies in India such as Amazon, Flipkart to mentions the country of origin with each product sold on their platforms.“We further wish to state that this initiative of the Government is a part of ‘Make in India’ call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and as such considering the above fact and the current critical period, it will be most appropriate not to consider the said Chinese Company and rather emphasis should be laid more on Indian Companies who have been shortlisted for this project,” the letter added.The ambitious ‘Make in India’ project involves manufacturing of for 44 train sets of 16 coaches each of Vande Bharat Trains.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had flagged off the maiden run of the Vande Bharat train on the New Delhi -Varanasi route on February 15, 2019. The second such train set service between New Delhi and Shri Mata Vaishnodevi Katra was flagged off by home minister Amit Shah on October 3, 2019.The Railway ministry on Wednesday also began the formal process to allow a private company to run trains on 109 routes -- a process that aims to, for the first time, open up one of the government’s most prominent enterprises that has in recent decades been outpaced by the demands of a rapidly growing economy.On whether Chinese firms will be allowed to bid for the private trains, railway board chairman VK Yadav had last week said, “As far as the question on Chinese companies arises, there are guidelines under the Make in India Policy by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and we will follow them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traders-body-urges-centre-to-scrap-chinese-jv-bid-for-vande-bharat-trains/story-C8mFIl0bRLDEU9rd3oGuiK.html

The quake flattened large parts of the capital Kathmandu.According to an article in Livemint, the quake was strong enough to shift Kathmandu south by 1.5m, wasn’t a big earthquake like the ones that measure over Mw8. It did, however, set the ground conditions that make a far larger earthquake, a “big one”, more favourable.Seismologists are not sure when the “big one” will come. It could happen anytime soon or in a few hundred years. But they insist that will, sooner rather than later for which the country has to be ready.The 2015 Nepal earthquake was caused by the ongoing tectonic collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate. The three main fault lines in the Himalaya gather massive strain due to the tectonic movements.Unfortunately for human population, earthquakes are the most effective way of releasing this strain and stress. It would take the really big, infrequent earthquakes of Mw8 and above, the so-called “crack” ruptures to relieve the strain that has built up.Roger Bilham, a geological scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (Cires), University of Colorado Boulder, wrote in a review paper that over the past 500 years, there haven’t been enough big earthquakes (Mw8 and above) to ease the accumulated strain in large sections of the Himalayan arc. In 100 years, the accumulated strain would need an Mw8.6 earthquake for release. In 350 years, a Mw9 earthquake would be required.India’s most recent major earthquake was in Kashmir in 2005 (Mw7.6) that killed 86,000 people on both sides of the Line of Control.Seismologists are increasingly certain that major earthquakes in the Himalayas over the past 100 years have only loaded greater strain where they occurred, making a big earthquake even more “necessary” to relieve the elastic strain built up in the faults but they are not sure where the next major quake will hit .Earthquakes remain largely a blind spot in India’s planning for disaster resilience.In September 2019, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) published an Earthquake Disaster Risk Index (Edri) report that looked specifically at 50 cities including the metros and cities in seismic zones IV and V (the two most active regions in India). Of the cities surveyed, 30 cities (including Delhi) are at medium-level risk and 13 (mostly Himalayan cities, including Shimla) at high risk.Delhi also faces a major risk given that most of the city is self-constructed, without technical inputs that makes it vulnerable to high-intensity tremors.In June, the Delhi high court came down heavily on the Delhi government and civic bodies for non-implementation of action plan for ensuring seismic stability of buildings in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seismologists-warn-big-himalayan-earthquake-is-overdue-delhi-shimla-unprepared/story-Kt49Y0e7pMyW2SIOqBpQeJ.html
11-07-2020||India||Meet the Covid-19 hero who sold one of her four goats to feed the hungry||Rani and her husband Shankar used to think of themselves as the parents of two children and four goats.He spent his days plying a taxi; she spent hers caring for the house and family. Then an accident left him out of a job, a good deed reduced their family by one goat, and in a twist of fate, that good deed resulted in Rani finding a full-time job herself.At the beginning of the lockdown, Rani, 28, was on her way to buy groceries at the market near their home Carmelaram, on the outskirts of Bengaluru, when she came upon a group of children sucking on the leaves of some eucalyptus trees.Their parents were huddled by the side of the street, out of work and out of money. “I could not bear the sight,” Rani says. “I remembered the state of my own children when my husband was in hospital. I just thought, no child should be faced with such a thing.”Even though her family had no steady income, she decided to do something. She started by speaking to the people by the side of the road. She found out they were migrant labourers from North Karnataka who had been working at a construction site for about a year. They were 43 adults and 22 children with now no income, shelter or food.“I’ll bring you food,” she told them.She went home and spoke to her husband; she wanted to sell one of their goats.“They are actually my husband’s goats — he had bought them in Chennai soon after our son was born. When I asked him, he said, you do what you think is right,” Rani says, proudly.The next day, the goat was sold to a local butcher for Rs 20,000. With that money, Rani rented large utensils from a wedding caterer, roped in a few neighbours and began cooking vegetable pulao and tomato bhaat on alternate days. For a week, she delivered the meals twice a day to the 65 migrants. She also took them biscuits each morning, for breakfast.When she ran out of money, she set out to sell a second goat. “By then the lockdown had come into full effect. The butcher had no customers so he had shut his shop. He couldn’t buy our goat.”She didn’t want to give up, so she began to ask everyone she knew — do you know a way I can continue feeding my people?A friend put her in touch with World Hunger Warriors. This was an initiative set up by events management CEO Kiran Soans at the beginning of the lockdown, to connect people who wanted to contribute funds, food, equipment and time with migrant workers and slumdwellers who could no longer feed themselves.The WHW team visited Rani and met the people she’d been cooking for and, in addition to directing resources their way, they hired Rani as local coordinator at a fixed salary. “Rani inspired me,” says Soans. “When I found out that she had sold one of her goats, I was determined to take her on.”The Shankars now gets free groceries via WHW too. “They also gave us a laptop, so that our four-year-old daughter can do her online classes,” Rani says. (Her son is two and not in school yet).Rani is now involved in identifying communities that WHW can help, ensuring the food gets where it’s supposed to go, and providing temporary shelter to people living on the streets before they can be directed to the local distress home run by the municipal corporation.“This work was meant for me,” she says, taking a deep breath. “I love working in the field and working with people. I feel satisfied with my life after I started working here.”And when she heads out every day, after her daughter’s checked that she has her mask and sanitiser, she and her husband smile at how their family has grown — it’s two kids, three goats and so much more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-the-covid-19-hero-who-sold-one-of-her-four-goats-to-feed-the-hungry/story-cbf3HqdhbvzLYR8Gu5vowO.html

There have been movements of terrorists towards the Indian side.Pakistan’s BAT consists of its army commandos and terrorists belonging to various terror outfits like Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Tayyaba etc. BAT has started targeting civilians as well.In January, the group killed a civilian identified as Mohammad Aslam whose headless and mutilated body was found near the LoC in Poonch district.“There was no such input over the past few weeks but after the input which has come hours back, forces have been alerted, especially in two sectors. Patrolling has been enhanced and there will be extra deployments during the night. Any misadventures of Pakistan will be responded effectively,” a senior BSF official told ANI.“During this season, BAT facilitates terrorists to infiltrate into India. After getting them trained at various known locations, BAT and other Pakistani agencies send them near the border and when they fail in multiple attempts, they plan action with these terrorists to facilitate them,” a senior government official said.Last week, the Indian Army on the basis of specific intelligence inputs from Jammu and Kashmir Police, in a joint operation, eliminated a terrorist close to the LoC in Keri area of Bhimber Gali sector in Jammu division’s Rajouri district.Earlier today, two terrorists were killed in an ambush by the Indian Army at Nougam sector in north Kashmir along the LoC. The Army recovered arms and ammunition, along with Pakistani currency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intel-warning-on-terrorists-action-with-pak-help-in-j-k-security-forces-on-alert-report/story-l9tY0RQuhR7r4OeVSdsPRK.html

While the number of coronavirus cases across India has crossed 8 lakh, the positive news is that more and more people are beating the deadly contagion across the country. So far, 515,385 people have recovered from Covid-19 across India. The number of people suffering from Covid-19 across India stands at 283,407 - this translates to ‘active’ cases excluding recovered patients and fatalities. Over 22,000 people died from the virus in the country. The government said that a series of pro-active, pre-emptive and coordinated measures have been taken by the Centre and various state governments to contain and prevent the spread of Covid-19. Also read: Delhi govt cancels all state university exams amid Covid-19 crisis“Coupled with effective implementation of containment zones, surveillance activities, timely diagnosis and effective clinical management of Covid-19 cases, the cumulative total number of recovered cases among Covid-19 patients has crossed the 5 lakh mark today,” the release read. The recovered cases of coronavirus outnumber the Covid-19 active cases by 2,31,978. “With this progressively widening gap, the recovery rate has further improved to 62.78%.

11-07-2020||India||Indian economy showing signs of returning to normalcy: RBI Governor||The Indian economy has started showing signs of returning to normalcy in response to the staggered easing of lockdown restrictions, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Saturday. He further said the need of the hour is to restore confidence, preserve financial stability, revive growth and recover stronger. “The Indian economy has started showing signs of getting back to normalcy in response to the staggered easing of restrictions,” Das said at the 7th SBI Banking and Economics Conclave. Indian companies and industries respond better in a crisis, he noted.   Das, however, said it is still uncertain when supply chains will be restored fully, how long it will take for demand conditions to normalise, and what kind of durable effects the pandemic will leave behind on potential growth. According to him, targeted and comprehensive reform measures already announced by the government should help in supporting growth.   Possibly in a vastly different post-Covid global environment, reallocation of factors of production within the economy and innovative ways of expanding economic activity could lead to some rebalancing and emergence of new growth drivers, Das added. The central bank, he said, strives to maintain the balance between preserving financial stability, maintaining banking system soundness and sustaining economic activity.   “Post containment of Covid-19, a very careful trajectory has to be followed in orderly unwinding of counter-cyclical regulatory measures,” he said. The financial sector should return to normal functioning without relying on the regulatory relaxations as the new norm, he added. He said the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has reduced policy rates by 250 basis points since February 2019 to support growth. The conventional and unconventional monetary policy and liquidity measures by RBI have been aimed at restoring market confidence, alleviating liquidity stress, easing financial conditions, unfreezing credit markets and augmenting the flow of financial resources to those in need for productive purposes, he said.           “The broader objective was to mitigate risks to the growth outlook while preserving financial stability,” he added. Das said despite the substantial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country’s financial system, including all the payment systems and financial markets, are functioning without any hindrance. “RBI is making continuous assessment of the changing trajectory of financial stability risks and upgrading its own supervisory framework to ensure that financial stability is preserved,” he said. Banks and financial intermediaries have to be ever vigilant and substantially upgrade their capabilities with respect to governance, assurance functions and risk culture, Das noted. The Governor also said banks will have to improve their governance, sharpen their risk management and raise capital in an anticipatory basis instead of waiting for a situation to arise. He said as the lockdown has obstructed RBI’s on-site supervision to an extent, the central bank is further enhancing its off-site surveillance mechanism. The objective of the off-site surveillance system would be to ‘smell the distress’, if any, and be able to initiate pre-emptive actions, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-economy-showing-signs-of-returning-to-normalcy-rbi-governor/story-lhHKr52UJMXJadzjEX98mN.html

Rapid antigen tests will be conducted exclusively on security personnel, including those from the Army and the paramilitary forces, at the Rangpo border check-post from Saturday onwards, he said. The Rangpo check-post along the Sikkim-West Bengal border is one of the major entry points to the Himalayan state. “Those testing positive for Covid-19 during the rapid antigen tests will not be allowed to enter Sikkim and will be sent back to quarantine centres from where they came,” said Director General-cum-Secretary of the Health Department, Dr Pemba T Bhutia. The measure comes after more than three dozen security personnel posted in the Himalayan state, bordering China, tested positive for Covid-19. Earlier, thermal screening was conducted on everyone including security personnel entering the state through the border check-posts. The rapid antigen tests, that give results faster, will be conducted for free for the first 15 days, he said. Meanwhile, eight more people have recovered from Covid-19 in the state, the official said. Of the 121 Covid-19 cases in the state, 41 are active and 13 patients (Army personnel) have migrated to neighbouring West Bengal, while the remaining people have been cured of the disease, he added. Sikkim had reported its first Covid-19 case on May 23 after residents started returning to the Himalayan state from other parts of the country. The number of cases has been rising since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-personnel-testing-covid-positive-won-t-be-allowed-to-enter-sikkim-state-govt/story-vuF5KElkAkYkLKQ9sxdx4O.html

PM Modi’s intervention was made during a high-level meeting he chaired on Saturday to review the status of the coronavirus pandemic situation in India.PM Modi is also reported to have praised the authorities for their coordinated efforts to contain the pandemic in Delhi and asked for the adoption of a similar approach in the national capital region (NCR) comprising several districts of UP, Rajasthan and Haryana adjoining the national capital.“PM appreciated the concerted efforts of the Centre, State & local authorities in containing the pandemic in Delhi. He further directed that a similar approach should be adopted with other State Governments in containing Covid19 in the entire NCR area,” an official communication by the PMO said.Watch | PM Modi lauds Delhi’s approach during review meet for Covid preparedness With record 27,114 new Covid-19 cases in a day, India’s tally tops 8.20 lakhThe review meeting was also attended by union home minister Amit Shah, union health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, member, NITI Aayog, cabinet secretary and other senior officials of the government of India. While taking stock of the situation in various parts of the country, the prime minister directed for a renewed emphasis on the need to observe personal hygiene and social discipline in public places. This he indicated should be done through renewal of awareness campaigns about Covid and methods to prevent its spread. He said that there is no room for any complacency in this regard. During the meeting, the Ahmedabad model of home-based care through ‘Dhanvantri Rath’ and surveillance was picked up for special commendation for its success in containment of the disease and it was directed that it may be emulated in other places. The review meeting came on a day when India’s Covid-19 tally went past the eight-lakh mark with a record single-day increase of 27,114 cases. The rapid rise in cases can be gauged from the fact that it took just four days to record one lakh new cases after the seven-lakh mark.Also Read: Share ‘inspiring anecdotes’ that have changed lives: PM Modi calls for ideas for July’s Mann Ki BaatThe total coronavirus caseload in the country now stands at 8,20,916 including the death toll of 22,123.

The surrender figures convey this trend. Last year and this year to date, 13 and 19 Maoist rebels have surrendered, respectively,” said DGP Abhay, days after five Naxals, including a state committee member, who carried a reward of Rs 20 lakh on his head, were gunned down.Kosa Sodi alias Sukru, a member of Odisha State Committee of the CPI (Maoist), was killed in an encounter with police in the dense forests of Kandhamal district last Sunday.Nayagarh, one of the five districts that may lose its LWE-hit district tag soon, hit the headlines in 2008, when Maoists had carried out their biggest-ever arms heist from the district police armoury. The rebels had looted hundreds of automatic rifles and magazines in a bid to boost their firepower.By the turn of the new millennium, the Maoist dominance started gathering momentum. And, the rebels held sway in the state’s 22 out of 30 districts by 2010. The internal rebellion intensified until 2015, when Odisha reported an unprecedented level of violence and loss of lives and property, as the Maoists targeted government installations and security forces with impunity.Abhay said the situation in Swabhiman Anchal area of Malkangiri district, considered to be the hotbed for LWE activities, has improved significantly over the past few years.Two police camps have been set up at Hantalguda and Darlaguda. Besides, a new police station has been set up at Jodaamba, the DGP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-asks-mha-to-remove-5-maoist-affected-districts-from-sre-list/story-wMCFP0uusgdEYKYF85ww4J.html

Dharavi is spread over an area of 2.5 square kilometres and has a population of about 8,00,000. People live in shanties and dilapidated buildings with narrow lanes and open sewers.2. The first Covid-19 case in Dharavi was reported on April 1, nearly three weeks after Mumbai recorded its maiden positive case on March 11.3. The government had launched an intensive screening and sanitization drive to prevent Covid-19 cases going out of hand in Dharavi. 4. Dharavi reported 12 new coronavirus cases on Friday, after recording one, three and nine new cases on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. 5. On June 9, the tally of the coronavirus cases in Dharavi, reached 2,347 after nine new infections were detected.6. Throughout June, Dharavi recorded an average of 18 new cases daily, with the highest single-day spike in recorded cases on June 1 (34 new cases). The number of new cases have declined in July.7. Dharavi has only 166 active Covid-19 cases, while 1,815 patients have recovered and have been discharged. Over 200 have died of the virus in Dharavi.8. Over six lakh of an approximate population of eight lakh residents in Dharavi have been screened till now.9. While Dharavi’s Covid-19 tally has come down, the count in Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtar continues to rise.10. On Saturday, India’s Covid-19 tally reached 8.2 lakh with 27,114 new cases with 22,123 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dharavi-fights-back-against-covid-19-pandemic/story-urAKUDtXmyIApSUzzaM9gJ.html

Preliminary investigation did not find any suicide note, but her parents maintained that she used to often talk about the recent suicidal deaths of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh and a popular minor Tik Tok star (16) from Gurugram, said police. Ajay Rawat, senior sub-inspector (S-I), who is one of the investigators in the suicide case, said, “The deceased had appeared for her Grade XII Board examinations this year. She used to live with her parents and two elder brothers. Her father is a trader.”“She was found dead in her room on Friday morning,” Rawat added.She was rushed to a nearby hospital, but doctors declared her brought dead on arrival. Soon, the police reached the spot and started the investigation.“Her family members insisted that there was no apparent reason for her to commit suicide. However, she was frequently talking about the suicidal deaths of Rajput and the popular minor Tik Tok star for the past 10-12 days,” Rawat said. Though her father used to tell her that she shouldn’t “think much about such incidents, but never thought she would take a similar step”.A probe is on, the senior S-I added.If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

Pawar, in an interview to the Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana, insisted there is no difference of opinion between him and Uddhav Thackeray over the way the government brought in the relaxations during the lockdown. This is the first time Saamana has interviewed a leader from some other party.In the interview to Saamana’s executive editor and Sena MP Sanjay Raut, Pawar said he came to a conclusion that curbs should be gradually lifted to revive the economy after discussions with several people and brought it to the notice of the chief minister. The Maharashtra government under its Mission Begin Again started relaxing lockdown norms from June and there were speculations that Thackeray was earlier unwilling to open up the state but Pawar intervened to get the curbs eased across the state.Raut asked if there were any differences on lifting the lockdown referring to newspaper reports about them and Pawar refuted them.“Absolutely not... During this entire situation, I have been in touch with the chief minister and am even today... During this time, I had discussions with labour bodies, business-owners etc. I formed an opinion based on that and brought it to the notice of the CM,” Pawar said. “This is not called a difference of opinion. Delhi and Karnataka lifted relaxation, it faced issues but economic activities started again. Such steps have to be taken. If the entire state’s and the country’s economy is disrupted then the ill-effects will be far greater than coronavirus which the future generations will suffer,” he said.Pawar said though some might think Thackeray delayed giving relaxations but they came at the right time. “The decision that came was true to the nature of the chief minister. Meaning, a decision should be taken but with caution. To take a step by seeing all sides, so that there is no need to go back on it,” he said.In the first of the three-part interview published in Saamana, Pawar spoke also about the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the changing nature of political activities after the coronavirus pandemic, his relationship with former Sena chief Bal Thackeray among other issues. The Maratha strongman denied that he is either the “remote control” or the “headmaster” of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government amid a buzz that Pawar has been directing Thackeray from behind the curtains and running the government.“I am neither. If headmaster, he’d have been part of the school. In a democracy, governments or administration do not function with remote control. It functions where there is no democracy,” he said giving an example of the political scenario in Russia.The veteran leader denied that the alliance between the three parties—the Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress—to form the government was an “accident”. Pawar pointed out that in the Lok Sabha elections last year there was no change but before the state assembly polls the people had decided to bring one.He said Sena’s voters and supporters were uneasy during the BJP-Sena government between 2014 and 2019. He said the Sena paid a heavy price for its association with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“The BJP continuously took the stand to sideline Sena, keep it quiet. The Sena supporters were uneasy because of it. They functioned as if it was only a BJP government. Earlier too there was a Sena-BJP government under Manohar Joshi but the atmosphere was not like this then. The BJP sidelined the Sena and functioned as only they are the rulers. This did not go well with the people of Maharashtra,” he said.Without naming former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Pawar said, “No political leader should take the people for granted saying ‘I will come back again’.” He added the Sena had a major contribution in the BJP’s assembly tally of 105 seats. “Had it not been for the Shiv Sena, that number would have been around 40-50.”Pawar also claimed that Bal Thackeray did not have the functioning style and ideology similar to the BJP. “The functioning style of Balasaheb, whom I have known, was different than the ideology of the BJP. He respected the leaders including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani, Pramod Mahajan,” he said.“Through respect, the idea of forming government came forward. Secondly, the Shiv Sena had struggles with the Congress but it was never permanent, I think. Shiv Sena was never at loggerheads with the Congress,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-no-remote-control-no-differences-with-uddhav-thackeray-over-lockdown-sharad-pawar-to-sena-mouthpiece/story-7s9n2YmP85i3gR6aW3FS6K.html

One of the two terrorists has been identified as 23-year-old Idrees Ahmad Bhat, a local from Kupwara’s Handwara area who had gone to Pakistan via Wagah border in 2018. “We believe the two are part of terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba ,” a senior police officer said. The second man, unidentified so far, is suspected to be a foreign terrorist.Besides AK 47 assault rifles and hundreds of bullets, the terrorists killed on Saturday also had a pistol made in China and four grenades based on Austrian technology that had been made by Pakistan’s ordnance factory. The grenades are concrete evidence that links the terrorists to the Pakistan army and government, said a top J&K police officer.Also Read: Terror launch pads across LoC full, says top army commander in KashmirSimilar grenades were also used by Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists who stormed Parliament in 2001. The 480-gram anti-personnel grenade is filled with 95 gram of highly explosive organic compound PETN and 5,000 steel balls, designed to kill or maim everyone in a 20-metre radius.In the Saturday morning encounter with the army’s Sikh Light Infantry soldiers deployed on the anti-infiltration grid, the two terrorists were shot before they could come down to using them.A senior police officer said the soldiers had spotted the two terrorists moving from an area close to a Pakistani Post across Nowgam sector in Kupwara district. They had cut the fence to cross the LoC and were stopped by the soldiers about 50-100 metres later. Major General Virendra Vats, GOC 19 division, said the soldiers took appropriate response to eliminate the terrorists trying to infiltrate by cutting the anti-infiltration fence.Top counter-terror officers said the infiltration attempt came at a time the security grid was on high alert over intelligence inputs that terror groups sponsored by Pakistan’s ISI (Inter Services Intelligence) could use load-carrying Chinese commercial drones - like the ones used to smuggle weapons and drugs into Punjab - to ferry firearms and explosives to its terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.The army is working to deploy anti-drone systems to shoot down such drones in sensitive systems.Officials said security agencies had been able to prevent the Pakistan-based terror groups from carrying out most of the deadliest terror strikes through the summer, the first after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5-6 last year.Given that much of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s pitch against India is centered around Kashmir’s scrapped special status, a senior police officer said it was but natural that Islamabad and Rawalpindi would like to see terror strikes that help Imran Khan put the focus on the situation in the Kashmir valley.Pakistan’s foreign ministry and its leadership routinely attacks India for killing terrorists in encounters, describing them as innocent Kashmiris. According to the Indian security establishment, a large number of terrorists killed in Kashmir this year are Pakistani nationals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-terrorists-shot-dead-100-metres-from-loc-leave-behind-proof-of-pak-role/story-EdWZgU1oO0NOTg3yBnQW1H.html

The response we received has now inspired us to create a range of Corona warrior rakhis with the tricolour, red cross, swachhata spectacles and other such motifs particular to different departments and clubs,” Uma Devi, the trainer of these women, said.Around 100 women are engaged in making the cow dung and seed rakhis, out of which 10 carve out the moulds and the rest then paint them. The other group creates the bamboo and thread bases to rest these seeds on. Once done, they package them in in-house handmade paper bags or cloth bags.The idea for seed embedded cow dung rakhis came from Durgesh Nandini and Manju Chandrakar.“In rural areas, people are closely connected with cow dung in their daily routine. Using this is considered a good omen to start festivities. Using them for seed balls is a new twist and opens a whole lot of possibilities for modern variations to this widely available local resource,” Chandrakar said.She said the prices of these rakhis vary from Rs 40 to Rs 100 depending on the bamboo base used. Made as a salute to frontline workers, the tricolour, red cross and swachhata rakhis are available for Rs 20 along with courier charges.“If we hit our sales target, about which we are optimistic, each woman will take home Rs 10,000 for a month’s work,” Devi said.Namrata Gandhi, the chief executive officer of Zila Panchayat, said people’s response to these rakhis has been encouraging.Gandhi said they had started training the women with the support from Arya Prerna Samiti before the coronavirus pandemic broke. She said the energy and ideas of the women inspired them to create around 15,000 rakhis.“There was a lag due to the Covid lockdown. But the women remained eager to get on with the work. With due precautions, we restarted work at our multi-utility centres. Keeping in mind the upcoming Rakhi festival, these women decided to make rakhis,” said Gandhi.“The public response to this initiative has been very encouraging. Local NGOs have come forward to help market these swadeshi rakhis. We have also trained women to sell them so that in the future it’s an added skill for them. Our next target is to create a range of ethnic lifestyle products with a modern twist,” Gandhi added.Raksha Bandhan, a festival of the bond between brothers and sisters, will be celebrated on August 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chattisgarh-women-make-cow-dung-rakhis-add-corona-warrior-motifs/story-mDsnRcChoGbmtLSTRqwdfO.html

If we have to guess, it could be anything between 250-300 terrorists presently occupying the launch pads,” Major General Virendra Vats GOC 19 Infantry Division, Baramulla, said according to ANI.General Vats’ comment came shortly after army troopers killed two terrorists who tried to infiltrate the Line of Control (LoC) in Naugam sector.The general said it launched its operation after detecting suspicious movement along the LoC. “Today, our troops along the LoC Naugam sector detected suspicious movement originating from Pakistani post in the area. Apt response was taken to eliminate two terrorists who were trying to infiltrate by cutting an anti-infiltration fence,” General Vats said.He said the army seized two AK-47 rifles, a pistol and ammunition after the gunfight.On June 30, Jammu and Kashmir’s Director General of Police, Dilbag Singh had said that Jammu and Kashmir’s anti-infiltration grid is intact despite active terror launch pads across the LoC and Pakistan trying to infiltrate terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terror-launch-pads-across-loc-full-says-top-army-commander-in-kashmir/story-IaZeSa3ldbq2DJTf6IywjM.html

The census has entered the Guinness Book of World Record. The fourth edition of the census, which was carried out between 2018-19, was “the most comprehensive to date, in terms of both resource and data amassed,” mentions the Guinness Book of World Record on its website.Environment minister Prakash Javadekar reacted to the feat and said that the aim is to double the numbers achieved four years before target.“Our census of tigers entered Guinness World Records because we have installed more cameras to monitor them as compared to other countries. Their population is nearly 70% of the world’s tiger population,” he told news agency ANI.  Our census of tigers entered Guinness World Records because we have installed more cameras to monitor them as compared to other countries. Their population is nearly 70% of world's tiger population. Resolve to double their numbers achieved 4 yrs before target: Min of Environment pic.twitter.com/ELO9K5KK9USince 2006, the government of India has been conducting the census every four years led by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) with cooperation from various state forest departments and conservation NGOs.The exercise aims at arriving at a nationwide assessment into the country’s population and habitat of tigers (Panthera tigris tigris). Also read: SC committee asks Assam to submit report on illegal construction in Kaziranga animal corridorThe latest survey was carried out in three phases, marked by an “unprecedented camera trap usage”. “Camera traps (outdoor photographic devices fitted with motion sensors that start recording when an animal passes by) were placed in 26,838 locations across 141 different sites and surveyed an effective area of 121,337 square kilometres (46,848 square miles),” the website noted. Around 34,858,623 photographs of wildlife (76,651 of which were tigers and 51,777 were leopards; the remainder were other native fauna) were captured during the survey from which 2,461 individual tigers (excluding cubs) were identified. The 2018 “Status of Tigers in India” assessment also conducted extensive foot surveys that covered 522,996 km (324,975 mi) of trails and sampled 317,958 habitat plots for vegetation and prey dung. It’s estimated that the total area of forest studied was 381,200 km2 (147,181 sq mi) and cumulatively the collection and review of data equated to some 620,795 labour-days.A positive outcome of the survey was that it concluded that India’s tiger population had increased by roughly one-third - from 2,226 in 2014 to 2,927 in 2018, though some have cautioned that this rise may in part reflect more comprehensive surveying as opposed to purely a population surge. Areas of improvement include better “corridors” between isolated pockets of tiger territory, reduced poaching and building up prey numbers through habitat restoration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/largest-ever-camera-trap-wildlife-survey-india-s-2018-tiger-census-sets-guinness-world-record/story-gRHiJKldML9LDF2ZPcaY8O.html

So, we assigned our designers to create masks, which the customer later bought. After this, we made a wide range of these masks as people will be requiring them in the coming days. Pure diamonds and American diamonds have been used with gold to make these masks,” Choksi told ANI.“Yellow gold has been used in the mask along with American diamonds and it costs 1.5 lakhs. Another mask which is made with white gold and real diamonds and it costs Rs 4 lakhs,” he added.The shop owner said the cloth material of these masks is in accordance with the government’s guidelines of manufacturing the protective gears.He said that diamonds and gold studded from these masks can be taken out as per the wish of customers and they can be used for making other jewellery items.A customer, Devanshi at the jewellery shop, said, “I came to the shop to buy jewellery as there is a family marriage. Then, I saw diamond masks which look more attractive to me than jewellery. So, I decided to buy it to match it with my dress.”Recently, a man named Shankar Kurade in Pune has bought himself a mask made of gold worth Rs 2.89 lakhs amid the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jewellery-shop-in-surat-selling-diamond-studded-masks-worth-lakhs/story-u5Hs5xFh9VY6GzA3scKxIN.html
11-07-2020||India||Bombay HC refuses bail to woman accused of supporting husband who allegedly raped two daughters||The Bombay high court last week rejected the bail plea of a woman accused of passively supporting her husband who allegedly raped two of their daughters and tried to sexually assault the third in Maharashtra’s Beed district.A single bench of Justice Vibha Kankanwadi took note that the entire story as was narrated by their daughters in the FIR was ‘consistent’ and ‘shocking’, and rejected the woman’s bail plea which claimed that the accusations against her were false. On April 2, 2020, Kaij police in Beed district had booked the man who is a headmaster of a school, along with his wife after the eldest daughter registered a complaint with the police after all the three sisters who were badly beaten up and locked in a room by the parents were rescued by police.On March 31, 2020, the man tried to molest his 20-year-old eldest daughter that led to all the three sisters raising a hue and cry. But the parents beat them up and locked them inside a room. The sisters, however, managed to communicate their condition to a friend who then informed the police which then rescued them on April 2.The eldest daughter then narrated her ordeal to the police officials and in her complaint stated that she was raped by her father in 2012. She told police officials that she was badly beaten up by her father after she informed her mother about the incident.The complainant further alleged that while her father kept molesting her intermittently, her father sexually had also assaulted her younger sister who is now 18-years-old since the time she was in fifth grade. All the three sisters were badly beaten up after the matter was reported to their mother and all of them were warned not to disclose the acts of their father to anyone.She further alleged that their father tried to rape their youngest sister, who is now 15-year-old, in 2018, and again their mother remained silent even after the incident was brought to her notice.Acting on the complaint lodged by the 20-year-old, the police on April 2 arrested the headmaster for rape, and his wife for abetment, for passively supporting her husband. The woman had moved the high court seeking bail claiming the complaint was false and that the 20-year-old had made wild allegations because she was reprimanded for moving around in bad company. “It is highly impossible that the mother would keep quiet when her husband was molesting their own daughter and would allow such activity to be continued for years together,” her lawyer had argued.The judge rejected the woman’s bail plea primarily noting that, “The entire story that has been narrated in the FIR, appears to be consistent with the statements of the sisters, in which serious allegations are levelled against her.”Justice Kankanwadi said the entire story was shocking and the defence put forth by the applicant mother appeared baseless. The judge felt that no daughter will go to the extent of making such serious allegations against her own parents simply because they were opposed to her relationship with a particular boy having bad antecedents. The judge also said that even if the complainant went to that extent, the other two sisters would not have supported her against their parents, if the allegations were false.The judge also took note of the allegation of the complainant that on the night of March 31, 2020, when they were at their native place, their father tried to molest her, and the next day when the sister raised a hue and cry, they were badly beaten by both their parents. The sisters were locked up in a room, and were rescued by police after they succeeded in contacting one of their friends, who in turn sought police help in freeing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-refuses-bail-to-woman-accused-of-supporting-husband-who-raped-two-daughters/story-kyyA2wOU9E8eEEz2zTKYLK.html

Maxwell is the daughter of the late British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell.Epstein was found hanged last Aug. 10 in jail at age 66, in a death ruled a suicide.He had before his arrest socialized over the years with many prominent people including Britain’s Prince Andrew, US President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton.Media crushMaxwell’s proposed bail package includes a $5 million bond, the surrender of her passports, “stringent” travel restrictions, and home detention with electronic monitoring.She said she will continue needing security guards to ensure her safety.Maxwell also maintained she is not a flight risk, claiming to have remained in the United States since Epstein’s arrest.She “did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable purpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online attention and its very real harms,” the filing said.Friday’s filing also raised several legal challenges to the indictment, including that Epstein’s 2007 nonprosecution agreement with the US government covered “any potential co-conspirators.”In seeking Maxwell’s continued detention, prosecutors called her an “extreme risk” of flight because of the possible long prison term, her wealth, her multiple passports and citizenships, and her having “absolutely no reason to stay.”The case is US v. Maxwell, US District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-cr-00330.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghislaine-maxwell-seeks-bail-citing-covid-19-and-denies-jeffrey-epstein-charges/story-1Nxw4dsfy4J1dmrw7rVYcJ.html

The former Congress president tweeted just one word and tagged a post from the Twitter handle of the Prime Minister’s Office.“Asatyagrahi!” Gandhi posted. असत्याग्रही! https://t.co/KL4aB5t149The word in Hindi means someone who practises the policy of untruth.Before Rahul Gandhi, the chief of the Congress’ Karnataka unit DK Shivakumar had sought clarification from the Union power minister over the government’s claim, saying that a 2,000MW solar plant already exists in Pavagada of Karnataka’s Tumakuru district.“BJP Central Govt is claiming today that it inaugurated Asia’s Largest Solar Plant of 750 MW at Rewa, MP. What then is the 2000 MW Solar Plant in Pavagada, Karnataka which was built in just 3 years by @INCKarnataka govt and has been operational since 2018?” Shivakumar asked in one of his tweets. “The unique thing about the 2000 MW Pavagada Mega Solar Park was that not a single acre of land was acquired from the farmers. All 13,000 acres have been leased from the farmers who are being given yearly rent. Karnataka model of Renewable Energy was accepted as the best in India,” he said in another post. The Pavagada solar park was developed by the Karnataka Solar Park Development Corporation Limited (KSPDCL), a joint venture between the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and the Karnataka Renewable Energy (KREDL).Earlier this year, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had tweeted about the “world’s largest solar park at Pavagada.”“India Takes Lead in Clean Energy: World’s largest solar park at Pavagada in Karnataka is now operational.

These are from other states and have no legal permission to enter the state. Many who have succeeded in sneaking into the state have been quarantined. So far, sixteen people hailing from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have been quarantined for fourteen days at Maheshwari ashram in Haridwar under police vigil.Also read: Eight-month-old tests positive for Covid-19 in Uttarakhand, state tally rises to 3,373To ensure total adherence of prohibition on entry of Kanwariyas in the state, the administration has started deploying police personnel at the interior and arterial routes on border areas.According to Shyampur station house officer Deepak Kathait, additional force has been deployed at sensitive border posts and entry points along the interior stretches of the district.“We are carrying out round the clock checking at various border posts for people on vehicles as well as on foot who try to sneak into the state. Many times, people resist but when we tell them that they can’t enter the state as Kanwar yatra has been cancelled, they agree to return, “said Kathait.Local intelligence unit personnel and villagers have brought to light how people from UP, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab are deceiving the police by skipping highway routes where checking is being done and are using narrow-temporary routes that pass through forest and riverbeds.Taking cognizance of this, the police administration has deployed additional security personnel at such rural arterial routes through which other state people were trying to reach Haridwar.The police have also deployed personnel at Sirchandi, Badedi, Hasanpur villages that lie on the border with Uttar Pradesh.The whole district has been bifurcated into 10 zones and 21 sectors to ensure better management and monitoring of security aspects till Kanwar yatra period ends. Superintendent of Police (city) Kamlesh Upadhyay has been appointed as Kanwar nodal officer for the period.“Police, along with PAC personnel, are monitoring the situation round the clock and carrying out checking drives to ensure no person enters the state illegally.

The lockdown kicked off from 10 pm on Friday and will remain in place till 5 am on Monday. The Yogi Adityanath government, however, described it as an imposition of curbs on certain activities to keep the spread of virus under check. Barring essential services, everything else is shut across the state till Monday 5 am. Sharpest spikeJust before the commencement of the lockdown, the state’s Covid-19 tally jumped to 33,700 on Friday with the highest single-day spike of 1,338 fresh infections. The previous highest single-day spike in fresh cases - 1,332 - was recorded on July 7.Strict action against violatorsThe government has decided to take a strict action against those who step out without face covers in public places. The administration has increased the penalty on violators from Rs 100 to Rs 500, additional chief secretary and principal secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad said on Friday. Sanitisation campaign amid lockdownMeanwhile, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has issued directives to officials concerned for the special cleanliness and sanitisation campaign which will begin today.In a video conference with all divisional commissioners, district magistrates and senior administrative and police officials on Friday, Adityanath said the campaign should be carried out on July 11 and 12 in all rural and urban areas, news agency PTI reported. What’s open, what’s notDuring the lockdown, medical and health services and essential services will continue as before. Petrol pumps and ‘dhabas’ (eateries usually present on the highways) would also be allowed to operate. Air and rail services will operate uninterrupted as before. Industrial units, which work continuously, would remain open in rural areas along with large construction works of expressways, bridges, roads and private projects. Essential services are allowed, so is the movement of essential service providers. All offices and markets in urban and rural areas will remain closed.

11-07-2020||India||Day after Vikas Dubey’s killing, 2 held for helping gang members||Uttar Pradesh police on Saturday arrested two more people from Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior in connection with the killings of eight policemen in Kanpur by gangster Vikas Dubey and his men on July 3, said officials.Vikas Dubey was shot dead on Friday morning after what the police have said was an escape attempt after a road accident near Kanpur city.They said the two Gwalior residents were arrested for harbouring two members of Vikas Dubey’s gang for more than four days before they moved to another hideout.JN Singh, additional director general (ADG) of police of Kanpur Zone, said the two men have been identified as Om Prakash Pandey and Anil Pandey.Singh said they allowed Shashi Kant Pandey alias Sonu and Shivam Dubey, accused in Kanpur cops’ killing case, to stay at their homes despite being well aware that the UP police are in their search.He said the two carry a reward of Rs 50,000 each for their head and are among the list of 21 active members of Vikas Dubey’s gang released earlier.The senior official said the two Gwalior residents have been booked under section 216 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for harbouring the accused in the case.Vikas Dubey and five of his gang members, including Atul Dubey, Amar Dubey, Prem Prakash Pandey, Praveen Pandey and Prabhat Mishra, have been killed between July 3 and 10 and three have been arrested while 12 others are still at large. Of those still on the run, Gopal Saini and Heeru Dubey carry a reward of Rs 1 lakh each, and the remaining 10 carry a reward of Rs 50,000 each.Besides, seven people, including former Chaubeypur station officer Vinay Tewari and sub-inspector KK Sharma, have been arrested for criminal conspiracy and harbouring Vikas Dubey’s gang members as well as helping them escape after the ambush.Vikas Dubey and his men had opened indiscriminate firing on the police team when they raided his house in Kanpur’s Bikru village. Devendra Mishra, the circle officer of Bilhaur, three sub-inspectors and four constables were killed while six others were injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-vikas-dubey-s-killing-2-held-for-helping-gang-members/story-jWS6rn52aYsGTTwqOynRAL.html
11-07-2020||India||NIA names IS operative in TN cop’s murder case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has filed a charge sheet naming an Islamic State operative from Tamil Nadu’s Cuddalore — Khaja Mohideen and five others in the killing of a police officer in Kanyakumari in January this year as part of Mohideen’s plan to revive Jehad, the agency said in a statement on Friday. Apart from 53-year-old Mohideen, those charge sheeted include Abdul Shameem and Y Thowfeek of Kanyakumari; Jaffar Ali (Cuddalore); Mahboob Pasha and Ejas Pasha of Bengaluru.NIA spokesperson DIG Sonia Narang said the charge sheet was filed in the murder of Wilson, Special Sub-Inspector (SSI) of Kaliyakkavilai police station, who was shot and stabbed to death on January 8 by Shameem and Thowfeek while the officer was on duty at Kaliyakkavilai market road check post. She added that the accused revealed their intention of creating terror in the minds of people as part of waging a violent jihad. The NIA took over the case on February 1 from the Tamil Nadu Police and during investigation, the roles of Mohideen, Mahboob, Ejas and Jaffer in the larger conspiracy were revealed and they were arraigned as accused. Narang said Mohideen, a member of the ISIS, had radicalised Shameem and Thowfeek on the jihadi (violent extremist) ideology since May 2019, and recruited them into his terrorist gang to carry out violent attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-names-is-operative-in-tn-cop-s-murder-case/story-cwz2nHEHgrO9TOKv4PJEHK.html
11-07-2020||India||Closed borders, few flights leave NRIs struggling||Not being able to leave home is one thing. Not being able to get there is another, especially for visiting non-resident Indians when the pandemic hit.As they waited out the lockdowns — the borders were shut on March 22 and the latest announcement, made on Friday, confirmed that they will remain shut until at least July 31 — they risk losing their jobs even as they continue to pay rent on homes that sit vacant overseas; and they remain separated from loved ones whom they may not see for some months more.Niklesh Sadarangani, 42, has been paying ~70,000 a month to rent a Singapore flat he and his wife Krishna Merchant, 35, haven’t used since December. That’s when they flew into India, a month before their first child was due. The idea was for Merchant, her mother and their baby to return to Singapore in March. Merchant would resume work as a journalist with a news agency and her mother would help with the baby while her husband established his car-polishing business in Mumbai and went back and forth.“On the one hand, I’m happy to have these months with my son. But my business hasn’t started. We’re also paying rent on a warehouse in Mumbai. It’s all adding up,” Sadarangani said.Plus, as NRIs, their tax structure is set to change if they don’t return to Singapore in the next 180 days or so. Meanwhile, the baby’s passport still hasn’t arrived, Covid-19 has disrupted his vaccination schedule, and the couple’s Singapore visas expire in October.“Because Singapore is not open to visitors, I will most likely not be able to take my mother with me whenever I do head back, so there will be no help with the baby,” Merchant said. “What worries me the most is the uncertainty and our complete inability to plan ahead.”A. Pereira, meanwhile, says that with every extension of the travel ban, his dream life slips a little further out of his grasp. The 33-year-old spent five years applying for hospitality positions in Canada. He finally got a job as a restaurant manager late last year, his visa was approved in mid-March.“My employers have been quite understanding so far. But it is utterly frustrating,” he said.The Vande Bharat flights that bring Indians stranded abroad back to the country, are also offering seats on their return journeys provided the country permits entry. However, lesser seats on account of social distancing norms and a low frequency means customers like Pereira have faced an uphill task booking a seat. “The flights are too few. The seats are all gone within an hour of bookings opening. I have just had no luck so far,” he said.In Bengaluru, Nidhi Agarwal, 33, a finance consultant, has been stuck in limbo since end-March. She flew in from Dubai with her son Shlok Dani, 3, for her parents’ 40th wedding anniversary. She now has no idea when she will get back. Her son’s schooling has become another source of worry.“For now, he will attend classes online, but we don’t know if we will even be back in Dubai when schools reopen in September,” she said. Alifya Tarawala, 25, a quantitative researcher flew from Dubai to Mumbai on March 13 to marry a business-development manager. Their wedding, scheduled for March 28 was brought forward to March 20 and their plans to return to Dubai were put on hold. The newlyweds are here with only what they packed for their wedding. “None of us even has a laptop,” Tarawala said. Two weeks ago, Tarawala was put on unpaid leave. It’s a blow for the couple, who is still paying rent on a home in Dubai that they have never used, and a car that’s been lying idle since March.The Tarawalas are among over 2,000 members of a Facebook group called UAE Residents In India, who are now collectively pushing for a way back. The page, created by 27-year-old Dubai resident Mohit Mulchandani, is hoping to get the Indian government to allow carriers other than Air India to offer flights.“We’re writing to the Prime Minister’s Office; we’re filing RTIs, but the responses so far have offered nothing concrete,” Mulchandani, who has been stuck here since March 9, said. “My finances are being depleted. My office has been supportive thus far but we don’t know for how long.”Tarawala said that being able to turn to others in the same situation has helped keep her sane. “I’m bonding with my mother-in-law, so that’s a plus. But some days, I wake up and I can’t believe what’s happened,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/closed-borders-few-flights-leave-nris-struggling/story-Qw8xpi2qa6K6SFyBniAVdK.html
11-07-2020||India||SC refuses to change Cheque validity period for lockdown||The period of validity of cheques will not be affected due to the lockdown as the Supreme Court on Friday held that it would not interfere with the policy decision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) prescribing the cheque to be valid for three months.A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde stated in its order, “We do not consider it appropriate to interfere with the period specified by the RBI (for validity of cheque) as the entire banking system runs on the basis of the period specified.”In a suo moto petition, the court took up the period of limitation expiring under various laws that could possibly be hit due to the present Covid-19 situation across the country which had forced several parts of the country to come under lockdown. This prevented litigants from approaching the Court and physically file cases.Meanwhile, the court agreed to grant concessions under other statutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-change-cheque-validity-period-for-lockdown/story-6HzuGUTM6M8Inw7DYaH6xN.html
11-07-2020||India||SC notice on use of loud sounds to scare animals||Use of barbaric means like explosives and snares to ward off wild animals should be declared illegal and more stringent punishment should be prescribed for cruelty against animals, a plea before the Supreme Court said.The petition filed on June 11 in light of the death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala on May 27 after she ate a pineapple filled with firecrackers, also sought guidelines for the tracking of elephants in order to save them from cruelty and extinction.“It is quite a common practice to scare off wild animals or scare wild boars/Nilgai etc by using food stuff filled with crackers as bait as the damage caused by these animals at times is severe and there happens to be no means to stop it. The Forest Department across India has failed in this endeavour to protect the wildlife and humans due to a severe shortage of staff and lack of scientific measures being used by general populace [sic],” the plea filed by advocate Shubham Awasthi said.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde issued a notice to the central government and 13 states which have more than 50 elephants in the wild.On May 27, a pregnant elephant passed away in the Palakkad district of Kerala after she accidentally ate a pineapple filled with firecrackers which was meant for wild boars which destroy crops. The incident had led to outrage on social media.Subsequently, another incident came to light in June when a cow in Himachal Pradesh was injured in a similar incident involving crackers.“This shows that the usage of such snares is pan-India and affects wildlife across India,” the petition filed through advocate Vivek Narayan Sharma said.Awasthi prayed that vacancies in forest forces should be filled in a timely manner to ensure effective management and order in wildlife belts.Scientific and alternative measures should be devised to ward off wild animals which pose a threat to crops and humans, he added.“Order governments to introduce necessary amendments in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960 to enhance punishments by making it more stringent as per modern times”, the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-on-use-of-loud-sounds-to-scare-animals/story-IYi5tCvYvA8XHwpJoi9TqJ.html
11-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||It is likely that around 15% of Delhi’s population has already been infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).That is one of the preliminary findings of antibody tests administered to 22,823 people across all 11 districts of the Capital between June 27 and July 5. The Delhi government and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), which conducted the study, are yet to publish the results.Hindustan Times reported the preliminary findings on Friday.Even at 15%-plus or 15%-minus (the final number may be a few percentage points higher or lower) this would suggest that there is community transmission in Delhi, though I sometimes wonder why we continue to be obsessed with this. In a press briefing by the health ministry, the first in 28 days — once, they were as regular as this column — the issue came up and the ministry once again danced around it. We should simply stop asking the ministry about this; it’s like repeatedly asking Shahid Afridi his age.It was on the basis of antibody tests such as this that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late last month that only one in 10 cases in that country was being reported. Delhi, based on a similar extrapolation, would then be reporting only one in 30 cases. Assuming that the actual proportion isn’t 15% but 10%, it would still be reporting only one in 20 cases. That may sound excessive, but it is probably correct.We already know many people who are infected remain asymptomatic. How many? A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research based on around 40,000 people infected by Sars-CoV-2 puts the proportion at around 28% in India. The actual proportion may be much higher — I have seen international studies with numbers ranging from 45% to 78%.We also know that many infected people suffer mild symptoms, do not require hospitalisation, and recover, often even without any sort of medical intervention. A June study by the US CDC put the proportion of hospitalised patients at 14% of those infected (it covered 1.3 million Covid-19 patients), although this is more a measure of how many of the infected were admitted to a hospital as opposed to the number that needed to be.Given this, it isn’t surprising that 15% of Delhi’s population may have been exposed to the virus.On Friday, the New York Times reported, based on data from tester CityMD, which “administered 314,000 antibody tests in New York City... 26% of the tests came back positive”. In some neighbourhoods, some clinics turned in positive results as high as 56% and 68%, the report added. Both numbers are around the 60% that is widely accepted as the proportion of the population that needs to be infected for so-called herd immunity — a phenomenon where a virus or any other pathogen can’t infect too many people because it soon runs into someone who has already been infected, and is therefore immune, breaking the chain of infections.In one particular area of Delhi, HT reported, the proportion in the early sero-survey findings was as high as 25%. Still, at 15%, Delhi is far away from 60%, or even the 43% defined in an article in Science by researchers from the universities of Stockholm and Nottingham — but the number should also be seen as 15% of Delhi’s population now being immune (we still do not know how long this immunity will last).These people are potentially safe from a second wave, if and when one breaks, and also in a position to go out and do their thing without the fear of getting infected or passing on the infection to someone. Purely mathematically, it also means the Capital’s death rate is actually much lower (a little over 3%, based on the current numbers).Interestingly, the 15% number is higher than the 6% a similar study in France came up with and the 5% a study from Spain (reported earlier this week in The Lancet) did. The Spanish study used the low number to highlight the difficulty of achieving herd immunity — which means this is not going to be a disease that runs out of steam in the foreseeable future, but one that needs a vaccine.Delhi should do wider antibody testing (or sero survey, or serological study, as these are called) to better understand the real prevalence of the coronavirus disease. So should every other state. A high prevalence isn’t necessarily a bad thing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-iL9V5AjtcsSxFstzEKI2uN.html

11-07-2020||India||US to Haryana, backlash against migrants grows||International students in the US – there are at least 200,000 from India – might have to leave the country or risk deportation, if their universities shift to online-only mode. The US also suspended for this year the H1-B visa programme, used by a lot of skilled Indian workers, last month. Kuwait’s parliament has passed a bill putting quotas on the migrant population that could force 800,000 Indians to leave the country. And closer home, the Haryana government has issued an ordinance to reserve 75% private sector jobs for applicants from the state. All are clear signs that the pandemic, and the economic disruption it has inflicted, has added to the already growing backlash against free movement of labour across the world. At a time when India has also imbibed self-reliance as the cornerstone of post-pandemic recovery, there is a need to seriously examine the implications of such a sentiment.World Bank data shows that India received the highest amount of personal remittances, $ 83.1 billion, in 2019. This is more than combined amount received by Mexico and Philippines, countries ranked second and third that year. Net personal remittances, or remittances received after subtracting remittances paid, for India were $75.6 billion in 2019. These numbers have been continuously increasing. The net remittances received in 2019 amount to 2.6% of India’s GDP. To put this in perspective,the amount is more than double of what India spends on health. As is obvious, India will stand to lose the most if there is a major backlash against immigrant workers. (See Chart 1)  The importance of migrant workers in the Indian economy is not limited to those who cross international borders. The Economic Survey, an annual publication of the ministry of finance, estimated that almost a fourth of India’s workforce is made up of migrant workers. In their book “How Lives Change: Palanpur, India and Development Economics”, Himanshu, Peter Lanjouw and Nicholas Stern show that 70% of workers who left their villages for non-farm work travelled more than 50km . A third of such workers actually travelled at least 100km. A lot of them must have crossed state borders. A 2018 World Bank paper by Gaurav Nayyar and Kyoung Yang Kim found that migrant remittances had a share of 35% in Bihar’s gross state domestic product (GSDP) and positively affected consumption at the household level. Not all this migration is due to push factors, or poor income levels in states which send out migrants. Migrant-receiving states are equally dependent. Southern states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where population growth has slowed down considerably need more workers from states with high population growth to meet their labour requirements . While a lot of this migration is of unskilled workers, policies that hinder upward mobility for migrant workers are bound to create discontent. And the cascading effects of loss in remittance incomes will ultimately hurt demand in the country. Any blanket policy which reserves jobs for local residents will also have an adverse effect on the talent pool available to enterprises. Annual Survey of Industry (ASI) data shows that 40% of India’s industrial jobs were located in just three states - Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat. If factories located in these three states were to hire just locals, or mostly locals, they would miss out on the talent pool available to them. Any such policy will also have serious consequences for India’s IT industry, which is concentrated in a handful of cities. (See Chart 2) To be sure, the push for anti-immigrant policies has an objective basis. With economies in contraction mode across the globe, politicians are doing all they can to placate local workers, who are also voters. While such short-termism might be attractive at the moment, it can end up doing long term harm. Foreign students bring large amounts in tuition fees and a wealth of knowledge to the American higher education system. India’ rich states are critically dependent on migrants for a host of activities.Political temptation for counterproductive policies during times of economic crises is not new. Economies tried to hurt each others’ exports by trade barriers or competitive devaluation during the Great Depression of the 1930s. This is often referred to as a beggar-thy-neighbour policy. Because all countries replicated this, it only ended up worsening the situation. A century later, the world seems to have shifted from beggar-thy-neighbour to beggar-thy-neighbour’s worker.As the highest recipient of remittances, it is in India’s interest to lead the charge against such a mindset. Doing this will require coherence in international and domestic policies. Policies which institutionalise discrimination in dealing with migrant workers or state governments enacting legislations which exclude migrants from jobs are the opposite of what is required to demonstrate such coherence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-to-hry-backlash-against-migrants-grows/story-2tfsPY9HCYBQj9uIIGYxEM.html
11-07-2020||India||India may invite Oz for naval drill||India is close to taking a call on including Australia in the Malabar trilateral naval exercise involving Japan and the US, people familiar with developments said on Friday.The move would dovetail with last year’s upgrade of the Quadrilateral alliance or Quad – which groups India, Australia, Japan and the US – to the level of foreign ministers and greater convergence between the four countries on the Indo-Pacific, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.It will also be a natural progression to India and Australia elevating their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signing a crucial agreement for reciprocal access to military logistics during a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart Scott Morrison last month.The annual Malabar exercise began as a bilateral drill between India and the US in 1992, and was expanded with Japan’s inclusion in 2015. This year’s manoeuvres have been delayed by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and are expected to take place by the end of 2020, the people said.A decision on Australia’s inclusion will also include consultations with Japan and the US for their concurrence, the people added.Australia’s inclusion will lead to the exercise having more complexity and scope, though it could also rile China, especially at a time when Beijing’s differences with all four members of the Quad are in sharp focus.US leaders have said China’s aggressive stance along the border with China fits with a larger pattern of Chinese aggression in other parts of the world, while Japan is engaged in a row with China over Chinese vessels intruding into its territorial waters around the disputed Senkaku Islands. Japan has also backed India in the standoff with China, saying it opposes any “unilateral attempt to change the status quo” on the LAC.Prime Minister Morrison referred to the India-China standoff when he recently launched Australia’s 2020 Defence Strategic Update.During a virtual meeting between Morrison and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe on Thursday, the two leaders welcomed the inaugural Quad foreign ministerial meeting in September 2019 and reaffirmed their commitment to ongoing quadrilateral consultations.Morrison and Abe also “committed to continue to work together through various bilateral and plurilateral mechanisms, including the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue with the US and trilateral meetings with India”, according to a joint statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-may-invite-oz-for-naval-drill/story-UsfaAIIbGEJb4s5qC9H6aI.html

The panel is chaired by senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, who, along with six other members, attended the meeting.Sources said it was conveyed to the panel that a vaccine for Covid-19 could be available only by early next year.This was the first meeting of the panel since the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25.Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said the delay in the resumption of parliamentary committee meetings was forced by circumstances beyond control.“I am glad that Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committees have resumed functioning, three and half months since the last sitting of Parliament on March 23rd,” he wrote on Twitter.Naidu said everyone was keen on resumption of work by these committees, “but the delay was forced by circumstances beyond our control”.“Corona pandemic did cast a shadow on the working of these committees, which function on behalf of the Parliament,” the vice president said.Naidu said all possible measures were taken to enable the committee meetings by complying with the norms of social distancing, wearing of masks etc.“I am hopeful these committees would now go about examining important issues concerning respective domains,” he said.Urging Naidu for the holding of virtual meetings, Ramesh, in a tweet, said, “I would still request you Sir to allow virtual meetings given that Parliament is unlikely to meet for the next month at least.” The sources said the other members present at the meet also sought virtual deliberations.A detailed discussion was held at the meeting over the government’s preparedness and handling of Covid-19.“Our Parliamentary Standing Committee is having a most informative and useful meeting with @DBTIndia @IndiaDST @CSIR_IND & @PrinSciAdvGoI on the issue of Science & Technology & COVID-19. Too bad we are not allowed to have virtual meetings so that more MPs could have participated,” Ramesh wrote on Twitter.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs is scheduled to meet on July 15.While the members of the panels are demanding virtual meetings, the presiding officers of both Houses of Parliament have said this requires a change of rules and endorsement by the Rules Committee of Parliament as also a nod from Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-could-be-available-by-early-next-year-parliamentary-panel-told/story-mzctmSr7RxHKs7CqhpaDLO.html
11-07-2020||India||SC to consider social media bar as bail rule||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine whether prohibition on use of social media can be prescribed as a pre-condition for granting bail.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde issued a notice to Uttar Pradesh government while refusing to interfere with an order passed by the Allahabad high court on May 20 which granted bail to Congress leader Sachin Choudhary on the condition that he will not use social media. “What is wrong with an order asking you not to use social media? We don’t think it’s too onerous if a person’s participation on social media creates mischief. Why can’t the court say you don’t use the instrument which was used to cause mischief,” the bench remarked.UP police had filed an FIR against Choudhary on April 11 for various offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including sedition (section 124A) and promoting enmity between religious groups (section 153-A), and Disaster Management Act. The case was registered in connection with a press conference allegedly held by Choudhary in April questioning chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s handling of the pandemic.The Allahabad high court released him on bail while setting a slew of conditions.In his plea filed through advocate Keshav Ranjan, Choudhary maintained that he had only given a statement to media when they approached him. Choudhary also contested imposition of restrictions on use of social media as a condition for bail submitting that it is violative of freedom of speech under Article 19 of Constitution. The SC bench said that it will lay down a law regarding whether restrictions on social media can be imposed while granting bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-consider-social-media-bar-as-bail-rule/story-eYTMgGV4BglqvEsfJifTAO.html
11-07-2020||India||Govt scales up testing in containment zones||The Delhi government has issued fresh guidelines under which residents of containment zones who are identified as contacts of Covid-19 cases, people with influenza-like symptoms, and high-risk individuals will be tested thrice through rapid antigen kits within 15 days of sealing an area, senior government officials said on Friday.The order, issued by the director-general of health services, and which has been reviewed by HT, said that the same set of people, all of whom will be identified during the formation of a containment zone, will be screened and tested between the first and third day of sealing an area, then again between the fifth and seventh day, and, finally, once again, between the 13th and 15th day.“Their health records will be saved in a database and they shall be asked to visit the nearest antigen test centres. The objective of the strategy is to get a better picture in terms of local transmission so that the government’s ongoing testing efforts can be enhanced for better accuracy,” said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified. High-risk individuals include people aged above 60 years, pregnant women, those with severe acute respiratory illnesses and those with comorbidities, said health department officials.Dr Lalit Kant, former Head, Division of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research said, “By employing this strategy it will be possible to test as many people as possible who may have come in contact with the infected individual in the entire period in which they are capable of infecting others. By tracking, testing, and treating these people, it will allow early detection of disease thereby limiting further spread of the infection.”Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “Such a strategy can help the government in assessing the prevalence of the disease and get a better picture concerning local transmission so that testing drives in future can be better strategised for more accuracy.”The new guidelines came even as the number of containment zones in the Capital rose from 458 to 563 between Wednesday and Friday, with several existing ones being split , government data showed. This move is a part of the government’s new delineation strategy for containment zones under which Covid-19 clusters are identified within existing containment zones and they are divided into multiple units of no-go zones.The first round of the delineation strategy was implemented between June 26 and 28, and the number of containment zones in the city rose from 280 to 421. “The strategy has two objectives. First, fewer people remain in containment zones. It is a matter of inconvenience and the government acknowledges that. Second, smaller containment units allow for stronger and more focused surveillance efforts,” said an official in the revenue department who asked not to be named.Containment zones in Hari Nagar, Tilak Vihar, Badarpur, Sangam Vihar, Meet Nagar, GTB Nagar, Jahangirpuri, Mahendru Enclave, Alipur, Malkaganj and Pratap Nagar are among those that have been split under the government’s new delineation strategy. Kishore said, “However, it is high time that the Delhi government revisits its overall containment policy. Now that a large number of people are apparently adhering to home isolation norms on being diagnosed Covid-19 positive, the government may limit its policy to areas where it is absolutely necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-scales-up-testing-in-containment-zones/story-DgLwhAQRUn499By9oWG8EN.html
11-07-2020||India||Dispute persists, but India, China commit to disengage||India and China said on Friday they will push forward efforts aimed at complete disengagement and easing of tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), even as differences persisted between the two sides on issues such as Galwan Valley. In a separate but related development, the Chinese envoy to India called for maintaining peace along the disputed border until both sides found a “reasonable solution” and for a “win-win” bilateral relationship, but warned against measures aimed at “decoupling” the two economies. Following the third virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs since the standoff began in early May, both sides issued similarly worded statements focused on progress in the disengagement and de-escalation process that began last weekend after a phone call between the Special Representatives on the boundary issue – India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. People familiar with developments, speaking on condition of anonymity, drew a distinction between positions adopted by the two sides on contentious issues such as China’s claim on Galwan Valley, and the process of disengagement involving meetings of corps commanders and mechanisms such as WMCC.“This meeting of WMCC reviewed the progress in disengagement and de-escalation and agreed communications will continue. WMCC monitors the disengagement according to the roadmap drawn up by the military commanders, who are set to meet again next week,” said one of the people cited above.“The positions of the two sides on issues such as Galwan Valley haven’t changed. We have made it clear that we aren’t ceding any ground on such issues,” the person added. The Indian readout following the two-hour meeting of WMCC said both sides had reaffirmed they “will ensure complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC and de-escalation from...border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas in accordance with bilateral agreements and protocols”.The statement from China’s foreign ministry said both sides “fully affirmed the positive progress made by border defence forces of the two countries in implementing the consensus reached at the commander-level and easing the situation on the ground”. It added they will continue to properly handle issues and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity along the border and overall ties.Both sides said the disengagement and de-escalation process is in line with the agreement reached by the foreign ministers on June 17 and the Special Representatives during their phone conversation on July 5.The Indian readout further said the two sides had agreed it was essential to maintain “enduring peace and tranquility” along the border for overall development of bilateral ties. It added India and China had also agreed it “was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between senior [military] commanders”. As agreed by the Special Representatives, the corps commanders will “meet soon to discuss further steps so as to ensure complete disengagement and de-escalation in a timely manner”, the Indian statement said. The two sides also agreed to hold another meeting of WMCC in the near future.The Chinese statement also spoke about promoting the “further cooling of the situation on the ground”, strengthening confidence-building measures along the border and promptly handling issues to prevent differences becoming disputes.Friday’s WMCC meeting was co-chaired by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and director general Hong Liang of the boundary and oceanic affairs department of China’s foreign ministry. Shortly after the meeting, Chinese envoy to India, Sun Weidong, said that both countries need peace rather than confrontation, and should maintain peace along their disputed border until they find a “reasonable solution” to the complicated issue.Sun addressed calls from some quarters for “decoupling” of bilateral economic and trade relations and excluding “Made in China” goods, saying self-protection, non-tariff barriers and restrictive measures would be unfair to both Chinese enterprises and Indian consumers.He further said India and China need to build trust through mutual respect and treating each other as equals. The two sides should “respect and accommodate mutual core interests and major concerns” and adhere to the principle of non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.Sun made the remarks in a nearly 18-minute video posted on the Chinese embassy’s YouTube channel. The theme of his remarks was “Implement consensus and handle differences properly to bring China-India relations back on the right track”.His remarks focused on five points — India and China should be partners, rather than rivals; they need peace, rather than confrontation; they should pursue win-win cooperation instead of a zero-sum game; they need to build trust, rather than suspicion; and bilateral ties should move forward, rather than backward.“We need to seek convergence while putting aside differences and not impose one’s will on the other. We should honour our commitment, walk the talk, and ensure implementation of the leaders’ consensus in letter and in spirit,” Sun said.He also made several references to the age-old ties between the two countries and the consensus achieved through informal summits between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping since 2018.Referring to the phone conversation between the Special Representatives, Sun noted the two had agreed to prevent more incidents that undermine peace and tranquillity along the border.Sun acknowledged China and India have a “sensitive and complicated” boundary issue left over from history and said: “We need to find a fair and reasonable solution mutually acceptable through equal consultation and peaceful negotiation. Pending an ultimate settlement, we both agree to work together to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.”However, the envoy again sought to blame India for the violent clash at Galwan Valley on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and caused unspecified Chinese casualties. “The right and wrong of what recently happened at the Galwan Valley is very clear. China will firmly safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and ensure the peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” he said.A person familiar with developments said the Chinese envoy’s remarks acknowledged the importance of China-India ties. “He’s saying there is a larger relationship to take care of,” the person added.Experts, however, continued to be sceptical of China’s position on the border standoff.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “There is a glaring gap between the noble norms talked of by the Chinese envoy and the brutal actions of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). India’s focus remains the disengagement and de-escalation process by zeroing in on the implementation of the agreements reached so far.” He added that feedback from metros and towns across India reflected the increasing sentiments about restricting economic ties with China. “The People’s Liberation Army is effectively demolishing the business prospects of Huawei and other Chinese firms in India and elsewhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dispute-persists-but-india-china-commit-to-disengage/story-USy0lQ8gonULKagDqZGdaP.html
11-07-2020||India||Good cop, bad cop online: Interrogations go digital||It is 4 in the afternoon and two men arrested for snatching are brought to a room inside a police station in central Delhi. They are wanted in different cases of snatching and robbery in different police precincts. The two are asked to be seated and prepare for a video conference with a team of officers. On a computer screen are small square-shaped windows of police officers, who are ready to begin what is called a virtual interrogation.Law enforcement in times of the Covid-19 pandemic has often been demanding and unpredictable and sometimes ventured into the realm of the unknown. In the first two months of the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the disease, they were on the streets to ensure that people were following social distancing norms, and feeding the homeless and migrant workers, or in the police stations stitching face masks. Now that lockdown norms have been gradually eased and criminals have returned to their line of work, the police have introduced the concept of virtual interrogation, questioning criminals and witnesses over video conferencing to minimise physical contact with them. Senior officers have also started interacting with victims over video link. Delhi police officers say that in almost all cases, barring a few in which the suspects were hardcore criminals or weren’t forthcoming enough, they have adopted virtual interrogation. The move is working, senior Delhi police officers said, because unlike in the pre-Covid-19 days, top officers need not depend on juniors and can join questioning at the click of a button from their offices.It started last month, when 11 policemen tested Covid-19 positive after coming in contact with a carrier in central Delhi’s Anand Parbat. During a virtual meeting of senior officers at the police headquarters and district police chiefs from their offices across the city, an officer informed his bosses that the men had been infected after coming in contact with a 37-year-old man who had murdered his life. The top officers then decided that since they were already holding law and order meetings over video conference, they could do digitally question suspects and witnesses too.Joint commissioner of police (central range) Suvashish Chaudhary said virtual interrogation offers many benefits and is working well. “It saves time and ensures social distancing. Suppose we have arrested a snatcher, then the investigating officer (usually junior rank officers such as sub-inspectors) may ask him about his past cases. Someone like me is more interested in why that snatchers does the crime in a specific place or how he identifies his victim. Many times, depending on the profile of the criminal, we come together and hold joint virtual interrogation sessions.” Police said they had come across many cases where arrested suspects were from containment zones. Until July 9, Delhi had 562 containment zones across the city, where more than 350,000 residents live. The police have arrested more than 100 such residents from across the city in cases of snatching, robbery, theft and burglary. Such suspects were subsequently interrogated by senior officers virtually after initial questioning by juniors. Chaudhary said virtual interrogation was the best option when the suspects are from containment zones.“On June 8, our local police had arrested six men for snatching and robbery. Some of them such as Gopesh alias Gopi, 23, and Ashim alias Aslam, 25, were from containment zones in Anand Parbat. Instead of visiting the station and crowding to question those men, my seniors and I interrogated those men virtually. We managed to quiz them thoroughly and found their involvement in over 15 cases.”In the last two months, senior police have also started meeting victims and complainants over video conference. Until the lockdown, the meetings would take place at the offices of the senior police officers. Many senior officers of the rank of joint commissioner have started virtual meetings every morning. HT spoke to one city resident who had met senior officers of the central range when her daughter went missing. On June 16, the seven-year-old child had gone missing from her house in Patel Nagar. The woman, Rameeta Devi, was adamant on meeting senior officers.“They connected me to the DCP and the Joint CP. I explained to them how my daughter was unsafe. They assured me on the video call that they would find her. I remember that while I was talking to him, one of the officers was driving and was on his way to find my child. Luckily they found her,” said Devi adding that she has only met the top policemen who found her daughter online. “ After this pandemic is over, I will meet all of them in person and thank them,” she said. Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava said, “Adversities also present opportunities. We realised that in many cases, we could easily question the suspects virtually. There is better monitoring of the cases when the senior officers monitor the interrogation directly. We will follow this even after the pandemic is over. Following this and many others measures we have managed to minimise physical contact of our men on the ground and reduce the coronavirus cases (in the police department).”The police chief also said that the cases of police personnel testing positive are gradually coming down. Until July 9, 2,339 police personnel had tested positive for the coronavirus disease, of which 1,808 (77.29%) have recovered. There are around 80,000 men and women in the city police. As many as 12 Delhi police personnel have died of the disease, while 44 are admitted in hospitals. The rest are in home quarantine. An expert in policing matters, Prakash Singh, who headed Border Security Force(BSF) and the state police forces of Uttar Pradesh and Assam, said virtual interrogation was a good initiative that police had taken given the circumstances. “ It is the best possible solution at this times. Senior officers will not have to depend on their juniors. The monitoring is better. Besides a group of officers avoiding physical contact, if this is minimising the risk of many officers for one interrogation, it is a laudable move,” said Singh, whose petition led the Supreme Court issuing directions for police reforms in 2006.“Sometimes, coming in contact with such arrested persons could mean a serious risk. The high court and the Supreme Courts are already holding virtual court hearings. It is working fine, it seems. One needs to evolve and find the best possible solution in this pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-cop-bad-cop-online-interrogations-go-digital/story-qZythKUVDhoagUvLJBOQ2H.html
11-07-2020||India||Rapid tests begin at Delhi govt dispensaries||In a bid to bring more residents of the Capital under the testing net to check for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Delhi government on Thursday directed all its dispensaries and polyclinics to start rapid antigen testing and extend quick point-of-care testing to those living outside the 633 containment zones.Testing in the centres is likely to begin next week. Any resident can walk in for a Covid-19 test, and will require no documents or prescriptions. “We need to upload the data on an app that asks for valid phone numbers, so that’s all we ask for. We check whether the number is working right at the centre itself,” said a Delhi government official who asked not to be named.These will be in addition to at least 160 centres set up by the government to test those inside or in the vicinity of containment zones.“Our instructions were to increase the number of tests and testing centres from day one. The resident welfare organisations had also said centres closer to people’s homes would encourage them to get tested,” said a district official, on the condition of anonymity.The test kits need to be stored at below 30°C. As a result, over the next few days, dispensaries that did not have air-conditioning systems will get them, the Delhi government official quoted above said.The official said although several of the testing centres were initially started in schools, the government is trying to move away from them. “Schools are likely to reopen in some time, so the centres will have to be closed. These tests do not require any elaborate facility or bio-safety arrangements, and can be performed in a small room. We are in talks with several RWAs to just get small air-conditioned rooms close to societies where people can come and get tested. In some places, we are roping in mohalla clinics as well,” another district official said.Delhi has about 200 dispensaries and 25 polyclinics. There are around 450 mohalla clinics in the city.Outside containment zones, dispensaries and polyclinics will test those with influenza-like symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat. Those who have come in contact with confirmed Covid-19 patients will be tested.“The priority is to test those with symptoms and who have come in contact with other cases, or have co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. However, we have asked our staff not to refuse anyone who comes to the centre even if they have a mild suspicion. Earlier, when there were limited RT-PCR test kits, we had to refuse people. Now, we can test more people,” a third district official said.Manpower shortageTwo of the three dispensaries HT spoke to said they already had enough kits, but that a staff shortage was preventing testing from being scaled up. “We already have the kits because they are distributed from here to testing centres. However, our lab technicians are currently posted at these centres, so we do not know how to start testing here,” said a doctor from a dispensary in east Delhi.A doctor from a dispensary in south district said, “We have received notification about testing at the dispensaries, but there aren’t any detailed guidelines yet. The guidelines are likely to come in by Monday. We already have the kits with us as soon as we get some of our trained staff back or someone is posted we can start testing here.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-tests-begin-at-delhi-govt-dispensaries/story-PoClOUssOK3oBXlAQduERK.html
11-07-2020||India||Chinese JV among six bidders for Vande Bharat trains||Chinese joint venture company CRRC Pioneer Electric (India) Private Limited is among the only foreign bidders for the global tender floated for manufacturing 44 rakes of Vande Bharat trains.The JV was established jointly by China-cased CRRC Yongji Electric Co. Ltd. and Gurugram-based Pioneer Fil-med Private Limited in 2015. Indian railways’ Integral Coach Factory, Chennai had floated a tender for manufacturing 44 rakes or train sets of semi-high speed Vande Bharat trains on July 10.“We have got bids from six players for the tender,” Vinod Kumar Yadav, chairman, Railway Board, said on Friday.The other five bidders include state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Bharat Industries, Sangrur, Electrowaves Electronics (P) Ltd, MEDHA Servo Drives Private Limited, Powernetics Equipment India Private Limited, according to the railway ministry.This comes at a time when India and China are involved in a tense border stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. A brutal brawl in Galwan Valley on June 15 led to 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers dead. India has also decided to ban 59 apps, mostly with Chinese links.The Railways has also scrapped a tender for thermal cameras meant for ‘Covid surveillance’ after Indian firms alleged that the tender specifications favoured a Chinese company, Hindustan Times reported on July 1. In June, Railtel, the railways’ telecom arm, had issued a tender for thermal temperature screening AI-based surveillance cameras for assistance in Covid-19 surveillance. The government company has decided to issue a fresh tender after the controversy.The ambitious ‘Make in India’ project involves the manufacturing of 44 train sets comprising 16 coaches each for Vande Bharat. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had flagged off the maiden run of a Vande Bharat train on New Delhi -Varanasi route on February 15, 2019. The second such train service between New Delhi and Shri Mata Vaishnodevi Katra was flagged off by home minister Amit Shah on October 3, 2019. The Railway ministry last week also began the formal process to allow a private company to run trains on 109 routes -- a process that aims to, for the first time, open up one of the government’s most prominent enterprises that has in recent decades been outpaced by the demands of a rapidly growing economy.On whether Chinese firms will be allowed to bid for the private trains, Yadav had last week said, “As far as the question on Chinese companies arises, there are guidelines under the Make in India Policy by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and we will follow them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-jv-among-six-bidders-for-vande-bharat-trains/story-rQlg6aK7RLQBo8xdkLC1HK.html
11-07-2020||India||Trafficked, abused minor from Tripura rescued in Rajasthan||A 14-year-old girl from Tripura was trafficked, sold twice, raped multiple times, forcibly married off and had to undergo an abortion in a span of about four months beginning March, according to her statement to authorities in Rajasthan.The girl, who managed to escape from her in-laws’ house in Jhunjhunu on May 2, has been rescued. She has been staying at a shelter home since. The minor is expected to be taken back to her state by a team of the Tripura Commission for Protection of Child Rights next week.Her statement before a magistrate and a panel of the Rajasthan Commission for Protection of Child Rights on June 23 narrates her ordeal that began in her home district of Unakoti four months back and continued in Jhunjhunu, about 2,500km away from her home.According to her statement, she lived with her mother, four sisters and a brother. A Tripura child rights body official said her father died a few years ago and that the family was living in extreme poverty.In the statement, the girl said a neighbour told her family that he will marry her off to a good family. “My mother is very poor. My family agreed,” she said in the statement on June 23, a copy of which is with HT.For seven days, the neighbour kept the girl in Assam’s Silchar and she was “physically abused four times”, the minor said.The neighbour trafficked her to Delhi and sold her to a resident of Rajasthan’s Jhunjhunu in April. He then sold her to his neighbour for ~2 lakh, according to the girl. Later, the second person married her.Sangeeta Beniwal, the chairperson of the Rajasthan child rights body, said the girl was raped by her husband five times between April and May. “Her mother-in-law also harassed her for not understanding the local language and being slow with household chores,” Beniwal said.On May 2, the minor managed to escape from her husband’s house and hid in a nearby field, according to a Jhunjhunu police official. The husband filed a missing person’s report, saying his wife aged 20 years had gone missing.After police found her the next day, members of the Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) met her and suspected that she was much younger than the age mentioned in the complaint.The girl was kept in a government rehabilitation centre in Jhunjhunu and the district child rights body wrote to Tripura police for her details, Mandawa police station in-charge Mukesh Kumar said. The area where in-laws live falls under the Mandawa police jurisdiction.“The girl told us that she has been living here for three-four months and that she is a native of Tripura. She also told us that she doesn’t want to live with her in-laws after which we kept her in a shelter home of an NGO,” said a police official who did not want to be named.After the Tripura police sent the documents, it was found that she was just 14 years old. Her medical tests conducted on June 15 found that she was 11 weeks’ pregnant.On June 23, the girl told authorities she would go for an abortion, which was done on July 2, according to Beniwal.Police booked the two Jhunjhunu men for kidnapping, trafficking and rape. They were arrested and sent to jail. Police are also looking for the neighbour of the girl.The Tripura high court took suo motu (on its own) cognisance on June 17 and sought the state’s response on “appropriate ways to ensure the safety and security of the minor girl”.According to the Tripura government’s reply on July 6, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, and the child rights bodies in Tripura and Rajasthan were coordinating to reunite the girl with her family.“The state government will send a team to Rajasthan soon to bring back the girl,” Barnali Goswami, chairperson of Tripura Commission for Women, said.(With inputs from Priyanka Deb Burman in Agartala)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trafficked-abused-minor-from-tripura-rescued-in-rajasthan/story-qsuM5x9Bxq8LEoQLGnnsOK.html
11-07-2020||India||Taiwan names new envoy to India||Taiwan has named senior diplomat Baushuan Ger as its new representative to India while his predecessor Tien Chung-kwang has been promoted to the post of deputy foreign minister.Baushuan’s appointment was part of personnel changes announced by Taiwan’s foreign ministry on Thursday. Tien, who served as Taiwan’s representative to India for more than seven years, is expected to leave for home on Friday.However, Baushuan is expected to take up his post in India in September, people familiar with developments said. He is currently director-general of the department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs in Taiwan’s foreign ministry and has served in the US and the UK.Tien will replace Hsu Szu-chien as deputy foreign minister. Hsu has been appointed as deputy secretary-general of Taiwan’s National Security Council.“Not only does such an arrangement convey approval for Tien’s performance as Taiwan’s representative to India over the past seven years, but it also suggests that the relationship with India is likely to become one of Taiwan’s most important diplomatic priorities in the future,” Taiwan News portal reported on Thursday.Under the “One China policy”, India doesn’t have full and formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Taiwan established the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center (TECC) in New Delhi in 1995 as its government representative office in India.Besides promoting bilateral relations in economy, trade, investment, media and tourism, TECC has divisions for consular, economic, education science and technology activities that are responsible for advancing mutual interests between Taiwan and India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal.Amid the border standoff between India and China, several experts and commentators have called for New Delhi to upgrade its ties with Taipei.In a recent article for HT, Sana Hashmi, Taiwan Fellow at the Institute of International Relations, National Chengchi University, wrote: “India’s foreign policy priorities, particularly with regard to the Indo-Pacific, should accommodate Taiwan. Along with military preparedness and aligning interests with key countries, Taiwan needs to be included prominently in its long-term strategy towards China.”Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s New Southbound Policy, launched in 2016, aims to expand political, economic, and people-to-people linkages with countries such as India. Taiwan also cooperated with India during the Covid-19 pandemic, donating one million face masks to protect frontline medical personnel engaged in the fight against the Coronavirus.In a recent editorial headlined “Taiwan must stand with India”, the leading newspaper Taipei Times said the June 15 clash between Indian and Chinese troops “fits a pattern of Beijing’s increasingly aggressive expansionism in the region – which should also concern policymakers in Taiwan”.The editorial said: “The incident should be understood in the context of Beijing’s aggressive behaviour in the region, which has clearly become more frequent since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.”It added, “What motivates Chinese President Xi Jinping’s increased assertiveness in the region? This is a question that Taiwan, India and other regional nations must seek to answer...

The US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) has scaled back the printing of the physical green cards, which identify the holder as a legal permanent US resident.By law, US permanent residents are legally required to carry the credit card-sized identity cards “at all times” and must show them when applying for jobs and when travelling. Indians received 10% of all green cards issued in 2019 and are the second-largest group of existing green-card holders. But 53% of all green card applicants are from India, a figure that has kept rising each year.A green card holder gets permanent resident status in the US and has the authorisation to stay and work in the country.The USCIS contract with the private printing firm that produces green cards expired in mid-June, reported the Washington Post. The USCIS was supposed to take over the printing itself but the agency’s financial difficulties forced it to reduce its output. There are two printing facilities for green cards. One in Kentucky has shut down. The other one, in Missouri, is operating at reduced capacity. There is a 50,000 shortfall in green cards, the USCIS said in a statement. The agency has asked the US Congress for an emergency $1.2 billion loan or else “all agency operations will be affected.”Even existing green card holders must get new identity cards every 10 years or if the card has been damaged or lost. Normally, green cards are printed within 48 hours of an applicant’s residency being approved.While the Trump administration has taken a number of anti-immigrant steps recently, including suspending new H and L visas and requiring students who are taking only online courses leave the country, it is not clear the printing problem is deliberate.However, USCIS’s financial difficulties are a direct result of Trump’s anti-immigrant policies. The agency is funded solely from the fees it earns from the services it provides. Thanks to President Donald Trump’s obsession with supposed immigrant fraud, much of the USCIS’s resources have been channelled towards trying to find such cases. This has led to the present financial crisis. The agency has reportedly warned that without the emergency funding it will have to reduce its workforce by three-quarters. The administration, says the Washington Post, has put up other bureaucratic hurdles to make life more difficult for immigrants including shutting down biometric data collection points and making intra-agency documents movement more difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-rules-printing-of-green-cards-in-us-scaled-back/story-a5CXJRVMTR9xZqP5L38DnJ.html
11-07-2020||India||Rajnath meets military brass, reviews situation||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday met the military brass and reviewed the border developments in eastern Ladakh, where Indian and Chinese armies are implementing a complex disengagement plan, officials familiar with the matter said. Singh held discussions with the chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs ahead of the fourth meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).“The meeting between the corps commander-ranked officers is likely to take place in three to four days,” said one of the officials cited above.The meeting is expected to focus on the critical Finger Area and the strategic Depsang plains, with a complex disengagement process that began after previous military talks on June 30 progressing smoothly in the Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra, as reported by HT on Friday.Tensions between the two countries escalated when 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on June 15. An undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers died in the violent face-off. The minister also spoke with US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper over the telephone and the conversation covered aspects related to bilateral military cooperation and the current border tensions with China, said a second official.While the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) pulled back 2km from Patrolling Point 14 (Galwan Valley) and PP-15 (Hot Springs) earlier this week, a similar retreat was completed at PP-17 (Gogra) on Thursday. The Indian Army, too, has pulled back proportionately from these friction areas and is closely monitoring PLA’s withdrawal.The army has observed some thinning of PLA troops, vehicles and removal of structures from the base of Finger 4 during the last three days but the PLA continues to hold ridge-line positions on the spur near Pangong Tso, the second official said.The Finger Area, which refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong lake, is expected to test the disengagement process. Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4 overlooking Indian deployments, the army would patrol right up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers 4 and 8 are 8km apart.The army is keeping a strict vigil on the Depsang sector, where the PLA’s forward presence is a matter of concern. A 2013 Chinese intrusion there blocked the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes.The defence minister also spoke with his South Korean counterpart, Jeong Kyeong-Doo, over the telephone and discussed regional security developments of mutual interest, a spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-meets-military-brass-reviews-situation/story-8L7NjmM53M9Jt3PFqJNDKL.html
11-07-2020||India||88 million visit Ayushman centres since February||Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) set up under the Centre’s flagship Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana have recorded 88 million footfalls since February 1 despite restrictions from late March on movement due to the lockdown imposed to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to Union health minister. They have played a key role in providing non-Covid services to patients within the community, he added.HWCs are the primary pillar of the flagship scheme that aims to provide universal and comprehensive primary health care. The government aims to set up 1,50,000 HWCs by converting some of the existing sub-health and primary health centres by 2022.Health checkups have been conducted at these grassroots-level centres and people screened and treated for hypertension, diabetes and certain cancers, according to the health ministry. Teams associated with the scheme have also helped local administrations in screening and conducting wellness sessions for migrants, who returned to their homes after losing jobs due to the Covid-19 lockdown, at quarantine centres.“Since there were teams deployed on the ground, it made sense to make use of the trained manpower to screen people housed at various quarantine centres set up at the peripheries of villages. This helped in assessing the health status of a large population base in a short span of time,” said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity.Nearly 14.1 million individuals were screened at the 41,000 centres across the country for hypertension, 11.3 million for diabetes and 13.4 million for oral, breast or cervical cancer, according to the ministry. Medicines were distributed at these centres among about 5,62,000 hypertension and 3,77,000 diabetes patients in June alone. From January to June, an additional 12,425 HWCs were made operational. The addition increased the number of these centres from 29,365 to 41,790, according to health ministry.“Having undertaken population-based screenings for non-communicable diseases, HWC teams already have a list of those with chronic disease and are able to rapidly screen individuals with co-morbidities and provide advice for protection against infection,” said a Union health ministry statement on Friday.HCW teams are also conducting immunisation and medical checkups of pregnant women and delivering essential medicines to tuberculosis, leprosy, hypertension and diabetic patients. “Health and Wellness Centres have demonstrated that creation of strong primary health care systems closer to the community is critical to the delivery of essential primary health care services to the community while also responding to the challenge of managing a pandemic,” the ministry added in the statement.The centres have also been creating awareness about measures such as frequent hand washing, wearing of masks and social distancing for preventing Covid-19 infections.Experts say establishing HCWs in villages is the best way to ensure health for all. “Historically, we have neglected primary health care, and by focusing on HCWs, now, it is a journey in the right direction to build positive health,” said CS Pandav, a former head of the community medicine department at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/88mn-visit-ayushman-centres-since-february/story-eimX28HpkrQUdu2ZdUmfzO.html
11-07-2020||India||Construction bids for new Parliament to close on July 14, work to begin after winter session||The pre-qualification bids to construct the new Parliament building, an integral part of the Central Vista’s redevelopment project, will close on July 14 and its construction is likely to begin after the Parliament’s winter session, officials aware of the development said.Earlier this month, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) began the process to select a firm to construct a new Parliament building which will come up adjacent to the existing Parliament.  CPWD invited pre-qualification bids in a two-bid system to construct the new building, which will comprise halls with greater seating capacity for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, a foyer, offices for members of Parliament, as well as a courtyard, dining facilities and a lounge for lawmakers. A Constitution gallery is also likely come up in the foyer. “The proposed work is of very prestigious nature and is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit of 21 months with the highest standards of quality and workmanship,” the bid document said.The bid document offered an estimated cost of Rs 889 crore, which it referred to as “a rough guide” to the project. It laid out strict eligibility criteria based on a firm’s past work — such as having built an assembly hall of minimum 1000 capacity and a building with a basement — as well as experience of ongoing projects, average monthly turnover, and net worth, among other factors. “The proposed new Parliament Building shall be of reinforced cement concrete framed structure building. The plinth of building shall match with plinth of existing building which is approximately 1.8 meter above the ground level,” the document stated.The ground plus two-storey triangular-shaped building with a built-up area of approximately 60,000 metre square, is set to come up on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate, which currently houses a reception, boundary walls and other temporary structures. The current Parliament building, which is over 90 years old, will continue to house the famed Parliament library and function in tandem with the new Parliament.“The construction work will begin post the Parliament’s winter session. It is expected to be completed by end of the year 2022,” said Bimal Patel, managing director of HCP Design, Planning And Management Private Limited, the architecture firm which won the bid for the redesign of Central Vista last year.The bid document also specified that 50% of the workers will need to be skilled for work of stone masonry, carving, fresco, furniture, and adequate health and safety measures would need to be taken in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.The purpose of prequalification is to assess the technical and managerial competency and financial soundness of the interested bidder. CPWD, which is the project implementation arm of the ministry of housing and urban affairs, specified that existing Parliament building shall continue to function during the entire period of execution of this project.“The existing Parliament Building shall continue to function during the entire period of execution of this project, therefore utmost care is required to minimise construction noise, dust free area and other construction activity related issues,” the document stated. “The contractor may have to execute the work in three shifts with large man power of workers, supervisors and professional engineers” the bid document said. “In view of high degree of security concerns at site and the work itself, stringent access control measures shall be exercised for entry and exit of manpower, material and construction equipment,” it stated.The plan to build a new parliament building had received two key approvals, including from the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee, towards the end of April. The proposal was also cleared by the Central Vista committee.On July 1, the new Parliament building also got the nod of the Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC), which had sought a revised building plan and made suggestions such as incorporating public art along the fencing and the gates of the Parliament complex. It further noted that the height of the building along the periphery of the boundary wall should be up to 3.6 meters “so as to ensure that the new Parliament building is visible from the adjoining roads and presents an aesthetically pleasing street picture.”“The suggestions made by DUAC have been taken into account and necessary changes have been made. More detailed plans will be made as the project progresses. Plans for incorporation of public art will also be detailed out,” Patel said. The new Parliament complex, which has an earlier deadline of 2022 under the Central Vista redevelopment plan, will be among the first plans to be finalised and tendered out.The redevelopment will also see North and South Block turning into a museum as well as new administrative offices with an underground metro on either side of the avenue.On January 21, Hindustan Times reported that the new Lok Sabha hall would be big enough to house up to 1,350 parliamentarians for joint sessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/construction-bids-for-new-house-to-close-on-july-14/story-cPxZ4BVQCN1IafqxwO9yML.html
11-07-2020||India||We need to allow testing for all: Adar Poonawalla||Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of the Serum Institute of India and president of the Vaccine Manufacturers’ Association of India, spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the timelines for vaccine development, the plan to begin production of some of the candidates, the low rate of testing in India, and the need to end stigma around a region where cases spike. Edited excerpts:Everyone is tracking vaccine development closely. Is it true that you plan to begin production of the candidates as early as next month?Yes, we have to start manufacturing some of these candidates at risk because if the world wants hundreds of millions of doses, we need to start by August-September. We’ve planned that, and we are planning to start manufacturing when we apply for Phase 3 of clinical trial permissions, which should be in the first week of August. That’s the plan. Of course, there’s risk-taking in everything, and this is where we have chosen to put in a lot of our investment both in the opex (operating expenditure) and the capex (capital expenditure) -- so that we have a dedicated facility, so that we can procure all the raw materials, and glass vials which we have already done. There’s the risk that if it doesn’t work out, we’ve got to go on to the next candidate, and the next candidate, and so on. We’ve got five different partnerships at the moment, including two of our own candidates, so I’m sure something will eventually work. But we shouldn’t be in a rush, we should take our time and make sure that the vaccine that we launch is safe and effective.ALSO WATCH | On The Record: ‘10 million tests till now is a joke,’ says Adar PoonawallaBefore we get to that bit of safety, can you explain the timeline a bit more about when vaccine will be ready for India’s billion-plus population?As I said, rolling out the vaccine, reaching everyone in India, is probably going to take more than a year, even from December. So we are talking about a year-and-a-half at least. We are talking about reaching parts of the country that are very difficult to reach, and even if we assume that people are going to come from rural parts to cities to get vaccinated, I don’t know how that whole plan is going to pan out. So up to two years provided the vaccine trials succeed and work. That’s the main “if”. After that, we can calculate how much time it will take, but the way the disease is spreading -- 70-80% are asymptomatic, which means you are not really having very detrimental symptoms, severity of the disease is not so bad in most healthy individuals. A lot of people will get the disease way before the vaccine comes about, I think in the US, roughly 1% of people have got it. That’s visible because of the amount of testing they are doing, and I’ve said if you increase the testing in India, you’ll see something similar coming about where 2-3% of the population by the end of the year will have it. And in 3-4 years, maybe 20-30% of the population would have got the disease and have recovered.The ICMR DG’s letter on a vaccine by August 15 created a storm. What did you make of the episode?I think the letter was misconstrued. I think they were trying to expedite things that the government is expected to do -- and they are doing a fabulous job about it. It got jumbled up, but nobody’s trying to cut corners. The whole vaccine industry is standing together to say we will conduct all Phase 1 and 2 and 3 trials, and even ICMR wants us to do that. They also want to adhere to global standards. What’s happened is a lesson that everybody’s learnt -- let us all be patient and wait for trials of drugs and vaccines to happen. After that happens, then we can come to a conclusion and give recommendations of what can be given to the public. We’ve just marked the milestone of 10 million tests in India. You’re not satisfied by that?No, I think that’s a joke. I think it should be 100 million, because if you look at our population, and if you look at other countries and the amount of testing they have done, it is way more. I think as the labs are gearing up, we certainly have the technology and the capability in India to do it. I believe in Mumbai you no longer need a doctor’s certificate to get tested. In a workplace, say you have a couple of hundred employees, you should be able to test everyone so that you feel safe and they feel safe coming back to work. We need to allow free testing, not in terms of price, but without doctor’s certificate or other such documents. The pricing of the test is very reasonable and affordable. We have picked up a lot, every week we are increasing and I think we are going in the right direction. Initially there were limitations to testing but now that’s no longer the case. Are there apprehensions that some states are not testing enough because of what the numbers will say about their Covid-19 management?Initially it was true, but very soon, whether it is at a country level or state level, where they compare with other states or countries to see the number of cases, I don’t think anybody’s going to care. Because there is going to be no shame in a state or a country that has got these cases, because this is something out of anyone’s control; you can’t stop it. You can mitigate it, you can take measures -- everyone’s wearing masks, taking precautions, but you can’t hold it back beyond a point, so there’s no shame. As soon as countries realise that, and the individual states realise that, there is no competition, and no shame, politics doesn’t come in the way of the science. With testing, you can isolate areas, you can isolate people, you can actually prevent more damage by testing more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-need-to-allow-testing-for-all-adar-poonawalla/story-ecBYZ9RUFaUOszxZ6RajNO.html
11-07-2020||India||Lab-made antibody trials show promise||A lab-made cocktail of antibodies has entered late-stage clinical trials in the US to evaluate its ability to prevent and treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has infected at least 12.5 million people and killed around 560,00 of them worldwide since December.The US biotechnology firm Regeneron announced the start of its Phase 3 experimental monoclonal antibody cocktail REGN-COV2 against Covid-19 this week in collaboration is the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The late phase trial will assess its ability to prevent infection among close contacts of infected people, such as family members.Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made proteins that act like natural antibodies and work by identifying and binding to the virus to destroy it. They are currently being used to treat several diseases and conditions, including cancers, asthma, Crohn’s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.REGN-COV2’s two antibodies bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein to prevent infection.REGN-COV2 has also moved into the Phase 2/3 portion of two adaptive Phase 1/2/3 trials testing the cocktail’s ability to treat hospitalised and non-hospitalised (ambulatory) patients with Covid-19. These trials will involve 1,850 hospitalised patients and 1,050 ambulatory patients at 150 sites in the US, Brazil, Mexico and Chile. The preliminary data expected later this summer, according to Regeneron.“We are running simultaneous adaptive trials in order to move as quickly as possible to provide a potential solution to prevent and treat Covid-19 infections, even in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic,” Dr George D. Yancopoulos, co-founder, president and chief scientific officer of Regeneron, said in the company’s news release.Regeneron’s antibody cocktail will be tested in four separate study populations, which included hospitalised Covid-19 patients; people with mild disease; healthy people at a high risk for getting infected; and healthy people who have come into close contact with a person who is sick.US-based pharma giant Eli Lilly and Canada-based AbCellera have also started testing their antibody treatment in humans June 1.Multi-centric studies to evaluate the off-label use of the anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody drug Tocilizumab to treat Covid-19 began in India last month. This second-line drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and works by lowering aberrant host immune response that leads to inflammatory cytokine storm and death in hospitalised Covid-19 patients. Inflammatory cytokine storm stops oxygenation by impeding gas exchange in the lungs, leading to death.“Tocilizumab is already available, licenced and effective in treating cytokine release syndrome caused by other conditions. The Covid-19 trial is going well, the recruitment is at the halfway mark within a month. We have recruited around 90 of the 180 patients for treatment across 14 hospitals in 10 cities, and hope to complete recruitment by the end of July and get initial data by August 15,” said Dr Arvinder Soin, national lead, Indian multi-centre trial on Tocilizumab in moderate and severe Covid-19.The trial will be conducted in several hospitals in Delhi-NCR, Haryana, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. “Off-label use for Tocilizumab is approved for moderate to severe patients whose condition is worsening, and the trial is an attempt to evaluate whether the drug will also prevent the progression of stable moderate disease to severe Covid-19 needing oxygen or ventilator,” said Dr Soin, who is also chairman, Medanta Liver Institute, Medanta, Gurugram.“The trial will show if it works or not. I think we should give science a chance to provide evidence-based data, so that we can ensure fair access to all to the most effective treatments against Covid-19,” said Dr Soin.Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody trials will be a part of the NIAID’s newly launched Covid-19 Prevention Trials Network (COVPN) to test vaccines and other treatments against Covid-19 through the merger of four previously existing clinical trials networks that focused on HIV/Aids. COVPN is a functional unit of Operation Warp Speed, the US federal partnership focused on speeding the development and delivery of COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine, which was developed jointly with NIAID, is expected to be tested in the first phase 3 clinical trial conducted through COVPN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lab-made-antibody-trials-show-promise/story-GQDrmNUmTWkSLJ4RPVQKfN.html
11-07-2020||India||Vikas Dubey encounter brings politics-crime link under lens||In the mid-1980s, two independent candidates, Hari Shakar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi, walked into the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha straight from jail. They had comfortably won their seats with the tacit support of the Congress.Tiwari was lodged in Agra jail and Shahi in Fatehgarh, hundreds of km away from their electoral arena in Maharajganj of east UP,. While Shahi was gunned down later in the 1990s, Tiwari continued his winning spree, becoming a minister in various governments.The trendsetters belonged to the two castes – Brahmins and Thakurs -- that had dominated the electoral politics of the state till Mayawati, Kalyan Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav emerged in the 1990s.But two constants remained. One, candidates with criminal antecedents continued to win elections . Some criminals fought as independent candidates, others as official nominees of the political parties. Two, all the criminals were self-styled Robin Hoods with similar career trajectories: a small begining by bullying or befriending cops at the local level and helping people out by funding weddings; building their empire with support from local politicians; living in huge safe bungalows with luxurious vehicles and protected by an army of supporters; and creating an aura of terror. Money came from lucrative contract business -- basically, they got a cut off everything. Over the decades, politicians and governments turned a blind eye to the growing influence of such gangsters -- instead tapping them for this very influence during elections . And people knocked on their doors as governments failed to redress their grievances.No government or leader could ignore them -- or their power and influence. Former BJP chief minister Kalyan Singh, a tough administrator, included Raguraj Pratap Singh in his government in 1998. Raghuraj Singh was on the run till his swearing in Raj Bhawan. The Samajwadi Party’s Mulayam Singh Yadav formed a government in 2003 and included Singh in it. The recommendations of the Election Commission were thrown to the wind in the distribution of tickets. Winnability became the prime factor in selection of candidates. In 2017 as many as 143 out of 403 members of the Vidhan Sabha had criminal cases against them. Interestingly, some do fall out of the favour.Mukhtar Ansari , a five time MLA and former MP Atiq Ahmad, are facing the heat under the present dispensation with CM Yogi Adityanath out to demolish their empires . Raghuraj Pratap Singh and his father were hounded by Mayawati and are currently lying low. Like many others, the Singhs are connected to every party. DP Yadav who ruled the roost in west UP was denied ticket by Akhilesh Yadav in 2012. He has been languishing in the backwaters.Prof DNS Yadav of Lucknow University says: “ Politicization of criminals started during Indira Gandhi days when parties started taking their help to win elections. Thereafter started criminalization of politics - instead of supporting candidates, criminals decided to themselves contest and win elections.”Vikas Dubey, too, had a huge following, especially in his caste group (he is a Brahmin) but he did not contest elections. He took membership of BSP in 1996 but could never get a ticket to contest. He was convicted in a murder case. But his wife is independent member of zila panchayat, an indication of his clout. The empire that he built would not have been possible without the support of the administration; Dubey had 60 criminal cases against him and had been convicted in a murder case.Former DGP and chief of UP Election Watch, I C Dewedi told HT once that “the leaders of mainstream political parties talk of clean and crime-free politics but to win elections they give tickets to criminals with money and muscle power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/politics-crime-link-under-lens/story-OOKqFETjnJcZmjgggjGd9J.html
11-07-2020||India||Encounter killings violate rule of law, says plea in SC||Killing of accused by police under the garb of encounter is a serious violation of the rule of law and amounts to “Talibanisation of the country”, a plea filed before the Supreme Court said on Friday, while seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the encounter killings of Uttar Pradesh gangster Vikas Dubey’s aides.The plea was filed by Mumbai-based advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay hours before Dubey himself was killed after he allegedly tried to escape from police custody on Friday morning. The plea raised concerns that Dubey, too, would suffer the same fate.“...there is every possibility that even accused Vikas Dubey shall be killed by Uttar Pradesh Police like other co-accused once his custody is obtained by Uttar Pradesh Police,” the petition stated.Besides seeking a CBI probe into the killings of the co-accused, Upadhyay also prayed that adequate security should be provided for Dubey so that he can be dealt with as per law.Apart from Dubey, five people from his gang been killed in separate encounters in Kanpur, Etawah and Hamirpur.Upadhyay likened encounter killings to what is depicted in the cop movie “Singham”.“A new tendency is now gaining ground in the rank and file of police machinery of arresting the accused alleged to be involved in heinous crimes and then killing the accused under the guise of encounter and then becoming movie cop ‘Singham’. (It) needs to be nipped in the bud at the earliest to save the country from becoming Taliban,” the plea said.Dubey was killed near Kanpur on Friday morning. The gangster was being brought back by the UP Police from Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, where he was arrested a day ago. Dubey had been on the run since the killing of eight policemen by his men in Bikru village near Kanpur city on July 3. “Though it cannot be denied the act of the accused of killing eight policemen is extremely heinous crime, yet the accused were required to be dealt with as per law and upon their guilt being proved after full-fledged trial, they could have been convicted even for death sentence,” Upadhyay’s petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/encounter-killings-violate-rule-of-law-says-plea-in-sc/story-8Lj3mo7ZvgJZG7WEThqixM.html
11-07-2020||India||Questions mark close encounter||Retired police officials, experts and human rights activists have said that Vikas Dubey’s death on Friday morning raises disturbing questions about the procedures followed by the Uttar Pradesh (UP) police; casts a shadow on its integrity and professionalism; points to the existence of a “strong lobby” which did not want to see him alive; and undermines potential investigations into the larger political-crime nexus in the state. They have also demanded an independent probe, and possibly a judicial enquiry, into the killing. Dubey was arrested in Ujjain on Thursday, and then taken by the UP police back to his home town of Kanpur, when on Friday morning, the police alleged that he sought to escape when the car transporting him overturned and was killed in an “encounter”. A former director general in the Kerala Police, NC Asthana, said he could point to glaring loopholes in the police’s story about the sequence of events. “The car overturned but one cannot see any skid marks near the vehicle. The street was wet but there were no skid marks. It is impossible that Dubey was the first person to be able to come out of the car after it overturned. Were there police officers inside the car? Why did the police not handcuff him if he was a notorious gangster? Also, why would Dubey try to flee in a place where there were only open fields all around? And above all Dubey’s mask was intact despite the accident, running and the shootout.”Asthana said that the story was somewhat similar in the case of Dubey’s associates, who too were shot dead. “Even they supposedly took the police’s weapons while fleeing. All this casts a shadow on the work of the UP police.” He added that the UP police had lost a great opportunity in getting Dubey convicted for the murder of the eight policemen. “His conviction would have set an example but all that is gone now.”Prakash Singh, who was the chief of the UP police between 1991 and 1993, and has been a key votary of police reforms, said he could not comment if the shootout was staged or genuine but expressed disappointment over the police’s handling of the case. “I am disappointed. Even if the encounter was genuine, let me say that there should have been no need for a shootout. Why was he not brought on a flight? He would have been a mine of information on the nexus between criminals, police and the powers that be.” Singh added that he had a feeling that there was a “strong lobby” within both the government, and the Opposition too, that did not want Dubey alive. “But I do not know. There could be a possibility (that he was killed in a genuine encounter). But what happened today was unfortunate and disappointing.”Human rights lawyers and activists too expressed their concern at the incident, but also pointed to the larger pattern of custodial violence, extra judicial killings and lack of accountability of the police, and demanded a probe. Sanjoy Hazarika, international director of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, said that Dubey could have given valuable evidence to unearth the nexus between police, criminals and the powers that shielded him. “What happened on Friday morning is the stuff of reel life. There needs to be a detailed accounting of the events from the time of his arrest to his death. The details of the post-mortem report need to be published and the National Human Rights Commission needs to move quickly on this case asking for accountability. It has raised key issues of due process and custodial violence.”Colin Gonsalves, a lawyer who has fought a range of human rights cases and is the founder of the Human Rights Law Network, said that under the Code of Criminal Procedure section 176(1)(A), a judicial enquiry should be conducted to find out what led to Dubey’s death. “The law is clear. The enquiry must be held by a judicial magistrate and not an executive magistrate or special investigation team. Has an judicial magistrate been appointed to look into it? The facts point out towards an extra judicial killing.” He emphasised that the UP government must follow the law and probe the chain of events because if a person had been killed in police custody, then it was a “heinous crime”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/questions-mark-close-encounter/story-oxlYI2be6c1IqehlMntpYI.html

Even for those who stayed back in the cities of work, the absence of income would have meant reduced access to sanitary napkins.“So we thought about it and started looking for someone who could provide sanitary napkins,” said Bengaluru-based Soans (44) who heads an event management company called Goldrush Entertainment. “And it struck us, why not just make them ourselves? We could employ women daily wage earners, teach them how to make the pads, and then hand the pads out free.”At the beginning of the lockdown, in March, Soans launched an initiative called World Hunger Warriors. His aim was to connect people in his extensive network who wanted to donate funds, food, cooking equipment, space, ingredients, fuel or labour.Watch | HT Salutes: Bangalore initiative that helps women make reusable sanitary pads He now has a network of 50 apartment kitchens and four commercial kitchens making the food and over 100 volunteers hand out cooked meals to migrant workers and other underprivileged people in Bengaluru. It was through this network that he heard of the urgent need for sanitary pads.Searching for companies that manufactured reusable pads, he stumbled upon Stonesoup, and reached out. He didn’t want to buy their product, he told them. But could they help him figure out how he could make his own?Stonesoup agreed to help. The design the two settled on was a durable, washable waterproof jacket, to be provided by the company; the women would make the cotton cloth inserts. Each jacket would be handed out with a set of five inserts. The whole thing could be washed, sunned and reused multiple times.“We settled on this design because the washable inserts look like regular cloth napkins and can be hung out to dry in the sun without stigma attached,” Soans said.WHW now works with 50 women in Yelahanka and Sarjapur, most of whom previously worked on construction sites. Soans sources korra cotton from local traders and the women, with a little training, have begun production. They call the pads Shaktipack.It’s a relatively slow process, since quality checks take time, but since the end of April, the women have made 200 Shaktipack pads; 55 were distributed on July 1. “We use our production units in Dindigul for the leakproof jackets, because those require machines to put together, but the inserts are easy to hand-stitch,” says Smita Kulkarni, co-founder of Stonesoup. “It feels like a great way to be involved.”Sheela Manu, 26, a construction site labourer who has used the pad, said she prefers them to the low-cost disposable ones she had been using. “These are more comfortable, especially in summer,” she added.WHW has started a fundraising campaign on crowd-sourcing website, Ketto.org, called ‘ShaktiPack4Women’ to raise money that would enable them to employ 500 women and make over 5,000 sanitary.“The women say the pads are comfortable and give them security. We hope the campaign works out and we find a way to continue this into the future,” Soans said.Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you 15 stories of HT Salutes.

11-07-2020||India||Dangerous dependence on China: House panel||The parliamentary panel on science and technology, in its first meeting since the Covid-19 outbreak, on Friday discussed the “dangerous dependence” on key Chinese imports in domestic pharma industry and the urgent need to get rid of these imports, functionaries familiar with the matter said.The Jairam Ramesh-led panel also discussed how making a vaccine for the pathogen before August 15 would “not be possible anywhere in the world” — a reference to a letter last week by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that suggested this possibility but later clarified it as a motivator of innovation, and not as a hard deadline.The meeting, which lasted more than three hours and included inputs from top scientific minds, also discussed the need to produce low-cost health equipment including ventilators, which are in high demand in the wake of the pandemic.Though only six out of 30 members could attend the meeting, the department of biotechnology, science and technology and the Prime Minister’s principal scientific adviser, K VijayRaghavan, gave presentations to the committee on India’s Covid-19 preparedness. “The focus was vaccines, drugs, pharmaceuticals and health equipment,” said a member of the panel.The focus on pharmaceutical imports from China assumes significance in the backdrop of the bloody clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Galwan Valley on June 15. Over the past few weeks, New Delhi has taken a series of measures to curb Chinese investments and contracts.In a written reply to Parliament last year, the government had said that from 20016 to 2019, more than 65% of India imports of bulk drugs and drug intermediates came from China. Replying to Trinamool Congress’s Mala Roy, the chemicals and fertilizer ministry had also said that “imports from China are due to economic considerations”, indicating that they were available at cheaper rates.According to a member of the panel who was present in the meeting, the “urgent need for research and development efforts to rid ourselves of Chinese dependence was also discussed threadbare”.In the discussion on an India-made vaccine, the panel members felt that if a vaccine has to come before August 15, it would mean that trials, tests and safety protocols would’ve been short-circuited.There was also a discussion on how India can make more affordable medical equipment, especially ventilators at a price range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. Functionaries also said that panel chairman, Jairam Ramesh, pointed out that “health security is as critical as defence security”.Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, who often faced demands from MPs for online meetings in recent weeks, said he was glad that standing committees under the Rajya Sabha have resumed functioning.“The corona pandemic did cast a shadow on the working of these committees, which function on behalf of Parliament. All concerned were keen about the resumption of work by these committees. But the delay was forced by circumstances beyond our control,” he said.He added that committee on home affairs, also under the Rajya Sabha, will meet next week after an earlier meeting could not be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dangerous-dependence-on-china-house-panel/story-Cuh4vOBG7kpP6Y3erCsIDJ.html
11-07-2020||India||Laying fibre cable tops PM’s job plan||An unusual but necessary and apt (given the times) activity has emerged the source of the most work in the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Yojna, the ambitious jobs-for-migrants scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 20 -- the laying of optic fibre cables. In the three weeks since its launch, the government has spent Rs 6,000 crore on the scheme on which it plans to spend a total of Rs 50,000 crore in 125 days, providing jobs to millions of daily wage workers who returned to homes in the Indian hinterland from cities in the wake of the coronavirus disease and the lockdown imposed to slow its spread. A total of 59.8 million days of work has been created across a bouquet of 25 schemes—clubbed to create the programme—in the three weeks, indicating, according to government officials who asked not to be named, the demand for work in rural areas. Of this, laying optic fibre cables generated the most work, and accounted for 93,390 activities (or work lots) according to government data. Details of how many man days this translated into were not immediately available. construction of houses for rural poor, which got off to a slow start, accounted for 64,756 activities. This comes at a time when a lot of daily activities have moved online, even in rural India, in the wake the coronavirus disease.The government estimates that at least 7.5 million migrant workers returned home due to the pandemic and the national lockdown. Policymakers scrambled to tweak plans and resources as rural India saw heavy demand for work while construction in some urban centres faced paucity of labourers. Demand for work under the goverment’s flagship rural guarantee scheme has soared. According to government data, 67.2 million individuals have already worked and 227,000 households have completed their entire quota of 100 days of work.The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Yojna was crafted last month to offer work to migrant labourers and, at the same time, focusing on key priorities. With around 60% of the workers having worked in the construction sector -- the government conducted a large survey to assess this -- the scheme was heavily loaded with similar opportunities.Interestingly, the data shows that two flagship schemes— the Jal Jeevan mission and Urja Ganga, —are yet to generate any work. While the Jal Jeevan mission aims to supply water to all houses, Urja Ganga aims to buid a piped network of cooking gas.The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Yojna and MGNREGA are the two major sources of jobs in rural India at this point in time. Together, they have a budget of Rs 2 lakh crore .Former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra said, “The rozgar scheme was envisaged to help migrant workers get livelihood in this crisis period. It is helpful but the ground reports suggest that many migrant workers are going back to their old workstations in cities and many of them are unwilling to take up hard manual work in rural areas. So, we may see a lot of existing workforce in villages taking up some of these works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/laying-fibre-cable-tops-pm-s-job-plan/story-QtLfhX0giUG2i4zJ0zIp8J.html
