Everyone wants to know if the development of antibodies in asymptomatic and those recovered prove that they are protected from the virus. Can such people get reinfected, and if they do, will it be mild or a more severe disease? Last week, three studies enhanced the understanding of the involvement of host immunity to coronaviruses in general, and the Sars-CoV-2 virus in particular. A study from the King’s College London of longitudinal evaluation of antibodies in 90 virus-positive health care workers showed that 60% of the participants developed “potent” antibody response that peaked three weeks after they developed symptoms. This fell to 17% three months later. In fact, some individuals no longer had any trace of antibodies. The study showed that the level of antibodies was depleted by as much as 23-fold in 90 days after infection. This observation highlights the point that the best time to obtain convalescent plasma for therapy is between four to six weeks after the appearance of symptoms.Similar observations of loss of antibody immunity were recorded in a Spanish study, involving 70,000 people. At least 14% of those tested positive later turned negative; the loss of immunity being most common among those who never developed symptoms. These observations raise questions on the ability to tackle the virus in the short-to-medium term. The vanishing antibodies are a reminder that their presence in Covid-19 does not mean guaranteed protection. These findings align with observations from Germany and China and dampen hopes of long-term immunity in those recovering from the infection. They also have implications for the development of a vaccine and the question about reinfection. Do depleting antibodies signify that the person doesn’t have immunity anymore? What about the cell-mediated immunity, involving killer T-cells, often referred to as the immune warriors? These cells are a part of the human immune response against viral infections due to their ability to kill infected cells. Until now, we had a limited understanding of the involvement of T-cells in immunity against Sars-CoV-2, but it is possible that these cells play a pivotal role in protection. The question is whether we can use T-cell responses as indicators of immunity? An interesting feature of immunity to Sars-CoV-2 virus is that a reasonably good number of non-exposed individuals may already have immunity from previous exposure to coronaviruses, of which at least six are known to infect humans. Of these four are endemically transmitted and cause the common cold, while the other two, Sars-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have caused limited epidemics of pneumonia in 2003 and 2017, respectively. An online paper from the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore published in Nature on July 15 makes two important points: One, in addition to neutralising antibodies, all of the recovered Covid-19 patients were found to have Sars-CoV-2-specific T-cells, which suggests that these play an important role in this infection. Second, patients recovered 17 years after the 2003 outbreak still possessed long-lasting memory T-cells that displayed cross-immunity to Sars-CoV-2. The discovery is promising because other studies have also suggested that even though antibodies may fade within months, the all protective army of T-cells can stay in circulation for years. It is important to note that the 2003 Sars-CoV-1 infection also originated through animal-to-human transmission in the Guangdong province of southern China. It reached its peak in late May 2003, affecting other areas such as Toronto, Hong Kong, Taipei, Singapore and Hanoi and killed about one in 10 infected people. In all, there were just over 8,000 cases and about 700 deaths. It disappeared in a matter of months and by July 2003, the World Health Organization declared the threat over. Interestingly Sars-C0V-1 and Sars-C0V-2 are closely related, with about 80% of their genome being identical. It is possible that much of the population in China and other Sars-CoV-1 affected areas still enjoy long- lasting immunity and have largely been spared of the current pandemic. The Singapore study highlights that the endemic coronaviruses trigger both T-cell and IgG antibody activity. More good news comes from Oxford where the phase I human trials of their Covid-19 vaccine have shown that it generates an immune response that may offer a “double defence” against the virus. It stimulated the body to produce both antibodies and “killer T-cells”. Resistance to infection may accrue from previous exposure not only to seasonal endemic coronaviruses, but also other microbes, all of whom trigger both T-cell and antibody activity. For instance, the Indian population has been exposed to a vast variety of pathogens, leading to the generation of broad specific memory T-cells, ready to confer protection from new invaders. It will be interesting to screen the exposed, uninfected subjects to examine the presence of both neutralising antibodies and killer-T cells that can protect against Covid-19 infection.A third very interesting study, again from the University of Oxford on July 16, suggests that a large degree of regional variation, observed in seroprevalence and cumulative deaths, is attributable to innate host resistance leading to significant reduction in expected mortality. It is encouraging that in a matter of only a few months, literally thousands of studies have appeared in peer-reviewed high- impact journals explaining immunity to Covid-19; it is still not clear whether the asymptomatic and symptomatic people have different or similar grades of immune responses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-twin-tales-of-vanishing-antibodies-robust-t-cells/story-RqZd6GsW04vvKo5dvZDn4M.html
23-07-2020||News||It is time to move India’s higher education online | Opinion||Education plays a dominant role in addressing the challenges a country faces and coming up with possible solutions. This has the potential to make a country self-reliant and resilient. While we understand the need for a greater share of public funding for supporting education, a country such as India needs to evolve innovative methods to spread mass education within the available resources. Undoubtedly, there is an increasing social demand for accessible, affordable and good quality higher education as the increasing gross enrolment ratio (GER) indicates. Covid-19 has given us the opportunity to reflect upon what should be the structures of higher educational institutes (HEIs), and in what forms we can ensure accessible education during and after the pandemic. Those who question the need for adopting online education even post the pandemic should look no further than the non-equity in most of HEIs’ admission policies, which are based on elimination rather than selection. I see two arguments advanced against adopting online education. One, the issue of the digital divide. This criticism is not as reliable as it may first appear. While it is true that Internet access has to improve, statistics tell a different story. In 2020, the Internet penetration rate in India is 50%, and is rapidly increasing.The good news is that the National Broadband Mission (NBM) is progressing fast enough to provide access to every village by 2022. NBM is expected to enable all rural and remote areas to have equitable and universal access to broadband services. In the near future, three million km of optical fibre cable will be laid and the towers are expected to increase from the existing 565,000 to one million. The speeds are expected to reach 50 mbps. Therefore, broadband Internet connectivity will not be a hindrance in providing online education in the future. In India, mobile data charges too are at least 30 times lower than the global average, making it cheaper to access digital content.The second argument is the belief that we cannot recreate the physical classroom experience. Therefore, some critics say that the online mode of education will dilute the quality of education. Unfortunately, the dilution is already embedded in the physical mode of teaching, with most students playing only a passive role in the classroom. This is one of the reasons why the teaching-learning outcomes in many HEIs are not up to the mark. The lack of student engagement and positive interactions through discussions in the classroom has led to the present situation, leading to increased absenteeism and poor performance by the students. We need to set this right before we criticise online education. Further, we should not import the bad practices of the physical classroom to the online classroom. And this is the right time to do it correctly by redressing the shortcomings of the past.When we shift to online education, more attention needs to be paid on how we impart it. Online education can happen in two parts. First, at their own leisure and pace, students will go through the digital resources made available to them. Second, students can interact with the teachers in real-time live online classes, discussing what they have already studied from guided online resources. It is in the second part that, teachers can play an important role. The teaching can be made enquiry or discovery-based, through inclusive and active involvement of students. Moving to online classrooms gives us the opportunity to create “non-didactic flipped classrooms” as students are expected to attend these after having gone through the pre-lecture materials. This is what we also call blended learning. We could have done this in the physical classrooms too but we missed the bus riding on outdated practices. But nothing stops us from implementing a flipped classroom in online mode. As many people assume, HEIs do not necessarily need to possess state-of-the-art technology and lecture recording systems to be able to offer online courses. There are many educational technology companies which can provide the technologies for recording, editing, hosting online courses and arranging proctored evaluations while HEIs can work on pedagogy, curriculum, teacher training and improvement of the quality of education. This is also an opportunity for public-private partnership (PPP) in higher education.HEIs must embark on offering skill-oriented online degrees, diplomas and certificate programmes. This is where prospective industries can join hands with the HEIs in designing the curriculum and offering job guarantees to the enrolled students provided their performance record crosses the desirable threshold. Being funded by non-governmental resources through PPP is the best guarantee for academic and financial independence of HEIs. The Institutes of Eminence and other HEIs with top National Institutional Ranking Framework scores should mandatorily offer skill- oriented online programmes at a moderate tuition fee. This way, online education has the potential to enhance the social mobility of those who could not easily access quality education from premier HEIs. Covid-19 has provided us the opportunity to be flexible in higher education replacing the ineffective educational practices that we have clung on to for too long. Maintaining quality in online programmes is important, but this should be done through appropriate mechanisms within HEIs rather than one-fits-all regulations. The greater the initiatives in online education from reputed HEIs, the more likely these will be accepted by students, teachers, parents and employers. In India, the time has never been better for HEIs to re-invent themselves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/it-is-time-to-move-india-s-higher-education-online/story-1zSRnoUCJWYjRb5cfoXBMK.html
23-07-2020||News||Safeguarding the autonomy of tribunals||On August 2, 2001, former law minister, Arun Jaitley, stated before Parliament that the government was considering establishing a central tribunals division within the ministry of law and justice, an independent supervisory body to bring uniformity for all tribunals. This was in the wake of the seven-judge Constitution Bench decision of the Supreme Court (SC) in the L Chandra Kumar vs Union of India case.It is 2020, but neither the vision of the then law minister, nor the dicta of the Constitution Bench have been realised. On the contrary, the current state of tribunals in the nation, and the burgeoning workload of SC, point towards an opposite approach of what was expected. While quashing a set of rules promulgated in 2017 by the government administering the functioning of tribunals, SC on November 13, 2019, in Rojer Mathew vs South Indian Bank, had directed that fresh rules be issued in line with various past decisions on tribunalisation. New rules were then published in February 2020, but unfortunately, these carry out only cosmetic changes and contravene the law laid down by SC on this subject.Some of these provisions are jarring. The new rules do not remove the control of parent administrative ministries over tribunals, that is, those ministries against which the tribunals have to pass orders. This majorly affects certain tribunals such as the Armed Forces Tribunal wherein it functions under the same ministry which is the first opposite party in litigation and which also wields rule-making powers and controls finances, infrastructure and manpower. Needless to state, SC in the cases of L Chandra Kumar (1997), R Gandhi (2010), Madras Bar Association (2014) and Swiss Ribbons (2019) has ruled that tribunals cannot be made to function under the ministries against which they are to pass orders and they must be placed under the law ministry instead. Shockingly, even complaints against members of tribunals can be made to the same parent ministries as per these rules. It’s worth recalling that when the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was created in 1941, it was put under the finance department, but moved to the legislative department a year later to ensure its independence. This arrangement continues till date, and is perhaps the primary reason that it is one of the best-performing tribunals.The new rules also ensure that the secretary of the ministry against which the tribunal is to pass orders sits on the committee for selecting adjudicating members of the same tribunal, a system which was termed as “mockery of the Constitution” by SC in Madras Bar Association. The selection committee under the new rules can even function in absence of any constituent, meaning thereby that a committee entirely (or majorly) comprising officers of the executive can select members of tribunals. The new rules provide for a retirement age of 65 years even for former judges who retire at 62 from the high courts (HCs), which gives them at best a three-year tenure. This is against the minimum five to seven years tenure mandated by SC in the R Gandhi case to ensure continuity. The new rules again contain ambiguous clauses stating that any person with experience in economics, commerce, management, industry and administration can be appointed as a member of certain tribunals and that even members with non-judicial/legal background can become chairpersons, while both these aspects were held impermissible in the R Gandhi case. Even the bar on employment with the government after retiring from tribunals has been removed, thereby gravely affecting the independence of members. Unless steps are taken in compliance with the law laid down by SC for tribunals, neither their independence nor their ability to reduce the burden on the regular judiciary can be guaranteed. Tribunals must not be seen as an extension of the executive. Further, in order to de-clutter SC of unnecessary burden and make justice affordable and accessible, it needs to be ensured that the high courts, being equally effective constitutional courts, practically become the last and final court in most litigation. The decisions of HCs must not be used as mere stepping stones towards SC for (especially rich) litigants. If required, the intra-court appellate jurisdiction from a single bench to a division bench within HC can be widened, catering to more subject matters. SC must be allowed to focus only on constitutional points of law of general public importance, Centre-state/inter-state disputes or where there is a major conflict between decisions of two or more high courts. “Special Leave to Appeal” may be extended only to really “special” cases. These measures will not only provide consistency and stability but also promote judicial discipline. As also held by SC, the system must not burden the highest court of the land with deciding on routine and innocuous matters, for example, whether a consumer should be paid 10% or 12% interest, or whether a maintenance of ~30,000 or ~32, 000 is enough for an estranged spouse. SC must be left with only quality work consistent with its eminence and majesty.

Taking note of this, Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) has written to the UT administration asking to penalise those found guilty of overcharging. CRAWFED chairman Hitesh Puri said, “Even though the market committee is releasing the list on a daily basis, vendors were selling items at a much higher price as compared with the capped price. Around two to three vendors per sector were designated by the municipal corporation (MC) who said that they provide a better quality of vegetables and that’s why they overcharge.” He said that he has to pay about ₹10 extra as per the pre-approved rates.General secretary of Sector 19C resident welfare association (RWA) Yashpal Kapoor said, “Vendors are fleecing residents of our area. They are selling items two times more than the price fixed by the UT market committee. Some vendors said that they are overcharging as earlier CTU buses would transport vegetables and now they have to do it spending money from their pocket.”For example, some vendors were selling tomato for ₹60 per kg. The wholesale price for tomato is ₹32-36 per kg, while the fixed price is ₹50 per kg. Cauliflower was being sold at ₹55 per kg by vendors, against its fixed price of ₹40 per kg.Speaking about wholesale prices, Rashwinder Singh who works as the auction recorder at the wholesale market said that wholesale prices had gone down, and spells of rain in Punjab had left prices unaffected. “These days a lot of our vegetables including potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower, etc are coming from Himachal Pradesh. The supply chain has improved after the lockdown so prices are on the lower side.” Officials of the market committee said that while prices are fixed, ensuring that vendors follow the rate list was the MC’s duty and demanded the civic body inspectors to challan those who overcharge customers.Vendors flouting Covid normsMany residents are also claiming that vegetable vendors are flouting social distancing rules, and not wearing masks properly even as Covid-19 cases in the city has touched 800-mark. Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) secretary Ranvinder Singh Gill said, “In the northern sectors there are only a few houses yet so many vegetable vendors pass through our house. They can be seen without masks. The police need to take action against such vendors.”Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Charanjit Singh Virk said that although the police weren’t targeting anyone specifically, people seen without masks including vegetable vendors were being challaned in a drive undertaken by the police.Rates at which vegetables were sold on ThursdayTomato- wholesale price- ₹32-36 per kg, Market committee price- ₹50 per kg, vendor price ₹60 per kgCauliflower- wholesale price- ₹10-25 per kg, Market committee price- ₹40 per kg, vendor price ₹55 per kgCapsicum- wholesale price- ₹15-25 per kg, Market committee price- ₹40 per kg, vendor price ₹60 per kgGreen chilies- wholesale price-₹8-9 per kg, Market committee price- ₹30 per kg, vendor price ₹40 per kg||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rates-fixed-but-vendors-sell-vegetables-at-higher-price-in-chandigarh/story-jZPFUqJkD8oPXF8GUkTJ6L.html

They are trying to ascertain how the accused made the stamp or if the doctor is also involved in the crime.The fraud came to light after Avneet Saini, a Sector 44 resident, informed the police that he had got an insurance policy issued through the accused and paid him ₹2,000. However, on checking the policy online, he found it to be a fake.Acting on this, the police arrested Suraj Pal and registered a case under sections 420, 468, 472 and 474 of the IPC against him at the Sector 17 police station.During interrogation, Suraj Pal revealed that he had issued 25 fake policies so far and charged ₹2,000 for each. The accused had also taken a cyber café on rent in Sector 44 where he used to make the fake insurance policies. Police have also seized Pal’s computer, scanner and register, and are verifying the involvement of others in the fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/agent-sells-fake-insurance-for-luxury-cars-in-chandigarh-held/story-LJUKsVXNt1eokEPxWnhoXN.html
23-07-2020||City||Mohali resident booked for duping his friend of ₹55 lakh||The district police on Thursday booked a person for allegedly duping his friend of ₹55 lakh on the pretext of seeking financial help. The accused has been identified as Balvir Singh of Phase 1 in Mohali.As per the complainant, Pradeep Kumar of Sector 20 in Chandigarh, Balvir was his good friend of 15 years so when he asked for ₹50 lakh to send his daughter abroad, Pradeep gave him the money. However, Balvir didn’t return the amount despite several requests. Later, the accused asked for ₹5 lakh more saying that he needed to get a bank loan passed. He assured Pradeep to return his money once he got the loan, but failed to do so. Subsequently, Balvir stopped answering his calls and his family members threatened of committing suicide and blaming it on Pradeep if he ever asked for the money.On May 13, the accused signed a self-declaration form in which he mentioned that he would return the entire amount to Pradeep by July 2, but all in vain.Pradeep then submitted a complaint to Mohali SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal following which a case was been registered against the accused under sections 420 and 406 of the IPC at Phase 1 police station.Inspector Manphul Singh said, “A raid was conducted at the accused’s house, but he was not there. He is at large and we will arrest him soon. It was found that another cheating case had been registered against him in the past.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-resident-booked-for-duping-his-friend-of-55-lakh/story-NeAp1eMaWDLdbYv74DLZqL.html

They have to compulsorily comply with the SOPs issued by the central government, Chandigarh administration and the college institution.Also, it is mandatory for the students to install Arogya Setu application in their mobile phones.A PEC official said these students will be accommodated in different wings of the hostels so that social distancing norms are followed and they will be allowed to go out of the premises once a week with permission from the authorities. No sports and cultural activity will take place during this time.For the online teaching process, PEC has recommended Google Classroom for teachers, but they can use a platform of their own choice. For this semester, PEC will not engage teachers on ad hoc basis since there is no such requirement. “We have a few ad hoc teachers and will not engage more this semester until such need arises,” said the PEC director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pec-students-with-internet-issues-back-home-to-put-up-in-hostels/story-PnU1bCWx10Tiuc0y752gdL.html
23-07-2020||City||After home isolation nod, focus now on increasing L2, L3 category beds||The Ghaziabad district administration is focusing its efforts to increase beds in its L2 and L3 category hospitals, which cater to Covid-19 patients with moderate and mild symptoms, respectively.The move comes after a nudge by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister’s office to ramp up the bed infrastructure across the state. Officials said that with home isolation facility having been granted by the government on July 20, L1 category hospitals — which were meant to treat asymptomatic patients — will be required less now.The Ghaziabad administration on July 20 gave its nod for home isolation of asymptomtic patients, after assessment by rapid response teams. Prior to the government’s home isolation order, all patients, including asymptomatic ones, were admitted to dedicated L1, L2 or L3 hospitals depending on the severity of their health condition.The UP government overall has about 1.5 lakh L1, L2 and L3 hospital beds at present.“The CM has asked to increase the number of beds in L2 and L3 Covid hospitals and has said that ventilators should remain functional. He has asserted that treatment of any patients should not be affected for want or medicine. In this regard, adequate quantity of medicines should be available with all the hospitals,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).In Ghaziabad, the district health department has three L1 facilities — ESIC Hospital at Sahibabad, Divyajyoti Hospital at Niwari and SRM College at Modinagar.“Since we have started the process of home isolation, we expect that majority of asymptomatic patients who were admitted to L1 hospitals will now move to home isolation. We will now assess the decline in number of patients at L1 hospitals for about 15 days or so. Our entire focus now will be on betterment and increase of beds under L2 and L3 category hospitals,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate.He added that the district administration about a fortnight ago had also sent a proposal to the government for converting the Haj House near river Hindon as a Covid care facility for asymptomatic patients, with about 1,200 beds.“With home isolation in place, we may not require the Haj House facility now. I have already directed for converting the ESIC Hospital into an L2 hospital which will allow us to add 100 more L2 category beds. Further, more private hospitals, having super specialty treatment, have been asked to dedicate their hospitals or one of the wings for paid Covid treatment. This will help us rope in more L2 and L3 beds with ventilator facilities,” Pandey added.Sources said that the administration may do away with SRM College facility once the home isolation facility reaches optimum level and all the patients admitted there get discharged as per discharge guidelines.The officials said that the doctors in Ghaziabad are also getting inputs for treatment from their seniors posted at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences at Lucknow,a s well as getting online help from other senior doctors for better treatment.The official sources in the health department said that the government has already acquired a private medical college in Pilkhuwa (Hapur district) where patients with moderate and severe symptoms can be sent under the concept of ‘bed pooling.’“For sending our patients there, we require government order which is expected soon,” Pandey said.Under the bed pooling, officials have planned identification of medical colleges under the Meerut division where patients can be referred to if beds are not vacant in any of the districts.According to the officials, Ghaziabad may need a total of 100 to 150 ICU beds as cases are rising in the district. At present, the district has only 33 ICU beds in government facilities and another 13 ICU beds reserved in private hospitals, they said.In Ghaziabad, the officials at present have identified about 4,816 L1 category beds, 1,026 L2/L3 beds, 117 ICU beds and 1,096 beds having oxygen facilities. Out of these, 876 L1 beds, 1026 L2/L3 beds, 117 ICU and 1096 beds having oxygen and are already fully operational.In government sector in Ghaziabad, only 33 ICU beds are available at L2/L3 hospitals. In private , the district has 544 beds which are available in eight private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-home-isolation-nod-focus-now-on-increasing-l2-l3-category-beds/story-Bgs9rvF8jB9mJOEEvVZYRK.html
23-07-2020||City||Positivity rate declines as Ghaziabad increases rapid antigen testing||The test positivity rate (TPR) in Ghaziabad has been on the decline over the past month, ever since the district ramped up rapid antigen testing that had started on June 26. While officials said various measures have helped bring about the decline, it was too early to assume that the disease is on its way out.Ghaziabad saw a major spike in the number of cases in the months of June and July. As of May 31, there were only 305 cases, which climbed to 4,321 as on Thursday. The spike was primarily attributed to the relaxation of in lockdown norms starting June 8.According to the weekly figures from the health department, the TPR was 9.19% in the week from May 31 to June 6 with positive cases during the period at 155. This climbed to 15.33% during the week from June 21 to June 27.In the week from July 19 to July 22, the TPR dropped to 3.22%. However, since June 26, antigen tests have become the primary testing regime in the district, constituting 54% (40,500 as on Thursday) of all tests done to determine Covid-19.Antigen tests are inherently unreliable with very poor sensitivity, which means that its ability to detect true positives is low and could result in many negative tests turning positive under an RT-PCR test. “What we have observed in Ghaziabad is that testing during initial months was done for selective groups. Now, with arrival of rapid kits, the net is wider. So, the sampling/testing rate has gone high and positivity rate is less. The RT-PCR test has about 70% sensitivity while rapid antigen kits have sensitivity of about 60%. So, there is not a major difference and the samples turning negative through rapid kits are anyway test through RT-PCR for finding true negative. So, the major reason for less positivity is more linked to widespread testing being done now,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad.Despite this, its share is high because of two advantages: point of care testing and no need of taking it to a laboratory, and that it gives a result within 30 minutes, as compared to the two days it would take an RT-PCR test.“The weekly trend shows that positivity is on decline but we cannot assume that the effect of Covid-19 is on decline overall. We will have to observe the trend for about 1-2 months before we can say that there is an assured declining trend. On the other hand, we have taken various measures to bring down the case positivity,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “Initially we put up restrictions at the Delhi-UP border in order to prevent cross-border infection. Then, we took up rigourous containment exercise in various areas and presently it is being taken up in 21 different localities which have 10 or more active cases. The weekend restrictions directed by the state government have also helped as we taken up cleanliness and sanitization for two days to curb spread of infection.” “We are analysing the week wise declining trend of positivity in the district. One of the major factors behind the reduced TPR is the test sensitivity. With the rapid antigen kits, we have positivity of about 3-4% while the positivity with RT-PCR tests is about 6-7%. So, this could be a reason why the trend is on decline while more tests are getting done through rapid kits nowadays,” said an officer from the district health department who wished not to be named.The RT-PCR tests are considered as more sensitive than the rapid kits as they have a higher rate of detection and can even detect minutest traces of virus including the traces of dead virus.Officials said that fatality rate has also come down. In June alone, the district had suffered 51 of the 64 deaths since the outbreak of the disease in March.According to official records, the fatality rate was 4.1% in the month of June with 51 deaths and 1,243 monthly cases. From July 1 to 11 the rate came down to 0.5% with seven deaths out of 1,544 cases during the period. The officials added that the rate has further come down to 0.2% with just two deaths out of 977 cases during the period.“To keep check on rising number of deaths we streamlined our systems and working round the clock on early detection, testing and speedy referral to prevent any patient getting into serious condition. Our focus is on every individual patient in order to further lower the death rate,” Pandey added.Box: Samples/test +ve cases positivityMay 31 to June 06 1686 155 9.19%June 7 to June 13 1845 162 8.78%June 14 to June 20 2258 249 11.03%June 21 to June 27 3398 521 15.33%June 28 to July 4 13183 698 5.29%July 05 to July 11 17178 948 5.52%July 12 to July 18 17918 935 5.22%July 19 to July 22 10521 339 3.22%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/positivity-rate-declines-as-ghaziabad-increases-rapid-antigen-testing/story-l3BJGNNh5nzJ2KDC10TtdJ.html

23-07-2020||City||Noida: Over 50 rapid response teams formed for screening of Covid patients for home isolation||NOIDA: Following the decision taken by the state government to allow home isolation for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has over 50 constituted rapid response teams (RRTs) to screen patients in different localities, who have asked for home isolation.According to district magistrate Suhas LY, the screening process for this has been started. “The patients will be allowed home isolation only after their thorough check-up has been done by the screening teams, confirming that they are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms. In case of any doubt, they will be brought to higher observation centres. If they are found having serious symptoms or are suffering from co-morbidities, they will be sent to L-1, L-2 or L-3 facilities as per their conditions. The whole process may take 24 to 48 hours,” he said.As many as 33 Covid-19 positive asymptotic patients were allowed for home isolation on Thursday, the DM said.The DM further said that as per guidelines for home isolation of very mild and pre-symptomatic Covid-19 cases, under which a patient can stay at home, they will have to be in touch constantly with the district surveillance officer, and a hospital and will have to sign an undertaking for them.“They should have the requisite facility at their residence for self-isolation and also for quarantining their family. A caregiver must be available for the patient to provide round-the-clock care. There must be a continuous communication between the caregiver and the hospital for the entire duration of their home isolation. The caregiver and all close contacts of such cases should take hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis as per protocol and as prescribed by the treating medical officer. Any difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or developing bluish discolorations of lips or face must be reported immediately to the treating medical officers,” he said.Speaking on the time span of home isolation, the DM said that patients under home isolation can end home isolation if their symptoms are clinically resolved and the surveillance medical officer certifies them to be free of infection after proper lab testing. Health officials said that the patient permitted home isolation will have to bear the complete cost of medical kits themselves. A doctor working with a district hospital said on condition of anonymity that a complete kit costs around Rs 10,000. “A good quality pulse oximeter itself costs around Rs 6,000 in the market,” he said.The district’s chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that the patients will have to buy medical kits equipped with a pulse oximeter, thermometer, mask, gloves and other necessary items for themselves. “Our team of experts will check the quality of all these items purchased,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-over-50-rapid-response-teams-formed-for-screening-of-covid-patients-for-home-isolation/story-J9J4AQY7pCzHmVwK76lItK.html

They said a senior official from the university should appear on the next date of hearing. “On the next date, we would like to know how your (DU) mock tests went. Give us the entire data on the mock test, and how many students participated,” the bench said. Datta told the court he would keep all the data ready for the court’s perusal. The court posted the matter challenging the conduct of exams for Tuesday after it was informed that the Supreme Court will hear a plea challenging UGC’s notification to conduct the exams. The high court asked the varsity to give data of how many students under the persons with disability category participated in the mock tests. The court was hearing a bunch of pleas, including one from the PwD candidates, challenging DU’s decision to conduct open book exams.The judge said that since the SC is hearing the matter and would be hearing it even on Friday, it would be better to list the petitions next week. Following this, the matter was posted for Tuesday.The final-year exams in DU is scheduled to start from August 10 till August 31 after the high court compressed the schedule given by the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-how-many-took-mock-open-book-tests-delhi-hc-to-du/story-HEnhS06gMDyt6U6qh0r43O.html

23-07-2020||Delhi||Chalk out protocol for issuing certificates, marksheets online: HC to DU||Remarking that it would be torture for students to wait for their degrees and marksheets, the Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the Delhi University to take immediate steps to chalk out a protocol for issuing degree certificates, marksheets and transcripts online with digital signatures and security features.Justice Pratibha M Singh said that students have to wait for several years for their marksheets and degree certificates due to delays in the transfer of data and the holding of convocations, even as Vinay Gupta, the dean of examinations, said that the data regarding the marksheets has been given to the National Academic Depository (NAD), a digital database of academic awards provided by the Centre, to upload.“Since the NAD is a unique feature and act as a national depository for academic records, DU should utilise it effectively and take immediate steps to transfer all existing data about students to NAD,” the judge said.The court said that in such a scenario, digital marksheets and degrees should be issued to the students as it is a fast process. It asked Gupta and the varsity to explore the possibility of digitally signed documents so that students do not face problems in the future.“A solution is needed within four days. Why don’t you give the degrees and marksheets with the digital signature? At this stage, every university is in difficulty but this (DU) is the only one which is not helping its students.“Give digitally signed marksheets. The process is fast enough and the digital signature software can be procured within 24 hours as a large number of students is yet to receive their documents from the varsity,” the judge said.The dean of examination, told the court that all marksheets, except for a few subjects, are online. He also said that the varsity would explore the possibility of digitally signed marksheets. The High Court directed that the Joint Director of DU Computer Centre officer arrange his digital signature before the next hearing date (August 4) so that the degrees can be emailed to the petitioners with his digital signature.The court was hearing a plea by five doctors who graduated from Lady Hardinge Medical College, which is a part of Faculty of Medical Sciences, DU, and had not received their certificates till date even after graduating in 2018.The plea filed through advocate Sarthak Maggon had contended that the petitioners wished to apply for their residency programmes in the United States and to sit for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).The court also said DU could take help from the IT department of the Delhi High Court to prepare a protocol for issuing digital degree certificates, marksheets and transcripts.On Wednesday, the court had directed the varsity to take a pragmatic approach and seriously consider the option of setting up a special cell for entertaining students issues of digital certificates, marksheets and transcripts.The matter will now be heard on August 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chalk-out-protocol-for-issuing-certificates-marksheets-online-hc-to-du/story-LEyvK2iSnap5yWnAOvPtKL.html
23-07-2020||Delhi||Nurse targeted by snatchers, passerby tries to fight them, incident caught on camera||A 40-year-old nurse walking back home from a bank with her daughter was targeted by two motorcycle-borne snatchers in South Delhi’s Greater Kailash on Thursday afternoon in an incident that was caught on camera and culminated in a bystander attempting to take on the suspects but failing. The nurse lost her gold chain, saved her handbag, but was left with a bruised neck. The nurse, who identified herself by her first name Siddheshwari, said that she lives near M Block Market, Greater Kailash, and works at a private hospital in nearby Zamrudpur. On Thursday afternoon, she and her 18-year-old daughter were returning from a bank in the neighbourhood when they were targeted on the street by two men who approached them from the opposite side on the road. The CCTV camera footage showed the pillion rider trying to snatch her bag, but Siddheshwari managed to pull it back. The suspect then hopped off the motorcycle and charged towards the woman, even as her daughter ran away in fear. “The snatcher was threatening to kill us both,” Siddheshwari said. Over the next few seconds, the suspect was seen tugging at her neck, but Siddheshwari said that he was actually strangling her. “He strangled me to get my gold chain. I couldn’t fight back; all I did was try to save my neck from his grip,” she said. As the suspect hopped on to the motorcycle to get away, a passerby hopped off his own motorcycle and attacked the two suspects. The video showed him managing to hit the pillion rider with his helmet, but the suspects rode away.Parvinder Singh, the additional deputy commissioner of police (south), said that the victim did not call the police control room and instead visited the local Greater Kailash police station. “We have registered a case of robbery and have formed a team to identify and nab the suspects,” the officer said, adding that there was no immediate breakthrough in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nurse-targeted-by-snatchers-passerby-tries-to-fight-them-incident-caught-on-camera/story-xDucl9L3Penb3DuZj9NP9N.html

This year, Delhi government schools recorded 98% results in the CBSE class 12 exams. Addressing the students, Sisodia said, “We could have been satisfied with the 98% result. But, for us, these are our students, not just a mere statistical figure. Every child is important to us. This is the reason this year I am meeting those children who, for some reason, have not been able to succeed. We pay equal attention to every child. But if for some reason, someone isn’t able to get good grades, we have to have faith in them. We will have to work really hard on those students so that nobody lags behind.”Seeking feedback from students on areas where the government can improve in the education sector, Sisodia said, “There has been a drastic change in our schools but if something is still missing, then we need your help in fixing it. If a student isn’t able to succeed, then we want to understand what is still lacking in our system. We know you are disheartened but you can still help us.” The students cited many reasons behind not clearing the exams, including lack of interest in subjects, sickness, financial and personal issues. “We will emphasise that after passing class 10th, parents should also be counselled along with children so that every child is enrolled in the subject of their interest. Parents should also understand its importance,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisoda-meets-govt-school-students-who-could-not-clear-cbse-class-12-exams-takes-feedback/story-LCJZD7iLkDxHoTP9M29qMN.html
23-07-2020||City||Two get bail in north-east Delhi cases, one refused relief||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to two accused persons in two separate cases of the north-east Delhi riots. In a third case, the court denied bail to a man who was arrested for rioting. The three were arrested in separate cases related to the riots earlier this year. In the first case, additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav granted relief to Vinod Kumar on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000.The judge said in the order, “...it has been stated by the IO that the applicant (Vinod Kumar) was not seen in any of the videos. It is also admitted by the IO that the applicant has been arrested in this matter only on account of the fact that his name is there in the FIR.When the IO was further questioned about any material against the applicant, then the IO could not give any satisfactory answer ..,” the court said in its order.The judge directed Kumar not to threaten the witnesses or tamper with evidence.The court said because the investigation is complete, and the trial is likely to take long time, no useful purpose would be served by keeping Kumar in incarceration. In the second case, chief metropolitan magistrate Purshottam Pathak granted bail to Jareef Ahmed alias Jareef on a bail bond of Rs 20,000. The prosecution had opposed his bail, saying he was identified in the video footage. The court, while granting bail, said Zarif had already been granted bail in another case where he was seen in CCTV footage. It said no recovery has been made Zarif in the present case and the charge sheet has already been filed.Police had arrested Zarif for rioting and damaging public and private property during the riots. In the third case related to the murder of a man named Babbu (only first name mentioned in police record) in Khajuri Khas, the court of additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav dismissed the bail of Bharat Bhusan alias Lucky, stating he had been categorically identified by independent eyewitnesses. Police had said Babbu’s murder was captured on tape by a news channel. Police told the court the investigating officer had already written to news channel seeking a copy of the footage. At least 53 persons died while 400 others were injured when clashes between Hindus and Muslims broke out in different parts of north-east Delhi in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-get-bail-in-north-east-delhi-cases-one-refused-relief/story-RNPGNvCoGKWe3v5fpfn1tI.html
23-07-2020||Lucknow||Over 75,000 people registered on UP govt job portal from April to July||Unemployment may be going up just a little bit in the state despite the resumption of economic activity during the Unlock phases , going by the number of those who have registered themselves on the state government’s integrated employment portal. A total of 75,865 people registered themselves on the portal from April 1 to July 15, said an officer familiar with the issue who refused to be named. Currently, there are about 34.51 lakh registered jobless persons on the portal, the officer added. This number is marginally higher the figure of 33.93 lakh unemployed persons that Uttar Pradesh minister for labour Swami Prasad Maurya had mentioned in a written reply to a question in the state assembly on February 7.No significant increase in registration was witnessed in the initial weeks of 2020-2021 due to the Covid-19 lockdown. From January 1 to March 31, 75,855 people registered themselves on the employment portal, the officer said. “There were hardly any registrations in April and, in fact, the number of unemployed persons came down to 33.91 lakh in May 2020 as many of those already registered could not renew their registration during the lockdown period. Those registered have to renew the registration after every three years,” said the government officer aware of the developments on this front. “Later, the beginning of Unlock-1 and Unlock-2 provided an opportunity for the unemployed persons to register themselves on the portal. Most of the new registrations have been apparently done after the beginning of the Unlock period,” he added.Asked whether the arrival of migrant workers/labourers changed the unemployment scenario in Uttar Pradesh, another officer said, “This number of 34.51 lakh registered unemployment persons apparently does not include the migrants who have returned to the state from other states following lockdowns due to Covid-19 pandemic. The state government has carried out a separate exercise to profile the migrants.” An elaborate exercise of profiling 37.61 lakh returnee migrants has been recently completed. Efforts are being made to provide them jobs as per their skills in the industry or to provide them loan to enable them start their own business after coming back to Uttar Pradesh.Director, training and employment department, Kunal Silku said the rising number of registrations on the portal did not indicate increasing unemployment as people often used the portal not only to seek jobs but also to switch jobs. “We want more and more persons to use the portal as any other job portal. Many persons continue with registration after getting employment to look for a new job,” said Silku. “We are also making efforts that all those completing their education or vocational course register themselves on the portal,” Silku said. “Many unemployed persons may not have registered themselves on the portal while many may have done it for better avenues. But these figures are definitely a source of concern. In a limited way, this indicates increasing unemployment and the figures of those registering themselves may go up further,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor of economics department, Lucknow University.“For rural migrant workers, the government has been implementing MNREGA. But there is no such focused programme for urban unemployed and the educated youth. The state government should take a note of this and work for the unemployed,” Tyagi said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has time and again asked his team of officers to work out strategy to provide jobs to the migrant returnees. He has also presided over programmes organised to sign memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with the industry to accommodate migrant workers. Loans have been also provided to them to start their own business.Maurya was not available for comment on the issue. Replying to an adjournment motion in the state assembly in February 2020, Maurya had indicated that the BJP government was providing more jobs to people than the previous Samajwadi Party government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/over-75-000-people-registered-on-up-govt-job-portal-from-april-to-july/story-b5s6l4IjoKJWmo8IilAJIK.html

23-07-2020||Gurugram||Only 22% hospital beds in Gurugram occupied by Covid-19 patients: Data||Only 22% of the 1,486 hospital beds earmarked for the Covid-19 patients in the city are currently occupied, according to the data published by the district health department. Officials said that only symptomatic patients with underlying health conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, are being hospitalised, while asymptomatic patients are in home isolation. With the decline in the Covid-19 positivity rate to nearly 8% and the number of Covid-19 patients requiring tertiary care, most of the reserved hospital beds continue to remain unused.Currently, the administration has reserved 1,486 general isolation ward beds — including 192 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and 92 beds with ventilator support system — across 40 government and private hospitals in the city. Of 1,486 beds, 335 were occupied as on Thursday. Out of these, 136 beds are occupied by patients from Gurugram, while 199 by patients are from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, parts of Haryana, and other states. The bed occupancy has dipped consistently over the last month due to overall decline in the positivity rate, according to the hospitalisation data. On June 30, at least 417 Covid-19 patients — all Gurugram residents — were admitted in the hospital. By July 7, it had come down to 197, and further to 175, on July 14, and 148 on July 21. The last time the number of people in hospitals was this low was in May, when the city had less than 1,000 cases. The district administration, however, cleared that they have no plans to de-escalate the preparations made for the Covid-19 treatment. Vivek Kalia, nodal officer for Covid-19 hospital management said, “Private hospitals have been directed to reserve 25% of their bed capacity for Covid-19. The capacity can be further escalated to additional 35% in case there is a surge in the number of cases. According to a state government order, a maximum of 60% beds can be reserved in the private hospitals. However, there has been no step towards the further expansion as the existing capacity continues to remain unused.”As per the district administration’s report on Covid-19 Health Facilities and Bed Management Report, the city required 18,000 beds for critical patients if the total number of Covid-19 patients crossed 1.5 lakh-mark. However, with the total count of infections at 8,266, the district continues to remain well below the projected mark.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), said, “The hospitalisation should not be more than 10% of the infected patients. All the asymptomatic patients are being asked to home isolate, while those with symptoms are shifted to Covid care centres and hospitals based on their underlying health conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes. This helps in controlling the fatality rate too.” Gurugram’s current fatality rate is 1.45%, while the recovery rate is at 84.62%.Patients prefer home isolationData shows that nearly 83% of the active cases are currently home isolated, while only 12% are hospitalised. At least 955 patients are in home isolation while 136 are in hospitals, according to the district health bulletin. On Thursday, 139 new Covid-19 cases were reported, taking the total count of infected person to 8,266. Of which 1,152 are active cases. In the last 24 hours, 85 patients have recovered, taking the total count of the recovered patients to 6,995. With one Covid-19 death, the death toll of the district stands at 119. Out of which, 81 deaths are due to co-morbidity and 38 are without co-morbidities.“Immediate hospitalisation is required only for those patients who report health issues and call on 108 (ambulance referral service) to get admitted to an isolation ward of a hospital after being suggested either by the local Rapid Response Team (RRTs) or a physician,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer. He said that asymptomatic patients tested positive for the coronavirus are being home isolated. “Those tested Covid-19 positive prefer home isolation as it is more comfortable than hospitalisation. Even as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, positive patients who do not report health issues should be home isolated. In case, there isn’t adequate facilities at the house like separate rooms or care giver, then patients are put in covid care centres.”He said that at present there are 61 patients in the Covid care centres, which are isolation facilities set up in hotels. As per health officials, most patients prefer to stay at a government-paid facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/only-22-hospital-beds-in-gurugram-occupied-by-covid-19-patients-data/story-N71jsNGOymn5YxuRGsH1QJ.html
23-07-2020||City||Gurugram: DSP of Bhondsi jail arrested for supplying drugs, SIM cards to inmates||Gururgam: A 53-year-old deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of Bhondsi jail was arrested on Thursday for allegedly smuggling drugs and supplying SIM cards to inmates over the last two years. According to officers, 240 grams of a narcotics substance (Sulfa) and 11 SIM cards were allegedly recovered from his government accommodation.The police also arrested a 25-year-old peddler who allegedly visited the DSP’s house and delivered drugs and SIM cards.Police said the DSP is named Dharambir Chautala and the peddler is Ravi Kumar, who is from Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh and lived in Faridabad on rent.A raid was conducted by the assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Sohna at his residence on Thursday around 2.30pm. Police commissioner K K Rao said they had received several complaints of drugs and SIM cards being supplied to inmates through jail officials, following which they formed a team and began tracking the movement of peddlers. “We have initiated a probe in this case but we suspect that he had been supplying drugs to inmates for the past two years,” he said.According to the police, the cost of the seized drugs in the international market is pegged at Rs 50,000. The suspect would have allegedly packed it in small packets of five grams each and sold in the prison for Rs 5,000 each, they said.“Our teams were tracking the location of Kumar and followed him through Jharsa crossing, near Sector 15. He reached Chautala’s house on the jail premises and delivered the consignment. A team that was keeping a close watch raided the house and recovered the narcotics and the SIM cards,” Rao said.Kumar allegedly tried to escape but he was also arrested by the crime team.In August 2014, the state government had amended the Haryana Prisons Act 1894 to control the smuggling of cell phones into prisons. As per a recent amendment, using mobile devices inside the jail premises is prohibited and anyone found in possession of such a device could get up to three years of additional jail time.The regular confiscation of cell phones from inmates has not only baffled jail authorities but also highlighted their failure to curb instances of phones being sneaked into the compound.Jail officials said that they conduct surprise checks regularly in the barracks to ensure no illegal activity is carried out. In February 2018, during an inspection by police officers after a fight inside the prison, 22 cellphones were found abandoned by inmates.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that mobile phones are often handed over to inmates by their aides during court visits, who then hide them in their socks or undergarments. There have also been cases in the past where jail officials were suspended for delivering phones to inmates. “Due to the coronavirus pandemic, court hearings are conducted through videoconferencing, following which there has been no movement of inmates and no one could sneak in any mobile phone. The suspect took advantage of the situation and was selling SIM cards at a higher price, which is under investigation,” he said.Sangwan said cigarettes, mobile phones and drugs are sold at very high price inside the jail and that its not possible without the help of jail officials.Preliminary investigation has revealed that Chautala had come under scanner earlier as well and on 24 June, 2017 eight mobile phones were recovered by him from the jail’s premises after information that the police will conduct raids inside the barracks, said officers.Chautala was posted to Panchkula after the incident. He returned to Bhondsi jail on December 6, 2018.Kumar was lodged in Bhondsi jail and was acquitted last year. He was arrested for allegedly drug peddling and supplying mobile phones in jails. Sources said the police’s investigation had corroborated that Chautala allegedly had close links with Kumar. “He used to supply drugs and SIM cards to Chautala in lieu of money and later they were sold to jail inmates,” said an official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-dsp-of-bhondsi-jail-arrested-for-supplying-drugs-sim-cards-to-inmates/story-vI1YEA1Q9SsBNkJVzhXkkK.html
23-07-2020||Gurugram||Man held for cheating people of lakhs in exchange for jobs||Police on Wednesday arrested a man for allegedly cheating people on the pretext of getting them government jobs during the lockdown. The man, 39-year-old Lucknow resident Chandra Bhushan Pandey allegedly charged his “clients” anywhere between ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh for his services, but left them jobless in the end, said police. According to the police, Pandey moved to the city on March 16 and rented a house in sector 31. Police said he published pamphlets offering government jobs and placed advertisements online, where he mentioned that he ran an organisation called ‘Kendriya Krishi Vikas Sansthan’.A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “From one person he charged ₹27,000 a month. Several unemployed men from Rewari, Mahendargarh and Narnaul had come to his office, where he taught them a course on agriculture and took interviews as part of his training module for 45 days.”Police said the training included courses on opening of credit cards for farmers and micro finance regulations. “The probe revealed that he had cheated several people using a similar modus operandi in Lucknow too and had been running this racket since 2016. In Lucknow, he charged ₹56,680 for the course package, in Gurugram, he was charging over ₹1 lakh. He told several job seekers that he would refund their money if they did not get jobs, but later he kept changing his location,” said the police officer. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “A complaint was received from the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare in the Ministry of Agriculture in June, following which a probe was initiated. This week a raid was conducted and the accused was arrested from sector 31. At the time of the raid, police found that six unemployed men were undergoing the training and their statements were recorded.”Several calls to the office of the administrative vigilance unit of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture did not elicit a response.Police said a laptop, which had details of the all the victims, was recovered during the remand. On Wednesday, the accused man was sent to judicial custody. A case was registered against him under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security will etc), 468 (forgery of purpose of cheating) and 471(using as genuine a forged document) of Indian Penal Code at sector 40 police station, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-held-for-cheating-people-of-lakhs-in-exchange-for-jobs/story-hpVScrCM6QBU663auTxTDL.html
23-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Number of pending samples brought down by nearly 55%||The number of samples awaiting confirmatory tests for Covid-19 infection in the district has been reduced by 55% over the past five days, said officials of the district health department. Since July 1, the number of samples has incrementally built up due to a paucity of equipment and logistical challenges in reporting the test results. However, with the addition of the new generation of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits, the backlog of pending samples is gradually being cleared, with the number of pending samples down to 614 from 1,358 on Saturday. This backlog too would be cleared soon, said health officials. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said that the health department has begun using three new RT-PCR kits. Each test kit has a cycle time of about three hours, while the labs can run two to three cycles daily. “We can test up to 90 samples at a time using the new test kits, which can produce results in about three hours. This has allowed us to test 600 new samples each day, and, more importantly, report the results sooner. Traditionally, RT-PCR can take at least 12 hours to produce a confirmatory result,” Yadav said. RT-PCR tests are considered to be the gold standard of Covid-19 testing and are used to determine the amount of viral RNA in a sample. Health department officials, however, did not provide details on the make, sensitivity or specificity of the new RNA test kits. “I am unable to recall these details at the moment. However, the new test kits have been validated and provided to us by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s (IDSP) district surveillance officer in Gurugram.Sharma added that there are only about 44 samples collected prior to July 23 whose test results are awaited. “Of the current lot of 614 pending samples, almost 570 were collected on July 23 itself, and their results will be received by late in the night, and shared in the next day’s (Friday) bulletin,” Sharma said, emphasizing that the new kits have significantly improved the turnaround time in reporting results. From the earlier turnaround time of nearly 12 hours, the new test kits are being able to provide results in three hours. A doctor with the IDSP in Gurugram, seeking anonymity, explained that the introduction of rapid antigen detection tests in the city earlier this month had necessitated an upgrade in health department’s RT-PCR testing capacity. “About 10% of the antigen test samples are being retested via RT-PCR. As per the norms, in antigen testing, a positive test is always a true positive, while a negative test requires a follow-up test, via the RT-PCR method, especially if a patient is showing symptoms. This adds to the RT-PCR’s testing load by anything between 80 to 100 samples per day, which is why the backlog had initially built up.” Officials said that, on an average, about 1,500 to 1,700 samples are being tested in the district everyday, of which rapid antigen tests make up about two third of the total number of tests. These tests are being conducted in the large outbreak regions and containment zones. The health department’s target in the coming weeks is to increase this capacity to at least 2,000 tests per day, if not more. A total of 74,720 tests have been carried out in Gurugram so far (including both anitgen and RT-PCR tests). While it took three and a half months for the health department to carry out the first 50,000 tests (which it achieved on July 10), the subsequent 24,000 odd tests have been carried out in less than two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-number-of-pending-samples-brought-down-by-nearly-55/story-fmY4oW42FKGoocHQVGhZTJ.html

23-07-2020||City||Gurugram: HSVP issues notice to CNG station operators over pending rent of ₹14 crore||Gurugram: The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has issued a notice to the operator of five CNG gas stations in the jurisdiction of Estate Office One over allegedly pending dues of around ₹14 crore. The authority has also asked the operator to appear before it and raise grievances, if any, with regards to calculation of dues. Officials said that fuel pump sites were handed over to the operator, Haryana City Gas Distribution Ltd (HCG) for running gas stations in lieu of monthly rent but the latter has not been paying the same regularly. Officials said the operator has questioned the calculation of dues by the authority and has even approached the high court and in light of that, they have decided to give another chance to the HCG to make a submission to the authority.The action comes in light of the HSVP facing major financial crunch due to loans taken by the authority. It is now trying to generate income by selling its properties and asking tenants to pay up rent. Prior to CNG stations, the HSVP had sent notices for liquor vend and petrol pump sites asking for rent, which ran into lakhs. Bharat Bhushan Gogia, Estate Officer One, said a contract was signed between the HSVP and HCG in 2006 and the rent will be calculated on the basis of that agreement. “We have given our property to the operator in that year and the firm had also paid rent at that time but in following years, no money was paid. This has led to a large amount of pending rental dues, which we are seeking,” he said. As per the details shared by HSVP, the five CNG stations allegedly owe nearly Rs 14 crore to the authority. “The company officials can come and raise their objections with regards to the rent and all the issues raised by them would be resolved,” he said. The company, when asked about the matter, said that they have been regularly paying the rent but they had objected to the calculation of pending dues by the HSVP. “We will pay rent from the day when the site was in our possession but the authority has a different take on this. In a number of instances, the possession was given to us years later as there were legal issues related to the land. We have asked HSVP to calculate the dues correctly and we will pay the rent,” said Kapil Chopra, MD, HCG, which operates the CNG stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-hsvp-issues-notice-to-cng-station-operators-over-pending-rent-of-14-crore/story-15mxYNbGGU7YBq6uOtU4dL.html
23-07-2020||City||Hate crime charge added against man who attacked Sikh-American store owner||Authorities in Colorado state of the US will add a hate crime charge against man who brutally attacked a Sikh-American store owner in April and told him to “go back to your country”.Sikh civil rights organisation the Sikh Coalition said it has been informed that the Jefferson County district attorney’s office has decided to add a hate crime charge against Eric Breemen, who will now be charged with multiple counts -- now including a bias-motivated crime -- in the violent April 29 assault on Lakhwant Singh.Singh said he is very grateful to “everyone -- Sikhs and non-Sikhs alike” who stood with him and his family in this incredibly difficult time and appreciates the Jefferson County authorities for hearing his story and, “through these charges, recognising the role that hate played in my horrible attack”.Singh was brutally attacked at the store he owns with his wife in April when Breemen entered the shop and began harassing the couple, the Sikh Coalition had said. Breemen damaged numerous items and repeatedly told the couple to “go back to your country”.When Breemen left the store, Singh followed him outside to take a photo of his license plate so that he could report the abuse but he struck Singh with his vehicle, throwing him several feet across the parking lot, causing multiple injuries.Following his arrest, Breemen had told police that he had attacked an “Arab” man. The Sikh Coalition had called for authorities to bring formal hate crime charges against the assailant. The organisation said more than 2,600 people sent emails to Jefferson County District Attorney Peter Weir urging him to pursue a hate crime charge. In addition, 29 organisations joined a sign-on letter earlier this month urging for the same, and many others signed and delivered additional petitions from across the world.“The decision to add a bias-motivated charge against Breemen is a resounding victory not just for Singh, but for minority communities who are threatened by bias and bigotry every day,” Sikh Coalition legal director Amrith Kaur said. “Adding these charges sends a clear message: Hatred is not welcome in Jefferson County, and those who are targeted for being different know that this community will acknowledge it and stand with them in solidarity,” she said.The Sikh Coalition has said that Sikh-Americans remain hundreds of times more likely to experience bigotry, bias and backlash than their fellow Americans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hate-crime-charge-added-against-man-who-attacked-sikh-american-store-owner/story-70uRF5CSbp33l3Rggf5b7O.html

23-07-2020||Gurugram||MCG identifies 46 spots prone to waterlogging, to deploy suction tankers, pumps||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has compiled a report, identifying 46 vulnerable spots in the city, where the civic body will be deploying suction tankers, tractor-mounted pumps to minimise the impact of waterlogging. The report is based on ground-level observations by its executive engineers from some of these areas that witnessed heavy flooding following rain on Wednesday. Earlier, prior to the start of the monsoon, officials of the district administration, MCG, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the Gurugram Police had identified 35 vulnerable spots in the city, which were brought under round-the-clock surveillance via installation of CCTV cameras and deployment of teams of MCG and GMDA officials.The 35 points are located in some major road stretches, where waterlogging can have an impact on the traffic movement. The new list, however, mostly comprises arterial stretches in the city. A comparison of the two lists reveals that only Vatika Chowk and Narsinghpur are common to both.The 46 newly identified spots are located in areas such as sectors 9, 52, 21,24, 26, 10, 4, 46, 39, 27 and 55, Vatika Chowk, Annath Road, Ghata, Signature Tower Road, Khandsa market, Narsinghpur, Cyber Park, South City-1, Sohna Chowk, Basai Road, and Kanhai. On Wednesday, the city received 22mm of rainfall, leaving most parts heavily waterlogged. Barring a minor 15-minute drizzle in some parts of the city in the evening, it stopped raining around 11.30am in most other parts. However, the extent of the waterlogging was such that it took officials until 6pm to clear the roads of rainwater. Wednesday’s waterlogging also affected the public transport, with services of 11 Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL) buses being disrupted.In order to prevent another incidence of waterlogging, Satyawan Singh, superintending engineer, MCG, has decided to deploy super suction tankers at 43 points, while a tractor-mounted pump has been deployed at Sector 27. In addition, Singh has also directed the civic body’s executive engineers to clean choked manholes in Sector 34.“We have identified 46 points across the city, based on the reports and the feedback we received from our executive engineers after Wednesday’s waterlogging. All these areas are low-lying that attract rainwater from the nearby sectors. As such, they remain prone to frequent waterlogging. A clean-up of these areas remains a bit of a challenge. Due to their location , the water does not recede quickly on its own. Hence, we have decided to intervene and introduce machines that can speed up the process of clearing rainwater so as to minimise the impact on traffic and commuters,” said Singh.Singh added that directions have been issued to executive engineers to identify more such points across the city so that similar measures can be introduced there as well. Additionally, the surveillance of the major roads of the city would also continue to enable prompt action in case of waterlogging. Reacting to issue of waterlogging in the city, Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG, said, “There are several reasons for Wednesday’s waterlogging. Each of these reasons is localised in nature, In some points,​ the drains got clogged, while in others the extent of rainwater accumulation was much higher due to the fact that these areas are located in low lying regions. Nonetheless, we took measures accordingly and cleared most roads of rainwater by the evening,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG. Last month, before the start of the monsoon season, HT had reported that the city is likely to witness waterlogging as most officials of the civic body are busy tackling the spread of Covid-19 and lagging behind on monsoon preparedness. Between March 21 and April 15 — a period where tenders for cleaning of drains are usually floated and allocated — the MCG had issued an order to all its officials, asking them to solely focus on ensuring basic services, such as sanitation, water, sewage, and streetlights, amid the Covid-19 outbreak, and not take up any other work until further notice.On April 15, during a video conference between senior MCG officials and councillors, it was decided that tenders for cleaning and desilting of drains can be initiated via e-tendering.However, due to the delay, the first set of tenders was only allotted to contractors in the first week of May with the remaining being alloted only in June.With a large number of migrant workers returning to their native places, officials of the civic body said that the contractors could not finish the cleaning and desilting of drains properly before the start of the monsoon season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-identifies-46-spots-prone-to-waterlogging-to-deploy-suction-tankers-pumps/story-foZe7WO68Fol60mHoRqCnL.html

23-07-2020||City||200-year-old gurdwara reopens in Pak’s Quetta city after 73 yrs||AMRITSAR/ QUETTAThe Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Thursday hailed the reopening of 200-year-old Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha in Quetta city of Balochistan province of Pakistan. The Balochistan provincial government on Wednesday handed over the gurdwara to the Sikh community after its restoration. “The Pakistan government’s move is worth being hailed. We also congratulate the followers of Guru Nanak in the neighbouring country,” said Gobind Singh Longowal, president of the SGPC, the apex gurdwara management body in India.The gurdwara that served as a school for Muslim girls for seven decades was returned to the Sikh community on Wednesday, enabling them to worship there for the first time in 73 years, Pak officials said on Thursday.Longowal said there are a large number of gurdwaras in Pakistan and most of them were closed after Partition. “The reopening of gurdwaras after decades on demand of the devotees is a great respect to their religious sentiments,” he said. The gurdwara stood empty for a year or two when most Sikhs left Pakistan after Partition in 1947, following two centuries of colonial rule.Under the government’s guardianship, a school was later set up in the gurdwara building, which remained functional until recently, when Sikhs won a legal battle to have the property returned, gurdwara custodian Govind Singh said.He said Sikhs living in Quetta were delighted to get back to their worship place.“This is the best gift for us. We are grateful to Pakistan and the judiciary for giving it back to us,” local Sikh leader Jasbir Singh said. “For us, it is like a dream come true.”Singh spoke as jubilant members of the Sikh community, adhering to social distancing rules to avoid the spread of the coronavirus, gathered at the temple to worship.The gurdwara could not be returned to the community earlier because of a lingering legal battle between local Sikhs and the provincial government, Singh said.Abdullah Khilji, an official at the education department in Balochistan, said hundreds of schoolgirls who were studying at the gurdwara building were relocated to a nearby school where they have since adjusted.The development comes at a time when Pakistan’s tiny Hindu minority is facing resistance from Muslim activists for attempting to build a temple in the capital. Initially, the government approved its construction, but then reversed the decision after Muslims objected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/200-year-old-gurdwara-reopens-in-pak-s-quetta-city-after-73-yrs/story-na46htHYwTMvbRFk0kMrgP.html

23-07-2020||Bangalore||Congress alleges Karnataka got PPE kits, gloves from China; false, says BJP||Even as the Congress in Karnataka alleged a massive ‘Rs 2000 crore plus’ scam in purchase of Covid related equipment and demanded a judicial probe into the matter, the BS Yediyurappa-led BJP government hit back saying the allegations were false and baseless.Leader of opposition in assembly Siddaramiah and state president DK Shivakumar addressed a press conference where they claimed that the state had spent Rs 4167 crore till date in combating Covid. The two senior Congress leaders alleged that more than Rs 2000 crore of the money spent had been siphoned off through corrupt practices by inflating prices of Covid equipment like ventilators, PPE kits, sanitizers, gloves, and other material. They also released some documents which they said showed that the material had been procured at artificially high prices.Siddaramiah said that while the average cost of a ventilator is Rs 4 lakh and for 1000 such ventilators it should have cost only Rs 40 crore, he alleged that the government had spent Rs 120 crore. Demanding a judicial probe from a sitting high court judge, the leader of opposition in the assembly alleged that instead of ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat advocated by PM Modi, BJP-led government had procured from China.”“On one hand @PMOIndia advocates Aatma Nirbhar Bharat but here in Karnataka, his own Chief Minister @BSYBJP, has procured hundreds of crores worth Made in China medical equipment at exorbitant price. Is this not hypocrisy?” Sidaramaiah said in a tweet.DK Shivakumar also questioned the state government saying that it was filled with ‘Kaliyugada Kauravas’ (Kauravas from Kali age a reference to characters of Mahabharata) and alleged that the BJP-led government was “no vision and only corruption”.After the allegations levelled by the Congress, a cabinet meeting was called by CM Yediyurappa and subsequently five ministers - deputy CM Ashwath Narayan, home minister Basvraj Bommai, revenue minister R Ashoka, medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar and labour minister Shivram Hebbar - were deputed to defend the government.The ministers, who called themselves a ‘Pancha Pandavas’ ( five Pandavas), attacked the Congress claiming that they were levelling baseless and false allegations.Medical education minister Sudhakar said that it was unfortunate that Siddaramiah who has presented 13 budgets does not know the difference between proposal and expenditure. He also released documents by which the state government said under the previous coalition government when there were no pandemic, ventilators were purchased at the rate of Rs 21.73 lakh whereas the current government had got the ventilators with the same specifications at just Rs 14 lakh.To Siddaramiah’s charge that Rs 815 crore had been spent on the purchase of equipment from the medical education department,Sudhakar said: “’How can this be when we have hardly spent Rs 33 crore from my ministry? Congress is day-dreaming of making a political comeback by flinging wild and baseless allegations without any proof during such a difficult situation when we are combating the pandemic. People of the state will not forgive them and will teach them a lesson.”Other ministers too took on the main opposition party and said the charges were a figment of Congress’s imagination. However, JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy expressed anguish at the ongoing fight between BJP and Congress, saying: “At a time when all of us should be focussed on combating the pandemic and helping the poor and distressed, it is unfortunate that those two parties are focussed on political mudslinging.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/congress-alleges-karnataka-got-ppe-kits-gloves-from-china-false-says-bjp/story-bkYECSBjKe9BDN0FdKAODL.html

23-07-2020||City||No legal hitch in holding civic polls in October: Punjab AG||Chandigarh Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda has said that civic body polls in the state can be held in October. “Legally, there is no problem in holding polls as per the likely schedule discussed at the level of CM,” said Nanda, adding that he had given his advisory to the local bodies department. The elections are running a bit behind schedule due to the lockdown and movement restrictions in place due to the covid-19 pandemic. Last week, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh after a video conference meeting with cabinet colleagues, including the local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, announced that the polls would likely be conducted in October second week. Subsequently, the local bodies department had sought legal opinion. The terms of nine municipal corporations and 117 municipal councils and notified area committees in Punjab came to an end between March 8 and April 26 this year, and as per the provisions of the Municipal Act, 1911, the polls should take place within six months, so all these civic bodies should go to the polls between September 7 and October 25, depending on the end of their terms. Currently, government- appointed administrators are running these civic bodies. POLLS NEED LOT OF GROUND WORK, MOHINDRA Mohindra added that before going into polls, lot of preparation needed to be done. “We will make a formal announcement in a few days. We have to take our MLAs into confidence, make sure that delimitation within wards is done, the population variation is settled as within a municipal area the population keeps shifting. These are time consuming and laborious matters,” he added.He adds that his department would complete all work related to `wardbandi’ (delimitation of wards) by the end of the month. The polls would have 50% reservation for women, in line with the state government’s policy, said Mohindra, adding that his department would be fully ready well in time for the polls.NOT A GOOD DECISION: SUKHBIRShiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal said the intentions of the state government were not good with their plans of holding the civic body elections in October“The government has imposed ban on public movement and yet plans to hold polls. I am sure they would not let our workers venture out and would rig the polls to ensure they win a majority in the civic bodies,” added the former deputy CM, demanding that poll dates be announced, after taking all parties into confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-legal-hitch-in-holding-civic-polls-in-october-punjab-ag/story-37aopvlyQrjz9ffDmE5e7K.html

The letter added that the four Sikh youth protesters, Ravinder Singh Littran, Baldhir Singh Ramgarh, Jhilman Singh Gorsian and Harminder Singh were killed without provocation on February 4, 1986, when they were protesting the burning of a bir (a copy) of the Guru Granth Sahib. He wrote that even during the Lok Sabha election campaign in 2019, he had raised the Nakodar police firing case, and had requested the CM to open investigation into the unfortunate incident and provide justice to families of victims. He said Captain Amarinder Singh had promised that the case will be reopened and investigated. The MP requested the CM to fulfil the promise made to the people and order an investigation into the Nakodar killings case at the earliest. “The families are waiting for justice with crossed fingers even after almost 35 years. It is time that justice be done to them and their suffering be put to an end,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jalandhar-mp-writes-to-captain-seeks-probe-into-1986-nakodar-police-firing-case/story-BWzf5t2aTlgLwaDtrIHjmK.html
23-07-2020||Chandigarh||Central Administrative Tribunal dismisses Khemka’s application||Finding ‘no merit’, the Chandigarh-bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal dismissed the application moved by IAS officer Ashok Khemka wherein he had sought direction from the Union government to consider his empanelment for holding additional secretary or an equivalent post at the Centre.The order mentioned that the matter relates to empanelment of applicant Ashok Khemka for holding additional secretary/ equivalent post at the Centre, which according to him had been wrongly denied to him.Khemka argued that the eligibility criteria for such an empanelment requires a minimum three-year service at the Centre at the level of the deputy secretary or above.“As per the officer, a number of officers who did not fulfil the said criteria have been appointed and three cases have been cited by him in this regard,” the order mentioned.He also stated that non-empanelment at this stage would lead to a cascading effect and he will not be able to serve at the Centre at all. The tribunal observed: “An important issue before us is whether a person can claim empanelment as additional secretary in the Union Government as a matter of right.”It adds: “Central Staffing Scheme clearly provides that appointment under the Union government under central staffing pattern is not a matter of right. Even the applicant has not challenged the Central Staffing Scheme. As such, no individual officer or no individual service can claim any right to these posts.”Mentioning the guidelines for empanelment at Additional Secretary level, the order mentioned: “The applicant being a member of premier service would have been aware of these guidelines. It is normal expectation that if he was really keen to serve at the Centre, he should have taken sincere and sustained efforts to fulfill the eligibility criteria.”Khemka’s submission that the civil services board specifically recommended his name for appointment in the Prime Minister’s Office has been denied by the Union government. As he did not provide any proof, the tribunal could not rely on this.“We also note that the allegation of the applicant about non-reasonability of classification for not counting the State service in top administrative ranks for eligibility, does not appeal to reason,” the tribunal observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/central-administrative-tribunal-dismisses-khemka-s-application/story-7nXuQMScx4COUtCSWXVHaM.html

The MS has issued norms for management of bodies and distributed duties of doctors, staff nurses and Class-4 employees for the disposal of covid-19 victims’ bodies on July 20 (the incident happened on July 17). He, however, mentions the date as June 20, while putting his signature on it. HT has a copy of the letter with two dates of July 20 and June 20. “The June signature was a clerical mistake and the document was released on July 20 with the additional point of clicking photos of bodies with face uncovered and their identification tag visible. The other guidelines were being followed since June,” said the MS. As per the guidelines of Punjab government, a body management committee was to be formed in state GMCs to handle bodies of Covid-19 victims, but no such committee was formed at the Amritsar GMCH, the staff has claimed.The nursing staff and Class-4 employees of the hospital, however, alleged that the document has been signed in backdate to show seniors and government that the hospital is following these rules since June and to find a scapegoat among staff nurses and Class-4 employees. Already, the GMCH has written a letter to the state medical education and research department to suspend four staff members in handling the bodies. President of Punjab Nursing Association, Amritsar, Narinder Bhuttar, said on Thursday, “The MS signed the document in back-date to show that Class-4 employees and staff nurses are responsible, but no doctor was present in the mortuary, during the tagging of bodies, due to which the incident happened. Doctors on duty have the responsibility of handing the bodies to their families and this is not the assigned duty of staff nurses and Class-4 employees. Doctors are responsible for the body swap incident. Higher authorities should probe the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-body-swap-nurses-accuse-amritsar-hospital-ms-of-issuing-back-dated-guidelines/story-vxdfBOpBBvBWKovJFXeegN.html
23-07-2020||Chandigarh||CBI court initiates process to declare suspended Chandigarh inspector PO||Stating that she is deliberately absconding and concealing herself to evade arrest, a special CBI court has initiated proclaimed offender (PO) proceedings against suspended SHO Jaswinder Kaur, an accused in a Rs 5 lakh graft case.“This court is fully satisfied that accused Jaswinder Kaur is intentionally and deliberately absconding and concealing herself with a view to evade her arrest despite having the knowledge of the proceedings initiated against her. Therefore proclamation proceedings are required to be initiated against her in the interest of fair justice,” said Sushil Kumar Garg, special judge, CBI, in Thursday’s order.The court also ordered issuance of a proclamation warrant against Kaur, requiring her to appear before it at 11am on August 29. The order came after CBI failed to arrest Kaur despite non-bailable warrants against her.On June 29, the inspector, along with an alleged conduit, Bhagwan Singh, was booked under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 7 and 7A of the Prevention of Corruption Act on charges of seeking Rs 5 lakh bribe from a Manimajra resident, Gurdeep Singh for not lodging an FIR of cheating and forgery.As per CBI, Kaur was informed in person to join the investigation at CBI office on June 30 and she was again informed telephonically. However, she did not appear before CBI, and instead created false evidence in a DDR at Manimajra station, where she was SHO, that she had returned from CBI office, Sector 30.The CBI court had first issued non-bailable warrants against Kaur on July 20. After they were not executed in time, fresh warrants were issued, returnable on July 23. As, Kaur continues to be at large, proclamation proceedings have been initiated against her.Both the district courts and the Punjab and Haryana high court have already dismissed her pleas for anticipatory bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cbi-court-initiates-process-to-declare-suspended-chandigarh-inspector-po/story-9wj6c2yX1wrmPFLMQ28EfN.html

She began feeling breathless and she died in the evening. From 6 pm to 11 pm we tried to get the death certificate and ambulance, but failed. Then, the senior officials from the Dhankawadi ward office came to our house, collected and packed the body, and took it in an ambulance for cremation. We are really thankful to all of them who helped us in this difficult time.” Jayant Bosekar, PMC deputy commissioner (zone 3), under whose jurisdiction the ward office comes, said, “It was an unfortunate incident to happen. I personally called the contractor, but he was not reachable. So, our team of senior officials went to collect the body and cremated it. Now we are issuing an official tender in our zone for this work. All the dead bodies of Covid- positive patients, whether from hospital or home, will be collected and their last rituals will be done.”The family itself has been through the Covid wringer since July 16, when a 72-year-old male member of the same family, living in Chavan nagar, died Covid-19 positive.After that, the entire family underwent testing and five tested positive on July 19, including the 65-year-old female.Home quarantine was the immediate reaction, but on Monday, July 20, as the woman started struggling to breathe, she was rushed to a private hospital.The family decided to bring her back home on July 21, and she died the same day at 6 pm.As other family members were positive in the house, and in quarantine in a separate room, they were unable to take the body for the last rituals, so contacted the PMC ward office.It is alleged that the contractor in question did not respond to the PMC calls because it was a case of a deceased Covid-19 patient in a home environment, which allegedly raises the risk of infection.Then, the PMC acted and as calls sped up the chain of command the buck stopped with assistant municipal commissioner Nilesh Deshmukh, who acted fast and decisively.A private doctor in the area was woken up at 11.30 pm and requested to issue a death certificate. Finally, the ward office ambulance, used for transporting Covid-19 positive patients, reached the house of the deceased at 12.30 am.The officers packed the body, sealed it and took it to the Kailas crematorium in Sangamwadi.By the time the body was cremated it was 4am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/asst-commissioner-ward-officers-turn-pall-bearers-to-ensure-last-rites-for-covid-positive-senior/story-lTDpNvrtPFIJ9xXhtVL9ZL.html

He said except for two releases of Rs 2.35 crore which involved repatriation of Sikh sangat stranded at Nanded Sahib, citizens and students stranded in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan and Rs 35 lakh compensation to the family of police officer Anil Kohli, no money had been released from the fund.The SAD leader said the Congress government had not thought it fit to release money for safety equipment for doctors, ventilators or other infrastructure in hospitals. He said the callous attitude of the Congress government bordered on being inhuman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-asks-amarinder-about-money-in-covid-relief-fund/story-Tv1oNqkWF3xFqMSkrIy8AI.html

The total number of cases registered in the state crossed the 50,000-mark and stood at 51,757 with 2,436 new cases being recorded in the last 24 hours. This is the highest single day spike till date. The death toll climbed to 1,255 with 34 Covid-patients dying in the last 24 hours. In Kolkata, life came to a virtual stand-still, as the city police used drones to keep a tab on lockdown violators and put up barricades and naka checking at multiple places to restrict unnecessary movement of people. Entry and exit points were sealed and cops led by senior IPS officers patrolled the roads and even lanes and bylanes in vulnerable pockets. “At least 886 persons were arrested for violating lockdown norms, which is four times than the number of persons arrested for the same reason on any lockdown day. More than 500 people were booked for not wearing masks compared to around 300 on other days. At least 30 vehicles were seized and 27 persons were prosecuted for spitting on the road,” said a senior officer of Kolkata Police. Offices, including banks, public transport and markets were shut down while medicine shops and petrol pumps were kept open along with some emergency services during lock down. The scenario in the districts was all the same with policemen strictly enforcing the lockdown on the first day. People who could no cite proper reason of stepping out of their houses were either sent back or forced to do sit ups as on-spot punishment. Week-long lockdowns have been declared in many civic bodies in North 24 Parganas, Burdwan and Birbhum district. In north Bengal, the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) has announced week-long lockdown in Darjeeling, Kurseong, Kalimpong and Mirik and five other hill towns. The next state-wide lockdown would be enforced on Saturday. While next week one lockdown day would be enforced on July 29, the state government is likely to announce the other date on Monday. Meanwhile the state has announced strict lockdown in containment zones till July 31 and night time curfew from 10 pm to 5 am. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said that there could be a further spike in the number of cases as the state would ramp its testing from present 14,000 to 25,000 by August 15.

With this, he said, any person after submitting his documents will be able to register from any tehsil in the state. The deputy CM said no registration will be done from July 22 to August 5, 2020 where Jamabandis are currently offline. In cases where e-stamps have been issued and the time for registration has been allotted in the mentioned period, the validity of challans has been extended by 30 days.Under the new centralised registry system, information about registries will also be given to the person concerned through e-mail. In addition, the registry will arrive at the buyer’s home by registered post just like passport services. Chautala said this decision has been taken in view of complaints that were received regarding issued related to registeries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-to-enact-law-to-reserve-50-seats-for-women-in-panchayats-deputy-cm/story-5SW12XTc0dZsPqcrO0pgWK.html
23-07-2020||Chandigarh||Congress proposed privatisation of mandis: Sukhbir||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday released a copy of Congress party’s manifesto which states that the party will amend the state APMC Act for setting up private mandis in Punjab.“Congress has double standards, it is crying hoarse that with passage of recent ordinances by the Centre, private players will enter the foodgrain procurement sector, however, before coming to power in 2017, Captain Amarinder Singh had promised that they will amend the APMC Act to facilitate private players,” said Sukhbir, during a media interaction via video conferencing.He added that Congress is now playing politics over the issue by misleading farmers that the MSP and assured marketing system will end, which in reality is untrue. “My party will not allow tinkering with the MSP and assured marketing of wheat and paddy,” Sukhbir added.SAD is a coalition partner in the NDA government in the Centre and is supporting the ordinances stating that farmers’ rights are protected.Farmers feel that the Centre has started the process to end MSP and assured procurement. “I have offered farmers to accompany me to the Centre to clear their doubts on both issues,” the SAD president said.“We understand the problems of farmers and have always fought for their rights. SAD will not stand for any discrimination against them. We will not allow anyone to tinker with MSP and assured marketing policy,” he added.He took on the Congress party for failing maize farmers besides demanding a CBI inquiry into the purchase of agricultural machinery from private companies at inflated rates.Sukhbir sought assurance from the Centre that MSP and assured marketing of wheat and paddy will not be tinkered with in any way. Senior leaders Jathedar Tota Singh, Prem Singh Chandumajra, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Daljit Singh Cheema accompanied Sukhbir on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/congress-proposed-privatisation-of-mandis-sukhbir/story-rGnfBnZWGO4oPk1HJAemLO.html

Former SAD MLA Desh Raj Dhuggal also joined the Dhindsa group.Talwandi is son of former SAD president Jagdev Singh Talwandi who remained associated with Akali patriarch Parkash Singh Badal for many years. On his reasons for joining Dhindsa, Talwandi said, “All these months, I have been noticing the activities of the Badals. Sukhbir Singh Badal has been running the SAD like a corporate office. Now, since Dhindsa is the true leader of the party and I have decided to join him.”Ranjit Singh remained MLA from Raikot constituency from 1997 to 2002 and was also chairman of the Punjab Small Industries and Exports Corporation (PSIEC). “The junior Badal lacks vision and is running the party like a dictator. Parkash Singh Badal appointed him SAD president without looking at merit,” he alleged. Dhindsa alleged that the entire Punjab knew that the Badal family were hand-in-glove with Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh over the Bargari sacrilege issue to save the accused. “The clear-cut effort to save those guilty in the sacrilege case and the misleading of public is visible. Despite the Congress being in power, the business interests of Badals remained unaffected,” he alleged. He added that their party would form committees at every level so that a proper road map can be prepared for effective functioning. To a pointed query from a reporter on whether former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra will be joining their party, Dhindsa said, “There is a long list. Just wait for another 10 days.”Others present included former ministers Sewa Singh Sekhwan, Parminder Singh Dhindsa, Jagdish Singh Garcha, former deputy speaker Punjab, Bir Devinder Singh, former president of Delhi Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee Manjit Singh GK and senior SAD leader Tejinder Pal Singh Sidhu.On July 8, a faction of dissident Akali leaders had elected Dhindsa as the SAD president at a gurdwara in Ludhiana. The SAD, however, had termed the move illegal and fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ex-sad-chief-talwandi-s-son-joins-dhindsa-says-sukhbir-lacks-vision/story-TLtJdVR82To1t6oJ5VbnxK.html

This is the second plasma bank in Haryana. Earlier, the Employees State Insurance corporation (ESIC) hospital in Faridabad had established the first plasma bank in Haryana.Vij said, “Our recovery rate and the national average is far better than many other states. I want to thank our medical fraternity for their sincere efforts and dedication in treating the Covid-19 patients. I appeal to recovered patients to donate plasma and help those suffering from the infection.” He said many people are facing problem in getting plasma and their problems will be solved by setting up a plasma bank at the PGIMS.Dr VK Katyal, head of medicine department, said 14 patients, who recently recovered from the disease have donated plasma at the PGIMS in Rohtak to help those suffering from severe infection. “We had conducted convalescent plasma therapy on seven patients, of whom three were discharged, one patient has died, two are not responding well and undergoing treatment. And one patient is responding better. At least 57 patients have pledged to donate plasma. The plasma of B+ve and O+ve blood group is in demand, he added.He said there is a target to call at least 200 plasma donors every month. “We are taking plasma from people aged between 18 and 60 based on their health conditions. The plasma is taken only cured patients after two weeks of recovery. It is a promising therapy for severely ill patients, but there is no proof that it works for all. We are treating people with this therapy and we would be able to comment more on its efficacy after conducting trials on more than 100 patients,” Dr Katyal said.“A plasma donor should have normal weight, haemoglobin level above 12 and no history of diabetes, cancer or hypertension. The therapy will be administered to those with respiratory rate higher than 30 (normal is 20), oxygen saturation less than 90% (normal is 95 to 100%), or those with pus in their lungs,” he said.₹7.5 will be spent for development projects in Ambala Cantt: VijAmbala: The state government will be spending ₹7.5 crore for development projects in the Sadar area of Ambala Cantonment, home minister Anil Vij, who holds the charge of urban local bodies said on Thursday.

23-07-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana to enact law to reserve 50 % seats for women in Panchayats: Deputy CM||The BJP-JJP government in Haryana will bring in a bill in the next Vidhan Sabha session for reserving 50 percent seats for women in Panchayati Raj Institutions, Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala said here on Thursday. Chautala, who is also the minister for Industries, Rural Development and Panchayats, said the state government has been taking adequate steps for ensuring maximum participation of women in PRIs and the society. “To give 50 percent reservation to women in Panchayats, we will bring in a Bill in the next Vidhan Sabha session,” Chautala told a news conference here during which he also dwelt upon various steps of the state government for making Haryana a preferred industrial destination. The JJP leader said a “scooty” (two-wheeler) will be given to 100 women who have done outstanding work in villages. The beneficiaries will include 30 women sarpanches, 10 Zila Parishad members, 20 Block Samitis’ members besides 40 other women associated with PRIs. He also said the government will soon amend the relevant law to provide for opening up of non-cultivable tracts of land of over 500 acres under any Gram Panchayat for industrial development. This will not only help villages generate revenue but the industries too would flourish and generate employment. Asked about the state government’s decision to temporarily stop the registration of land transfer deeds in the state, he said the government had come across some “loopholes” in the registration process which needed to be set right. The new registration process being developed by the government would remove those loopholes, besides simplifying the entire process for the benefit of the common people, he said. He said the revenue department officials are conducting “re-verification of loopholes”. “When the registration process is simpler, it will benefit common people and that is why we are digitizing the entire process. Within 24 hours, they will get all details over their e-mail,” he said. He also said in the registration process “stamping of over Rs 100 will be in e-mode”. Chautala said at a recent state Cabinet meeting, a proposal had been cleared for bringing an ordinance to reserve 75 percent of private-sector jobs in Haryana for local candidates. The government had also given nod to amend the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the Factories Act, 1948 to provide for some relief to industries and factories amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He said the state’s new industrial policy, the ‘Haryana Enterprises Promotion Policy-2020”, would be announced next month. Promising a congenial industrial climate to investors, Chautala said the state intends to be at the top by next year in ‘Ease of Doing Business’ rankings, moving a ladder ahead from its present second spot. He said the present BJP-JJP dispensation has been taking several steps to ensure a congenial atmosphere for investors to invest in Haryana. With the government promoting the establishment of industrial clusters in all 22 districts, he said, “We will have industrial clusters according to the strength of a particular area in a particular industry.” Replying to a question, he said the government has enough land bank and added around 17,000 acres are available. Asked if companies like Maruti Suzuki were looking for an expansion in the state, Chautala said the government has been discussing with them what more it can offer them in this regard. The government can look into any land requirement by companies, close to their existing facilities in Gurgaon district, for their expansion, he added. He said Haryana can emerge as an IT hub like what Greater Noida has become for mobile phones. Touching upon another issue, he said the expansion of road network in eight districts of the state has been approved and 83 roads will be built at a cost of Rs 383.58 crore by December. These districts are Charkhi Dadri, Jhajjar, Jind, Karnal, Mewat, Rohtak, Sirsa and Yamunanagar, he said. He also said it has been targeted that more than 200 tonnes of plastic waste will be collected by Panchayat Department and given to the PWD for use in road construction under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana. On the bypoll for Baroda assembly in Sonipat, dates for which are yet to be announced, Chautala said the JJP and its ally BJP will jointly fight the election and the decision about the candidate will be taken at an appropriate time. Chautala also hit out at the Congress for allegedly trying to mislead farmers on three farm sector ordinances promulgated by the Centre recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-to-enact-law-to-reserve-50-seats-for-women-in-panchayats-deputy-cm/story-DT17MEzmVkFcuT3T7LgA4J.html
23-07-2020||City||Dhankar takes charge as Haryana BJP chief in Rohtak||Om Prakash Dhankar, the newly appointed president of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana, took charge at the party office in Rohtak on Thursday.The BJP’s central leadership on Sunday had appointed former agriculture minister Dhankar as the state chief, replacing Subhash Barala, who had completed his term.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, BJP’s Haryana in-charge Anil Jain, former state BJP chief Subhash Barala, former ministers Captain Abhimanyu, Ram Bilas Sharma and minister of state Sanjeev Baliyan and other party leaders were present on the occasion.While addressing the gathering, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the BJP is a party where a worker from poor financial background can become the state president, chief minister, minister and the Prime Minister. “In other parties, the key positions are reserved for political dynasties. Lobbying and pressure tactics to get any position does not work in our party. I hope that Dhankar will lead the party in the state and strengthen the organisation,” the CM said.After assuming charge as state BJP chief, Dhankar urged the party workers to support him in the new role. “The doors of my house will be open 24x7 and anyone can meet me with their grievances. I urge all party workers to send their suggestions on Haryana party president’s e-mail ID regarding new steps to strengthen the organisation in the state,” he added.Slamming Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda’s elevation as Rajya Sabha MP from Haryana, Dhankar said his party has nominated Ram Chander Jangra, a man from poor family for the Rajya Sabha while the main opposition Congress has sent the son of a politician to the upper house from the state.Man attempts suicide at eventHigh drama prevailed during Dhankar’s oath taking ceremony when one Rajbir from Rohtak’s Kansala village tried to commit suicide by cutting the veins of both his legs with a sharp edged weapon. The incident took place during the CM’s address. Khattar noticed him and directed the police to rush him to the Post-graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), here.The man had earlier attempted a suicide bid outside the Rohtak superintendent of police’s office a few months ago. He alleged that the police had filed a false case against him for giving drugs to inmates at his drug de-addiction centre.“I had paid money to the police for cancelling the FIR but they failed to do so. The corruption has reached to a next level in the state and I attempted the suicide bid in front of the CM to apprise him of the real face of his government,” Rajbir said.SHO Jai Narayan said the man was rushed to PGIMS and his condition is stable. A suicide note was recovered from him.Social distancing goes for a toss Social distancing guidelines were not followed during the function as hundreds of party workers and leaders attended the event. BJP’s Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia was among those who did not maintain social distancing. The CM also appealed to the workers to maintain social distancing and wear masks. However, the norms were not followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dhankar-takes-charge-as-haryana-bjp-chief-in-rohtak/story-Xtw5hQWS4KmlHvKHQFgWhP.html
23-07-2020||Chandigarh||SEC sanctions Rs 15 crore to boost health infrastructure in J&K||With the rise in Covid-19 cases in J&K, especially in Kashmir, the state executive committee (SEC) sanctioned Rs 15 crore to boost the health infrastructure in the major hospitals in Srinagar and Jammu on Thursday. The SEC, headed by J&K chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam, sanctioned Rs 15 crore under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to major health institutions for further procuring essential labs and equipments for handling the Covid-19 pandemic. The Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Srinagar; Government Medical College, Jammu and Srinagar have each been sanctioned Rs 5 crore. ‘’The funds will be placed with the divisional commissioners of Jammu and Kashmir for this purpose,’’ the official spokesperson said, adding that as per MHA guidelines SDRF funds for Covid-19 containment efforts in government hospitals can be utilised for setting up additional testing laboratories, procurement of personal protection equipment for health workers and other related consumables for government hospitals. “The funding under SDRF is over and above the funding that is being provided to the health department during the course of the year,’’ the spokesperson said. Officials said the money will be given to major hospitals in Srinagar like SKIMS, Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar and GMC, Jammu. After a sudden spike in cases and deaths due to Covid-19, complaints started pouring in from different hospitals about depleting oxygen supplies and non-availability beds, which forced the government to impose fresh lockdown in all districts of Kashmir, except Bandipore. People have asked the government to boost medical infrastructure in time so that once Srinagar and other districts open, people don’t face problems. “It seems the government did not utilise the earlier lockdown period effectively. The loopholes were laid bare as the number of cases went up. Hopefully, things will be taken seriously now,’’ said a Valley resident, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sec-sanctions-rs-15-crore-to-boost-health-infrastructure-in-j-k/story-BOxcZms5FkvCkyC1t4WZ9L.html

As such, the matter regarding interim prayer needed to be decided urgently, the applicant’s counsel argued.“In view of urgency of the matter,” the order reads,” Registry is directed to take steps for constitution of appropriate division bench and the matter be listed before it, urgently, preferably within this week or early next week.”Observing that the Centre and the UPSC have not filed the reply so far, Dayalan stated: “They are directed to file their replies before the next date.”WHAT IS THE MATTERIn a June 9 order, the Haryana government had directed Haryana Public Service Commission to recommend Non-SCS officers (five times the number of vacancies) after conducting the written examination.It is for the first time that Non-SCS officers in Haryana will have to take a written examination to get appointed to an IAS post. Until now, the Non-SCS officers of the state were appointed to such posts on basis of their service record. The HPSC will prepare a merit list based on the marks obtained in the written examination and recommend names to the state government for onward submission to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).The petitioner has sought quashing of the June 9 notification of the state government, pleading that the government has committed an illegality by introducing the written test.The state government has held that there was no “illegality” in its June 9 order and that the written test for shortlisting the eligible candidates has been introduced to have a rational and transparent system for evaluating/adjudging the persons of outstanding merit and ability.The HPSC has also told the CAT that the state government has the powers to make a reference to the HPSC for recommending names of persons of outstanding merit and ability on the basis of written test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-non-scs-to-ias-cat-member-recuses-from-case-after-two-hearings/story-FORZmkLImVGC4qdHQGWBEJ.html

He urged them to make regular announcements in this regard through public address systems.Amarinder reiterated his appeal to farmer unions not to come out on the roads in protest against the Centre’s anti-farmer ordinances but to defer any such movements to check the spread of Covid.He also directed the officials to install mask-vending machines at vantage points such as bus stands.PLASMA BANKS IN AMRITSAR, FARIDKOT SOONChief secretary Vini Mahajan and health experts were asked to work out the modalities for setting up plasma banks also in government medical colleges in Faridkot and Amritsar, in addition to Patiala, where the state’s first plasma bank was inaugurated on July 21. On the first day itself, four donors had donated their plasma in the bank.He appealed to those already cured of Covid to donate their plasma to help out those fighting the disease. The chief secretary informed the meeting that IAS and PCS officers who have recovered are also being encouraged to lead the way by donating their plasma. DGP Dinkar Gupta said three policemen, including a home guards jawan, had also donated convalescent plasma at Patiala and Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana.Citing the high positivity rate in Ludhiana and Jalandhar, the chief minister directed the health department to step up surveillance and testing in these districts to contain further spread of the pandemic.At present, Jalandhar has a maximum of 18 micro-containment zones in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rs-5-000-fine-for-violating-home-isolation-flouting-of-social-distancing-norms-by-restaurants-in-punjab/story-VkRJfvVlTdN1YDERicbiVK.html

23-07-2020||Chandigarh||Panipat’s handloom industry back on track as migrants return||After three months of struggle, Panipat’s handloom industry is back on track as weavers have resumed work and are clearing pending orders from across the globe. The handloom industry largely depends on migrant weavers from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The lockdown was hard on both the handloom owners and the weavers as the industry remained closed for over two months after migrant workers returned to their home states. Now, around 60% of the labourers have returned to work as handloom owners made arrangements to bring them back. There are around 10,000 small and large handloom units in Panipat that employ around 3.50 lakh people, of which around 3 lakh are migrants.Northern India Roller Spinners’ Association president and Sachdeva Textiles owner Pritam Singh Sachdeva said, “Many industrialists have arranged air tickets for their workers. Now, around 60% workers have returned and most industries have resumed production.” FLUSH WITH ORDERSIndustrialists say there has been a surge in demand for handlooms both in India and abroad. Panipat Exporters’ Association president Lalit Goyal said, “There is huge demand for Indian handlooms and weaves aboard, especially in European countries and the USA. The demand has surged after China was criticised by global leaders. We are working hard to fulfill their expectations.”He said there were around 500 exporters’ units in Panipat and almost all units have resumed work. INDIAN VS CHINA IN PANIPAT’S BATTLEFIELDAs per industrialists, China is India’s biggest competitor in the handloom and textile sector. An exporter, who did not wish to be named, said, “Though, we are facing several problems and do not get the requisite support from the government we are still doing are best to compete with China. We are providing a bed sheet with two pillow covers for Rs 127.”Most industrialists agree that China’s advanced technology is a major threat. “Most of our machines are imported from China and it is difficult to defeat them as India cannot produce parts of these machines. One of my machines that cost Rs 18 lakh remained non-functional for three months because I could not procure a part due to restrictions on courier services,” says Jitender Malik, owner of Garima Carpets.The total turnover of industries in Panipat is approximately Rs 10,000 crore per annum, of which Rs 8,000 crore is earned through exports, and Rs 2,000 crore from the domestic market. MANUFACTURE OF PPEs During the lockdown, several industries in Panipat started producing personal protective equipment to meet the growing demand. The production of PPE kits has not only helped industrialists run factories, but also helped workers to earn wages during lockdown. Industries that earlier used to manufacture blankets and towels switched to PPE-kit production in April and May and started producing around 25,000 PPE kits everyday. However, there was no demand for the kits due to ban on export of PPE’s and most industrialists have now returned to their own businesses.“PPE kits helped us run the industry even during lockdown but now that there is no demand for PPE kits in the domestic market, we have decided to return to our old business,” said Sachdeva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panipat-s-handloom-industry-back-on-track-as-migrants-return/story-FyiyoAyHyFQZ9nxOzYkgGI.html
23-07-2020||Bangalore||Relatives torch ambulance after Covid-19 patient dies in Karnataka hospital||Upset over his death, relatives of a 55-year-old Covid-19 positive man set fire to an ambulance and resorted to stone pelting at the Belgavi Institute of Medical Sciences (BIMS) in Karnataka late on Wednesday night.In the melee, health workers were also said to have been manhandled and a constable present at the hospital was injured in the incident.The patient was said to have been admitted on July 19 with severe breathing problems and when a test was conducted was found to be Covid-19 positive. Relatives and friends who had gathered near the hospital apparently felt that the man had not got the right treatment and started manhandling some of the healthcare workers. Angered, they went out and set a ‘108’ ambulance service vehicle on fire.Fire and police personnel were rushed to the scene. The situation was subsequently brought under control. A case has been registered in the APMC police station. Medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar said that the incident and behaviour was reprehensible. “Why are they destroying public property? What did the ambulance do? That too when health care workers are working day and night. I have asked authorities to take the strictest action against culprits,” said Sudhakar.The Belgavi city police commissioner Dr Thyagarajan said a case has been registered and efforts are on to trace the culprits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/relatives-torch-ambulance-after-covid-19-patient-dies-in-karnataka-hospital/story-LLdCWVxLzpZ43ZBhee97DO.html

The operations smoothened further on Wednesday leading to sufficient arrival of stocks of onions, potatoes, leafy vegetables among others.Besides, Market Yard, supplies reached the suburban market yards at Moshi, Khadki, Uttamnagar and Manjri.Deshmukh said, “The main market received 18,000 quintals of vegetable supplies in 700 vehicles which boosted the availability of vegetables leading to a downfall in the prices of essentials which had shot up during the lockdown period.”“In the suburban Market Yards, vegetable supplies worth 3,000 quintals arrived in 300 vehicles,” he said.“Due to the shortage of vegetables in the market, prices surged across the city and the suburban areas. With ample stocks arriving at the market yard and its branches, the prices will now be under control and residents won’t have to pay extra for the vegetables,” he said.Rutuja Pawar, a resident of Undri said that she had to buy coriander for Rs 40 instead of Rs 20 and all other leafy vegetables were selling double the price in the market during the first few days of lockdown.“We had no option but to buy the vegetables at high prices but what about the common people who earn pittance every day. The vegetables were costly and even tomatoes were selling above Rs 100 in the market. As of today, the prices are back to normal and we hope that they remain stable for a long time,” she said.Currently, the vegetable market is open between 8 am to 12 pm and the traders association had demanded an increase in timings to cater to the rising demand of the customers. The administration has, however, said that a final decision of the timings will be taken only after the lockdown is lifted.Prices of greensLeafy vegetables like coriander, methi, spring onion cost Rs 40 during lockdown and now cost Rs 20Onion Rs 50, now Rs 30Ladies finger Rs 100, now Rs 70-80Pumpkin Rs 50, now Rs 30Tomato Rs 100, now Rs 60Potato Rs 60, now Rs 40||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/prices-of-veggies-fruits-stable-sufficient-stock-to-meet-demand-pune-apmc-official/story-iCpnmMoYwDSGrUYGvAUx0O.html
23-07-2020||Chandigarh||Much-awaited Himachal cabinet reshuffle put off for a week till CM is back from quarantine||Shimla: A day after the Bharatiya Janata Party announced Suresh Kashyap as the Himachal Pradesh unit chief, the much-awaited state cabinet reshuffle is on the cards with three berths vacant.Though chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has got the go-ahead from the high command, he is in self-quarantine for a week after a deputy secretary in his office tested positive for Covid-19.Thakur had sought party chief Jagat Prakash Nadda’s nod and discussed the reshuffle in detail with Himachal BJP in-charge and Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey.Three cabinet berths fell vacant after then food and civil supplies minister Kishan Kapoor was elected to the Lok Sabha from Kangra, while power minister Anil Sharma quit after the Congress nominated his son Ashray Sharma from the Mandi parliamentary seat against BJP’s sitting Lok Sabha member Ram Swaroop Sharma and health minister Bipin Singh Parmar was appointed speaker in place of Nahan legislator Rajeev Bindal who was named state unit chief in January.Jai Ram Thakur planned to expand his cabinet after the Dharamshala and Pacchad Lok Sabha byelections last year but the exercise was deferred due to bickering in the state BJP. After that, the coronavirus pandemic stalled his plans.CONTENDERS FOR CABINETNurpur legislator Rakesh Pathania is likely to be inducted into the cabinet. He began his political career in 1991 and was the BJP Kisan Morcha’s Kangra president before becoming its state secretary and a member of the party’s state executive. He was elected to the assembly as a BJP nominee in 1998 and re-elected as an independent in 2007 before becoming an MLA for the third time in December 2017. Pathania belongs to the Rajput community and has been vying for a cabinet berth since 2017. However, the party chose Bipin Singh Parmar, another Rajput leader.Paonta Sahib MLA Sukhram Chaudhary, the leader from other backward classes from Sirmaur, is also likely to be inducted into the cabinet. Chaudhary was a junior engineer in the electricity board before joining politics and was elected to the Vidhan Sabha in 2003, 2007 and 2017. He was parliamentary secretary from 2009-12.The chief minister is likely to give a place to Hans Raj, the legislator from Churah in Chamba, for the second term in his cabinet. Hans Raj is the deputy speaker of the Vidhan Sabha.Speculation is rife that first Narender Thakur, the two-time legislator from Hamirpur, could replace Hans Raj as deputy speaker. Narender is the son of late BJP stalwart Jagdev Chand Thakur. Narender, however, does not enjoy a rapport with former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal and his son and Union minister Anurag Thakur.The names of senior BJP leader and former horticulture minister Narinder Bragta, Sarkaghat legislator Colonel Inder Singh, who is a three-time MLA, and Kailesh Kumari, a first-time legislator from Bhoranj, are also doing the rounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/much-awaited-himachal-cabinet-reshuffle-put-off-for-a-week-till-cm-is-back-from-quarantine/story-LPZlpfsEU1thAjU4FkiBuN.html

These patients need ventilators and intensive care units, or non-invasive ventilators. The city administration has been under the pump in terms of ensuring bed availability for these critical patients.Dr Sunil Rao, general manager at Sahyadri Hospital said, “We often do get cases of people rushing to our hospital at the 11th hour when the patient is critical and requires oxygen or the ICU set-up with ventilators. The alarming thing is that these patients who come to the hospital are not just those with comorbidity or senior citizens; especially those who come in on the fifth or seventh day after the first symptoms showed. Even young Covid-19 positive patients who are asymptomatic or have just mild symptoms report severe symptoms in a short span of time. It could be because now the spread of the virus is very intense and also possibly the virus is showing mutations which is causing more complications. However, those in home isolation need to check their vitals, especially oxygen saturation, regularly. Even Covid-19 positive patients with a slight breathlessness must be reported to the hospital immediately.”Dr Parikshit Prayag, Covid-19 consultant with the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital said, “In some cases we have observed that patients are rushed to the hospital at the 11th hour. We are seeing sicker patients now as compared to before. For those in home isolation, they can constantly check their oxygen saturation levels using a pulse oxymeter which is the only sure way to indicate the beginning of any complication. We have observed ‘silent hypoxia’ in some cases wherein the symptoms are not clear until the virus reaches a critical stage and so, an oxymeter is the only way out. The district authorities could provide an oxymeter for those who cannot afford one which can help save a lot of precious time.”The number of critical patients rose from 174 as of June 1, to 616 on July 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/from-mild-to-critical-11th-hour-syndrome-puts-covid-patients-at-mercy-of-bed-availability/story-cH05JPACF8f4mSemCweMTL.html

23-07-2020||Kolkata||Kumartuli artisans for 50% advance for Durga idols||The return of lockdown in different parts of West Bengal has forced artisans of Kumartuli, the famed hub of clay modellers in the city, to ask for 50 per cent advance payment during booking of idols.The government has clamped lockdown in containment zones in the city since July 9. It announced total lockdown in the entire state twice this week to check the spread of the contagion.Durga Puja this year is likely to be much toned down one with the Covid-19 protocol in place and the organisers unwilling to spend as much as the earlier years.“We have unanimously decided to ask for a 50 per cent advance during booking so that we don’t incur heavy losses as we have suffered after Cyclone Amphan and the lockdown since March end,” a spokesman of ‘Kumartuli Mritshilpi Samity’ said.Kanchi Paul, a prominent clay modeller of Kumartuli, told PTI that she has got bookings of 10 idols in the past one month and many others had called and told her that they will visit her studio once the lockdown is over.“But we are insisting on payment of 50 per cent of the price of the idol as advance before sealing the order. This is important because we had suffered huge losses as all the finished Annapurna and Basanti idols for their respective pujas which took place in the end of March could not be sold as the pandemic had set in.“Since we have made huge investments, we cannot take a chance,” she said.To a question, Paul said the bookings this time were far less than in other years. There would be bookings for at least 30 Durga idols after Rath Yatra around this time in the previous years but she has no complaints. “The situation is different. Unlike 12-15 feet high idols in the past, organisers are settling for those with heights of 8-10 feet. We are happy that the orders are at least coming,” she said.Paul said the puja organisers this time are asking for idols of much lesser price than the Rs one lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh they paid in the previous years.“There has not been any booking for over 10 feet high idol. The price of an idol has been halved as both small and big puja organizers have been asking for low priced ones,” famous clay modeller Prodyut Paul said.Paul said the price of an idol around 15 feet high would be around Rs two lakh but no Durga puja organiser is ready to pay such an amount this time.The Samity spokesman said most of the 700 clay modellers who live and work in the area have got bookings of 5-6 idols each. This would have been more than 15 on an average on earlier occasions but “at least a start has been made.” “We are getting bookings for Ganesha idols but in ones and twos at many studios. The organisers said they cannot spend much,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kumartuli-artisans-for-50-advance-for-durga-idols/story-R4wztUk5q1UQMAvkCXr7VJ.html

23-07-2020||Bangalore||Siddaramaiah demands judicial probe into alleged irregularities in Covid management||Alleging large-scale corruption in Covid management in Karnataka to the tune of at least Rs 2,000 crore, former chief minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday demanded a judicial inquiry by a sitting High Court judge. The government, however, dismissed the charges saying no irregularities have taken place. “The total money spent on Covid management is Rs 4,167 crore whereas state Health Minister B Sriramulu says only Rs 324 crore has been spent.Equipment and materials were purchased double or triple the existing cost. At least Rs 2,000 crore has been pocketed by the ministers and officials,” Siddaramaiah. who is the leader of opposition in the state assembly, told reporters. He demanded a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of the high court.Releasing some documents to the media to substantiate his allegations, the former chief minister claimed that the health department spent Rs 700 crore---”some of the amount has been spent and some is in the pipeline.” The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (city corporation) and the urban local bodies spent Rs 200 crore, district administration spent Rs 742 crore under the State Disaster Response Fund, labour department spent Rs 1,000 crore and medical education department Rs 815 crore, Siddaramaiah claimed. At least Rs 500 crore was spent by the social welfare department, food and civil supplies department, education department, home department and woman and child welfare department, he added. Siddaramiaah said the health department was given a budgetary allocation of Rs 10,032 crore, which was revised and made Rs 9,689 crore. “So far Rs 1,527 crore has been released but Rs 1,554 crore was spent in April and Rs 1768 crore in May. The total money spent in two months was 3,322 crore whereas the money released was Rs 1,527 crore.So the spending is double the money released,” Siddaramaiah claimed. Speaking about ventilators, Siddaramaiah said the Centre purchased 50,000 ventilators from the PM Care funds for Rs four lakh each, Tamil Nadu government purchased 100 transport ventilators for Rs 4.78 lakh each. The Karnataka government, on the other hand, purchased the first batch of ventilators on March 22 for Rs 5.6 lakh, then the second batch was purchased at a cost of Rs 12.32 lakh the same day. The third batch was purchased on March 24 for Rs 18.2 lakh. “This is the reply given to me by Jawaid Akhtar, who is the additional chief secretary in the health department,” Siddaramaiah said. He said Dr Sarvabhouma Bagali, a former BJP MLA and a medical doctor, has lodged a complaint to the Lokayukta. In his letter, he has stated that the 15 ventilators supplied by a firm to the government were useless and second hand. These ventilators do not possess any standard certificates, Siddaramaiah said. About the procurement of Personal Protection Kits, Siddaramaiah said the state purchased 9.65 lakh kits of which three lakh were purchased from a Chinese firm.Import of three lakh PPE kits from China, approved by honourable chief minister and in the Task Force meeting on March 23, 2020 and April 4, 2020,” Siddaramaiah said. Claiming that the PPEs were available in the market for Rs 330 each, Siddaramaiah said 3.5 lakh PPEs were purchased from a Maharashtra based firm for Rs 2,117 each. There were many complaints against the PPE kits (by the Maharashtra company).Even doctors had protested against the poor quality PPE kits, he alleged. The government later returned 1.25 lakh kits to the company,the veteran congress leader said. He alleged irregularities in the purchase of masks, sanitisers, oximeters and thermal scanners. “The government purchased 10,000 scanners for Rs 5,945 for each thermal scanner whereas in the market it is available for a maximum of Rs 2,000,” Siddaramaiah said. Refuting the charges, Health Minister B Sriramulu said, “I said it before and I am saying it now -- no irregularities have taken place.” PTI GMS BN WELCOME BN WELCOME||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/siddaramaiah-demands-judicial-probe-into-alleged-irregularities-in-covid-management/story-Z9VWt3pQwzxKXCEJaRWplI.html

23-07-2020||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath interested in hiding conditions of health facilities than improving them: Priyanka Vadra||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday attacked Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over the state of health facilities in Uttar Pradesh where Covid-19 patients are being treated, alleging that he is more interested in hiding their conditions than improving them. The Congress general secretary has been criticising the UP government’s response to the Covid-19 crisis, alleging that it is indulging in propaganda, instead of dealing with the pandemic. “In the Covid-era, health facilities should be up and running. But, Mahoba’s women’s hospital is in this condition. You have seen the bad state of hospitals in Bareilly and Gorakhpur,” she said in a tweet in Hindi, tagging a video showing the hospital in Mahoba waterlogged. “In Lucknow, the CM, who makes statements about health facilities, is interested in hiding these conditions, not improving them,” Priyanka Gandhi said. Earlier this week, Priyanka Gandhi had tagged a video of rain water pouring down from the ceiling of a coronavirus ward of a hospital in Bareilly. She had also put out a video of the Covid-19 ward in Gorakhpur’s medical college last week that showed the facility was full of drainage water. A total of 34 people died of Covid-19 and 2,300 tested positive for the infection in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday, raising the death toll due to the disease to 1,263 and total cases to 55,588.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-cm-yogi-adityanath-interested-in-hiding-conditions-of-health-facilities-than-improving-them-priyanka-vadra/story-16xQyF6y4IDwMV20ySM2aI.html

23-07-2020||Patna||Around five lakh people affected in Bihar flood||Close to half a million people in nearly a dozen districts in Bihar have been affected by the flood that has cut a swathe of destruction across the northern parts of the state, the disaster management department said on Wednesday.A total of 4.6 lakh people in 245 panchayats of 10 districts have been affected by the deluge that has displaced more than 13,000 people. So far, 4,845 people have been put up at 16 relief camps, according to a release issued by the department.However, there has been no report of any loss of life so far, it stated.According to the state’s water resources department, the Kosi, Budhi, Gandak, Kamala Balan and Lal Bakeya rivers, flowing above the danger mark at many places, have been showing a receding trend or were stable.Water Resources Minister Sanjay Kumar Jha asserted in a statement that “all embankments in the state are safe” despite an increase in water pressure because of heavy rainfall in areas along north Bihar’s border with Nepal earlier this month and again in the last 24 hours.The minister claimed the embankments were “in better shape than ever” on account of the use of sheet pile while repair works were on before the calamity struck.“We are fully prepared. All repair works were complete before the floods came. Surveys of the flood-prone areas have been made beforehand with the help of drones. Personnel are involved in relief and rescue work, and engineers have been deployed in areas deemed to be vulnerable,” he added.Life was affected in large parts of Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul, Kishanganj, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, East Champaran, West Champaran and Khagaria districts due to the flood.Large parts of Areraj sub-division in East Champaran have been marooned, Sub Divisional Officer Dheerendra Mishra said. “About 25,000 people from 18 villages have fled their homes and are taking shelter, along with their livestock, at nearby school buildings.” NDRF Ninth Battalion commandant Vijay Sinha said in a statement that 21 teams have been pressed into service in 12 districts, taking people to safety and distributing food and other essential items.A 10-year-old girl in East Champaran was rescued by a team led by ASI Kaushal Kishore from her remote flood-hit village where she suffered a snakebite. She was carried NDRF personnel to a safe place where medical help was available, he said.Meanwhile, the floods caused the state’s political temperature to rise further.Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav, who toured districts such as Darbhanga and Madhubani and distributed food among the flood-hit people at many places, accused the ruling dispensation of having left the populace to fend for themselves.“I was appalled to see that these people have been compelled to take shelter in cramped surroundings, throwing to the winds social distancing which is still necessary in Bihar on account of the explosion of COVID-19 cases,” Yadav told reporters at one of the spots visited by him.The RJD leader drew flak from the BJP, a partner in the ruling alliance in the state, which accused the former deputy chief minister of “himself being in a hurry for electoral gains”.“Tejashwi Yadav’s antics show that he is himself in a hurry for electoral gains. Instead of cooperating with the state machinery, he is holding gatherings which could potentially lead to a fresh spurt in coronavirus cases,” BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said.The BJP spokesperson’s accusation was a rebuttal to the charge by the RJD leader who has been advocating postponement of state assembly elections, due in a few months, and alleging that the ruling coalition led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar wanted polls to be held on time, “unmindful” of the health risks involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/around-five-lakh-people-affected-in-bihar-flood/story-DQIQTmthpo40pWzv3pLzHO.html

In India, it has chosen SII as manufacturing partner, which has to conduct field trials before getting the final nod to ensure they are safe and effective for Indians.While Pune district has over 59,000 confirmed cases as of Wednesday, Mumbai has 1.03 lakh such cases. Both the cities account for almost half the positive cases in Maharashtra and over a 10th of the cases in India.There are a number of trial sites across both Mumbai and Pune that we have shortlisted, as these cities have many hotspots, which will help us understand the efficacy of the vaccine, the company’s chief executive Adar Poonawalla told PTI in an email interview.He said the company aims to commence the crucial phase-3 of the trials of the vaccine christened as Covishield in India by August after getting the necessary permissions from the Drug Controller General of India.“The Indian regulatory authorities have aided us in fast-tracking approvals keeping in mind the requisite guidelines of safety and efficacy, Poonawalla said.We do not want to rush and would focus only on delivering a viable and effective product for the masses, he said.His father and company chairman Cyrus Poonawalla had on Tuesday said SII is aiming to sell the vaccine for under Rs 1,000 per dose in India.Adar Poonawalla said the company aims to manufacture 300 million to 400 million doses by the year-end, following the success of initial and licensure trials.He said as part of the agreement with AstraZeneca, SII can manufacture 1 billion doses for India and nearly 70 low and middle income countries.There are no challenges in the manufacturing of the vaccine doses and the company will be starting by making 60-70 million doses per day, he said.He had earlier explained that the Covid-19 vaccine project is a USD 200 million bet, wherein it is investing in production even as the vaccine goes through the trials process, so as to ensure that it can introduce a large volume of the vaccines in the market as soon as the license is received. However, if this candidate fails, the company will lose the money.“Our facility is well-equipped with state-of-the-art technology to manufacture the Covid-19 vaccine. We plan to start production post regulatory approvals, Poonawala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mumbai-pune-to-help-test-vaccine-efficacy-serum-institute-of-india/story-RgT15ync2eWAQgE6oLK15M.html

23-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A city secret||These days, it is difficult to recommend a place outside home that offers physical distancing possibilities.One comes close. But there are many buts about this place. It is thick with trees, but this green padding is too thin to screen off the traffic noise (Mathura Road is next door). It is very close to the touristy zoo, but tourists rarely visit it— even during the pre-corona era. It is packed with grassy slopes, graves, and even a small ruined monument, but the entire area is so small that you could cover it in 10 minutes.The forlorn signboard outside calls this place a Delhi Development Authority (DDA) Park. Inside – plenty of weedy bushes, but no flowers, and almost nobody at the moment, in this rainy afternoon. The grounds are covered with overgrown grass, but you soon notice a narrow path snaking through the terrain. This afternoon the trees skirting the pathway are shaking quite violently in the breeze, making the setting appear like a scene from Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights.Looking around, the whole area seems untamed, but it does not feel truly wild. Perhaps because of the continuous sound of honking cars speeding along the adjacent road. Now, the most exciting thing here to be done is to ascend the hillock upon which lie three graves. You have to carefully climb upon the slippery rocks to reach the top. Up there, giant neem tree branches bend down on to the three whitewashed tombs, each draped with a colourful chadar. The graves are said to be of a Sufi mystic and his disciples; their identities is impossible to determine. In that, these graves are similar to many other resting places of forgotten mystics that litter the city. Along central Delhi’s roadsides, a number of such mounds are memorials to revered figures whose names have been lost to history. Of course, the roads came centuries after the graves, which must have once enjoyed the solitude that is still the privilege of these three.The park is also home to a little ruin. Who built it? And why? And when? There’s no plaque around to offer even a hint.The lack of information about the landmarks in this park is truly frustrating. But think of it like this—why do we need to strip the city of all its mysteries, to decode all its secrets, and break everything about it into chunks of information, to make it guidebook worthy?In a time when Google can show results even about your most introvert neighbour, it comes as a relief to hang about in a place like this one, that has managed to remain so secretive. It is tucked in Delhi’s heart, yet hidden from view. It is supremely serene and yet crudely infiltrated by the city sounds.

23-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh mulls allowing nursing homes in residential areas||Plans are afoot to permit the conversion of residential plots into nursing home sites in the city with an aim to reduce the burden on government hospitals.The UT administration has directed a standing committee of the UT administrator’s advisory council to examine the issue and report on it.MAY BRING BACK 1999 POLICYThe standing committee on urban infrastructure and planning for the city, a sub-committee of the advisory council, is scheduled to meet this week and deliberate on reviving the 1999 policy which allowed nursing homes on residential plots.As per the policy, the minimum plot size for nursing home was 500 sq yard and parking space was mandated both inside and outside the premises depending upon number of beds available.In 2005, UT had discontinued the provision of new nursing homes in residential areas in view of the traffic congestion and parking problems these posed.MOVE FOLLOWS MPs LETTERCity MP Kirron Kher had recently written to the administration, stating, “The demand for allowing nursing homes in residential areas has been a persistent one by different associations. There is paucity of private doctors in the city and a lot of burden is on government hospitals. Chandigarh government hospitals are also catering to the patients of neighbouring states. If new private nursing homes are allowed in residential areas across Chandigarh, as is prevalent in neighbouring states, it will certainly decrease the burden on government hospitals and people will get better health facilities at their doorsteps.”She added, “This will also generate more employment opportunities for medical and paramedical staff.”Speaking on the UT’s earlier decision to disallow nursing homes in residential areas, former chief architect of the city, Sumit Kaur said, “Residential sectors were designed for a serene family life. These are city-level functions and generate inter-sector movement of people. These created traffic congestion issues, parking problems and even noise pollution. Later on, specialised and designated sites for nursing homes were earmarked in sectors where all these issues have been taken care of.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mulls-allowing-nursing-homes-in-residential-areas/story-GG2ZExTXjgR9HGAswZHrOL.html

23-07-2020||City||Panchkula claims ‘zero’ Covid death||Twenty days after declaring a Covid death, Panchkula administration on Wednesday said that it was a “non-Covid death.” The woman, 76, a kidney patient, had died at a private hospital on July 2. In Wednesday’s bulletin, the authorities claimed ‘zero’ Covid-19 deaths. The reason given was that “the 76 year-old female died due to chronic renal disease (Stage 5) and had been declared Covid-19 negative before death.”Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said: “The woman was tested positive by a private laboratory, where she was undergoing dialysis. She was tested again and her report came out negative, however, we were waiting for the death audit report, to officially declare her a non-Covid death.”Three new cases, P’kula count to 348Meanwhile, three new cases were reported in the district on Wednesday, taking the count to 348 in the district. No new infections among paramilitary men were reported. Of three fresh cases, two were from Barwala while one is from Raipur Rani.

Out of the total 348 positive cases, 202 are active and 146 have been cured. The reports of 85 persons are awaited.Paramilitary asked to screen high-screen populationDuring a meeting, Panchkula deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja asked the paramilitary forced to identify high-risk population, such as pregnant woman and those suffering from chronic diseases, and screen them. “We have suggested to them that they should conduct medical screening of the population. Basically there are 300-400 families in ITBP and CRPF. Apart from this, we have asked them to strengthen their medical dispensary with extra para-medical staff. And that they should set up their own Covid care centre, which will be supervised by us.” Over 60 personnel from ITBP and CRPF have been tested positive for the virus so far, which has become of a cause of worry for the authorities. Civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said: “Trainings have been conducted at ITBP and tomorrow, it will be done at CRPF. It’s about the surveillance part, how to conduct house to house survey and basically it’s a training for how to prevent from the virus.”When asked about what led to sudden increase in numbers, she said: “I have been told that there was some sports activity, for which persons had come from outside. The good thing was that they quarantined those who had come from outside. Now, some might have picked up infection during travelling. One two families have also been infected, but they are contained their only.”She added that there is a sharp increase in number and we have identified some clusters where random sampling will be done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-claims-zero-covid-death/story-MJqxvxDimEtDBzOlXkqKrJ.html

23-07-2020||Chandigarh||No weekend curfew in Chandigarh||Despite a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases over the last fortnight, the UT administration has once again stepped back from imposing a weekend curfew in the city and will not be restricting crowds at public places such as the Sukhna Lake.Both the proposals were under consideration for some time, but during the war room review chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore on Wednesday, decisions were taken to identify micro-containment zones across the city and depute more officials at public places for stricter enforcement of social distancing.The city has seen a jump in Covid-19 cases this month, with 29 people reported positive on Wednesday, taking the count to 780.In June, on an average, around 4.9 cases were reported per day Chandigarh, a number that jumped to around 15.45 cases per day.On putting off weekend curfew plans, UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “The prop||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-weekend-curfew-in-chandigarh/story-0RMVpkk47Kf4ulTkZJeroM.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||Air India pilots unhappy with ‘lower’ pay cut taken by top management||Air India’s (AI) senior pilots have expressed discontent over the differences in pay cuts announced by the national carrier for pilots and senior management. They claim that the salaries of top AI officials have been reduced by a smaller percentage, as compared to their own. Pay of AI pilots has been reduced by 60% (40% on salary and 85% on flying allowances) owing to the new wage structure and leave without pay policy. The airline management, on the other hand, has taken a 50% cut on just their allowances.Senior pilots, unhappy with the decision, said allowances paid to high-ranking officials are a small portion of their salaries, unlike that of pilots, whose allowances constitute 70% of their salaries.Explaining the matter, a senior pilot said the airline has imposed a 40% pay cut on their gross salary and also reduced their flying allowance. “Other airlines have announced an overall percentage cut on the gross salary. Air India has announced a 40% salary cut for pilots and will also pay allowances for a maximum of 20 hours of flight time instead of 70. With the current situation, when the demand is low and flight operations are restricted, it is impossible to fly for 70 hours. All the top officials are aware of this,” said an airline official. When contacted, Air India did not comment on the matter.Another senior pilot said, “Senior management has taken a cut on just arbitrary allowances, which comprises around 20% of their salary, so their cut comes down to just about 3-5%. Deductions have been strategically applied majorly on flying allowances; this move targets only pilots and brings down a pilot’s gross salary by 60-65 % on average.”“We are still ready to take the cut in the interest of the company, but the top bosses must lead by example by agreeing to the same income loss as the frontline workers. It’s like cutting doctors’ pay during the Covid pandemic, but protecting the pay of those in the hospital accounts section,” said a senior pilot. He said that the pilots were not only flying to bring back stranded Indians but also to transport necessary personal protection equipment (PPE) and medicines during the lockdown. “If a pilot gets infected with the virus, he is de-rostered without pay. He has to prove his complete medical fitness before boarding a flight. If a pilot sustains long-term lung damage or neurological or cardiovascular damage as a side effect of Covid-19, he will lose his livelihood,” the pilot added.Jitender Bhargava, former executive director of Air India, said, “The airline’s senior management should set an example for its employees by taking at least an equivalent pay cut if not more than their staff. This wage structure is a poor decision taken by the airline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-pilots-unhappy-with-lower-pay-cut-taken-by-top-management/story-G2BTIWV6S7vnI3YEYgGN2M.html

But, ahead of Teej (July 23), this year the mehendi artists in Delhi-NCR are pleasantly surprised at the steady number of women visiting them, in popular markets. Women did step out to get their favourite henna designs applied on the hands. Anju from Anju Mehandi Art, Tilak Nagar, says, “We are getting customers. The number isn’t like previous years lekin bilkul suna bhi nahi hai. Customers to aa rahe hain aur hum bhi saare precautions le rahe hain is time pe. We sanitize our hands and wear face masks... And during the lockdown, we got a chance to come up with some interesting designs such as Madhubani, and a mix of Jaipuri and Rajasthani. Our customers have been loving these.”Some mehendi artists share that they are also getting pre-bookings. Raju Kumar, a mehendi artist in Karol Bagh, says, “Bridal ke liye toh pehle bhi booking aati thi par is baar toh Teej ke lie advance booking aa gai thi aur humne sabhi safety measures ko dhyan mein rakhte hue address pe jaake mehendi lagai. Ek client ko mehendi lagwane ke baad thode time ka gap diya aur sanitize kiya seat ko, tab dusre jane ko mehendi lagayi. Market me kaam mein manddi to abhi bhi hai par Teej aur uske baad Rakhi aa rahi hai to tyohaar karke log aa rahe hain mehendi lagwane.” Monika Aggarwal, a Karol Bagh-resident who went to the market to get mehendi applied on her hands, says, “I gave a particular time to the artist and he assured me that no one else will queue up at that time. That’s how I got the confidence to go for it. I’m a mehendi lover and thought that when everything is unlocking then why shouldn’t we give a chance to mehendi artists to get back to business; we need to learn to live with coronavirus. And, when I went there, I was satisfied to see that they took all the precautions. On my part, I took extra precautions, and I must say that it was quite a different experience this year.”Vicky, a mehendi artist at Central Market, Lajpat Nagar, says, “Customers are calling and inquiring about the safety measures we are taking. We are trying our best to not upset them, and are taking all safety measures at our end. Pehle lockdown mein kaafi nuksan ho chukka hai, ab aur nahi kara sakte toh precaution lena better hai. With Teej, the festive season is here, and we are trying our best ki customers khush rahe.”Mehak Maheshwari, a Greater Kailash resident, says, “For a recent wedding, we had invited mehendi artists in our house. They took all the precautions and so did we. I told this to my friends and they went to the market to see the same artists so as to get mehendi for Teej celebrations.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unlock-teej-mehendi-craze-takes-over-corona-scare/story-sBzMrilmW9q5X24wwq8pJI.html

The department has launched a crackdown against such buses and seized as many as 133 private buses registered with states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan. “The enforcement branch of the state transport department seized many sleeping coaches also during this drive. Out of the 133 buses that have been seized, 92 are UP registered buses, 23 are from Rajasthan and 8 from Bihar. Our department has deployed 20 teams for the ongoing drive,” said KK Dahiya, special commissioner (transport).In Delhi, interstate bus services have remained suspended since March 21. Dahiya said the transport authorities of the respective states have also been requested to cancel the licenses of the owners of these private buses so that the action acts as a deterrent. HT had earlier reported the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had given its go-ahead to resume interstate buses to and from the national capital.“The DDMA had clarified that there is no restriction by the Centre or the Delhi government on the movement of interstate buses and that such services can be resumed. But, most of the neighbouring states have kept their interstate bus services suspended till now, which is why opening our three inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) doesn’t make much sense. Even now, only Rajasthan has shown interest and Delhi’s ISBTs can’t be opened with just the buses of one state,” said Dahiya. Under the unlock 2.0 guidelines issued by the Central government on June 30, passengers can travel across state borders without travel passes. Under the Unlock 1.0 rules, interstate travel was allowed (since June 8), but it was subject to both states agreeing to the decision and passengers carrying travel passes. None of these requirements applies any longer. In Delhi, however, no interstate bus service has resumed until now.Before the onset of the pandemic, the three ISBTs would witness a combined footfall of over 250,000 every day. At least 3,467 buses from states such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Chandigarh would ply through these ISBTs every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/transport-dept-seizes-over-130-buses-plying-despite-suspended-inter-state-bus-services/story-2KhyD6oMRNQTR518w8kw1H.html

Among its major objectives is the empowerment of the underprivileged sections of society who live on the margins of society.HPU vice-chancellor Sikander Kumar said striving towards excellence, the university aims to empower the people of the hill state. He said that HPU has led the way by spearheading the progressive move to provide free education to girl students. Besides, it reserves two seats for the ‘single girl child’ in every department. The university has reserved one seat each in MPhil. and PhD for students with disabilities. It is also the first university to have started a distance education programme.

The attendants have also complained about the disruption of oxygen supply to the beds of Covid-19 patients, which has put their lives at risk.“I had to get the machine from my friend after the oxygen levels of my mother started dropping. I don’t know when the oxygen supply will be stopped and there is nobody whom we can approach. Therefore, we got the portable machine,” said Ahmad, whose mother is admitted in a ward at the hospital. “We have never seen senior doctors or head of departments visit these wards. They have left everything on the shoulders of juniors and many of them are overburdened and have long duty hours, “ he added.Even for minor test reports like KFT, LFT and others, the attendants have to wait for hours.A physically challenged 16-year-old patient admitted at the hospital had to wait for several hours to get an injection on Tuesday as the staff couldn’t find her veins. “When the anesthesia department was given a call they refused to come and attendants had no option but to wait. She was recovering and we don’t know what will happen to her now. Being an attendant, we can’t even raise our voice,” the girl’s mother said.Attendants of another patient Wani Nighat from north Kashmir were forced to arrange oxygen cylinder on rent when the supply was disrupted due to some issues.A doctor at the hospital said four resident doctors are deputed for seven wards which is exhausting. “They get 50 calls for IV lines which is not manageable at times and patients feel they are being ignored,” he said.SKIMS director AG Ahangar said all senior doctors are keeping tab on patients. “Our doctors regularly visit patients. The hospital has three oxygen plants and all are working fine. Due to Covid-19, the rush of patients has increased and the hospital was getting oxygen supply from a private vendor. It has developed a snag and we have arranged oxygen from another vendor,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/attendants-at-skims-allege-lack-of-support-from-hospital-administration/story-YNUfNjcX7yx8Chn8coublK.html

Also the hospital isn’t charging as per the government directions, “said Tiwari.He added, “They also took bed ₹2,500 as bed charges. There are so many other charges mentioned in the bill.”The video shows Tiwari confronting the hospital staffs, asking them about the overcharging and seeking an explanation.

Two of the accused worked as medical representatives for a private firm. AEC officers received their contact numbers from an informant, following which they set up a trap. One officer posed as a dummy buyer and got two accused to come to deliver a vial of injection for ₹25,000 and nabbed them. Senior police inspector R Kothmire said, “A pharmaceutical distributor based in Wadala, Pradip Jain, is the distributor. He is yet to be arrested. He sold it to the prime accused, Amitab Das, 39, for ₹11,000. Das then sold it to Arun Singh, 35, and Sudhakar Giri, 37, who are medical representatives, for ₹17 thousand.

23-07-2020||Mumbai||PIL seeks curb on begging activities by children during Covid-19 pandemic||The petitioner, who filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Bombay high court in 2019, has sought an urgent hearing regarding the proliferation of beggars after the relaxation of lockdown norms and the condition of child beggars in view of the pandemic. The petition had earlier sought directions to the state and local authorities to clamp down on syndicates that control and push children and women into begging, by invoking the provisions of the Maharashtra Prevention of Begging Act, 1960. However, in light of the Covid pandemic, the petitioner has sought an immediate stop on begging activities and to rehabilitate the women and children in homes so that they may be safeguarded from contracting Covid-19.The PIL filed by Dhyaneshwar Darwatkar through advocate Shekhar Jagtap was based on a 2016 survey conducted by Rainbow Foundation, an NGO. The survey had revealed that there were more than 10,000 children involved in begging only in Pune city. Of them, nearly 83% belonged to families that live on streets while 15% were street working children and 3% were children who lived alone on the streets.In light of these figures, the petition had sought immediate measures to stop begging activities on the streets by children and women and to initiate action against police officers who allowed such activities. After hearing the submissions in 2019, the court had directed the Pune authorities to file a reply.On Wednesday, Jagtap moved a praecipe for urgent hearing of the petition on the grounds that as lockdown norms had been relaxed, thousands of children had started begging. As children are susceptible to Covid-19 which poses a threat to them and to general public, an urgent hearing was sought.

23-07-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal BJP president appointment: Caste factor, clean image worked in Kashyap’s favour||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command has made a smart move by picking young Shimla MP Suresh Kashyap as party’s Himachal unit chief.Kashyap’s defence background, non-controversial image and caste card make him a good bet for the party that is eyeing the 2022 assembly elections.Of the total 68 assembly segments in Himachal, 17 are reserved. Scheduled castes comprise 26.5% of population in Himachal – the second-most dominant community after Rajputs (37.5%). Kashyap is the first Himachal party president from the SC community. Age in his favourThe BJP has been keen on strengthening the second-line leadership in the hill state. In both Lok Sabha and assembly elections, the saffron party has given preference to young leaders. Kashyap, 49, fits into the party’s plan nicely.Also, after Nahan legislator Rajeev Bindal had to step down from the state party president’s post following a health scam controversy, the BJP had been on the lookout for a leader with a clean image to hold the party’s reins in the hill state. Bindal had resigned from his post on May 27 within four-and-a-half months of his appointment, saying he was doing so to ensure a proper investigation into the case of alleged corruption by a health department official. Defence backgroundThere are nearly two lakh serving and retired defence personnel in Himachal. Kashyap, who served in the Indian Air Force before joining the politics in 2005, will come in handy to strike a chord with defence voters.Born in Paplahan village of Sirmaur, Kashyap started his political career from the grassroots. He remained a member of block development committee, Pachad, from 2005 to 2010. He joined the BJP in 2006 and became party’s district SC Morcha chief . He was later appointed as state general secretary of BJP SC Morcha in 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-bjp-president-appointment-caste-factor-clean-image-worked-in-kashyap-s-favour/story-0BnFwRbW1iMVtf7kKnNYAP.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||DNA test not conclusive evidence in rape, HC upholds trial court view||An Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has upheld a trial court view that the result of a DNA test is not a conclusive piece of evidence in rape cases, and rejected a bail plea of a rape convict from Latur district. A DNA test has revealed that the convict was not the biological father of the rape survivor’s child.According to the prosecution, the survivor, a 16-year-old hearing and speech impaired girl, was raped in February 2018, but her pregnancy came to light when she got married a few months after the incident. A day after the marriage, her husband noticed that she was pregnant, and took her back to her parents’ house.A first information report (FIR) was registered against the applicant, based on the girl’s testimony, and he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment by a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court.The convict had moved a plea seeking suspension of the sentence and appealed for bail during pendency of his appeal against conviction, primarily on the grounds that the DNA test result of December 2018 proved that he was not the biological father of the survivor’s child, and thus, falsified the charge of rape levelled against him.An assistant public prosecutor, however, opposed the plea, submitting that in her statement in the FIR, and her testimony before the trial court, the survivor clearly stated that she was raped by the applicant, because of which she became pregnant.The prosecutor submitted that the trial court had rightly held that a negative result of the DNA test did not rule out the possibility of the applicant raping the girl. He submitted that the applicant took advantage of the fact that the survivor was handicapped, and her mother was blind, and thus, deserved no sympathy.Justice Vibha Kankanwadi found force in the prosecutor’s submissions, noting that the trial court had taken pains to point out that the DNA test cannot be considered conclusive evidence regarding rape, and cannot be solely relied on to exclude ocular evidence (testimony of the survivor).“This court agreed to the observation made by the learned trial judge that the DNA report is a corroborative piece of evidence,” said justice Kankanwadi, while approving the view adopted by the special court, and rejecting the convict’s plea.HC also clarified that the general principle is that when there is a variance between ocular and medical evidence, then the former has to be given weightage over the later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dna-test-not-conclusive-evidence-in-rape-hc-upholds-trial-court-view/story-oBqhSRqIYwK42fCzN6StVI.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||Inspector suspended for naming person in FIR sans sufficient grounds||A police inspector has been suspended for allegedly naming an individual in a first information report (FIR) without sufficient grounds. The inspector also named the individual as a co-accused in abusing and assaulting a south Mumbai policeman along with Yash Shah, the grandson of film producer Bharat Shah, in November 2019.The officer had also allegedly ranted about his seniors on a WhatsApp group of police officers. He hurled abuses and made derogatory remarks about officers in the group. A departmental inquiry on this has been ordered.Inspector Anup Dange has been suspended by additional commissioner of police (south region) Nishith Mishra on July 18. Dange was previously attached to the Gamdevi police station.According to the police officers, on November 23, 2019, while on a night patrolling duty, Gamdevi police inspector Anup Dange along with his team had visited the pub, Dirty Buns SoBo, located on Bhulabhai Desai Road. The officer asked the pub staff to close down as per the Mumbai Police rule that does not permit any hotel or pub establishment to run the business beyond 1.30am deadline. Policemen also asked the customers to leave. Meanwhile, film produces and diamond merchant Bharat Shah’s grandson Yash, who was at the pub along with his friends, had a heated argument with another customer near the elevator, the police said.Police naik Santosh Pawar, 43, tried to pacify, but Yash and another customer allegedly started abusing and assaulting Pawar, and also tore his uniform. Other policemen rushed to Pawar’s help and Yash and his friends were detained by the police.The police had registered a criminal case against Yash Shah, his two friends and arrested them. The pub owner and two unidentified customers were also booked. Pawar was made complainant in the case and all seven accused were booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.However, the police’s internal inquiry found that inspector Dange misguided Pawar and ordered him to name one person in the FIR who had nothing to do with the offence. After this, he was transferred to the south region control room as a punishment posting.Later, Dange allegedly posted objectionable messages about his seniors on a WhatsApp group of policemen called ‘Gamdevi Officers’. “The messages Dange posted on the group were derogatory and insulting and were also causing character assassination of senior police officers. His messages had the potential to instigate others in creating negative notions about senior police officers,” said a police officer requesting anonymity.“Such an attitude cannot be tolerated in a disciplined police force. Hence, he was suspended a few days ago pending a departmental inquiry,” another officer said. However, Dange was not available for comment.Dange also had heated argument on the same night with Bharat Shah, his son and grandson at the police station. Dange had alleged that Shah was trying to pressurize him to not to take action against his grandson and was also instigating Yash to abuse and assault policemen.Later he had registered a separate case against Shah along with his son and grandson for allegedly assaulting a police officer and creating ruckus at the Gamdevi police station. However, Shah had managed to secure pre-arrest bail in the matter from a city sessions court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/inspector-suspended-for-naming-person-in-fir-sans-sufficient-grounds/story-uQwX46cXZ26xFZO3Tl1pwN.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||Yellow alert: IMD says heavy rain likely over the weekend||After five days of sporadic light showers and mostly dry conditions, the weather bureau on Wednesday predicted an increase in rain intensity expected over the weekend.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a yellow alert (heavy rain at isolated areas) for the entire Konkan coast, including Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg for Saturday and Sunday. A yellow alert has been issued for Raigad and Ratnagiri for Thursday and Friday as well.The city and suburbs can expect cloudy conditions, with very light rain or drizzles on Thursday and Friday.IMD said monsoon conditions are likely to be active due to strengthening weather factors. “A trough, extending from the Karnataka to Kerala coast, is expected to strengthen, and a weather system is likely to form in the Bay of Bengal towards the weekend,” said an IMD official.A drop in rain activity this week has led to hotter conditions across Mumbai. The island city and suburbs recorded day temperatures of 32.2 and 32.7 degrees Celsius, respectively, which was two degrees above normal.Over the last 24 hours, no rain was recorded in the city or suburbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yellow-alert-imd-says-heavy-rain-likely-over-the-weekend/story-83WkK936WegP55g0FlGKGK.html
23-07-2020||City||Social distancing to be strictly followed in jail||After over 20 officers at Thane jail, including the superintendent, tested positive for Covid-19, jail authorities have adopted measures employed by Arthur Road Mumbai Central Jail to curb the spread of the infection. These include maintaining adequate distance between officers and inmates in common areas and implementing a diet and exercise regimen for all its employees. No inmates have tested positive so far.Deepak Pandey, inspector general (prisons) has visited Thane Jail twice in the past month and shared a video with the jail’s staff with instructions to curb the spread of Covid-19. In the video, Pandey talks about how Arthur Road Jail, where over 181 prisoners tested positive for Covid-19 and over 90% have recovered, tackled the infection.In the past month, around 20 officers of Thane Jail have tested positive for Covid-19. Five officers are still under treatment while the rest have recovered, including two officers above the age of 45 who were in critical condition.Jail superintendent Harshad Ahirrao, who was among the Covid-positive, said, “We studied Arthur Road Jail’s measures to tackle the cases. We have over 250 employees and 3,000 prisoners. The employees did not come in direct contact with any inmate. They maintained distance while on rounds. Barricades were set up at common places like the dining area. At medical camps, prisoners maintained distance. The doctors conducting the camps wore PPE [personal protective equipment].”Ahirrao said employees of Thane Jail were divided into teams. Each team worked for 15 days and then was off duty for the next 15 days. “On returning, the employees are told to isolate for two to three days as we don’t know what they do in their off period,” said Ahirrao. Returning officers are not allocated work that would bring them in contact with prisoners for the first few days. Recently, one employee tested positive upon their return to work, due to which 19 others contracted Covid-19. All Thane Jail employees and prisoners were given an exercise regimen. Officers were also recommended yoga and healthy diets. Counselling was provided to Covid-positive employees and their families. Counselling sessions were also made available to other officials and inmates.In May, 1,000 of Thane Jail’s 4,000 inmates were released on bail, following the Supreme Court’s direction to state governments to decongest jails by releasing certain categories of prisoners so that the spread of Covid-19 may be curbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/social-distancing-to-be-strictly-followed-in-jail/story-KuoDlQKgtj3rWQM8eX5KRJ.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||52-year-old accused of sexually abusing minor refused bail||The special court under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act on Tueday refused to grant bail to 52-year-old man arrested for sexually abusing a 12-year-old boy since 2018.According to the case registered with Khar police station, the minor has in his statement said that during Diwali in 2018, the accused had called him to his residence to have chicken, showed him pornographic videos and sexually assaulted him.The boy said the accused continued to assault him, but he could only disclose this in January this year. It is claimed that the boy was caught showing clips to other girl students in his school by his teacher in January. The matter was taken up with his parents. It was after this that the boy opened up about the sexual abuse by neighbour. The family then filed a complaint against the neighbour with Khar police station in January.The accused was arrested on January 16 and has been in jail since. On July 17, the accused moved the court seeking bail claiming delay in registering the complaint. The accused also pleaded that there is a possibility of him contracting Covid-19 in jail.Public prosecutor Geeta Sharma opposed the plea on the grounds that the accused is staying alone in the city, hence there is a possibility that he would abscond. The prosecution also expressed concerns that the accused may repeat the offence as he stays in the same neighbourhood as the minor. The prosecution also presented medical report which confirmed that the boy was subjected to sexual assault several times.The court, after hearing both the sides, rejected the plea observing that it is dangerous to release the accused. It also noted that since December 2018, the victim was subjected to sexual abuse on several occasions and punishment for the offence, if proved, can go up to life imprisonment.Considering the nature of the offence, the victim’s age, direct evidence showing involvement of the accused in the offence, the court held the accused is not fit to be granted bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/52-year-old-accused-of-sexually-abusing-minor-refused-bail/story-amvsOlAq84S0nSoQRqK02J.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Excessive leopard captures in Nashik due to fear psychosis’||Fear psychosis among villagers due to human-animal conflict has led to a surge in leopard captures in Nashik, said forest officials, adding that all captured big cats may not have been involved in the conflict.The Maharashtra forest department caught a sub-adult female leopard from farmlands at Palse village in Nashik, early Tuesday morning. The animal was then transported to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) on Wednesday. This is the third conflict-related capture within a month and 11th over eight months. Nashik forest officials said there are two more leopards in the area and plan to trap them both as early as possible. Five deaths and five serious injuries (including two children) have been reported since December 2019 at the 12-km stretch along Darna river (between Sinnar and Eklahare) where leopard numbers have risen significantly. Apart from three leopards sent to SGNP, eight were captured and released at undisclosed locations (forest areas) between December and April before human deaths were reported.The forest department on Wednesday said based on a report received from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, an adult male leopard was responsible for conflict cases. The report was based on swab samples of four of the five victims. “While DNA reports matching those of the trapped leopards are yet to be received, the latest report states that a large male leopard was responsible for four deaths. We estimate that none of the leopards captured so far were involved in the conflict,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife-west).On July 12 and July 2, a two-year-old male leopard and five-year-old female leopard were lured into trap cages at Chehedi village and Samangaon, and transported to SGNP. “The sub-adult male does not exhibit extreme fierceness nor any traits that he may have been in conflict. It is now clear that the male leopard, dangerous to human life, is still at large and is one of the two leopards yet to be caught,” said Limaye adding that releasing captured animals at the moment in Nashik was risky. “There is a fear psychosis among villagers. Once we have caught the problem animal, immediate efforts will be made to rehabilitate the three captured leopards. We have ensured minimal human imprint during their temporary stay in captivity.”Vivek Bhadane, range forest officer (RFO), Nashik said, “We are under tremendous pressure from local villagers. Any lapse in tracing the male leopard, which is yet to be captured, still poses a great threat to human safety. For this reason, capturing as many leopards and moving them to captivity, for the time being, is helping us trace the problem animal, and also acts as a temporary comfort for villagers.”Over 200 dogs, close to 100 wild boars and cattle have been killed, said Bhadane adding, “An average of 25 dogs have been killed per month since December.”Wildlife experts said Nashik had reached the worst-case scenario for human-animal conflict. “The only way forward is to have a targeted campaign and engage villagers to collectively address the issue of leopard presence in croplands. Nashik needs to have rapid response teams including villagers similar to how Junnar tackled this problem,” said Vidya Athreya, wildlife biologist.Others said the forest department was not prepared for more conflict cases. “Without any proper census undertaken, the humongous rise in leopard numbers has not been documented in Nashik. Especially when the habitat of these animals has changed from dense forests to sugarcane farms. Even if they are being released back into forests, they are returning to farmlands regularly,” said Rohan Bhate, member, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau. “A detailed location-specific study needs to be undertaken before capture numbers rise to 10 per month.”Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) said, “Leopards are using the sugarcane farms, adjacent to forest areas along Darna, as a safe zone. While hunting for dogs and other livestock, they are coming in close proximity to farmers. The department has already begun a conflict management exercise with locals and the situation is likely to improve soon.”‘Capacity at SGNP leopard rescue centre almost full’As leopard captures rise in Nashik, three hours away at SGNP, Borivli, the leopard rescue centre is reaching its capacity. The rescue centre currently has 15 leopards with the latest addition of three from Nashik. “We have three more cages left. With two more leopards planned to be captured soon, we would have only one additional cage. However, the three leopards recently brought to SGNP are only coming in close proximity to humans twice a day. Once when their cages are cleaned and when they are being fed. This is done to reduce human-imprint as much as possible. The issue is they get adapted to captivity very fast,” said Vijay Barabde, superintendent of safaris and range forest officer, SGNP.Meanwhile, Bhadane said the leopard trapped on Tuesday was 1 to 1.5 years old. However, SGNP officials said the leopard was not more than eight months old. “Even the male leopard trapped on July 12 was said to be 2 years old but he is not more than 11 months. All three leopards are healthy,” said Barabde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/excessive-leopard-captures-in-nashik-due-to-fear-psychosis/story-OMUiLF3J7fraSIvGpRsxfO.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||Sheena Bora murder case: Bail plea of Shyamvar Rai rejected||The special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Wednesday rejected the interim bail plea of Shyamvar Rai, one of the main accused in the murder of Sheena Bora. Rai, a close aide of Indrani Mukerjea, has turned approver in the case.Rai had moved a plea before the special CBI court for interim bail for 45 days in view of the spread of Covid-19 in prison. Rai has been in jail since his arrest in 2015 and is currently lodged in Thane jail.CBI prosecutor Manoj Chalandan opposed the plea on the grounds that jail authorities are taking appropriate measures to deal with the Covid-19 situation on jail premises and all prisoners are well taken care of. CBI also pleaded that Rai is an approver in the case and cannot be released till the trial ends.After considering the objections raised by CBI, the special court rejected Rai’s plea.According to the prosecution, Bora was killed on April 24, 2012 by Mukerjea, her former husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai. The three allegedly strangled her in a car, and later dumped her body in a bag and kept it overnight in the garage. The bag containing Bora’s body was taken to Pen village the next day and was set on fire. The remains were first found in May 2012.The case came into light after Rai’s arrest in August 2015. He was arrested by Khar police for illegal possession of a pistol. During the questioning, Rai had confessed to the murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sheena-bora-murder-case-bail-plea-of-shyamvar-rai-rejected/story-4b2aGwv6Zcbjb0UGHvMElM.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||Not 2020, Metro-3 tunnelling likely to be completed in 2021||One of the city’s most ambitious projects, the 33.5-km fully underground Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz), has been majorly affected by the coronavirus-enforced lockdown. While the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) was looking at completing tunnelling work by December 2020, lack of labourers, machinery and disruptions in the supply chain during the lockdown have most likely delayed work to beyond February 2021. According to officials, MMRC was undertaking tunnelling at a speed of 1,500 metre per month before the lockdown, which has reduced to 600m in the past two-and-a-half months. The number of labourers had reduced from 15,000 to 4,000 on site, which has now improved to 6,000 as migrant labourers have started coming to the city. Eighty-three per cent of the tunnelling work and 57% of the overall work have been completed.A senior official from MMRC said, “There has been a major disruption in the supply chain, availability of labour and even spare parts. Despite that, we have completed 45.6km of tunnelling work. While we did aim for December 2020 to complete tunnelling work, it might go beyond February 2021 now.” It is the stretch between Mahalakshmi and Mumbai Central that would spill over to 2021, the official said.While MMRC was expecting the first rolling stock by December 2020, that might also be delayed owing to the lockdown. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, under chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, has also stalled the car-shed work at Aarey Colony, which would further derail the project. Thackeray stalled the work in November 2019 and appointed a committee to look at alternative options for the car-shed. However, the state is yet to take a call on it.The earlier deadline for phase 1 of the fully underground corridor was June 2021, which was revised to December 2021, owing to delays caused by legal battles. In 2017, MMRC had estimated that even a day’s delay in Metro-3 would cost ₹4.2 crore. The project cost has already escalated from ₹23,000 crore to ₹32,000 crore.Two Metro lines that were to be operational by December 2020 had also been pushed to April 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-2020-metro-3-tunnelling-likely-to-be-completed-in-2021/story-gdS9gQSLN2CMSE24GsWxQL.html

While the residents continue to use the masks unaware of the warning, the manufacturers and traders rue that the sales had already gone down as a large number of residents do not change the mask after purchasing it for once. The manufacturers further demanded that the government should allow export of N95 masks with valves, which has a demand in the internal market.The director general of health services in the Union ministry of health, in a letter to the principal secretaries of health and medical education of states, had said on Tuesday that it has been observed that there is “inappropriate use” of N-95 masks, particularly those with valved respirators by the public other than designated health workers.President of Punjab Chemists’ Association Surinder Duggal said: “We have asked our association members to make the people aware about the government’s new guidelines that warn the usage of N95 masks. But some people are still adamant on purchasing masks with valves.”VENDING MACHINE AT CHANDIGARH RAILWAY STATION The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDCL) has installed an automatic vending machine for dispensing 3-ply masks, N95 masks, sanitisers and gloves at the Chandigarh railway station last week.An official said that the corporation has observed an average sale of Rs 5,000-6,000 in last few days and the highest of nearly Rs 8,000 sale from the vending machine. On being asked about any plans to discontinue N-95 masks with valves after recent guidelines by the health ministry, Balbir Singh, CGM, IRSDCL, Chandigarh, said: “I am aware of the advisory, but we’re yet to receive any official notification on the same. Once we receive it, we may discontinue the N95 masks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-warning-use-sale-of-n95-masks-goes-on-unabated-in-punjab/story-CsetRRBuEhl4ImAMM7qtxL.html
23-07-2020||Pune||Covid hospital did not pay two months’ salary: Pune doctor||A doctor from Pune, who worked at the intensive care unit (ICU) of Baj RR Covid Hospital in Dombivli for two months, has complained of non-payment of salary and sudden termination by the management of the private hospital.The doctor, who tested positive to Covid-19, has been undergoing treatment at a hospital in Ulhasnagar since the past eight days. In a letter to Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi, he stated, “I joined on May 3 at the Covid hospital in Dombivli and was terminated on June 28 without any prior notice. They also assured to pay the salary of two months by July 15, but there was no further communication. When I asked the hospital management, they threatened to cancel my medical registration.” The 32-year-old, who earlier worked in a hospital in Pune as casualty doctor, joined Baj RR Hospital for three months on a contractual basis that assured ₹55,000 salary per month. He moved from Pune to Dombivli to join the hospital and had treated around 40 Covid-positive patients. However, he tested positive for Covid-19 on July 14.“I am sure the hospital got my replacement for lesser salary and hence they removed me. It’s not just me; there is another doctor and two ward boys who are not paid. I am admitted in a hospital now and if the salary is not paid how am I supposed to pay my bills. I have mailed a letter with my complaint to the KDMC chief as I am helpless,” he said.Another doctor, Pawan Saini, 28, who left the work at Baj RR Hospital on June 30, also complained of non-payment of salary.“I left the job due to personal reasons and my two months’ salary is pending. They had agreed to pay me on July 15, but now there is no communication. I don’t understand why my payment is held,” said Saini who worked at the hospital at the ward since January.When asked, Bharat Tiwari, chief executive officer of the hospital, said, “He [the doctor from Pune] was warned thrice before the termination as he fought with staffers and was also caught eating inside the ICU. As his salary was delayed, I received threatening calls from random people in the past few days. Hence, I decided to hold the salary.”“The other doctor has also ganged up with him. Unless he gives me a written apology, we will not pay him,” added Tiwari.The doctor, however, refuted the allegations saying, “These are false allegations. I was terminated without any valid reason.” Suryavanshi did not respond to calls, while KDMC health officer Dr Pratibha Panpatil claimed that she was not aware of the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-hospital-did-not-pay-two-months-salary-pune-doctor/story-a4SF8piULRugV0s9V5KsIN.html

They have also demanded a reduction in fees for the academic year 2020-21.“The institute should provide alternative mechanism for students who don’t have access to internet or laptops/mobiles,” read a statement released jointly by the Progressive Students Front (PSF) and the North East Students’ Forum (NESF) on Tuesday evening. It further stated, “In the fees levied for the semester, there are components that become redundant given online education and absence of students on campus in Mumbai. Components such as medical examination fees, field work charges, computer fees, etc. should be removed.” While the students are still waiting to hear from the management about their demands, a spokesperson for TISS administration said the institute is working on the same. “We are looking at the complaints from candidates to verify if there has been any error for any particular programme,” said PK Shajahan, dean (academics), TISS, Mumbai.He said not more than one-third of the lectures will be conducted through live sessions, and added that the institute is exploring the possibility of recorded sessions to be made available for students to download any time.

Schools have been asked to conduct exams for of these students by August 7. “As per government rules, students who fail in Class 9 and 11 are eligible for a re-exam the same year and passing the exam would allow them to be promoted to the next class. Under the current conditions schools should conduct an oral exam of such students either by calling them to school or via video conferencing by August 7,” states the GR. Earlier this month, several parents had written to the state government urging schools to cancel re-exams and promote all students due to the pandemic. Parents said that schools should conduct online exams and should not call students to school even for orals. “It is a big risk which we are not willing to take,” said a parent of a Dadar based school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/class-9-and-11-students-to-be-promoted-based-on-oral-exams/story-iu2H24lAUxCbH6jmRhR8YP.html

23-07-2020||Mumbai||Rajgruh vandalism: Second accused arrested in Kalyan||The Matunga police on Wednesday arrested second accused Vishal Ashok More alias Vitthal Kanya, 20, from Kalyan railway station in connection with the vandalism at Rajgruh, the house of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, located at the Hindu Colony, Dadar in Central Mumbai. The first accused Umesh Sitaram Jadhav, 35, was arrested two days after the incident on July 9.“Both the accused were captured in the CCTV camera installed inside the house. Jadhav was found standing outside the Rajgruh, while More went inside the house and damaged the pots in the compound,” said senior inspector Vijaysingh Ghatge of the Matunga police station. More has no permanent place to stay so he was staying on footpath and railway station’s platform. The incident occurred on July 7. Jadhav was arrested from Matunga, while More was absconding. The CCTV footage was circulated to all the police stations across Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai and the railway police were also alerted. During the search, police team spotted More at Kalyan railway station on Wednesday afternoon. After verification, he was brought to the police station and was arrested. It does not appear that he did this intentionally, but we are inquiring further, added Ghatge. Earlier, a case was registered under sections 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of ₹50 or more) and 447 (criminal trespass) of the IPC based on the complaint of one of the three grandsons of Dr Ambedkar who reside in the house.On Tuesday evening around 5.30pm, the accused first threw stones at glass window panels of Rajgruh and then entered through the gate. He was barefoot and damaged flower pots. CCTV cameras were not damaged, a senior police officer said.The guard at Rajgruh is said to be the witness in the case.The two-storeyed heritage house of Dr Ambedkar has a museum where his books are kept along with his portrait, ashes and vessels and other artefacts.Ambedkar’s daughter-in-law and three grandsons Prakash, Bhimrao and Anandrao live at the bungalow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rajgruh-vandalism-second-accused-arrested-in-kalyan/story-iiiIUn6Cu4MOFr8pdPBh7K.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||Incarceration of young boy for indefinite time antithesis to liberty: HC||Incarceration of a young boy for an indefinite period would be the antithesis to the concept of liberty, the Bombay high court (HC) said on Tuesday, while granting bail to an engineering graduate from Pune who was arrested for allegedly raping his friend.Justice Bharati Dangre has ordered the 25-year-old man to be released on a personal bond of ₹50,000 and one or two sureties in the same amount.The Pune resident was booked by Paud police station for raping his friend when a group of classmates had visited Amby Valley, near Lonavala in October 2019. The victim complained that the accused tried to force himself upon her when they stayed at a bungalow, during the night.Counsel for the accused, advocate Abhinav Chandrachud, however, maintained that it was a consensual act. He pointed out that the incident allegedly took place in the night of October 28, but the complainant disclosed the incident to her friends accompanying them a day after when they were about to depart. He added that the offence was registered belatedly on November 8, 2019, and the accused was arrested on December 16.Justice Dangre, however, refused to accept that the delay was indicative of the fact that the prosecution’s case was false.The judge said, “There cannot be a formula as to how a woman will react to an act of outrage by a male, since all women are borne into different circumstances in life, go through different things and face, experience and react differently. Each woman would turn out to be different from the other.”The judge said that the long-lived notion expressed in the words of Warren Buffet, ‘if a lady says no, she means maybe’ or in the expression of Rich Santos for Marie Claire - ‘changing nos to yeses’, were old tricks.“Whether the girl consented freely for a physical indulgence has to be searched by applying new standards of modern life and the present social scenario,” said the judge.The court, however, granted bail to the engineering graduate after noticing that at least two friends of the survivor have revealed in their statements to the police that they had seen the survivor and the accused having slept together in a bedroom.The court also took into consideration that the 25-year-old was languishing in jail for over seven months and there was no likelihood of him fleeing, as he was a permanent resident of Pune and his father runs a business of manufacturing and engineering goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/incarceration-of-young-boy-for-indefinite-time-antithesis-to-liberty-hc/story-S62cc6R28bGYwJXKI8cGfL.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||Dismiss Babri case before Ram Mandir ceremony: Sena||As the ground-breaking ceremony for the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya draws near, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday said that dismissal of the Babri mosque demolition case before the ceremony would be a fitting homage to the “martyrs” of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.“When you accept [Mughal emperor] Babar was an aggressor, the Babri case itself becomes obsolete...If the Babri masjid demolition case is dismissed before the ‘bhoomi pujan’ of the Ram Mandir, it would be a homage to the martyrs of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement,” said an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana.The editorial added that even after the Supreme Court gave its verdict on the Ram Janma Bhoomi case, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) continues to Babri mosque demolition case. “The foundation is being laid for the Ram temple. Prime Minister Modi is going for the ceremony, but Babri demolition case is still on, where leaders such as Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, etc appear as accused,” it said adding that this is “a strange game of the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dismiss-babri-case-before-ram-mandir-ceremony-sena/story-2SBUTzhniXF5kMdCcolL0J.html

The fraudsters have also published advertisements on some housing portals. They are asking buyers to deposit money through online modes, such as Paytm, to take part in the lottery.According to Vaishali Gadpale, chief public relations officer of Mhada, people should not fall prey to such mechanisms. “We don’t have any project in Dadar. In addition, our officials do not call people to take part in lottery. We don’t want people to lose their hard-earned money to these cheaters,” said Gadpale.Mhada vigilance department has taken over the case and have started their investigation. The accused are allegedly advertising 1 room kitchen, 1 bedroom hall kitchen (BHK) and 2 BHK flats and started an account named ‘Corporate central collective hub, MHADA’ to fool victims while depositing money.One of the homebuyers, who received such call, said he was told that it was a life-time opportunity and that he had to first deposit ₹3,500 as initial payment to take part in the lottery. However, when he asked for the eligibility criteria, he was told everything would be taken care of and the details would be shared after he deposited the money.

23-07-2020||Mumbai||Triple talaq in Bandra: Businessman booked||Nirmal Nagar police has booked a Bandra-based businessman for divorcing his wife by uttering talaq three times. The first information report was filed following a complaint by the man’s 46-year-old wife.The woman, in her complaint, said, “I got married in November 1999 and lived in Navpada, Bandra (East). After a few years passed smoothly, my husband wanted to set up a footwear business on Linking Road, so I provided him with monetary help. However, in 2006 he almost got addicted to pornographic videos and sexually assaulted me on several occasions,” She further alleged that on one occasion she was left bleeding and had to visit a local clinic for treatment. Following the incident, she warned her husband that she would file a complaint against him if he sexually assaulted her again. But he threatened to post obscene pictures and videos of her on social media.Later, the accused allegedly demanded more money from her, and when she refused, he assaulted her with an iron rod. The complainant’s advocate Adil Khatri said, “On June 15, her husband uttered the word talaq three times to divorce her. Following this, she decided to report this incident. She visited Nirmal Nagar police station and lodged a complaint against her husband and two of his family members.” Shashikant Bhandare, senior inspector, Nirmal Nagar police station, said, “We have registered the offence and are investigating the matter. We have not arrested any accused so far.”Police have booked her husband and his two family members under sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) 506 (criminal intimidation), 34 (common intension) of the Indian Penal Code and section 4 (pronouncing talaq) of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/triple-talaq-in-bandra-businessman-booked/story-GYXVuKbCqxUdvNAz2i8dNM.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||Stomach flu cases in June lowest since 2012: BMC||The absence of street food vendors due to the lockdown has reduced cases of gastroenteritis — also known as stomach flu — to its lowest count in eight years. Other illnesses, like hepatitis and dengue, have also reported fewer patients this year, say experts.Data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows that the number of gastroenteritis cases dropped by almost 15 times in June this year to 40 cases, as compared 777 cases in June 2019. So far in July, 21 cases of gastroenteritis have been recorded. Similarly, last year, the city witnessed 282 cases of hepatitis in June while this year in June, only three cases were reported. There have been no cases of hepatitis this month so far.Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, said, “During monsoon, waterlogging and overflowing sewage lines spread bacteria and viruses. So we see the highest number of gastroenteritis and hepatitis cases, mostly caused by contaminated water. But this year, the flow of patients has gone down by almost 70%. Closure of roadside food stalls, which is the primary source of infection, is one of the major factors behind the plunge in cases.”Dengue cases have also dropped, with four cases in June this year as compared to eight in June 2019. Five patients were diagnosed with leptospirosis in June 2019 while only one leptospirosis patient was reported last month.However, there has been a slight increase in cases of malaria. In June 2019, there were 313 cases of malaria in Mumbai while last month, 328 cases were reported.“Due to limitations on the movement of people, they were not exposed as much to mosquito breeding grounds. Additionally, all construction sites are closed,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC.No deaths have been recorded due to any of these ailments since April.Due to similarities in the symptoms of malaria and dengue with Covid-19, all patients are mandatorily tested for the Sars-CoV-2 virus. “We have kept separate beds for monsoon-related ailments, but the flow of such patients is thin so far. Also, the cases of co-infection of Covid-19 with monsoon ailments are rare,” said Dr Deshmukh.Doctors said cases of monsoon-related illnesses may rise once there is heavier rain, leading to stagnant water. In July, the civic body has registered 236 cases of malaria in the city with 78 cases reported in the first week and 158 cases in the second.“We have kept over 9,000 non-Covid beds ready for treatment of such patients. Generally, cases rise to the highest by the end of August when the city witnesses the heaviest rainfall. Thankfully, till Wednesday, no deaths have been reported due to dengue or malaria,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/stomach-flu-cases-in-june-lowest-since-2012-bmc/story-GY9oCAbfbVpMc8U4ZzuoVK.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||HSC, SSC students to collect mark sheets from school, college: State board||The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), on Wednesday, announced that mark sheets of students who appeared for their SSC (Class 10) and HSC (Class 12) exams this year will have to be picked up directly from their respective schools and colleges.This could pose a problem for students, as visiting their institutes to receive their mark sheets could put them at risk of getting infected with Covid-19. Additionally, travel restrictions will make it difficult for many students who live far away or have returned to their hometowns.The announcement regarding mark sheet disbursement was made after MSBSHSE held an internal meeting to come up with possible solutions for the issue.“There was a consensus that these mark sheets would have to be given by hand and cannot be sent by post or any other way as it is an important document. Colleges can, however, ensure all safety norms and give flexibility to students to collect it,” said a senior official from the board. The official said that mark sheets would reach schools and colleges within 12 days after the results.On July 16, the state board announced results for HSC examinations, and the admission process to first-year degree courses began on July 17. Since then, parents have been trying to know when and how they can collect the mark sheets considering that many students live far from their colleges. “Especially in Mumbai, it is going to be a struggle. Trains are not working, and travelling so far is not just a hassle but also very costly. Not all parents can afford it,” said Asmi Jain, a parent from Mira Road whose son appeared for his HSC exams through Jai Hind College in Churchgate.The board is expected to declare a detailed schedule and process for result distribution in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hsc-ssc-students-to-collect-mark-sheets-from-school-college-state-board/story-QzZr1YLybFtRfQngahYtRN.html

23-07-2020||Mumbai||Turned away by 3 civic hospitals despite Covid symptoms, Bhandup woman dies||A 43-year-old Bhandup resident, whose family alleged she was turned away by three hospitals despite showing Covid-19 symptoms such as breathlessness for want of Covid test report, died minutes after she was admitted to Sion hospital, almost 12 hours later, on Monday. While Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation claimed they will seek a detailed report into the incident, the Opposition termed it a case of negligence.Sushma Bhelekar, who has been a deputy shakha pramukh of Shiv Sena, faced breathing issues on July 20, two days after she got fever. Around 10am, the family rushed her to a Covid facility set up by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in Mulund in partnership with private doctors. “The staff from the facility told us that they couldn’t admit her as she had not been tested for Covid. I pleaded them to at least give her some treatment as her condition was worsening. They refused to do it. We have hand-to-mouth existence and I had no money to get her admitted to a private hospital,” said Anil, Bhelekar’s husband, who works in the laundry department of a hotel near the domestic airport and drives an autorickshaw at night to make ends meet. Anil, with his 20-year-old son, rushed her to civic-run SVD Savarkar Municipal Hospital in Mulund, but she was turned away, citing similar reasons. “The staff told us to take her to civic-run Babasaheb Ambedkar Municipal Hospital in Vikhroli. She was not given oxygen support or any kind of treatment at any of the hospitals. The staff at Vikhroli told us she needed ICU facility. They arranged for an ambulance that had no medical staff, but had one oxygen cylinder, so that we could take her to Sion hospital,” alleged Anil.Anil said his wife was scared to get into the ambulance. “My son and I held her hand throughout the ride and kept cheering her up. We were trying to divert her attention, but as we reached Chembur, the oxygen cylinder stopped working. We told the driver to rush her to the hospital,” he said.After reaching Sion hospital, Bhelekar died while she was being shifted from the stretcher to the hospital bed. The hospital staff declared her dead around 10pm on Monday. Anil said, “We are still in shock. We have lost everything.”Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “It is very unfortunate that the patient had to move from one hospital to another. To avoid this, we have advertised calling our control room 1916 or ward war room where the staff guides the callers to testing, admission and treatment. Prima facie, we were informed that the family did not contact our control rooms. We are trying our best to streamline the process for proper guidance and quicker response which is just a call away. I have directed officials to make a detailed report and will set up an inquiry into the matter if needed.”Bhelekar’s family said the body was handed over to them without conducting Covid test. They cremated her at Sion. The patient’s son has developed Covid symptoms and is awaiting test results at a quarantine facility.The protocol states that any symptomatic or suspected Covid patient directly walking in to any BMC hospital shall be treated either at the suspected patient area of the hospital or may be transferred in ambulance to the nearest jumbo Covid facility, depending upon the condition of the patient.BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said, “Why is BMC not issuing notices to the Covid care facility and the other two hospitals that denied admission? Should we let a patient die if he has not tested for Covid, but is showing strong symptoms? The BMC is fully responsible for the death and I demand that they should initiate an inquiry into the matter. Also, the municipal commissioner should publicly apologize for the negligence.”Family didn’t contact helpline: BMCAny symptomatic or suspected Covid patient walking into any BMC hospital shall be treated either at the suspected patient area or may be transferred in ambulance to a Covid jumbo facility.Private hospitals can’t deny admission to walk-in patients who are highly symptomatic either positive or suspected 1916 Helpline in case you show symptomsBMC hospitals carry out Covid tests for free, whereas in pvt hospitals, the charges are capped at ₹2,500-₹2,800Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “It is very unfortunate that the patient had to move from one hospital to another.

23-07-2020||Mumbai||Daily Covid-19 case average in Mumbai dips to 1,200||In the past two weeks, Mumbai has seen an average of 1,200 Covid-19 cases per day, and a total of 16,822 cases, a drop from a fortnight ago, when the average daily cases stood at 1,300, according to figures from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The dip comes amid the liberalisation of testing and more lenient phases of Mission Begin Again, indicating the situation in Mumbai is gradually improving almost four months after the lockdown was imposed on March 23.However, on Wednesday, Mumbai saw 1,310 new Covid-19 cases, and 58 deaths, pushing the case count to 104,678, the toll to 5,875. The number of active cases stood at 23,393. The recovery rate was 71.7%, and fatality 5.6%. Mumbai has so far conducted 450,459 tests, with a positivity percentage of 23. Since Sunday, for three days in a row, Mumbai’s daily cases have been below the two-week average of 1,200. On Tuesday, Mumbai recorded 992 new cases. It was the fifth time in July that the city saw less than 1,000 cases a day. On Monday, the city recorded 1,035 new cases, and on Sunday, 1,037. “This is a sign that the situation is stabilising, it is too early to say if it is declining. As and when more opening up happens, we will be able to get a clear picture. This is seen throughout Mumbai in all wards, and growth rate is consistently falling, from 2.2% to 1.1%. Some wards have a growth rate below 1%. Hospitals now have more vacant beds too. On Wednesday, cases were a little more, but one single day there could be a spike, as it depends on how many people get tested,” said BMC’s deputy executive health officer Dr Daksha Shah. Shah also said, “Even though testing has liberalised, we can say with some certainty that there are not many symptomatic people out there, who feel the need to approach a lab and opt for a test. That is also a good sign.” However, on Saturday, the number of cases in a single day was 1,186. Last Friday, the number was 1,214. The highest number of single day cases reported this week was 1,476, on July 16, followed by 1,347 on July 15. Moreover, July also recorded the lowest number of cases since May, 785 cases on July 7. Mumbai liberalised testing on July 7, allowing any person to approach a laboratory and get a Covid-19 test done, without a doctor’s prescription. BMC expected Covid-19 cases to increase following this, but the trend has not emerged yet. Municipal commissioner IS Chahal told Hindustan Times last week, “I was expecting the cases to increase as testing has increased, Even though testing has gone up by 2,000 to 3,000 per day, our cases have gone down.” Mumbai conducts an average of 5,000 to 7,000 tests per day. According to the latest available figures from Tuesday, the doubling rate in Mumbai was 59 days and average growth rate 1.17%. On July 7, a fortnight ago, the doubling rate was 45 days, and the growth rate 1.54%. Another fortnight ago, on June 24, the doubling rate for the city was 41 days, and the growth rate was 1.72%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/daily-covid-19-case-average-in-mumbai-dips-to-1-200/story-wPjBifj9dgEWnuphIQSuWI.html
23-07-2020||Chandigarh||State-of-the-art ISBT Mohali without power, running on generators||It was once a dream project of the former Shiromani Akali Dal government, but the state-of-the-art Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Inter State Bus Terminus (ISBT Mohali), almost abandoned till the Covid-19 outbreak when buses for migrants and other parts of the states started running from there, has no power connection, with just a few fans and lights powered by generators.Passengers have to sweat it out all the while as they wait for their buses.ISBT was back in business after June 15 when the UT administration decided to suspend interstate operations of the Chandigarh Transport Union and other state operated buses from Chandigarh’s Sector 43, following a spike in Covid-19 cases.The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) snapped power supply to ISBT Mohali in April 2018 after its Rs 15 lakh bill was not cleared.When contacted, Sarabjeet Singh, ISBT manager, said, “I have recently joined the duty. The authorities concerned have to pay the power bill. These days we are using generators because of the warm weather.”All Punjab and Pepsu Roadways buses are now operating from the terminus, which was inaugurated on December 17, 2016, by Sukhbir Singh Badal, the then Punjab deputy chief minister.Only one section of the bus stand was made operational then, and after SAD lost the state elections the ruling Congress termed it a ‘white elephant’ before abandoning it. The company which built and operated the ISBT also went bankrupt and fled.Project that went off-trackThe ambitious Busopolis project was launched in 2009 and was to be completed in December 2011. Spread over seven acres, it was to have an inter-state bus terminal, three multi-storey towers with retail and office spaces, multiplex, five-star hotel, banquet hall, hyper markets, and a helipad atop a tower. But since its inception, the project has been mired in controversies and possession delays.While the bus terminal has become operational, the commercial towers are yet to be completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/state-of-the-art-isbt-mohali-without-power-running-on-generators/story-wb9Tuvz8fqm3psmrkGHjiO.html

23-07-2020||Mumbai||Online classes in Maha up to Class 2 also||Making amendments to their earlier Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for conducting online classes in Maharashtra, the education department on Wednesday allowed schools to conduct online classes for students from pre-primary to Class 2. As per a government resolution released late on Wednesday, pre-primary students can be asked to attend up to 30 minutes of online instruction from Monday to Friday. This has to primarily consist of assisting and guiding parents about the learning of their children. Students of Classes 1 and 2 can be asked to attend two sessions of 30 minutes each. “Of this, 15 minutes should consist of guiding parents and communicating with them, while the remaining 15 minutes could be used to impart activity-based learning to students,” stated the GR. Students of Classes 3 to 8 can attend up to two sessions of 45 minutes each, while Classes 9 to 12 can be asked to sit for four such sessions. On June 15, as the new academic year began for schools in the state, the Maharashtra government approved a set of SOPs proposed by the state education department to ensure uniformity in the conduct of online learning across the state. The SOPs had stated that students up to Class 2 cannot be asked to attend any online instruction. The move was, however, criticised by several preschool chains, educationists and parents who thought that some interaction needed to be there, even for younger students. The GR also stated that the decision to physically reopen schools would rest with the local administration of every place. As per the department’s tentative schedule relea-sed in June, schools can first start Classes 9,10 and 12 in July, followed by Classes 6-8 from August and Classes 3-5 from September. This however, is subject to local permissions and the absence of a single case in the locality for a month. The changes are in accordance with a recent MHRD document on online education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/online-classes-in-maha-up-to-class-2-also/story-MDQaNqfUbKlgKSVY5Kqt1M.html
23-07-2020||Chandigarh||More men testing positive for Covid-19 in tricity than women||More men in the tricity are testing positive for Covid-19 than women, reveals data from various sources. The reason, say experts is men’s travel history and more mobility.In the tricity 57.2% of those affected are men. The gap between males and females was widest in Panchkula at 66.5% male patients followed by Mohali at 59%, while in Chandigarh it’s 52%.Seventeen out of 26 fatalities were males too. In Chandigarh out of 13 Covid-19 fatalities, eight were males and five were females, including a three-day-old infant. Nine out of 12 fatalities in Mohali were males. A number of studies internationally had pointed to such trends, but experts suggested that there could be a difference in local conditions.Comparisons can’t be done now“India has the lowest mortality, which could be likely due to varied reasons. Thus, comparison with international trends can be possible only when parameters of age and death are the same. Such a trend is a mystery as of now,” said Dr Pankaj Malhotra, professor of internal medicine at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).Dr G Dewan, director of health services, Chandigarh, said the pattern was part of the social structure in which men were more mobile. However, there was no hard evidence to suggest which gender was more vulnerable. In Panchkula, according to data shared by Dr Rajiv Narwal, nodal officer, Covid-19, “Till July 17, out of a total of 223 cases, 126 were men and 75 women. The remaining 22 children included 10 males and 12 females.” Up to July 21, out of 327 cases reported in the Panchkula district, 217 were men and 109 are women. The details of one person were not known.More men are travellingAccording to Dr Jasjeet Kaur, CMO, Panchkula district, the “main reason is mobility. More men are travelling, especially after the lockdown was lifted, with many of them coming in from Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, which had a high rate of infection.”“They carried the infection to their families. I am not saying the women don’t go out for work, they do, but the percentage of men is higher.”Larger groups getting infected too included men, for instance the Jamaatis returning from the US who were found infected in Panchkula and Central Reserve Police Force and Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel, Kaur added.Dr Sonu Goel, a community health expert at PGIMER, too, pointing to the mobility factor, said “More the mobility, more chances of contracting the infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/more-men-testing-positive-for-covid-19-in-tricity-than-women/story-CQVg8bXHdu8rvPR4ct5zhI.html

The fate of party which has a history and legacy is uncertain. So I decided to move on,” said Talwandi.On July 8, afaction of dissident Akali leaders elected Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa as the SAD president at a gurdwara in Ludhiana. The SAD, however, termed the move illegal and fraud.Dhindsa’s son and former finance minister in the SAD-BJP government Parminder Singh also joined the new outfit. In February, the core committee of the SAD led by Sukhbir Singh Badal expelled Dhindsas from the party for anti-party activities.“Talwandis are a big name in the Akali politics. They have played a key role in building the party and I am sure Ranjit Singh will make important contribution to make Akali Dal getting back to its legacy and ethos,” said Parminder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ex-sad-chief-talwandi-s-son-to-join-dhindsa-today/story-EpCAP2nW6vKT7lzLrXORYK.html

23-07-2020||Chandigarh||At 65%, Covid infection rate among males double than women in Punjab||The rate of coronavirus infection among the males is nearly double than the women in Punjab, according to the data till July 18 compiled by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).As per the data, of the confirmed Covid cases in the state, 65.1% were men while women accounted for only 34.8%of the infections. Health experts say as men are supposed to venture out in harness, the rate of contracting infection among them is more. As per the state health department media bulletin, 9,792 people in Punjab tested positive for the Covid-19 till July 18.“Men are more mobile as compared to the women in Punjab. It is very likely that they are contracting the virus while venturing out for their routine work. Men should adopt extra precautions as they can spread the virus among their family members,” said Amardeep Singh Cheema, chairman of Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC).69.1% CASES ASYMPTOMATICAs per the ICMR data, 69.1% cases in Punjab were asymptomatic, which has increased the worries of the health department. “High number of asymptomatic people is dangerous as they would roam around freely and may spread the virus,” Cheema said.Only 16% Covid-19 patients in Punjab are symptomatic, while 14.9% patients are asymptomatic, but they have symptoms of other diseases.MOST PATIENTS ARE YOUNGData shows that 23% patients in the state fall in the age group of 21 to 30, while 21% are those between 31 to 40 years of age. People between 41 and 50 years of age account for 16% cases. Patients in the age group of 51-60, 61-70, 71-80 and 81-90 are 14%, 8%, 3% and 1%, respectively.Cheema said, “Most vulnerable section of senior citizens till now has relatively lower infected rate which is the result of the cautions taken by them as advised by the state government. People in the age group of 21 to 40 should take extra precautions.”Also, 5% of the patients are the children below 10 and 9% those between 11 and 20 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/at-65-covid-infection-rate-among-males-double-than-women-in-punjab/story-QFIEjtqnJsqvFU2vXat6gJ.html
23-07-2020||Gurugram||Covid cases surge past 8,000 in city, but cases growing at a slower rate now||Gurugram witnessed at least 149 fresh cases being added to its tally on Wednesday taking the district’s total number of coronavirus infections to 8,127, according to the district health bulletin. Of the total cases, 1,099 are active while 6,910 have recovered. With almost 2,780 cases reported in July alone, Gurugram continues to remain one of the worst-affected districts by Covid-19 in Haryana. In Haryana, 28,186 Covid cases have been confirmed so far, with at least 724 new cases emerging in the last 24 hours. Out of these, 21,697 have recovered while 6,117 are active cases. Gurugram’s share in the overall active cases is almost 18%, which has decreased from 50% as reported in June. Gurugram, however, has shown a decline in the number of positive cases in July when compared to last month. At least 4,573 Covid-19 cases were reported in the district in June. The daily growth rate of cases has also come down from 12.6% (in May) to 2.6% (in June) and to 1.7% (in July). Between June 30 and July 20, Gurugram’s positivity rate – the total number of positive cases compared to the overall testing – declined from 13.05% to around 8.48%. With antigen test being conducted in large numbers as compared to RT- PCR tests — which is the gold standard in detecting Covid cases — there has been overall dip in positive cases reported this month. Experts have cautioned that this could lead to a false sense of security. Even going by findings of a recent serological survey for Covid antibody detection conducted on 454 people, at least 56 were tested positive, which is 12.3% positivity rate. If extrapolated to the 15 lakh population of the city (as per the 2011 census), the 12.3% translates to 1.85 lakh population who may have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. “It is too small a survey in Gurugram to comment on. The plan is to conduct 1,800 more antibody test to study the prevalence of the infection,” said a senior health department official. Professor Rajib Dasgupta from the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said that repeated sero-surveys are required to track the time trends of prevalence as a single point prevalence is of limited relevance in case of Gurugram. “The sero-positivity of Gurugram is about 12%. Assuming that the samples are taken from among the population residing in areas of high incidence or containment zones in the urban/peri-urban areas (as is being generally done), this is not very high. This is less than many other cities (in the earlier round) where it ranged between 15% and 30%, and, about 36% in Dharavi and 40% in Ahmedabad. Since IgG antibodies appear typically three weeks after the infection, this reflects the spread for the corresponding period, presumably, Unlock 1,” said Dasgupta. The findings of the antibody survey can be easily co-related with the district administration’s predictions on the Covid-19 positive cases by July-end. The Covid-19 Health Facilities and Bed Management Report prepared in the first week of June stated that by July, nearly 1.5 lakh people will be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on which the city would require at least 18,000 beds for the Covid-19 patients with critical health condition. The health department data, however, shows that currently only 145 patients from Gurugram are admitted in 40 hospitals of the city. “Presently, only 25% of the total allocated bed capacity has been utilised as most of the patients prefer home isolation. Out of the 1,099 active cases, 895 have been home isolated and 59 are in isolation centres,” said Vivek Kalia, nodal officer for Covid-19 hospital management. Data shows that till June 30, when total number of active cases were 1,289, nearly 64.23% people were in home isolation. This increased to 78.62% by July 20, when the city had 1,048 active cases. “It shows that those detected Covid-19 positive are preferring home isolation and easily getting cured. Through video calls, we are connected with the home isolated patients, who get counselled by mental health expert,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. According to him, the rate at which patients are recovering from the illness has also improved, at 85.12%. “In the last one month, testing has drastically increased in the city. In the Large Outbreak Areas (LORs) with emerging Covid-19 clusters, more than 31,000 antigen tests have been conducted. Our focus is upon timely detection of cases to reduce the fatality rate,” said Yadav. The fatality rate of the city in the last one week has come down to 1.45% from 1.50%. Two people have died in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of the fatalities in the district to 118. The overall fatality count of the state is 372, which is almost 1.32%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-cases-surge-past-8-000-in-city-but-cases-growing-at-a-slower-rate-now/story-iohYBLdCrdMFubh9ZIsn7N.html
23-07-2020||Delhi||A lot of water has flown under this bridge: The Minto mark on Delhi’s history||It’s Wednesday evening, and the traffic on the two carriageways under Minto Bridge is smooth. A couple of men are sleeping under it on the footpaths, undisturbed by the vehicles going past them -- there’s nothing at all to show that this is the place, where, on Sunday, a mini-truck driver drowned in the waterlogged rail underpass. Even earlier in the day, the carriageways were closed for an hour. For almost seven decades, Minto Bridge — a large segmental arch spanning the width of the road — gets flooded during the monsoon, becoming a metaphor for eternal civic apathy. But Minto Bridge is not just Delhi’s flooding yardstick — it has many other stories to tell. AK Jain, an architect and former commissioner (planning) at the Delhi Development Authority, says the Hardinge and Minto bridges were built by the British in 1926 as part of the realignment process of the railway line for New Delhi railway station. The British also had a larger objective in mind. “The memories of the 1857 Mutiny were fresh in their minds and they wanted the new realigned railway line to New Delhi station to serve as an embankment for the defence of New Delhi. The British felt that in case of a threat they could close the Minto Bridge and the Hardinge Bridge underpasses, the only two entry points into New Delhi and virtually seal the city,” said Jain, who has written several books on Delhi.“And they kept the height of Minto Bridge low to ensure an unhindered visual link between the Jama Masjid in the walled city, Central Park in Connaught Place, and Parliament.”Curiously, though Minto Bridge and Hardinge Bridge were renamed Shivaji Bridge and Tilak Bridge respectively, the first refused to shed its colonial name, unlike the latter, whose old name is known only to a few. An untold story of the Minto bridge and the man it is named after. Many believe that it has to do with Minto Bridge’s persistent penchant for remaining in the news — often for wrong reasons. Minto Bridge witnessed violence during the riots at the time of Partition. There are several accounts of how those fleeing the walled city — on foot and in tongas — to refugee camps in Purana Qila and Humanyun’s Tomb were ambushed and killed near Minto Bridge.“One night, a Muslim friend named Badruddin Tyabji showed up at [Jawaharlal] Nehru’s door to alert him to an especially troubled area — Minto Bridge, which Muslims fleeing their Old Delhi neighbourhoods had to cross to reach the safety of refugee camps in New Delhi,” reads an account in Midnight’s Furies: The Deadly Legacy of India’s Partition by Nisid Hajari. The book, published in 2015, chronicles Partition and the riots that followed. “Many people coming from the Walled City were waylaid at Minto Bridge and massacred. We had to close our shops for a few days ,” says Satish Sundra, 84, who runs Ram Chander & Sons in Connaught Place, a couple of hundred metres from Minto Bridge.Ironically, the man the bridge was named after — Gilbert John Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, the Fourth Earl of Minto and Viceroy of India from 1905 to 1910 — too had a controversial legacy.Minto received a delegation of Muslims aristocrats, led by the Aga Khan, at the Viceregal Lodge in Shimla in October 1906, and promised to meet their demand for separate electorates, which was eventually awarded under The Indian Councils Act 1909, commonly known as the Minto-Morley Reforms, enacted by the British Parliament. The act was formulated by John Morley, secretary of state for India between 1905 and 1910. This was seen as an attempt to wean away Muslims from the nationalist movement. Barely three months later, on December 30, 1906, the All-India Muslim League was founded and held its inaugural session in Dhaka.The name of Lord Minto, who ruled India from Kolkata and Shimla, has lived on in New Delhi, thanks to Minto Bridge, which first started hitting the headlines in the early 1950s for water-logging. Back then, it would often be closed for a couple of days for traffic – usually tongas, buses, and phat phatis (three-wheeled vehicles powered by old Harley Davidson motorcycle engines ) — while the water was pumped out.In the late 1960s, Minto Bridge area became Delhi’s cabaret destination with the opening of Blue Star, a restro-bar. Tucked by the side of the bridge, it soon found thousands of patrons. “There used to be three shows between 9pm to 12pm, which were a major hit. In fact, following Blue Star’s massive success, several new “restrobars” offering cabaret came up in areas such as Anand Parbat and Naraina,” said Kuldeep Chauhan, 68, a real estate agent and a restaurateur in Connaught Place. “Its reputation ensured that not many honourable men wanted to be seen anywhere near it in the evenings,” added Singh. “Not that Blue Star had introduced cabarets to Delhi. There were in fact very fine restaurants such as Alps at Janpath that offered cabarets in the 1950s, which were classy and artistic performances, but the same could not be said about the Minto Bridge cabaret destination,” said Sundra.Now abandoned, Blue Star is a derelict building with overgrown plants. There is a burnt hall inside, with a few trousers and shirts hanging from the hooks on the walls. A fire broke out inside the abandoned bar in 2010. “This place is a haven for drug addicts,” Rajesh Kumar, an elderly taxi driver said. He was aware of its colourful past. “It made Minto Bridge a nightlife destination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/a-lot-of-water-has-flown-under-this-bridge-the-minto-mark-on-delhi-s-history/story-28RtrRTUcpWKKXifGdEkBI.html
23-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram gets two new air quality sensors||After a delay of months, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has finally managed to install two low-cost air quality sensors in the city — one at Gurugram University in sector 51 and the other at The Energy Research Institute (TERI) Gram in Gwal Pahari village. These sensors are expected to provide more accurate information about air pollutants up till PM10. Both PM2.5 and PM10 are breathable pollutants that can easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments. Particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is the city’s most prominent pollutant and is 2.5 microns in size or smaller. PM10 is coarse particulate matter of 10-micron size or smaller.The installation of the new sensors had been pending for some time now. In February last year, the GMDA had said that it had plans to install 15 low-cost sensors across the city.In a statement released by the district administration on Wednesday, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said that accurate information provided by the new sensors was necessary for preparing an action plan to check air pollution in the city. “Earlier, the district had ambient air quality monitoring machines that gave information up to PM2.5 level. The new equipment that has been installedwill give us informations up to PM10 level,” said Khatri. He said that the installation of the new machines before the next spate of winter pollution would allow the administration to adopt necessary steps aimed at controlling pollution levels in time.Gurugram currently has four air quality monitors. The city’s air quality index (AQI) value, as reflected in the CPCB’s daily bulletin, continues to be calculated using data from these AQI monitors. One of them is operated by the HSPCB at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11, and another in Gwal Pahari is operated by the National Institute of Solar Energy. The other monitors are located on Gurugram-Faridabad Road and Sector 51.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-gets-two-new-air-quality-sensors/story-UNFfDS9iEgO4iPXqwDTKwK.html
23-07-2020||Gurugram||Three break into house of elderly couple, loot cash, jewellery in Sector 40||Three armed men broke into a Sector 40 house and allegedly robbed an elderly couple of cash and jewellery after tying them up in sector 40 on Tuesday afternoon. Police said the couple was held hostage at gunpoint for over half an hour as the robbers went about ransacking the house. They eventually made away with Rs 35,000 in cash and jewellery worth lakhs. The suspects are yet to be identified and the police are checking CCTVs in the area to identify the suspects. According to the police, the incident took place around 3.15 pm when the house owner, Ved Prakash Tandon, 80, and his wife, Kiran Tandon , 80, were in their house. Police said one of the suspects first arrived alone and rang the doorbell.A police officer privy to the investigations, requesting anonymity, said, “After Ved Prakash opened the door, the suspect enquired from the man if his wife was at home. He was asked to leave. After 20 minutes, the man returned with two others and broke the lock of the main gate and entered the house. They held the couple hostage at gunpoint and tied their hands. Over the next 30 minutes, they ransacked the almirahs of the house and stole Rs 35,000 cash and some jewellery before escaping.”Police said the first suspect, who had enquired about the woman in the house, had been sent to conduct a recce. “The couple do not have a house-help and stay alone. Their son stays in DLF Phase 3. We are checking CCTVs in the area and questioning security guards to identify the suspects,” said the police officer.A case was registered against under sections 392 (punishment for robbery) and 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at sector 40 police station on Tuesday.In a similar incident on July 4, three armed men had allegedly barged into a house in sector 10 and snatched the phone and car keys from a family. The suspects had fired a gunshot to intimidate the victims. In March, four men — including a domestic help — had robbed jewellery and cash worth Rs 2 crore after tying up a senior citizen and a minor in sector 45.SUV robbed in ManesarElsewhere, three men were arrested for allegedly robbing an SUV from a scrap dealer in Manesar on Tuesday night. Police said the incident was reported around 11pm when the victim, Praveen Kumar, who has a scrap warehouse in Manesar, and his two friends, were on their way to Kumar’s house in his SUV.Police said they had reached near village Naharpur on Nawada road when the suspects parked their motorcycle in front of their car. Kumar said, “I asked them why they were blocking our way. They were inebriated and when I objected to them drinking on the road, they hit me with the alcohol bottle on my head. They then started assaulting me and snatched my phone, some cash and car keys. I ran towards a warehouse and told them that their movements were being recorded in a CCTV nearby, following which they panicked and fled with my car.”Police said the victim was admitted to a private hospital for treatment of head injury and discharged on Wednesday. “The suspects were arrested from Manesar and the car recovered,” said a police official privy to the investigation.An FIR was registered against the suspects under sections 379 B (snatching) and 34 (common intention) of IPC at Manesar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-break-into-house-of-elderly-couple-loot-cash-jewellery-in-sector-40/story-6uM7FQYjPRJt3mH5WkWQpL.html
23-07-2020||Gurugram||Moderate rain, heavy flooding in city||Despite the Gurugram civic bodies preparations over the last two months to prevent flooding, moderate rainfall on Wednesday led to the inundation at most stretches in the city. However, traffic was largely unaffected.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), less than 15.5 mm rain would be classified as “light”, while up to 64 mm would be classified as “moderate”. On Wednesday, the city had received around 22 mm rain.The city witnessed spells of rain throughout the day with varying intensity. While the first two -- around 2am and another between 4.30 am to 5.30 am -- were somewhat light, the third between 10.30 am-11.30 am was a downpour that inundated most parts of the city.Such was the extent of waterlogging at some stretches that services of 11 Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL) buses were disrupted.GMCBL said that eight buses plying on bus route 212 had to be diverted via sector 4/7 chowk due to “flooding by rains” at Laxman Vihar in sector 3A, while three buses plying on route 112D had to return to the bus depot in sector 53 as “the buses were unable to ply on waterlogged roads” between Dharam Colony, located in Palam Vihar Extension and Columbia Asia hospital in Palam Vihar.At around 11 am, Gurugram traffic police cautioned commuters over social media to avoid stretches such as Hanuman Chowk, AIT Chowk on Golf Course Road, Narsinghpur on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Rampur flyover exit on NH 48, MDI Chowk, Sheetla Mata Mandir Road, Vatika Chowk on Sohna Road, IMT Chowk on NH 48, Galleria Road, sector 41/45 dividing road, sector 27/42 dividing road, Khandsa on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Sohna Chowk, Bakhtawar Chowk, Basai Road, Kanhai Chowk, South City 2, and IFFCO Chowk on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. Chander Mohan, DCP, traffic, said that around 1,100 personnel were deployed across the city on Wednesday to manage traffic.“At most spots, we were able to manage without much difficulty despite the heavy waterlogging. With the help of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), we kept 24x7 surveillance, via CCTV cameras, on 88 key points. Wherever waterlogging was reported, the area station house officer (SHO) and traffic inspector were immediately informed to deploy their personnel to the affected points,” said Mohan. Mohan said there were no snarls reported, and they did not need to divert or block off any roads in the city.“There were only a few areas in the city where traffic moved at a slow pace such as Narsinghpur, which has some localised drainage issues and thus rainwater takes time to recede. Our personnel ensured traffic kept on moving. In addition, we had also deployed 15 cranes to tow vehicles if an emergency arises, and these were used in two instances where vehicles were removed immediately,” said Mohan.Parts of Old Gurugram also witnessed a light drizzle around 4.30 pm -5 pm.The municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said that the spells of rain affected their efforts to ensure no flooding.“By the time we started clearing patches of roads from rainwater following early morning showers, it started raining heavily around 10.30 am. This resulted in the flooding today. To fix this, we deployed all our 22 motor pumps across different parts of the city to drain out rainwater. In newer parts of the city, rainwater was cleared off most roads by around 4 pm, however, due to some parts of Old Gurugram experience rain around 4.30 pm, it took us slightly longer,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.As per the IMD forecast, the city is likely to receive such spells of rain till at least July 28.In May, HT had reported that due to civic bodies allocating most of their resources and attention towards fighting Covid-19, tenders for cleaning drains in most areas of the city were floated in the last week of May and early June, thus it was likely that the city will witness heavy waterlogging this monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/moderate-rain-heavy-flooding-in-city/story-SeOJyhn52OB25po2R7DbAP.html
23-07-2020||Gurugram||Industrial production still far away from normal, situation likely to improve from next month||Acute labour shortage forced by the Covid-19-induced lockdown has hit the industrial complexes in Gurugram and Manesar, with many running only at half capacity. They now hope that by second week of August, many of those who had left for their home towns and villages after finding it difficult to continue living here, would return to the cities.With the central government relaxing many of the restrictions from June 8 after 68 days in lockdown, industries in the areas say they have been in contact with their workers who had left. Some of them have offered to pay an advance, others have offered to pay their air fare, while still others have sent buses to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to facilitate their return. They were also hoping that measures announced by government, like paying the return train fare, would also boost their return. Manish Singh, general manager, Galaxy exports, a firm having units in Manesar and Gurugram said they were working with only 25 per cent labour. “We had sent a bus to Bihar to get labour, but only five to six people returned as they were apprehensive of another lockdown in Delhi-NCR,” he said. “Due to paucity of skilled labour we are not taking up new orders from abroad. But, we expected things to improve from next month as a lockdown will end in Bihar on July 31 and after Eid.” Gurugram based factory owners said that demand in the market was rising and supply chain was also improving. “For large industries in auto and other sectors, the situation is not so bad as permanent labour is still there but problem is being faced by small and medium enterprises and vendors, who have mostly contract labourers to do the job,” said Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar. As per the emloyees state insurance (ESI) department office in Gurugram, the industrial hubs engage around 1.2 to 1.3 millions workers in around 5000 industrial units. The hubs contribute roughly 45 to 50 per cent of Haryana’s gross domestic product (GDP), as per the local industry associations. The Haryana government’s announcement to reserve 75% of jobs in the state to its residents, has not gone down well with the industry.Manmohan Gaind, vice president of the Manesar Industries Welfare Association and of managing director, MM Creations, an export oriented unit, said: “Demand has improved and orders are coming and the need of the hour is flexible policy to woo workers back.” He added that he would be sending a bus to Bihar to get back his workers next month as he had one earlier to make things work. Satyendra Singh, general manager, east west exports, said most workers came from districts in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. “Workers are wary of returning due to the quarantine policy and lack of adequate transport facilities. We have sent train tickets for 100 workers from these districts and they will be boarding on July 28. Things on the labour front are going to improve from next month,” he said.A senior official of an auto unit said that there is huge demand from two wheelers across the country particularly in rural areas and once the labourers are here, this would boost the entire sector as a whole. “The demand is rising gradually and now we have started facing problems due to shortage of labourers as specialized workers are not available or they have shifted jobs,” said KohliThe switch of workers from smaller units to large units, which pay comparatively better has also caused trouble for the former but things are likely to improve in the coming months, the industry experts aver and are hopeful that negative things have bottomed out in the short run.“There’s a shortfall of labour right now. So it’s being taken care of through a demand-supply dynamic. There are some startups that are registering labours and matching their competencies against the requirements of the industry. We can help in easing out their issues with respect to permissions, if needed, even if takes to reaching out to district authorities in other states. In case some labour comes back to find there is no work at their previous employer, we can help them with the search,” said Munish Sharma, additional labour commissioner, national capital region, Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/industrial-production-still-far-away-from-normal-situation-likely-to-improve-from-next-month/story-S6cLnbjd0RMs1zxuuf4hhO.html
23-07-2020||Gurugram||Teenage police wing to address issues faced by Faridabad teenagers||Faridabad Police has set up a teenage police Wing to help students report abuse, harassment, stress related issues, bullying along with other issues, which they cannot discuss with their family members and friends.Police officers said that the teenage police wing, which commenced operations on Wednesday, is headed by an assistant commissioner of police ranked officer and comprises 11 officials of the district, apart from four councillors. The special police wing will pay special focus to teenagers between the age of 13 and 19 and help them deal with various issues and the menace of cyber bullying.Police said they will soon launch a helpline number for the special wing, which will be widely advertised in schools and colleges and on social media platforms.“Teenagers sometimes do not reach out to their friends and family members to discuss their trauma and end up slipping into depression. We decided to launch this wing to help such distressed teenagers and to help their parents overcome such situations,” said OP Singh, who took over as the commissioner of Faridabad police on July 1.Police said they receive many complaints related to cyber crime — cases of teenagers sending or receive obscene messages or videos from fake accounts that threaten them of dire consequences if reported. “The wing will also help students understand the right use of social media and how to create a balance between studies and usage of social media so that they are not addicted to it,” said Singh. “The special wing will also run a helpline with the help of NGOs active in this field for the parents and teenage victims of bullying, harassment, and allurement to addiction,” he said. Singh added that the initiative will also spread awareness among teenagers to reach out to their close ones and to express what has been bothering or troubling them instead of harming themselves. The wing will work in close coordination with school authorities, parents associations, and NGOs active in the area dealing with teenage problems.“We will create an interactive platform of school head boys and head girls and sports team captains. They will host listening sessions through web-conferences and face-to-face interactions to understand the problems the victims and their peers are facing, seek their suggestions in how best to deal with them and based on that it will formulate an appropriate and effective response to identified problems,” said Singh. Police said the helpline number will be operational round-the-lock once launched.The special wing will also keep a close watch on social media platforms — like Instagram and Snapchat —that are popular among teenagers to educate them about possible victimisation and encourage them to take steps to avoid falling in a trap. Police said the wing will also utilise the platform of Parents-Teacher meetings to sensitise parents and teachers about the steps they need to take to save their children from potential harm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/teenage-police-wing-to-address-issues-faced-by-faridabad-teenagers/story-mOnSTob6KUQehQhO98dfrJ.html

Police said the man sustained two gunshot wounds on his left leg and was rushed to a hospital for treatment, where his condition is said to be stable.According to the police, the incident took place around 9pm on Tuesday, when the victim, Shamshad Khan — who has a godown on Kherki Majra road in Dhanwapur — was about to head back to his home. Police said two suspects arrived in a car and took Khan hostage at gun-point.A police official privy to the investigation said, “The suspects drove him around Dhanwapur area for half an hour before taking him near the railway crossing, where they asked him to handover all his cash. When he resisted, they shot him in his left knee. The men then snatched Rs 35,000 cash from Khan’s pocket. They then took him to sector 105 near Dwarka expressway, where they again assaulted him and hit him with a stone,” said the police o0fficial, adding that Khan was beaten with the butt of a gun.Police said the suspects asked him for more cash and then shot him for a second time on his left foot. Around 11pm, they finally abandoned him on the expressway in sector 105 and fled. The victim made a phone call to his son, who reached the spot and rushed him to civil hospital, from where he was referred to a private hospital for treatment.According to the police, the suspects wanted to rob the victim and did not personally know him. “Probe has not revealed any past enmity. The suspects are yet to be identified,” said the police official.A case was registered against the suspects under sections 365 (kidnapping), 307 (attempt to murder) and other relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and The Arms Act at Rajendra Park police station on Tuesday night, said police.In another incident, a group of armed men shot at a 25-year-old man in Jharsa village in sector 39 on Tuesday around 6pm. Police said the victim, Preetpal alias Chunbun, was taking a stroll on his terrace when a motorcycle and a car drove by his house. Police said the occupants of the car and the motorcycle riders fired at least two times at the victim but missed. Preetpal, sensing danger, took cover behind a table on the terrace.Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “Preliminary probe suggests that the victim is associated with criminal activities. We are yet to establish his criminal records and are checking if there are any FIRs registered against him. It appears he was attacked by some rivals over past enmity. The suspects are yet to be identified.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/scrap-dealer-kidnapped-shot-twice-robbed-of-cash-cops-hunt-for-suspects/story-MtnhuhNo8VQb92p0m1fd1N.html
23-07-2020||Gurugram||Badshahpur MLA, HMRTC discuss extension of Metro rail||The extension of Metro rail in the city, which has remained on paper for the last 10 years, was discussed at a meeting between Badshahpur MLA and senior officials of Haryana Mass Rapid Transport Corporation Limited (HMRTC) in Panchkula on Wednesday. The independent MLA, Rakesh Daultabad, said that the proposed route of the Metro was discussed at the meeting and he was also planning to take up the matter of the appointment of an internal consultant with Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar later this week so that the project work for the proposed route such as acquisition of land, removal of encroachments and shifting of utilities can be carried out. A detailed project report for the route extension of Delhi Metro from Huda City Centre to Subash Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, sector 9-10, Sector 5, Palam Vihar, Udyog Vihar and Cyber Hub was approved by state government in December last year but a nod from the Centre is still awaited. “I have discussed the proposed route as well as two other proposals which include the route from Rezangla Chowk to Dwarka sector 21, and another from Gurugram railway station to Rajiv Chowk and Vatika Chowk with planning advisor, HMRTC. The issue of appointing the internal consultants was also discussed apart from other issues,” he said. Daultabad further said that next week, the consultants for the metro project would give another presentation for the extension of route from Palam Vihar to Dwarka. “One presentation in this regard had already been given to the chief minister and next week the same would be presented before top government officials, “ he said. The chief contention in pursuing this project, he said, was that the development of metro involves multiple stakeholders like union urban development ministry and others as well and it was important that the projects are pursued aggressively. “We will take up this project with central government at all levels so that metro can be extended in the city,” he said. Delhi metro route has not been extended in the city since it became operational in 2009. Although Haryana government and a private real estate developer did build the Rapid metro project along the Golf Course road but the project failed to take off and this network was also taken over by the Delhi metro last year. The Gurugram metro extension will be carried out by HMRTC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/badshahpur-mla-hmrtc-discuss-extension-of-metro-rail/story-YRYiCDLB7YeuL9Pc9Lt18I.html

23-07-2020||City||ST buses cancelled: Nalasopara commuters protest on railway tracks||At least 200 commuters staged a protest on the Nalasopara railway tracks on Wednesday morning, after the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) temporarily stopped the operation of buses from the depot. Local train services on the Western Railway (WR) line were hit for at least 20 minutes.MSRTC said the buses were stopped on instructions from the police, after noticing a sudden rise in the number of commuters. The passengers wanted to travel in the buses, despite not being from essential services. Social distancing rules, too, were being flouted, according to MSRTC officials.Demanding permission to travel by local trains, the passengers headed to platform no. 1 of the Nalasopara railway station and blocked the railway tracks at 8.25am. A Virar-bound local train had to halt at the station for a few minutes. Local train services resumed at 8.45am.“MSRTC operates 100 to 150- odd buses to Mumbai and Thane from the Nalasopara bus depot. However, on Wednesday, no bus services were available. Agitated passengers later came to the railway station, asking the railway authorities to permit them to travel by local trains,” said an eyewitness, on condition of anonymity.“The Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Government Railway Police (GRP) counselled the protesters, and the situation normalised by 8.45am,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer, WR.RPF has registered a case against unknown persons under section 147 (entering any part of a railway without lawful authority), 145 (interfering with any amenity provided by the railway administration), and 174 (tampering, disconnecting hose pipe, signal gear) of the Railway Act, 1989.

23-07-2020||City||Family says man held for grandfather’s murder was framed, complains to CM||The relatives of a 30-year-old man, who was arrested for allegedly killing his grandfather, have filed a complaint with the Uttar Pradesh chief minister alleging that he was framed while the real culprits were let off by the Noida police.According to the family, the incident took place on June 2 when Chandra Singh left his house in village Khedi with a relative to visit a doctor. He was dropped off near Kasna around 3pm but did not come back home, after which the family tried to call him.“His phone was switched off and despite multiple attempts, he could not be reached. My father finally filed a missing person’s complaint with the Surajpur police on June 4. Using his call detail records, the police detained a woman and her relatives as it seemed he was being blackmailed by them. Nearly Rs 11 lakh was withdrawn from his account last year, up to March 2020,” alleged Chakresh Kumar, Chandra’s other grandson, in his complaint on the CM’s grievance portal.The victim’s body was identified on June 10 through a missing person’s database at the Ecotech 1 police station. It had been found on June 4 and following an autopsy and procedure, it was sent for last rites on June 8.“After that, the police started harassing us. My brother, Manvendra, was called to the police station twice, on June 12 and 16. He was beaten and was even told that he should confess to the murder and then he would be released within two months. Meanwhile, the other suspects were cleared of all charges,” alleged Chakresh.Manvendra was called for questioning again on July 7 and July 13, and was arrested on July 14, he said.“We even have CCTV footage of him (Manvendra) with his friends around 5pm on the day my grandfather went missing. But the police have framed him without any evidence. We want the case to be re-investigated and the responsible people be nabbed,” said the complainant.Meanwhile, the police have denied all allegations.“There is enough evidence against the suspect. There is no motive or technical evidence against the suspected family. Manvendra had assaulted the deceased earlier as well. The family waited two days to report him missing and now they are trying to protect him,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.Police said the suspect was after the victim’s money he had recently come into after selling a property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/family-says-man-held-for-grandfather-s-murder-was-framed-complains-to-cm/story-qoxfeGVlZmDdZLC41z32yJ.html
23-07-2020||Noida||GIMS conducts 78 successful plasma therapies||One of the first hospital in the state to administer plasma therapy to severely ill Covid-19 patients, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida on Wednesday said that it has successfully treated 78 patients.GIMS administered the experimental treatment first on May 9, 2020, and so far 54 recovered patients have donated plasma. Eight patients died despite being administered the therapy.The hospital did not disclose how many patients were still undergoing the procedure.“This is the largest number of case series of collecting plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients and patients receiving it in Uttar Pradesh,” said Brig (Dr) Rakesh Gupta, Director, GIMS.Convalescent plasma therapy, in which antibody-rich plasma from recovered patients is injected into recovering individuals to help them stave off infection, has previously been used during the Sars and Mers outbreaks (which were also caused by viruses in the same family as the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19).Plasma is a major component of a person’s blood, making up almost 55% of it. A plasmapheresis machine separates it from the blood and returns the rest -- the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets -- back into to the donor who typically supplies 300-500 ml of plasma, and the transfusion process takes between 60-90 minutes. Although promising, the effectiveness of the treatment is still in the experimental stage and is allowed to be administered only in severely ill patients.“From early May to 21 July, 62 patients aged 19 to 53 years-old volunteered for screening and plasmapheresis, of which procedure was deferred in 12 donors for various reasons, ranging from anaemia, to lack of prominent vein suitable for undertaking procedure and uncontrolled hypertension. Two donors had undergone the procedure twice,” said Dr. Shalini Bahadur, associate professor of pathology and blood bank in-charge, GIMS. The eight patients who died had comorbidities (which complicated their illness).”According to the doctors while they try to maintain at least four bags of Plasma for each blood group – each containing 200ml while a patient of moderate Covid-19 symptoms is administered two bags, the current requirement is more.“We are receiving promising results so far. However, there is need to formulate policies to retain, promote and motivate recovered symptomatic Covid-19 patients to come and donate their plasma to assist in recovery of the severely ill patients in need of this therapy. We keep calling up the recovered patients and also keep motivating them to donate, we need more volunteers,” said Brig RK Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gims-conducts-78-successful-plasma-therapies/story-u6JNB0CJPhtZMxW1BtskyN.html
23-07-2020||City||Home isolation: Ghaziabad forms rapid response teams to assess patients||The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday directed for the formation of rapid response teams in districts to assess the status of asymptomatic Covid-19-positive patients who opt for home isolation. The state, in an order on July 20, had allowed home isolation for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients and on July 21, rolled out a new discharge policy for different categories of Covid patients.“We have asked districts to form rapid response teams which will consist of doctors who will visit the homes of patients to assess their health status and permit home isolation. The team will also get an undertaking signed from the patient and a copy of directions to be followed will be given to them. The patients must keep themselves in complete isolation from other family members,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health).The state government has also rolled out a new number – 1800 1805 146 – meant especially for patients opting for home isolation. Officials said that such patients can call up and seek advice from doctors over the phone on this number.In compliance with the government’s directions, Ghaziabad officials have formed nine teams, consisting of doctors and pharmacists/staff nurses.“The role of this team is to visit the homes of patients and assess their health status. The teams will also meet the patient’s family members and will also take up contact tracing. Besides, they will also put up stickers at the homes of the patients in case the patient is allowed home isolation. In case there are family members in the house who have co-morbid conditions, home isolation will not be allowed as the patient may pass on the infection which could affect others severely,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.The administration has also roped in six static teams who will be stationed at the district control room and will be in touch with patients under home isolation.“The teams will be in touch with the patients over the phone three times in a day and will seek details of patients’ oxygen level, temperature, etc. If the teams observe any complication, the patient will be shifted to a Covid facility. Meanwhile, our surveillance teams will visit the patient’s house upon getting information, and will take up testing of the patient’s family members through rapid antigen kits. We have also decided that home isolation will be allowed only for new patients while those already admitted to Covid facilities will be discharged after they complete their duration of stay,” Pandey added.Till now, anyone, with or without symptoms, who has tested positive for the coronavirus disease was not allowed to stay in home isolation and needed to get admitted to government’s L1 (for asymptomatic cases), L2 (for cases with mild symptoms) or L3 (for critical cases) category hospitals, paid private Covid hospitals or paid isolation facilities in hotels.The new directions now allow asymptomatic patients to remain in home isolation with certain conditions – an undertaking promising compliance with all norms needs to be submitted by the patient; a consulting doctor to declare the patient asymptomatic; patient to ensure round-the-clock availability of a caregiver; minimum two toilets at home and separate isolation room at home. Patients will also have to purchase medical kits equipped with pulse oximeter, thermometer, mask, gloves, among others.In their revised guidelines issued on Tuesday night, the UP government said that asymptomatic patients in home isolation will be considered as recovered if they do not show any symptoms for 10 days.“Such patients will be shown as recovered on the UP portal and will further have to remain in home isolation for eight more days. In case they show any symptoms, they will be referred to the appropriate Covid facility,” the government order said.The district magistrate added that he has also directed officials to insert one more clause to the ‘action plan’ being formulated for patients in home isolation.“The concept is called ‘friendly watcher’. Under this, we will assign people in two neighbouring houses and one house in front of the patient’s house to keep track of movement of the patient as well in case their condition deteriorates. The owners/residents of the three houses will also be given our control room number where they can provide us information,” Pandey added.The officer said that the action plan will be rolled out on Thursday.The officials of the Ghaziabad health department said that multi-layered teams have been assigned the task of monitoring home isolation patients as there is risk involved.“We will be strictly monitoring the patient but it is also vital that a patient and his family provides us with genuine information and not hide details which could be vital for health,” said an officer from the health department, who asked not to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/home-isolation-ghaziabad-forms-rapid-response-teams-to-assess-patients/story-WISv9HRPlvXsWP4c5RsgwN.html

23-07-2020||Delhi||Downpour brings Delhi to its knees again||Just around three hours of rain on Wednesday morning threw the city into disarray, with prolonged snarls throughout the day made worse by at least five cave-ins and waterlogging on major arterial roads, leading to traffic being diverted, forming bottlenecks across the national capital. The downpour left several residential areas flooded, with the city’s agencies getting into yet another blame game, days after Delhi witnessed waterlogging after the first heavy rain spell on Sunday.The Capital in the last four days alone has recorded 120mm of rain. IMD data shows that between July 1 and July 20, Delhi received 124.9mm rainfall. Till July 19, Delhi had a rainfall deficit of 47%, which went down to 29% till Tuesday.In the heart of the Capital, a section of Ashoka Road caved-in, causing a 10-feet fissure, forcing Delhi traffic police to cordon the stretch off and divert traffic. Vehicles had to be stopped on the stretch between the Windsor Place and Jaswant Singh roundabouts. A New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) official said, “The area around it has been cordoned off, and an NDMC engineering team is working on site to repair the sewer line and road.”Portions of roads also caved-in on the Mahipalpur bypass and the link road near Nawada metro station on Wednesday because of waterlogging. Traffic between Vasant Kunj and Mahipalpur was severely affected because of the cave-in on Mahipalpur bypass. The bypass is also an important connect for those travelling between Delhi and Gurugram.According to the police, the snarls also took place due to diversions put in place after a portion of Bhairon Marg caved-in on Tuesday morning. Even before the rain started on Tuesday, during the morning peak traffic rush, vehicles were directed to take alternative routes, causing jams to cascade to Noida Link Road, Sarai Kale Khan, IP Estate, Vikas Marg, ITO, Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway, Ashram, Mathura Road and Nizamuddin Railway Bridge. The rain made snarls worse during the day, traffic officials said.“The cave-in on Bhairon Marg became a real problem as the stretch is already a traffic jam-prone zone because of ongoing construction. Road maintenance agencies have started pumping water out, but the portion won’t hold till the rain continues and the soil underneath dries,” a senior traffic official said.Complaints of miles-long delays were also reported from Chirag Delhi (towards Nehru Place), Mayur Vihar Link Road, Mathura Road (near Nizamuddin railway bridge), Lajpat Nagar (Ring Road), under Uttam Nagar Metro station, Munirka (under the flyover), and outside the Karkardooma court complex.Sunaina Parimal Das, a commuter on the Noida Link Road, said it took her over an hour to reach Patparganj from Connaught Place on Wednesday evening. “I have not been able to travel at a speeds beyond 20kmph. From ITO, throughout Vikas Marg and then on the Noida Link Road, vehicles were moving at snail’s pace,” she said.Similar chaos was also reported from Girdhari Lal Marg, Guru Ravidass Marg, under Mayapuri flyover, under Prahladpur flyover, Dhaula Kuan (towards Gurugram), Naraina (towards Loha Mandi), Ring Road (from Sarojini Nagar to Hyatt Hotel flyover), and Mahipalpur.The scenes of traffic jams and waterlogging in different parts of the city led to citizens posting pictures of vehicles caught in serpentine jams on the roads. According to PWD and the civic bodies at least 63 places in the city reported waterlogging.Just two days after severe waterlogging under central Delhi’s Minto Bridge, as a precautionary measure, Delhi’s traffic police diverted vehicles from the route for nearly an hour as water started accumulating on the road again on Wednesday after the shower. A 56-year-old man had drowned in the underpass on Sunday morningHowever, while this saved vehicles from getting stuck on the Minto Road, Connaught Place was flooded with rain water, and saw vehicles crawling on the outer circle, Barakhamba Road and Mandi House roundabout.While commuters had to brave the severe congestion, residential areas were not spared the effects of the rain, with areas such as South Extension-1, Lajpat Nagar, parts of Defence Colony, BK Dutt Colony reporting waterlogging. In Defence Colony, for instance, water flowed back on to the streets from drains. Satyendar Jain, Delhi PWD minister, said waterlogging incidents are being tackled effectively. “Our priority is to clear roads of waterlogging immediately and for this we have deployed 1,400 pumps all over the city. In case of high-intensity rain, there may be waterlogging on streets at certain places but I assure that it would be cleared immediately,” Jain said.Anamika Mithilesh, mayor, SDMC, said water was pumped out immediately after rain stopped. “We have cleaned the drains, but people have started throwing garbage in the open in several places, which also causes problems,” she said.Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said,“We have desilted our drains, but since PWD’s bigger drains are yet to be cleaned, water back flows in smaller drains and inundates residential areas and markets,” he said.SS Singh, an urban planner and a researcher at IIT-Delhi, said lack of a proper pre-monsoon plan is the reason behind the repeat of this picture every year.“This just shows how inept our agencies are in handling the basics of city planning. This year they might have an excuse that they were busy handling Covid-19 management, but we see roads flooded every year, what is their excuse for that?” Singh said.Delhi traffic police in a statement said, “Additional staff was deployed to help direct traffic across the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-hours-of-rain-100-chaos-delhi-s-monsoon-story/story-0R7llFl166mURW2RgmIRpO.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government to purchase 500 ambulances for rural areas||To augment healthcare services in the state, especially in rural areas, the Maharashtra government has decided to purchase 500 ambulances and has released around ₹90 crore for the procurement of the same. An order to this effect was released by the state health department on July 17.Officials said this will help the state fight the Covid-19 outbreak.Deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar had, while presenting budget for 2020-21, made the announcement about buying the ambulances to replace the old ones over the next two years. However, in view of the outbreak and the difficulties faced by the people in rural areas, the government has now decided to procure 500 ambulances in this year only. As most of the ambulances in these areas are old and cannot be repaired, it has become hard for the state to provide health facilities to the people, said an official from the health department.The department needs a total of 731 ambulances. Of the 500 ambulances that are going to be procured, 253 will be for primary health centres functioning at zilla parishad level, 137 for rural hospitals, 106 for district, sub-district and women hospitals, and four ambulances are going to be handed over to regional mental hospitals, states the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-to-purchase-500-ambulances-for-rural-areas/story-ugZxcNUwDQItZ61A5CJRtK.html
23-07-2020||Chandigarh||Interim relief to ex-DSP in Kotkapura firing case||A day after a Faridkot court issued arrest warrant against then Kotkapura deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Baljit Singh, Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday stayed his arrest till further orders in an FIR registered in connection with the 2015 Kotkapura firing incident.While issuing notice to the Punjab government, the court of justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa said that he be not arrested till next date of hearing on July 27.

He had cited challan report submitted in the 2018 FIR to buttress his claims and further submitted that all through he had been associating with the special investigation team (SIT) and would continue to do so in the future.The SIT probing 2015 police firing incidents had summoned Baljit to join investigation on a couple of occasions but he had failed to appear. Fearing arrest, he had moved an anticipatory bail plea in the court of District and Sessions court at Faridkot last week but it was dismissed. On Monday, the district court had allowed an application for his arrest filed by SIT.

23-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi court hands sex racket operator Sonu Punjaban 24-year prison sentence||A Delhi court on Wednesday sentenced alleged sex racket operator Geeta Arora alias Sonu Punjaban, 35, to 24 years in prison on charges of kidnapping, immoral trafficking, prostitution among other offences for abducting a minor and forcing her into prostitution for four years in 2009. Stating that Punjaban had ‘crossed all limits to be called a woman’, the court said a person who had committed such acts had no right to live in a civilised society and that the best place for her were the four walls of jail. According to police, Punjaban gained notoriety for exploiting women and forcing them into flesh trade. Punjaban, whose real name is Geeta Arora according to police records, ran one of the biggest prostitution rackets in Delhi and nearby states in early 2000. Additional sessions judge Pritam Singh also sentenced Punjaban’s accomplice, Sandeep Bedwal, 41, to 20 years in prison for the abduction and rape of the 12-year-old girl. Apart from the present case, Punjaban has five other cases involving murder, the immoral trafficking act and the POCSO act against her. This is her first conviction in the multiple crimes. Punjaban was arrested in December 2017 from a hideout in Delhi and presently lodged in Mandoli jail in judicial custody.The court directed the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to pay a compensation of Rs 7 lakh to the girl. “In India thousands of children are kidnapped every year. Very few of them are recovered. Minor girls are kidnapped on the pretext of marriage to be sold in flesh industry where they are sexually exploited on a daily basis. (This) is also one of those cases where a minor innocent girl was trapped in the name of love and kidnapped in a pre-planned manner to force her into flesh trade,” the judge said in his order. The court sentenced Punjaban to two jail terms of 14 years for offences under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act and 10 years for other offences under the Indian Penal Code, including selling and buying of a minor girl for prostitution and criminal conspiracy, while stating that she would stay in jail for 24 years. Bedwal was sentenced to 10 years for kidnapping, kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, procuration of minor girl, selling a minor girl for prostitution, criminal conspiracy of IPC and another 10 years for offences under section 376 (rape) of IPC. The court also imposed fines of Rs 64,000 and Rs 65,000 on Punjaban and Bedwal, respectively. On July 16, the court had convicted Punjaban and Bedwal for kidnapping the minor girl on the pretext of marriage and her rape. Police had said the girl was sold several times to different people for prostitution. In 2014, she managed to escape from the house of a man who bought and married her. She went to a police station and on her statement, an FIR was registered. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bhisham Singh, who has been part of the probe team ever since the case was transferred to the crime branch in 2017, said the court’s judgment vindicated the saying that “justice can be delayed but not denied”. “I am happy because we as a police team could help the victim get her due justice. She was less than 13 years when she was kidnapped,” said DCP Singh. Retired Delhi Police officer, Ashok Chand, who was an additional commissioner of crime branch, said, “I had been part of teams investigating cases related to Sonu Punjaban and her associates. Now that she has been sentenced to 24 years in one of the cases, many of her victims may feel they have got justice.” Punjaban’s first husband Vijay Singh, a gangster, was killed in a police encounter in 2004. Her second husband, Hemant Singh, was also killed in 2006 by a police team in Gurgaon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-court-hands-sex-racket-operator-sonu-punjaban-24-year-prison-sentence/story-mCVSOwL7pIyUQDgOizkNlK.html
23-07-2020||Noida||Shot in front of daughters, Ghaziabad journalist dies||A 35-year-old Ghaziabad-based journalist who was shot in the head in an attack in front of his two daughters on Monday night succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday, prompting opposition parties to criticise the Uttar Pradesh government on the law and order situation in the state. Vikram Joshi, who made a complaint with the police alleging harassment of his niece on July 16, was attacked around 10.30pm on Monday when he was returning home on a two-wheeler along with his two daughters, the police said about the crime, which was caught on CCTV. He worked as a journalist with a local Hindi daily, Jan Sagar Today.According to an investigator, a group of nine men attacked Joshi about 500 metres from his sister’s house in Mata Colony while he was returning on a motorcycle along with his two minor daughters. The group of men first assaulted him and one of them, Chotu alias Shahnoor, later opened fire at him with a countrymade gun, the police said. They said Joshi visited his sister’s house to attend the birthday celebrations of one of his nieces.Senior superintendent of police Kalanidhi Naithani said Joshi filed a police complaint on July 16 that one of the suspects in the attack, Ravi, and his accomplices were harassing his niece. He said nine men were arrested on Tuesday and Pratap Vihar police post in-charge Raghvendra Singh was suspended for dereliction of duty as he did not pay heed to the harassment complaint lodged by Joshi.Days before the attack, Joshi was also engaged in a scuffle with Ravi, Akash and Shahnoor after he raised objections to illegal betting by them, Naithani said. The accused are bookies and were operating in the area, the SSP said. “Ravi received injuries in the incident and from that day, he was planning to take revenge from Joshi,” he said.“The investigation is on in the case and six of our teams have arrested nine suspects, including Chotu alias Shahnoor. More arrests are likely,” Naithani added.“As for the family’s allegations of harassment of a niece of Joshi by the suspects, we have registered an FIR in this matter on July 21 against several men, including prime suspect Ravi Kumar, who was named by the family,” the SSP said.The police identified the nine arrested suspects as Ravi Kumar, Shahnoor alias Chotu (goes by a single name), Mohit Kumar, Dalvir Singh, Akash Nath, Yogendra Singh, Abhishek Kant, Abhishek Mota and Mohammad Shakir, adding that they were working to nab a suspect Akash Bihari, who is on the run.During the attack on Monday, CCTV footage showed, one of his daughters ran back to her aunt’s house, while the other tried to help a bleeding Joshi. Shortly after being shot, Joshi was admitted to a private hospital, where he died during treatment early on Wednesday. He is survived by his wife, three children and mother.Doctors at Nehru Nagar’s Yashoda Hospital, where Joshi was admitted, said he was in a critical condition when he was brought in. “He was admitted to the ICU and put on ventilator support ever since he was brought in. There was hemorrhaging and blood loss due to critical gunshot wound. He also suffered a cardiac arrest and died at 4.01am on Wednesday,” Dr Sangeeta Garg, chief medical superintendent of Yashoda Hospital, said.Condemning the incident, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticised the Yogi Adityanath-led UP government over the law and order in the state. “Journalist Vikram Joshi was killed for opposing the molestation of his niece. My condolences to the bereaved family. The promise was of giving ‘Ram Raj’, but gave ‘Gundaraj’,” he said in a tweet. The Samajwadi Party announced a financial help of Rs 2 lakh to Joshi’s family and demanded that the state government provide Rs 25 lakh to the next of kin and bear all education expense of his children.Bahujan Samaj Party chief Maywati tweeted: “The way heinous crimes like murder and those against women are continuing unabated, it is clear that instead of law and order, jungle raj is prevailing in UP. Crime virus of criminals is more active than coronavirus in UP. People are fed up and the government must address this issue.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal demanded “strictest punishment” for the accused.According to the police, after the fight on July 16, the two parties lodged separate complaints at the local police post. Joshi alleged that the men harassed his niece. However, the police post incharge made the two parties reach a compromise.“It is because of the harassment that we had a fight with these men on July 16. But police did not lodge our complaint even then. My sister went to the SSP’s office and gave a complaint but nothing happened. They were planning an attack on us a day before Joshi got shot. Chotu and the others had come to Ravi’s house with firearms. When my sister saw this, she called me up and I, along with Vikram and other family members, confronted them,” Joshi’s sister Payal, who goes by single name, said.“Chotu and the others threatened us but Vikram sorted out the matter. On the night of July 20, he was going back home when the group shot him,” she said.The family also raised concerns over their safety and said the men may come out on bail and attack them. “We have provided them police cover,” Naithani said.The district administration said in a statement: “The UP government has announced a financial aid of ₹10 lakh to Joshi’s family. Free education will be arranged for his children and the family was also assured of a job to his wife as per her qualification.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/journalist-joshi-dies-police-lodge-fir-over-niece-s-harassment/story-WImTxOu23oO8V1EVvFtpFP.html
23-07-2020||Delhi||Heavy showers in Delhi reduce rain deficit||Delhi recorded “heavy” category rain in many parts of the city on Wednesday morning, with weather officials saying most stations covered the rain deficiency on Wednesday, which will be reflected in their records on Thursday. Delhi’s rain deficiency since June 1 was 43% on Tuesday, which reduced to 29% on Wednesday. Safdarjung recorded 67.3 mm, Palam 81.2 mm and Lodhi Road recorded 71.9 mm rain on Wednesday.Rainfall of 64.5 to 124.4 mm in a day is considered ‘heavy” by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The heavy spell of rain is due to a combination of factors, meteorologists said.“The monsoon trough (line of low pressure) is passing south of Delhi. It is passing along Bikaner, Palwal, Badaun, Bahraich, Muzaffarpur and north-eastern states. Because Palwal is just south of Delhi, it is bringing a lot of rain here. There is also a trough (area of low pressure) in the westerlies. Moist south-westerly winds are blowing from the Arabian Sea. These are contributing to rain,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.The monsoon trough is likely to shift to the east Thursday onwards, leading to gradual reduction in the rains. The western part of monsoon trough is now lying to the south of its normal position and eastern part runs close to the foothills of Himalayas. In addition, the convergence of moist southerly-southwesterly winds from Bay of Bengal over north-east and adjoining east India is likely to continue for 24 hours till Thursday.According to IMD’s Wednesday bulletin, rain intensity and distribution over northwest India was likely to reduce significantly from Thursday but widespread and heavy rain is likely over central, east, northeast India and Maharashtra during the next three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heavy-showers-in-delhi-reduce-rain-deficit/story-iAohLs2PbPhVpltKC22yFL.html
23-07-2020||Delhi||Man held for killing wife and two minor children in West Delhi||Three days after a man killed his wife and two children at their rented home in outer Delhi’s Shiv Ram Park near Nihal Vihar, police arrested the 39-year-old man on Tuesday from Paschim Vihar. Police said the man was living on the pavements posing as a homeless person in order to avoid arrest. The man, Gagan Kumar Sahu, was planning to flee to Nepal, officials said.Police officers associated with the case said Sahu told them that he had become insecure and was enraged with his wife, Preeti Gupta, as she often threatened to leave him and take along her children. Police said two days before the murders, the couple had a fight and the woman had assaulted Sahu. Police said this left Sahu seething with anger. “He planned to take revenge by killing his wife and children,” said a senior investigator, who did not want to be named.On Saturday night, the investigator said, Sahu went to bed after dinner and pretended to sleep. “Sahu heard Preeti speaking on the phone, after which he took out a hammer and killed her,” the officer said.Sahu first allegedly attacked his wife. When their two children, aged 9 and 7 years, woke up on hearing their mother’s screams, Sahu allegedly attacked them as well with the hammer, killing all three on the spot.“He then washed his hands, changed his clothes, and hid the bloodstained hammer in the kitchen before leaving the house around midnight,” the officer said.On Sunday, around 11.30am, Preeti’s father Ram Chandra Gupta, who lives in the same area, came to check on her as she was not answering his calls. Gupta found Preeti and the two children dead on the bed and their faces smashed in. He raised the alarm and alerted neighbours. The police were called and the three were shifted to a nearby hospital, where they were declared brought dead. Gupta suspected his son-in-law’s role in the murders, as he was missing. A murder case was registered and the police sent a team to Sahu’s native home in Jamalpur, Bihar. Another team kept surveillance on Sahu’s relatives and friends to whom he might go for shelter.“As we knew Sahu did not have money, we activated our intelligence network and we came to know that he had been seen at different places in outer Delhi. Our team searched and caught him sleeping on a pavement in Paschim Vihar area on Tuesday night,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-held-for-killing-wife-and-two-minor-children-in-outer-delhi/story-KAFxNHgaJz5WP2tCtNzuTK.html
23-07-2020||Mumbai||Single command centre in MMR to manage beds||The state government is planning to set up a single command centre in either Thane or Navi Mumbai to help resolve the problem of bed availability in the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR). With patients from neighbouring cities coming to Mumbai for treatment, the city’s health infrastructure is overburdened, said state health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday.There has been a surge of Covid-19 cases in MMR, forcing many municipal corporations in the region to re-impose the lockdown in July. On Wednesday, MMR reported 2,447 new cases while Mumbai had 1,310 new cases. The cities other than Mumbai in MMR have so far reported 105,300 cases of Covid-19.“We have a single command centre in Mumbai for testing and bed management. The dashboard developed gives real-time data on the availability of beds across the city and helps the administration in their management. At present, no one gets a bed for Covid-19 treatment directly. He or she has to call the helpline or ward level war room. In case of MMR, I found beds at field hospitals in Thane city are empty while other cities are facing shortages of beds,” Tope said.The issue has also been discussed with Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde, both of whom support the idea of a single command centre. The command centre is likely to come up either in Thane or Navi Mumbai, with the help of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).“Because of non-availability of beds, people from Thane and other areas are coming to Mumbai for treatment and burdening the city’s health infrastructure. The command centre will resolve that problem,” Tope said.The state health minister further clarified that restrictions would continue to be relaxed gradually.“We have started the process of unlocking the state and there is no chance of again imposing lockdown. We have allowed functioning of private and government offices, hotels and restaurants. I am aware that health-conscious citizens and those working at gyms are facing difficulties. We will resolve their problem very soon and bring a standard operating procedure (SOP) to ensure distancing is followed,” said Tope. Meanwhile, in a meeting held on Tuesday, chief minister asked experts of homoeopathy, Ayurveda and unani medicine to submit a treatment protocol for Covid-19. “It’s time for Ayurveda and unani medicines to prove their significance,” Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-plans-single-command-centre-in-mmr-for-bed-management/story-4l2yPPUqlNXcT0Db21aDAN.html
23-07-2020||Pune||Pune’s Ruby Hall successfully performs liver transplant on HIV positive patient||PUNE Doctors at the Ruby Hall Clinic in Pune performed a liver transplant from a brain-dead donor to a recipient with a pre-existing HIV condition. The liver transplant team at Ruby Hall Clinic successfully completed the transplant, to be one of only a handful of liver transplant units in the country to have successfully done so.The 54-year-old resident of Pune suffered from critical end-stage liver disease due to rare immunological damage owing to the HIV infection. His MELD score (which ranks the degree of sickness and need for a transplant) was 22 which implied a three-month mortality rate. Like most HIV patients, he too was advised the use of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) which enables HIV patients to live longer lives.Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), Pune, said, “Earlier we have had kidney transplants, but this is the first time an HIV positive patient has successfully received a liver.”The patient became the perfect candidate for a liver transplant after the blood group matched the donor. Both the recipient and the donor were screened for Covid-19. Dr Manoj Shrivastav, chief hepatobiliary and liver transplant surgeon, said, “In addition to the detailed decision-making that exists with most organ offers, the presence of HIV infection and the current pandemic added a new layer of dual complexity to this particular case with regard to the protection of the operating surgical team, nurses and paramedical staff. One was the protection from exposure to body fluids, and needle stick injury, owing to the HIV positive status of the patient. The second was strict universal safety precautions from the Covid-19 infection. We minimised personnel in the operation theatre and strictly adhered to the use of PPE kits while meticulously following internationally laid down universal safety precautions guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ruby-hall-successfully-performs-liver-transplant-on-hiv-positive-patient/story-IHpfOyYHW3qjKERyPPvJCJ.html

The injured were rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital.District Headquarter Hospital (DHQ) Deputy Medical Superintendent Dr Qaiser Abbas Bangash said that at least 17 injured, including a child, were brought to the facility, Dawn newspaper reported.One injured person was in critical condition and being shifted to the Combined Military Hospital, Peshawar, the paper quoted Bangash as saying. Earlier, authorities had said that 20 people were injured in the incident.Parachinar is the capital city of Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Soon after the blast, security forces and rescue teams reached the spot.Security forces have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but the region is known for sectarian clashes between Sunnis and Shias.The residents blocked the main highway and staged a protest against the bombing in front of Parachinar Press Club.Leader of the Opposition Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the blast, saying “terrorists seek to target citizens and leave Pakistan in the grip of terror.” Kurram district is considered one of the most sensitive tribal areas of Pakistan as it borders three Afghanistan provinces. It has witnessed scores of attacks and kidnapping for ransom incidents during the last decade.In 2017, nearly 132 people were killed and 460 others wounded in five militant attacks in Parachinar.In previous years, militants had carried out 11 bomb attacks that killed over 500 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/17-injured-in-bomb-blast-at-open-air-market-in-northwest-pakistan/story-Lv8zOLz58pGNCWtiGwvxXP.html
23-07-2020||World||8 Indian films at Shanghai festival as Drishyam’s Chinese remake top box office||Eight Indian movies including the two Bollywood Hindi hits “Article 15” and “Section 375” will be screened at the Shanghai International Film Festival (SIFF) starting Saturday.At least four of the movies including two directed by acclaimed directors Gautam Ghosh and Prakash Jha will be part of the “India film week”, during the SIFF.Coming in the backdrop of the border tension between the two countries – the worst in decades involving fatalities on both sides – it is difficult to predict how the films will be received at this year’s SIFF but Chinese film critics and historians say that it’s good sign even if the political and diplomatic situation is far from normal.Interestingly, the Chinese remake of Indian thriller “Drishyam” – which has been promoted by Chinese media as “Sheep without a Shepherd” is leading the current box office in the country following the calibrated reopening of theatres on Monday in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.Re-released this Monday – it was released in December but screenings stopped after the Coronavirus outbreak spread in January – the movie has “…made 3 million yuan ($430,095) since Chinese mainland theatres reopened on Monday, despite competition from Hollywood hits such as Coco and China’s Wolf Warrior 2,” said a state media report.“Chinese audiences do not connect politics and cultural consumption directly,” Li Daoxin film scholar from the Arts faculty at the Peking University, said.Talking about the Indian films to be screened at SIFF and the expected audience reaction, Li said: “The new Indian films that Chinese audiences see are very good and they like them very much.”Film critic and editor-in-chief of Diangying Yishu (Film Art), Tan Zheng, talked about the popularity of the remake “Sheep Without a Shepherd”.“I am not sure if everyone in the audience knows this (that is a remake of an Indian film) but I think a lot of them do because it has been reported by the media. And, the regular movie-lovers know it,” Tan Zheng said.On the SIFF screenings, Tan said: “Cultural exchanges are conducive to the development of bilateral ties”.In January, just days before theatres shut down because of the outbreak, the official news agency, Xinhua had reported about the box office of “Sheep without a Shepherd”.“The Chinese mainland box office sales of thriller film “Sheep Without a Shepherd” shot past 1 billion yuan (about 144 million U.S. dollars)…” a Xinhua report said, adding: “A remake of Indian thriller ‘Drishyam’ the film tells of a man trying to cover up his daughter’s killing of a police officer’s son”.At SIFF, besides Ghosh’s “Raahgir” and Jha’s “Pareeksha”, two other movies to be screened are Arati Kadav’s “Cargo”, a rare sci-fi movie from India, and a Bangladesh-India joint production “Debris of Despair”, by Indian director Indranil Roychowhdury, who had earlier directed the critically acclaimed “Phoring”.The two others to be shown are Pratik Thakare-directed Annual Day and Gitanjali Rao-helmed “hand-painted animation movie “Bombay Rose”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-indian-films-at-shanghai-festival-as-drishyam-s-chinese-remake-top-box-office/story-RgSsANiS4ESDDCsblgLP4J.html
23-07-2020||World||President Trump orders ‘surge’ of federal troops to crime-hit US cities||President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a “surge” in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers to cities, mostly ruled by Democrats, struggling with spiraling cases of violent crimes.Trump has projected himself as a “law and order” president and struggling in polls against his presumptive Democratic rival Joe Biden, he has fallen back on portraying a grim and scary situation of lawlessness that he is committed to addressing.“This rampage of violence shocks the conscience of our nation, and we will not stand by and watch it happen; can’t do that,” President Trump said at a White House event, accompanied by his top federal law enforcement officials, such as Attorney General William Barr, acting head of homeland security Chad Wolf and FBI director Christopher Wray.“Today, I’m announcing a surge of federal law enforcement into American communities plagued by violent crime.In New York City, over 300 people were shot in the last month alone, he said, which was a 277% -- “at least” -- rise over the same point a year ago. Murders have spiked 27% in Philadelphia and 94% in Minneapolis compared to the same period in 2019. “Perhaps no citizens have suffered more from the menace of violent crime than the wonderful people of Chicago -- a city I know very well,” Trump said.Chicago will be the first recipient of additional federal enforcement personnel under the “surge”, which is taking place as part of the justice department’s recently launched “Operation Legend. Other cites targeted include Portland, Oregon, where federal agents are already on ground to protect federal properties from anti-racism protests (but the surge is not about the protests, but rising violent crimes); and Albuquerque, New Mexico.Chicago officials have said they welcomed federal help but cautioned against federal agents operating on their own, and not under the guidance of local officials.But New York mayor was more forthright. “It is clear that the president’s proposed actions threaten the safety of New Yorkers, the rights of New Yorkers and the fundamental principles of our nation’s constitution,” Mayor Bill de Blasio wrote in a letter to Attorney General Barr.Two days ago, Portland mayor Ted Wheeler called for federal agents to leave. “They’re not wanted here. We haven’t asked them here. In fact, we want them to leave,” he told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-orders-surge-of-federal-troops-to-crime-hit-us-cities/story-9i67j3BhP7nf1wZ8fhEj6N.html
23-07-2020||World||US senate panel paves way for TikTok ban for federal workers||As the Trump administration mulls a broader ban on Chinese apps along the lines of India, a US senate panel on Wednesday approved a bill barring federal employees from downloading and using TikTok, one of them, or replacement applications developed by its parent company ByteDance.Titled “No TikTok on Government Devices Act”, the legislation said, “No employee of the United States, officer of the United States, Member of Congress, congressional employee, or officer or employee of a government corporation may download or use TikTok or any successor application developed by ByteDance or any entity owned by ByteDance on any device issued by the United States or a government corporation.”In the escalating rift between the US, China, President Donald Trump has not ruled out shutting other Chinese missions here following the closure of the consulate in Houston. “As far as closing additional embassies, it’s always possible,” he told reporters. The senate legislation on TikTok was introduced by Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri who has also moved other measures against China including one to make Beijing pay for the Covid-119 epidemic. The TikTok bill was passed by the committee on homeland security for consideration of the full senate and it is set become law as the House of Representative passed a legislation earlier this week, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act 2021, the defense budget, that proposed to do the same, bar federal employees from using TikTok.Though Hawley introduced his TikTok bill in march, America has moved rapidly towards outlawing TikTok and other Chinese apps after India banned 59 of them June-end including US browser and WeChat saying their user data were being mined and profiled by “elements hostile to national security and defense of India”.A 2017 Chinese law forces these and other Chinese companies to cooperate with the government in intelligence matters.Shortly after the Indian ban, Secretary of State mike Pompeo said the United States was considering a similar measure, specific to TikTok. He later said a broad review was underway not only of TikTok but other Chinese apps and devices.The United States has barred Chinese telecommunications firms Huawei and ZTE from participating in its rollout of the 5G network and lobbied other countries to join in a burgeoning global boycott of these companies.TikTok spokeswoman Jamie Favazza said the company’s growing US team has no higher priority than promoting a safe app experience that protects users’ privacy. “Millions of American families use TikTok for entertainment and creative expression, which we recognize is not what federal government devices are for,” she said, as reported by Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-panel-paves-way-for-tiktok-ban-for-federal-workers/story-tWaqwgmJKodwyOvvoY0VjJ.html
23-07-2020||World||China cites ‘malicious slander’ as US orders closure of Houston consulate||China said “malicious slander” is behind an order by the U.S. government to close its consulate in Houston, Texas, and maintained Thursday that its officials have never operated outside ordinary diplomatic norms.Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the order to close the consulate “violates international law and basic norms governing international relations,” and “seriously undermines China-U.S. relations.”“This is breaking down the bridge of friendship between the Chinese and American people,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing.The order this week to close the consulate, one of China’s six missions in the United States, is seen as escalating tensions between the world’s two largest economies while President Donald Trump steers blame and punitive measures against China ahead of the November U.S. election. Beijing has said it would take action in response, although Wang gave no details on Thursday.Relations between the sides have nose-dived in recent months over the conronavirus pandemic as well as disputes over trade, human rights, Hong Kong and Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea.In its statement on the closing of the consulate, the State Department alleged that Chinese agents have tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system statewide and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.Wang said there was no basis to that claim.“This is completely malicious slander,” Wang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-cites-malicious-slander-as-us-orders-closure-of-houston-consulate/story-7nZ1RVNFD9ialWPSNjRrKO.html
23-07-2020||World||US records 2,600 new coronavirus cases every hour as total approaches 4 million||US coronavirus cases were approaching 4 million on Thursday, with over 2,600 new cases every hour on average, the highest rate in the world, according to a Reuters tally.Infections in the United States have rapidly accelerated since the first case was detected on Jan. 21. It took the country 98 days to reach 1 million cases. It took another 43 days to reach 2 million and then 27 days to reach 3 million. It has only taken 16 days to reach 4 million at a rate of 43 new cases a minute.The federal government, state governors and city leaders have often clashed over the best way to tackle the pandemic, leading to a confusing patchwork of rules on issues like mask wearing in public and when businesses can open.President Donald Trump recently shifted his tone. He had been previously been reluctant to wear a mask himself but this week encouraged Americans to wear masks and recently appeared in public for the first time with a face covering.Of the 20 countries with the biggest outbreak, the United States ranks second for cases per capita, at 120 infections per 10,000 people, only exceeded by Chile.With over 143,000 deaths, or 4.4 fatalities per 10,000 people, the United States ranks sixth globally for the highest deaths per capita. It is exceeded by the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Chile and France.Globally, the rate of new infections shows no sign of slowing, with the disease accelerating the fastest in the United States and South America, according to the Reuters tally, based on official reports.Brazil registered a new daily record for confirmed coronavirus cases on Wednesday, pushing the total confirmed cases across Latin America past 4 million.Brazil has the second-largest outbreak in the world, with more than 2.2 million people testing positive and nearly 83,000 deaths.India, the only other country with more than 1 million cases, reported almost 40,000 new cases on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-2-600-new-coronavirus-cases-every-hour-as-total-approaches-4-million/story-Z4WRoZlbbdscetacedIqsN.html
23-07-2020||World||Xi’s own campaign to stay in power pits China against the world||Less than four months before the US election, President Donald Trump has made his tough China policy a centerpiece of his campaign to stay in power.Over in Beijing, President Xi Jinping is similarly preparing for China’s own leadership contest in 2022. While the country’s 1.4 billion citizens don’t get a vote, public sentiment still matters when it comes to how much support Xi can muster from senior Communist Party leaders for his indefinite rule.A crucial pillar of that support has been Xi’s personification of standing “tall and firm” in the world, an image he’s brandished by strongly asserting claims in the South China Sea, spending billions to upgrade military hardware and tightening Beijing’s grip over Hong Kong. While that’s generated nationalism that has buoyed his support, helping make Xi the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, it’s also set China on a collision course with the rest of the world.China has “almost created a dynamic where it has to be externally assertive in order for the party to maintain control domestically, so there’s almost a kind of impulse of clashing with the interests, values and sensitivities of other countries,” said Rory Medcalf, a professor at the Australian National University who wrote “Indo-Pacific Empire: China, America and the Contest for the World’s Pivotal Region.”“It’s almost as if the way Xi Jinping has rewired the Chinese system, it can’t help it -- it can’t help itself,” he added. “That is obviously very damaging for China’s interests in the long run. It’s actually very damaging for all of us.”‘Real Resistance’The deterioration of U.S.-China ties -- the closure of the Houston consulate was the latest in a long string of tit-for-tat action -- is just the tip of the iceberg. In recent months, more countries have spoken out against Chinese actions in places like Hong Kong and Xinjiang. And China’s diplomats, eager to please party leaders, have sparred with countries ranging from the U.K. and Australia to India and Kazakhstan.A new purge with the Communist Party ranks may explain why officials are so eager to demonstrate their loyalty. Quishi Journal, the party’s official magazine, published excerpts from Xi’s speeches this month saying the party leadership should be embodied in “every aspect and every link” of society. An accompanying editorial called Xi the “ultimate arbiter.”“His campaign to remain in power at the 20th Party Congress has definitely started,” said Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego. “There is very likely some real resistance under the surface in the system, and 2022 will be very interesting. I don’t think it’s a slam dunk.”The biggest question looming over Chinese politics is when Xi, 67, will step aside after breaking with succession practices set up after Mao’s fraught tenure. He has pledged to transform China into a leading global power by 2050, with a thriving middle class, strong military and clean environment.In recent weeks, Xi has sought to weed out dissent among China’s security forces. The Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the party body that oversees the country’s police, prosecutors and courts, announced an “education and rectification” campaign to “thoroughly remove tumors” from the justice system. Its top official compared the campaign -- set to last through 2022, when Xi’s term as party leader expires -- with a political purge that consolidated Mao’s paramount position more than 75 years ago.Xi also placed the People’s Liberation Army reserve forces under direct control of the central government and Central Military Commission, changing a rule whereby they reported to both the PLA and local government. And he took steps to silence critics of his government’s response to the pandemic while attaching top priority to “safeguarding the regime’s security.”Perfect StormWhile China’s citizens aren’t going to rebel against Xi, a “perfect storm” scenario in which a Covid-19 upsurge forces another lockdown, Chinese stocks crash and countries pressure companies to withdraw investments could lead to splits in the leadership, according to Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies. That’s dangerous for Xi, he said, because of the precedent he set by jailing former security chief Zhou Yongkang after he retired from the Politburo Standing Committee, China’s most powerful body.“He knows that he’s got a lot of enemies, and the enemies are not dissidents,” Tsang said. “The enemies are within the top echelon in the Communist Party.”Right now there’s no reason to think Xi is facing any imminent threats. While his government’s initial handling of the pandemic generated widespread dissatisfaction, Xi’s subsequent ability to reduce cases and restart economic activity helped mitigate the damage -- and compared positively with the responses of countries like the U.S., where the virus is still running rampant.China’s economy has also continued to expand, even if growth rates weren’t as impressive as during his predecessor’s watch. Economic data released in July suggest the country is back on the path to recovery, even though the figures showed worrying trends such as a decline in retail sales and a drop in investment by private companies. Xi this week urged companies to innovate and pledged to further open the economy, saying China will “stand on the correct side of history.”“His position is much more secure than any time before largely because of his success, from the Chinese perspective, in containing coronavirus,” said Cheng Li, director of the Brookings Institution’s John L. Thornton China Center. “We should not underestimate his capacity and his popularity.”Disputes SurgingAlthough gauging public opinion in China is always difficult due to strict censorship, a Harvard University study released this month showed that satisfaction rates among Chinese citizens in 2016 had increased markedly across all levels of government compared with 2003, with officials seen as “as more capable and effective than ever before.” It found that citizens respond positively and negatively to measurable changes in their well-being, which could be a “double-edged sword.”“While the CCP is seemingly under no imminent threat of popular upheaval, it cannot take the support of its people for granted,” it said.Without democratic elections, the Communist Party’s roughly 200-member Central Committee nominally elects the party leader and lawmakers pick the president -- titles both held by Xi. In reality, leadership positions are hashed out behind the scenes among various factions, a process that starts several years before the Party Congress and remains largely a black box to outsiders.Whereas a decade ago it was possible to see the government as a separate entity, under Xi the party has become paramount, said Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Center. That has contributed to a surge in border disputes flaring up at the same time, he said, as promoting nationalism has become more important than creating new diplomatic links.“In a way that would be less necessary in more prosperous times,” Mitter said.Xi’s consolidation of power has made him at once more secure and more vulnerable, with any missteps like the initial response to Covid-19 providing an opening for any rivals to pounce, said Tsang from SOAS University of London. On the world stage, he said, Xi’s administration is “picking fights with everybody.”“When you’re running it as a strongman, you really cannot afford to show any signs of weakness,” Tsang said. “And this is what we have with Xi Jinping.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-s-own-campaign-to-stay-in-power-pits-china-against-the-world/story-5McDwzKAjiS9OLgAjwjkmO.html
23-07-2020||World||China launches first independent Mars probe, calls it ‘Questions to Heaven’||China on Thursday launched its first independent Mars probe, a milestone in the country’s ambitious space programme which aims to have a space station by 2022. If successful, the probe, named Tianwen-1 - which in Mandarin means “Questions to Heaven” - will join an international community of explorers on Mars, comprising the US, Europe, Russia, India, and soon the UAE which launched a mission to the red planet on July 20.The launch was planned for years but comes in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, which China seems to have brought under control, and the worst floods it is experiencing in decades – the launch carries a show of strength for the international community especially the western powers.Also read: Security agencies red-flag Chinese fronts in education, not just power and telecomChina’s first Mars probe Yinghuo-1 launched in 2011 had failed. Yinghuo-1, launched in November 2011, two years later than originally planned from Kazakhstan on a Russian spacecraft, crashed into the Pacific Ocean in 2012.On Thursday, Chinese official media reported that a Long March-5 rocket, the country’s largest launch vehicle, carried the 5-tonne spacecraft from the Wenchang Spacecraft launch site on the coast of southern China’s Hainan province at 12:41 pm.“About 36 minutes later, the spacecraft, including an orbiter and a rover, was sent into the Earth-Mars transfer orbit, embarking on an almost seven-month journey to the red planet,” the China National Space Administration (CNSA) was quoted by official news agency, Xinhua.The Mars mission is named Tianwen-1 from a poem written by Qu Yuan (about 340-278 BC), a leading poet of ancient China. “The name signifies the Chinese nation’s perseverance in pursuing truth and science and exploring nature and the universe,” said the CNSA.The Mars rover, which is expected to work on Mars for at least 90 Mars days (more than three months on Earth), will carry out patrol exploration and research on geomorphic landforms of Mars, Bao Weimin, an academic with the Chinese Academy of Sciences told Xinhua in June.“A safe landing on Mars is the most difficult and risky part of the mission and the lander carrying the rover will be slowed down through four steps,” said Bao who is also the director of the Committee of Science and Technology under the CNSA. The whole landing process will take about seven to eight minutes, Bao had said.Last November, China had successfully mounted an experiment simulating the process of a probe hovering, avoiding obstacles and descending to land on Mars. In January 2019, China’s Chang’e-4 probe landed on the far side of the moon, making it the first spacecraft to touch down on the part of the moon, which is never visible from earth. China had lauded India’s Mars mission when it was launched in 2014.The successful mission to Mars was not only India’s pride but also that of Asia, China had then said, adding that it was a landmark in the world of space exploration.“We congratulate India on the Mars satellite entering orbit (of the planet) successfully,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, had said in 2014.“This is the pride of India and the pride of Asia and a landmark progress in humankind’s exploration of outer space. So we congratulate India on that,” Hua had added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-first-independent-mars-probe-calls-it-questions-to-heaven/story-5wedpH0NsLN4cpQzZhb64K.html

It is encouraging. There is de-escalation, tensions seem to ease,” Sir Philip Barton, British High Commissioner to India, said at a press briefing on Thursday.Both the countries started the process after the face-of in Galwan Valley, in which India lost 20 soldiers and China suffered undisclosed number of casualties.There have been a series of meetings since the June 15 incident.India and China remain committed to “complete disengagement” which is an “intricate process” and “requires constant verification”, the Indian Army had said in a statement last week.Limited disengagement had started after at least six rounds of meetings both at the miltary and diplomatic levels.Defence minister Rajnath Singh visited Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir last week where he said that the ongoing negotiations with China should help resolve the ongoing border dispute but he couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation would be resolved, in another confirmation of the complex nature of the ongoing military and diplomatic negotiations between the two nuclear powers.The government had said ahead of Singh’s statement that the complex disengagement process with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is specifically aimed at preventing “face-off situations”, and any unilateral attempts to change the status quo on the disputed border won’t be accepted.However, sources aware of the situation on the border said that India and China have lately failed to make a breakthrough in reducing border tensions, and the disengagement process at some points of the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) has virtually halted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/encouraging-uk-welcomes-steps-taken-by-india-and-china-to-ease-border-tensions/story-7fzq2mzgrNvlrBI79k5gEK.html

In 2019, thanks to a massive scale-up, WFP and partners were able to reverse the deterioration in the worst hit areas of Yemen.” Yemen’s conflict has killed more than 100,000 people and created the world’s worst humanitarian disaster, with more than 3 million people internally displaced and two-thirds of the population reliant on food assistance for survival.Donor countries recently cut back on aid to Yemen amid the coronavirus pandemic and also due to concerns that the aid might not be reaching intended recipients in territories controlled by the Iran-backed Houthis.“Yemen is again on the brink of a major food security crisis. ... Unless we receive the funding we need now, we won’t be able to do the same this time,” said Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen.She said the UN agencies faced the similar situation 18 months ago, but they were “generously funded” and “prevented a famine.” Some 24 million Yemeni people, which is 80% of the country’s entire population, require some form of assistance or protection, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA. And 75% of UN programmes for the country, covering essentially every sector, from food to health care and nutrition, have already shut their doors or reduced operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-food-shortages-in-war-torn-yemen-warn-un-agencies/story-h99vlgAqskWYkgpos2lQtM.html
23-07-2020||World||US says Chinese researcher linked to military hiding in San Francisco consulate: Report||There is a new twist in the move by the United States government to shut down China’s consulate in Houston. According to CNN, the US government is looking for a Chinese scientist accused of visa fraud.According to federal prosecutors quoted by CNN, the scientist Tang Juan is hiding in China’s consulate in San Francisco. Juan is a researcher who focuses on biology, the CNN reported.She has been accused of lying about the connection with the Chinese military in order to get entry into the US, the CNN further reported. She was charged with visa fraud on June 26.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is assessing that Tang is in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco.This is a latest blow to China after the US said on Wednesday that it had given China 72 hours to close the consulate “to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information”.The decision marked a dramatic escalation of tensions between the world’s two biggest economies amid fresh accusations of Chinese espionage in the United States and calls by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for a new global coalition against Beijing.China’s embassy to the United States described the move to close the Houston consulate as a “political provocation” and called on Washington to “immediately revoke” the decision.

The National Defense and Security Forces have the responsibility to protect the lives and property of the people, in this regard, they use all the opportunities and facilities and will not spare any effort,” the statement said.Habib Amini, a local official in neighbouring Guzara district, confirmed the incident and that 45 were killed and more injured.A spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan said they had not taken part in Wednesday’s airstrikes. The United States is winding back troops under an agreement with the Taliban struck in February, which was meant to pave the way to formal peace talks between the insurgents and the Afghan government. However, disagreement over the release of prisoners demanded by the Taliban and rising violence around the country have hampered progress, and talks have yet to start. Qari Muhammad Yousuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, said in a statement that two airstrikes in Heart had killed eight civilians and wounded 12. Two local officials confirmed there had been two rounds of airstrikes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airstrikes-in-afghanistan-province-kill-45-civilians-and-taliban-members-report/story-FIuT3WrgbXm6J4gQGLEjvN.html

In Herat, photos and eyewitness accounts suggest many civilians including children are among the victims of an Afghan airstrike. We condemn the attack and support an investigation,” Khalilzad wrote on his Twitter page on late Wednesday, reported Sputnik.Airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan killed 45 people, including civilians and Taliban fighters, local officials said on Wednesday.Ali Ahmad Faqir Yar, governor of Adraskan district in the eastern Afghan province of Herat, said, “Forty-five people had been killed so far in airstrikes by security forces in the Kham Ziarat area. Taliban were among those killed and at least eight civilians were among the dead”.The diplomat also slammed the Taliban Islamist movement for recent attacks that also resulted in many civilian deaths.“The Afghan people want an immediate start of peace negotiations and a settlement that is in their best interest. More graves will not bring negotiations forward. Rather than setting the process back, we urge all sides to contain the violence, protect civilians, and show necessary restraint as the start of intra-Afghan negotiations is so close,” Khalilzad added.Under the US-Taliban peace agreement which was signed in Doha on February 29, up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners should be released by the Afghan government ahead of the intra-Afghan negotiations.The process has not been completed yet.Despite the February agreement, the situation in Afghanistan has remained volatile with sporadic attacks both by the Afghan forces and the Taliban, on each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-condemns-deadly-airstrikes-in-afghanistan-s-herat-province/story-HxAmlwicc5kX9Qgn7z6ECP.html

Gennady Zyuganov, in a column, attacked “capital globalism” and claimed that the mandatory vaccination plan is a “ploy by so-called globalists to implant chip in every human being so that their movements could be monitored”.Gates said he wants to bring the coronavirus pandemic to an end and hoped that the theory dies down as people get the facts.Gates and a foundation led by him and his wife Melinda are working to find a vaccine for Covid-19. In February, the foundation had announced that it is donating US $100 million to vaccine research and treatment efforts.Meanwhile, GSK and CureVac, backed by Gates, are work on developing up to five so-called mRNA-based vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for infectious diseases. mRNA vaccines use ribonucleic acid (RNA), a chemical messenger that evokes an immune response when injected by instructing cells to make proteins that mimic pathogens.The approach, also being deployed in experimental Covid-19 vaccines by BioNTech and partner Pfizer and Moderna, is yet to be approved in any therapy.Tech giant Google had recently said that it will prohibit websites and apps that use its advertising technology from running ads on “dangerous content” that goes against scientific consensus during the coronavirus pandemic. Examples of content that will not be allowed to make money from ads include debunked conspiracy theories, such as the notion that the novel coronavirus was created in a Chinese lab as a bioweapon, that it was created by Microsoft founder Bill Gates or that the virus is a hoax, Google said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-it-dies-down-bill-gates-on-theory-claiming-he-is-planning-to-implant-chips-via-covid-19-vaccine/story-JWHGHxSvhBARCE89pHbUQM.html
23-07-2020||World||Hong Kong records highest single day spike of 102 Covid-19 cases||Hong Kong reported a record 102 new local virus cases on Wednesday as the city’s “most severe” situation since the pandemic began prompted health officials to expand virus-protection measures.Of the additional local cases, more than half were unlinked to previous cases, according to data from the city’s health department on Wednesday. The Asian financial hub has been caught off-guard by the sudden eruption of infections, with the number of untraceable cases signaling that hidden chains of transmission are widespread.“Hong Kong’s epidemic is at the most severe moment,” Sophia Chan, secretary for food and health, said in a briefing Wednesday. “I urge all citizens to stay in their homes and stop unnecessary outings.”Officials said on Wednesday that imported cases numbered 8, out of a total of 113 imported and local infections. On Thursday, the Hong Kong government revised the number of imported cases to 11, making the number of local infections 102, not 105.Officials are quickly imposing the strictest rules yet after easing guidelines over the past month. Effective Thursday, mask-wearing requirements will be expanded to indoor public venues -- including malls, shops, supermarkets, markets and building lobbies, Chan said. The maximum fine will be HK$5,000 ($645). Currently, public transport passengers are already required to wear masks to curb the virus.Hong Kong will also extend a 14-day mandatory quarantine for those with travel history to mainland China, Taiwan and Macau to Sept. 7. The US and Kazakhstan were added to a list of high-risk regions, meaning inbound travelers who have been to those countries in the last 14 days must pass a virus test before boarding their flights.The government might further tighten virus-control rules if cases continue to surge, Chan said. The city has dismissed speculation that Hong Kong will be imminently locked down.Hong Kong is reeling from another wave of cases as outbreaks elsewhere in Asia are also raising alarms. Australia, once hailed as a success in containing the virus, hit a daily record for infections on Wednesday. Tokyo’s infections now total more than 10,000, as Japan’s capital struggles to stamp out new clusters. The flare-ups are a sobering reminder of the difficulty of eradicating the pandemic that has sickened almost 15 million people worldwide.The resurgence of cases in Hong Kong has been aggressive after a period that saw residents return to normal life. While the city reacted quickly to the epidemic earlier this year, implemented mask-wearing and social distancing, complacency set in as daily local cases dwindled to near zero in mid-April.In addition to the tighter new restrictions, the government is also scrambling to boost testing, quarantine and hospitalization facilities. But for now, it is avoiding a lockdown as it tries to keep the economy open.Lam Ching Choi, a member of Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s Executive Council and a doctor, said Hong Kong is seeking a strategy that balances public health, the economy and social acceptance in a city that has been rocked by anti-government protests. As a result, it isn’t aiming for zero cases, like mainland China is, through heavy lockdowns.Lam also noted the difficulty of shutting down restaurants, even though they are high-risk areas, because of the popularity of dining out in the city, with some families never cooking at home. Hong Kong restaurants currently must stop dine-in services by 6 p.m.“Our trust level is maybe the lowest compared with western countries because of the social events that happened this year,” Lam said in an interview. “So we must listen to our people and not affect their work, their daily lives – like shopping or visiting their family members.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-records-highest-single-day-spike-of-102-covid-19-cases/story-5Kkuw8Vo5oGny2qnnPvvQN.html

23-07-2020||World||Mexico’s president downplays importance of wearing masks amid Covid pandemic||Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Wednesday downplayed the importance of wearing face masks during the pandemic, calling his treasury secretary’s assertion that using them would be a factor in reactivating the economy “disproportionate.”López Obrador had never been seen publicly wearing a mask until he flew to Washington earlier this month to meet with President Donald Trump.“If a mask was an option for the economy’s reactivation, I’d put one on immediately,” López Obrador said Wednesday. “But it’s not like that. I follow the recommendations of the doctors, of the scientists.”The World Health Organization recommends the wearing of masks among other measures to slow the spread of Covid-19. At age 66, López Obrador also falls into an at-risk group of people who should wear masks.Mexico continued to report high transmission rates Wednesday, with 6,019 newly confirmed cases, for a cumulative total of 362,274 infections. The Health Department also reported 790 more deaths, bringing the total so far in the pandemic to 41,190, the fourth highest total behind the United Kingdom at 45,586.On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Arturo Herrera said in a virtual meeting with a national business council that countries that have taken a more ordered approach and precautions in reactivating their economies had been more successful than others that suffered new outbreaks and had to lock down again.Herrera himself had been earlier infected with Covid-19 and recovered.On Wednesday, Herrera was sitting behind López Obrador when he spoke and he asked the president to let him clarify his comments from the day before. He said he was using the mask as an “analogy” to explain to business owners that measures have to be taken to safely operate now. Among such measures are masks and he pulled out his own.López Obrador returned to the podium and pronounced: “It’s safe distance and freedom.” He then proceeded to commend Mexicans for being careful and to criticize recent stories in the press that highlight the number dead in countries with presidents who don’t wear masks, including Mexico, the United States and Brazil.Trump tweeted a photo of himself wearing a mask Monday and yesterday conceded that they had an impact.López Obrador continued traveling around Mexico for weeks, wading into crowds like usual, after Mexico confirmed its first Covid-19 infection Feb. 28. He has generally downplayed the pandemic’s threat and pushed to reopen Mexico’s economy.“It’s not just the mask,” he said. “It has to do with a number of factors of all kinds.”On Wednesday, the Health Department reported that Covid-19 has now become the leading cause of death among pregnant women in Mexico and those who have recently given birth, accounting for 19% of such deaths.A total of 2,842 infections have been confirmed among pregnant women and those who have recently given birth, resulting in 83 deaths. The agency said 88% percent of the infections were confirmed during pregnancy and 12% after giving birth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-s-president-downplays-importance-of-wearing-masks-amid-covid-pandemic/story-7FfdICRwSzVC2ycd7yaEgJ.html
23-07-2020||World||Trump to send federal agents to more US cities as part of ‘law and order’ campaign||President Donald Trump announced a plan on Wednesday to send federal agents to the Democratic-run cities of Chicago and Albuquerque to crack down on violent crime in an escalation of his “law and order” theme heading into the final months before the presidential election.Trump, joined at a White House event by Attorney General William Barr, unveiled an expansion of the “Operation Legend” program to more cities in a further effort by federal officials to tackle violence.“Today I’m announcing a surge of federal law enforcement into American communities plagued by violent crime,” said Trump, a Republican who has accused Democratic mayors and governors of tolerating crime waves. “This bloodshed must end; this bloodshed will end,” he said.The program involves deploying federal law enforcement agents to assist local police in combating what the Justice Department has described as a “surge” of violent crime.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, welcomed the federal help, so long as it was to assist local law enforcement with community policing and public safety. Both rejected the use of federal agents for the kind of protest crackdown seen in Portland, Oregon, saying such actions would be met with legal action.“If the Trump administration wishes to antagonize New Mexicans and Americans with authoritarian, unnecessary and unaccountable military-style ‘crackdowns,’ they have no business whatsoever in New Mexico,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. Barr sought to differentiate the initiative from the use of federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to quell unrest in Portland, where local authorities have complained about the federal involvement.Barr said the law enforcement personnel from a variety of agencies will serve as “street” agents and investigators who will be working to “solve murders and take down violent gangs.”“This is different than the operations and tactical teams we use to defend against riots and mob violence,” Barr said. “We will continue to confront mob violence. But the operations we are discussing today are very different – they are classic crime fighting.”Trump hopes his “law and order” push will resonate with his political base as he trails Democrat Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election. But the initiative risks inflaming tensions running high in many cities in the wake of the death in police custody of George Floyd, an African-American.Operation Legend involves federal agents from the FBI, US Marshals Service and other agencies partnering with local law enforcement.Lightfoot said it was not unusual for federal law enforcement to work alongside local partners, but urged Chicagoans to watch for any sign that federal agents, especially DHS officers, were stepping “out of line.”“We don’t need federal troops, we don’t need unnamed, secret federal agents,” said Lightfoot, in reference to tactics used by federal personnel in Portland.Trump has emphasized a robust policing and military approach to the protests across the United States about racial inequality after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.The White House has sought to focus on city crime even as Trump’s approval numbers plummet in response to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. “We are waiting for the mayor (Lightfoot), respectfully, and other mayors and governors to call us. We are ready, willing and able to go in there with great force,” Trump told reporters later on Wednesday.Operation Legend is named for LeGend Taliferro, a 4-year-old boy who was shot and killed while he slept early on June 29 in Kansas City, Missouri, according to the Department of Justice’s website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-send-federal-agents-to-more-us-cities-as-part-of-law-and-order-campaign/story-vuYcK0ZJ35BwawDDV6tX1K.html
23-07-2020||World||Canada sees fresh Covid-19 spike, experts blame it on ‘fatigue factor’||Young Canadians flocking to bars or packed indoor parties may be contributing to a fresh spike in the number of coronavirus cases in the country. The number of fresh cases reported in a day, which had gone down earlier, has now increased by over 50 per cent, crossing 450.Canada’s Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Dr Howard Njoo said there may be a “fatigue factor” in play as younger adults are seeking to enjoy themselves after over three months of facing restrictive measures. Most provinces in the country have brought about relaxations and opened bars, restaurants and pubs.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNjoo pointed out that younger adults, those under 39, now comprised 55 per cent of new cases as against approximately a third in May.As social gatherings increase, authorities are also seeing the number of contacts per person increase tenfold from threefold or fourfold earlier.Among the most impacted provinces in Canada is Ontario. On Tuesday it witnessed 203 new positive cases, the highest since late June. Ontario health authorities said 57 per cent of those cases involved those aged below 39.According to Public Health Agency of Canada, those in the 20-29 demographic formed the largest chunk of new cases in the second week of July.This trend has caused concern among health authorities in the country, even as the overall numbers haven’t spiraled out of control with the country recording nearly 112,000 cases with 8,862 deaths.Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr Theresa Tam echoed the worry that younger Canadians may cause a resurgence in Covid-19 infections. Though our social, economic and recreational spaces are cautiously re-opening, we can’t afford to throw caution to the wind. Living with Covid-19 means we cannot eliminate all cases and clusters in Canada, so preventing epidemic acceleration depends on our actions, individually and collectively,” she said in a statement.Pointing out that this summer is “not like any other”, she advised Canadians to stay in their “social bubble”, avoid closed and crowded spaces and maintain measures like social distancing and wearing masks, even as the last two have been among those often sacrificed in places like bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-sees-fresh-covid-19-spike-experts-blame-it-on-fatigue-factor/story-1zJA69GFFYXBDYPYICCFKJ.html

23-07-2020||World||California moves past New York, now tops in United States for Covid cases||A record one-day total of newly confirmed coronavirus cases gave California more than 409,000 since the pandemic began, sending it past New York for the most in the country, data from Wednesday showed.California’s cases have climbed rapidly in the last month, punctuated by the 12,807 recorded Tuesday, while New York’‘s have fallen to less than 1,000 per day. California’s overall total is about 700 more than New York’s, according to a tally Johns Hopkins University.The surge of cases in California came after much of its economy was reopened in May and early June following nearly three months under the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order that forced most businesses to close and restricted where people could go.Statewide, hospitalizations have nearly doubled in the past month to more than 7,100 patients. Coronavirus patients in intensive care have risen 71% over the same time frame to more than 2,000 patients.Gov. Gavin Newsom and health officials have blamed the increase on people — many of them younger adults — gathering with friends and family and not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing.At the end of June, Newsom began reimposing shutdowns. Bars and inside dining are forbidden statewide and tougher restrictions — including bans on indoor religious services and in-person instruction at schools and closures of indoor malls and gyms — have been imposed on virtually every large county and some small ones where the outbreak is most severe.Officials say it’s still too soon to know if the new restrictions will adequately slow the spread of the virus. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has warned the situation in LA has become so tenuous that a virtual lockdown may be needed.Still, the lure of sunny skies has beckoned families and friends to gather for barbecues and pool parties despite pleas from public health officials to stay home.“I know it’s hard,” Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Wednesday. “I know it’s a sacrifice, especially on beautiful summer days. But I’m asking people to stay home as much as possible. Avoid gathering with people you don’t live with.”New York still has by far the most coronavirus-related deaths in the country with more than 32,500 — four times more than California’s tally of about 7,900. New York’s rate of confirmed infections of about 2,100 per 100,000 people is twice California’s rate.With nearly 40 million residents, California is the most populous state in the country by a wide stretch. New York has 19.5 million residents.Newsom said it wasn’t surprising California would eventually have the most cases. He added, however, that it is “a sober reminder of why we are taking things as seriously as we are.”But with the disease spreading faster than public health officials can track it, it’s impossible to know the true extent of the virus’s reach in the United States. Federal government data published Tuesday found that reported and confirmed coronavirus cases vastly underestimate the true number of infections, echoing results from a smaller study last month.Testing supplies were so scarce at the start of the pandemic that many people had it and recovered without ever getting checked to see if they had the disease. Antibody surveys in New York City have suggested that by late April, as many as 1 in 5 people in the city had the disease, which would be about 1.6 million people.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study said true Covid-19 rates were more than 10 times higher than reported cases in most US regions from late March to early May. It is based on Covid-19 antibody tests performed on routine blood samples in 16,000 people in 10 US regions.In California, Los Angeles County and its 10 million residents remain a virus hot spot. County officials announced 64 new deaths on Wednesday, raising the total to 4,213 as the number of confirmed cases soared past 164,800. County hospitals had 2,207 patients, marking the fourth day in a row of hospitalizations exceeding 2,200 people.A state watch list of counties with increasing number of cases grew to 35 on Wednesday as officials added rural Butte County to the list. The Northern California county was devastated by a 2018 wildfire that destroyed most of the town of Paradise.Counties on the watch list for three consecutive days trigger a new round of restrictions, including closing indoor operations at hair and nail salons. The renewed restrictions now apply to more than 85% of the state’s population, fuelling fears of a more job losses in a state where more than 8 million people have applied for unemployment benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-moves-past-new-york-now-tops-in-united-states-for-covid-cases/story-NuNK9Fdqanz1Q6HgekAVLJ.html
23-07-2020||World||Donald Trump is first racist US president, says Joe Biden||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden labeled Donald Trump on Wednesday the first racist to become US president in remarks his opponent’s re-election campaign quickly rebuked.Biden, who was vice president under Barack Obama, the first Black US president, fielded a question at a Service Employees International Union roundtable from a healthcare worker concerned about the Republican president calling the coronavirus pandemic the “China virus.”He responded by saying it was “absolutely sickening” how Trump “deals with people based on the color of their skin, their national origin, where they’re from.”He added: “No sitting president’s ever done this. Never, never, never. No Republican president has done this. No Democratic president. We’ve had racists, and they’ve existed, and they’ve tried to get elected president. He’s the first one that has.”Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson fired back, calling Biden’s comments “an insult to the intelligence of Black voters” given the onetime senator’s past work with segregationist lawmakers. She said Trump “loves all people” and “works hard to empower all Americans.”A number of US presidents owned slaves or supported policies including the repression of Native Americans and segregation of Black Americans. Princeton University said last month it was dropping former President Woodrow Wilson’s name from the school, citing his racist thinking and policies.The Biden-Trump exchange marks an escalation in what had already been a heated clash on race in the campaign being waged between the two candidates, who are both white, ahead of their Nov. 3 election contest.Biden previously criticized Trump for stoking racial division, often saying that he was motivated to run for office by his outrage over Trump’s assessment that “both sides” were to blame for violence between white supremacists and counterprotesters at a 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.Race became an even more central issue as protests raged over unarmed African Americans being killed by police in the aftermath of the May death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police office pressed his neck into the pavement for more than eight minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-is-first-racist-us-president-says-joe-biden/story-PW2l0p68BLe1hipZuh5EqI.html

The alternative -- a trip to Thailand to use a simulator owned by Thai Airways International Pcl -- was blocked because of travel bans, an Asiana spokesman said.“Takeoffs and landings of this plane cost a lot of money, and it’s money that needs to be used wisely, especially these days,” said Um Kyung-a, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in Seoul. “Asiana is in a bind because it also can’t afford for its pilots to lose their licenses.”Asiana had another 135 pilots who didn’t have enough flying time on its six A380s, but it couldn’t afford to keep flying the empty jet. In the end, the country’s transport ministry extended the pilots’ flying credentials as a special exemption. Japan’s All Nippon Airways, which operates two A380s, received a similar extension from Japan’s aviation authority.Most of the big A380 operators, like Asiana’s rival Korean Air Lines Co., have their own simulators.The International Civil Aviation Organization has provided guidelines to state members on how to help pilots keep up their skills. Normally, pilots must have taken off and landed an aircraft at least three times within the previous 90 days to keep their license.The problem is acute for the biggest jets, which were designed for an age of mass travel. But Boeing Co.’s 747 has more simulators and is used by many airlines, including Korean Air, for cargo flights, allowing carriers to rotate crews to keep them certified.The International Air Transport Association said international air traffic may not return to pre-Covid levels until 2024.One of the few that’s still flying the A380 is Emirates Airlines, which has the world’s biggest fleet of the superjumbos. The airline restarted A380 flights on July 15 to London Heathrow and Paris as Dubai eased travel restrictions.Deutsche Lufthansa AG said last month its A380 jets will be mothballed for at least two years and may never return to service. Even before the virus, weak demand for the giant plane caused Airbus to announce it would stop making the A380 next year.“It’s like you’re basically stuck with a 1990 car that’s running on diesel,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “We’re going to see more heading to the scrapyard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airline-flies-empty-a380-to-nowhere-to-keep-its-pilots-certified/story-gjhFVa2AmF9mx7JvvauIhO.html

It is a mistake that I regret. I apologize for that.”The finance minister said the C$41,366 in expenses were incurred when his family traveled to Kenya and Ecuador in 2017 with the non-profit group. Morneau also said his family made two C$50,000 donations to WE, one in April 2018 to support work for students in Canada and a second last month for Covid-19 relief efforts in Kenya.Morneau said he wasn’t aware he had incurred the expenses at the time, and only realized the “error” after a recent review of the trips.Along with Trudeau, Morneau is also under investigation by Canada’s ethics watchdog for possible conflict of interest over the decision to award a contract worth up C$43.5 million to WE for the administration of a C$900 million student grant program. Two of the finance minister’s daughters have ties to the group, including one who currently works for the organization.Separately Wednesday, the prime minister’s office said Trudeau has accepted an invitation to testify before the finance committee on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-charity-scandal-trudeau-s-finance-minister-admits-to-travel-gift/story-0FdBTW5Q6E3zurTFeiDUDN.html
23-07-2020||World||Pompeo tells UK MPs China ‘bought’ WHO chief Tedros||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo told a group of British lawmakers that China had “bought” the head of the World Health Organization, according to people familiar with the matter.At a private meeting in London on Tuesday, Pompeo said there was firm intelligence to show that a deal had been done to get Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus the job of WHO director-general -- and that this had resulted in the deaths of UK citizens from coronavirus, the people said.Three of those who were present at the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussion was private, said Pompeo told them he believed China had bought the WHO chief. He didn’t give further details of what he meant but said there was intelligence to support this comment.The Chinese Embassy in London and the State Department did not respond to emailed requests for comment. The WHO rejected “unfounded allegations” which first surfaced in British newspapers including the Telegraph on Tuesday.Pompeo’s allegations mark a significant escalation in the Trump administration’s criticism of the WHO and of China’s response to the pandemic. US officials have said the WHO allowed the coronavirus outbreak to get out of control and President Donald Trump has said it is too close to China.Speaking a day after Tuesday’s meeting, Conservative member of Parliament Iain Duncan Smith, who was present, confirmed that Pompeo had said China swayed the WHO director-general election in May 2017 so Tedros won.“He openly made the point that the arrival of the present chief who had taken the WHO backwards and that it had become quite political,” Duncan Smith told Bloomberg TV Wednesday, when asked about Pompeo’s comments. “He therefore said that it was China had managed to get others to ensure that they voted for this particular candidate at the time and that is why the US, he said, has decided to withdraw and use the money,” to tackle some of the projects the WHO supports.According to three of the people present, Pompeo criticized the WHO and the United Nations Human Rights Council during the hour-long meeting.“WHO is not aware of any such statement but we strongly reject any ‘ad hominem’ attacks and unfounded allegations,” an emailed statement from the WHO read. “WHO urges countries to remain focused on tackling the pandemic that is causing tragic loss of life and suffering.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s officials were asked about Pompeo’s comments and confirmed that the Secretary of State had not made similar remarks in his meeting with the premier on Tuesday.“The prime minister believes the WHO and its Director General are playing an important role in leading the global health response to the pandemic,” Johnson’s spokesman James Slack told reporters. “The WHO continues to have an important role to play in leading the global health response to the pandemic, the UK is a major donor to the WHO.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-tells-uk-mps-china-bought-who-chief-tedros/story-ySYJsVVP18PUUrfFmTfJXM.html
23-07-2020||World||Trump willing to work with China on Covid-19 vaccine ‘if it gets good results’||US President Donald Trump expressed a willingness on Tuesday to work with China or other countries to bring a successful coronavirus vaccine to the United States, despite rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.“We’re willing to work with anybody that is going to get us a good result,” Trump said, when asked if the administration would collaborate with China on a vaccine for Americans, whether China is first to develop one or not.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage​The remarks came a day after researchers said a vaccine against the coronavirus developed by China’s CanSino Biologics Inc (6185.HK) and China’s military research unit appeared to be safe and induced immune responses in most subjects in a closely-watched mid-stage study.The CanSino candidate is one of a handful of vaccines that have shown some promise in early human testing. Others gearing up for such trials include vaccines from US-based Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Germany’s BioNTech SE (22UAy.F), in partnership with American drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).Data from a combined early/midstage trial of a vaccine candidate being developed by researchers at the University of Oxford and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca (AZN.L) was also released on Monday.Trump has long blamed China for mishandling the deadly coronavirus pandemic, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and charged across the United States, killing more than 140,000 Americans and raising the stakes for a quick and viable vaccine.“I think we’re going to have some very good results. We’re already in testing. Nobody thought that would be possible,” he said. “I think you’re going to see something over the next fairly short period of time - maybe very short period of time - having to do with therapeutics and vaccines that are very good,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-willing-to-work-with-china-on-covid-19-vaccine-if-it-gets-good-results/story-MZ3Ub6tHf71Rk6aLZmMETM.html
23-07-2020||India||UK envoy raises concerns over China’s actions||New DelhiChina’s actions around the globe, including imposing a national security law in Hong Kong and the border standoff with India, are a challenge for the world community and Britain will work with partners to call out violations of international law, UK high commissioner Philip Barton said on Thursday.Following its exit from the European Union (EU), the UK will focus on health care, a long-term agenda for green growth and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and trade and investment while strengthening its ties with India, Barton said during his first news briefing after presenting his credentials.“There are challenges around the world on all sorts of Chinese actions, for us Hong Kong particularly is a focus, clearly for India the LAC (Line of Actual Control) is a particular focus,” he said.“These are concerning things and our hope would be that there can be de-escalation, and tensions do seem to have eased over the last week or two after the tragic loss of lives,” he said, referring to the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a clash with Chinese forces along the LAC on June 15.Barton welcomed progress by India and China in managing tensions and the commitment by the two Special Representatives on the border issue to disengage and de-escalate. “I hope we’re not about to see a change in that,” he said.Britain, he said, has its own concerns about a range of Chinese actions and has decided to remove Chinese technology giant Huawei’s equipment from all its telecommunications networks by 2027 because of concerns highlighted by the UK National Cyber Security Centre.“We don’t have a border with China but we have particular responsibilities for Hong Kong and the new national security law which China has imposed there, we see this as a very clear and serious violation of the UK-China joint declaration,” he said, referring to the agreement that laid out the administrative arrangement for Hong Kong when the former British colony was handed over to China in 1997.“We are very clear sighted about the challenges China presents in the region and around the world. We in the UK want to work with China and hope for positive, constructive engagement and strive for that...We welcome all partners who join us in calling out what is a serious violation of the UK-China joint declaration...,” Barton said.The UK also has “grave concerns” about human rights abuses, particularly against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, he added. Pointing specifically to Huawei’s role in 5G, he said the UK and India can work together to resolve such “wider global issues” and to diversify markets.Asked about the activities in the UK of Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan group banned by India, Barton declined to go into details but said Britain would act if any of its laws were violated.“In the UK, you have the right to protest and the right to freedom of speech is there but there are limits to it. Where people clearly break the law, we will take action. We have a dialogue with the Indian government across a range of issues of mutual interest and extremism of all kinds is one of those,” he said.Barton said there was no inconsistency between the Indian government projecting the country as an open destination for trade and investment while also working for self-reliance through the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiative. The two countries, he said, can work on making critical supply chains more resilient.“It’s perfectly possible for India to be an open trading economy and open to investments and international cooperation while also pursuing the [Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative] and wanting to manufacture in India and wanting to build manufacturing and other capacities and capability...I don’t see any inconsistency,” he said.Barton, a career diplomat with long experience of South Asia and India, advised the need for caution while responding to questions about the two countries cooperating on Covid-19 vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca backed vaccine that has shown encouraging results.He said it wasn’t known for certain if any of the vaccines would work, and the world community needs to keep backing a suite of potential vaccines till research reaches a stage where experts can be confident. Distribution of any successful vaccine would also be based on the ability of countries to pay for it and those needing subsidies, he added.India’s “fantastic vaccine capability” and the tie-up between the Serum Institute of India and AstraZeneca represent a “clear partnership with India” in this field, Barton said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-envoy-raises-concerns-over-china-s-actions/story-rt3dSBszYMpN0aNBii9oUL.html
23-07-2020||India||Curbs on procurement from border countries||New DelhiThe finance ministry on Thursday made an important amendment in its public finance rule that barred all government agencies to procure goods and services from bordering countries such as China and Pakistan on the ground of national security, two officials said, requesting anonymity. “The Government of India today amended the General Financial Rules (GFR) 2017 to enable imposition of restrictions on bidders from countries which share a land border with India on grounds of defence of India, or matters directly or indirectly related thereto including national security,” the finance ministry said in a statement. The GFR laws regulate all matters related to public finance.The order takes into its ambit all public sector companies, autonomous bodies and public-private partnership (PPP) projects receiving financial support from the government, it said. State government and its undertakings have been also directed to follow the suit.The Department of Expenditure, an arm of the finance ministry, issued two separate orders on late Thursday night. While the first order barred public procurements from countries sharing land-borders with India, the second gave exemptions to certain neighbours whom India offers lines of credit. According to the officials mentioned above, they could be neighbours such as Nepal and Bhutan.But the notifications did not mention names of any particular country or group of countries.Bidders from countries that are barred could bid in any procurement whether of goods, services, including consultancy services only if the bidder is registered with “the Competent Authority”, the statement said.“The Competent Authority for registration will be the Registration Committee constituted by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Political and security clearance from the Ministries of External and Home Affairs respectively will be mandatory,” it said.Relaxation has been provided in certain limited cases, including for procurement of medical supplies for containment of Covid-19 global pandemic till December 31, 2020.By a separate order, countries to which India extends lines of credit or provides development assistance have been exempted from the requirement of prior registration, the statement said.The new provisions will apply to all new tenders. In respect of tenders already invited, if the first stage of evaluation of qualifications has not been completed, bidders who are not registered under the new order will be treated as not qualified, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curbs-on-procurement-from-border-countries/story-1mQawKwSFrAZpAMNd9nTSO.html
23-07-2020||India||No extradition time frame in Vijay Mallya case: UK||New Delhi: The UK cannot give a timeframe for the extradition of businessman Vijay Mallya though the British government and courts are clear on their roles in preventing people from avoiding justice by moving across national borders, British high commissioner Philip Barton said on Thursday.Barton declined to answer a question during a virtual news briefing on whether Mallya had sought asylum in the UK, saying the British government never comments on individual asylum cases.“The UK government and the courts, [which] are independent of government, are absolutely clear around their roles in preventing people [from] avoiding justice by moving country. We are all determined to play our part in any case, and to make sure that we’re working together to ensure that criminals can’t escape justice by crossing national borders,” he said.Mallya’s extradition was ordered in February but “there is an ongoing legal case and I can’t comment any further on that and I can’t say anything at all about timescales”, Barton said. “The UK government understands the importance of the case,” he added.Last month, India said it had asked the UK not to consider any asylum request from Mallya, currently on bail pending his extradition, as there are no grounds for his persecution in the country. India has also said it has sought the early extradition of Mallya from the UK.The UK has so far only said a “confidential” legal issue was holding up Mallya’s extradition but that it was trying to deal with the matter as quickly as possible. Britain’s stance gave rise to speculation the 64-year-old businessman, wanted in India to face charges of financial irregularities, could have applied for asylum.Mallya lost his appeal against the 2018 order to extradite him in the UK high court in April. Last month, the high court also refused Mallya permission to appeal in the UK Supreme Court.He is wanted in India to face charges of financial offences involving Rs 9,000 crore borrowed by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines from several Indian banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-extradition-time-frame-in-vijay-mallya-case-uk/story-hmWDDslkVVhzxqoFUPxELM.html
23-07-2020||India||India accuses Pak of blocking review options||New Delhi India on Thursday accused Pakistan of blocking all avenues for an effective review of the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, sentenced to death for alleged involvement in spying, and said it reserved its rights to avail of further remedies.A day after the Pakistan government petitioned the Islamabad high court to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav for filing a review petition against his death sentence, the external affairs ministry charged Islamabad with systematically blocking access to the former naval officer, not providing documents related to his case and violating the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) order for a review of his conviction.“[Pakistan] has blocked all the avenues for an effective remedy available for India,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly briefing.“Pakistan has completely failed to provide the remedy as directed by the ICJ and India reserves its position in the matter, including its rights to avail of further remedies,” he said, without giving details.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India would take the next step after legal consultations. They didn’t preclude the possibility of again approaching the ICJ on Jadhav’s case.The Pakistan government promulgated an ordinance on May 20 to give foreign citizens convicted in the country the right to file a review petition in courts. The ordinance was aimed at complying with ICJ’s order for effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s conviction and sentencing by a Pakistani military court.But even here Pakistan’s actions had led to confusion, Srivastava said. Pakistan created confusion over the last date for filing a review petition, initially saying it was July 19 before changing the date to July 20. Pakistan took two weeks to inform India about the ordinance and shared the copy of it only after a request from New Delhi.India conveyed its concerns about “inadequacies and shortcomings in the ordinance” with Pakistan in June. It also informed Pakistan the ordinance “neither fulfils nor does it give complete weight to the judgment of the ICJ”, Srivastava said.India also made repeated requests to Pakistan to provide documents related to Jadhav’s case and was told they could be handed over only to an authorised Pakistani lawyer. “Thereafter, India appointed a Pakistani lawyer to obtain the relevant documents. To our surprise...when the authorised Pakistani lawyer approached the concerned authorities, they declined to hand over the documents to the lawyer,” he added.In the absence of unhindered consular access to Jadhav and the documents, the Indian side tried, as a last resort, to file a review petition in Islamabad high court on July 18. “However, our Pakistani lawyer [said] that a review petition could not be filed in the absence of power of attorney and supporting documents related to the case of Jadhav,” said Srivastava.Indian officials had walked out of a meeting with Jadhav on July 16 after Pakistan breached assurances about providing unimpeded consular access. “The meeting of consular officers with Jadhav on July 16 was scuttled by Pakistan authorities. The consular officers were instructed not to hand over any document to Jadhav. Hence, the officers could not obtain a power of attorney from Jadhav,” he said.Srivastava said Pakistan was “non-serious in its approach and was not interested in implementing the judgment of the ICJ in letter and spirit”. He added, “The whole exercise of not providing any documents related to the case even after repeated requests, not providing unimpeded consular access and some reported unilateral action of approaching the Islamabad high court on the part of Pakistan again exposes the farcical nature of Pakistan’s approach,” he said.Jadhav, 50, was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. In April 2017, Pakistan announced he had been sentenced to death by a military court.ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and stayed his execution while calling for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-accuses-pak-of-blocking-review-options/story-fwbfWHqrdOLgauwOiEZdbJ.html

The shuffle in the HRD panel comes at a crucial time when the Covid-19 pandemic has altered the traditional education landscape, forced millions of students to go online, deferred key competitive exams and also when the NDA government is set to unveil its new education policy.The newly-elected Rajya Sabha members were distributed seats in 23 of 24 department-related standing committees of Parliament on Thursday, months before its monsoon session is set to start. Indian Parliament has 24 standing committees of which eight are headed by Rajya Sabha members while the remaining 16 are led by lawmakers from the Lok Sabha. Every member is entitled to be a member of a standing committee. Seven panels—home affairs, agriculture, external affairs, finance, petroleum, science and technology and industry—got one new member each. The energy panel got the most (6), followed by 5 members each in the urban development and social justice panels.Nominated MP Gogoi is the lone new entrant in the foreign affairs panel, Pawar is accompanied by RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta and Congress’ Rajiv Satav in the defence committee which also has Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as its member. Former Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh got agriculture panel, former union coal minister Shibu Soren, who stepped down from the Manmohan Singh cabinet is in the coal and steel committee. CPIM’s Elamaram Kareem is in the finance panel and former railway minister and senior Trinamool Congress leader Dinesh Trivedi is in home affairs panel. While all new MPs (barring minister Ramdas Athawale), have been given berths in different panel, 16 MPs including former prime minister HD Devegowda will be allowed to participate in the panels only after taking their oath. Along with Scindia, BJP’s Bhubneswar Kalita, GK Vasan of Tamil Maanila Congress(M) and AIADMK’s M. Thambi Durai are in the HRD panel.Among the prominent BJP MPs, Sudhanshu Trivedi is in the energy panel, Ashok Gasti in social justice and empowerment, Arun Singh in water resources, Roopa Ganguly in food and consumer affairs and Sanajaoba Leishemba in science and technology panel.Among the prominent Congress leaders, Mallikarjun Kharge is in commerce, Digvijaya Singh in urban development, KC Venugopal is in transport, tourism and culture, Shaktisinh Gohil in Information Technology and Deepender Singh in law and justice committee.Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi is in the commerce panel.Even as the pending vacancies in the panels are filled up, the industry committee will not be able to sit as its chairman, K Kesava Rao, could not take oath on Wednesday, when 45 of 61 new members including 36 first timers were administered oath. A senior Rajya Sabha official said, “if a member has not taken oath, he can’t participate in the business of the House and panels are an extension of the House.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-cji-gogoi-scindia-enter-key-house-panels-in-rejig/story-hPidrZPGxN69HqHkPnROQN.html

23-07-2020||India||Piyush Goyal calls for building trust for trade at BRICS meeting||Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal called upon BRICS nations to enhance transparency in trade and build trust to prevent losing their role of preeminent trade partner. Goyal’s comments came during the 10th meeting of trade ministers attended by member countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—on Thursday.“It is trust and transparency which determines the sustainability of global supply chains and nations must demonstrate their compliance with global rules of trade to remain a part of global trade flow. Increasingly, nations which trust each other are coming together to build global supply chains with corresponding investments in manufacturing and services,” a commerce ministry statement said, quoting Goyal.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, had highlighted the importance of trust in building trade relations between countries during his address at India Ideas Summit organized by the USIBC forum on Wednesday.Referring to Covid-19 outbreak and its impact on the economy, he said trade can be an engine of reviving growth premised on strengthening of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) based on its principles of openness, fairness, transparency, inclusivity, and non-discrimination.He called for removing multiple hurdles to accessing medicines at affordable prices created by lopsided WTO rules for protecting intellectual property. “IPRs [intellectual property rights] should not block access to critical medicines and other devices required for the treatment of disease,” he said.Goyal said the pandemic has paradoxically provided nations a window of opportunity to add strength by building capacities, expanding manufacturing as well as by plugging into the global value chains. “As BRICS members are among the most affected countries in the world, we must collectively demonstrate a determined will to emerge stronger, while being prepared to face any such unknown crisis,” he said.The multilateral rules-based trading system is facing serious and grave challenges, including a spate of unilateral measures and countermeasures, deadlock in key areas of negotiations and an impasse in the appellate body, the minister said.Also Read: Northeast has potential to become India’s growth engine: PM Narendra ModiHe said the WTO reform process should take into account the existing realities in the world and should, therefore, be inclusive, balanced and consensus based, leading to prosperity for all.“It is disheartening that we are seeing some proposals at the WTO seeking to ride on the pandemic for pursuing commercial ends. It will essentially support the quest of developed countries’ firms to have unhindered access to the markets in developing countries, while putting constraints on developing countries to establish domestic manufacturing capacities,” he said.Describing 2020 as a turning point in the history of multilateralism, especially for the BRICS grouping, the minister said that any economic partnership must keep in mind the different size and population of each country, unequal levels of economic development and human development indicators, contrasting levels of prosperity, cultural diversity and significantly different political and judicial systems.“We place humanity at the centre of our global engagement and thus despite being hit hard by the virus ourselves, we have not shied away from providing humanitarian relief to those who sought it,” he said. India provided critical medical supplies to around 150 countries in these troubled times.As the ‘Pharmacy of the World’ we have catered to the spike in demand for drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine and Paracetamol being used for the treatment of Covid-19, he added.Talking about India’s proactive role in assessing and dealing with the challenges caused by the pandemic, he said saving lives has been India’s highest priority.“Despite being home to nearly 17% of the world population, we have only 8% of Covid-19 affected patients worldwide. Under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime minister Narendra Modi, we implemented one of the severest lockdowns at an early stage thereby breaking the coronavirus transmission chain and prepared the country to become self-reliant in covid care facilities,” he said.“We have done significantly better than many other countries, with a lower death rate and higher recovery rate,” he added.Speaking about the steps taken to mitigate the economic challenges posed by the pandemic and bringing the economy back on track, Goyal said the Prime Minister announced a stimulus package of over $300 billion, called ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-reliant India Initiative). He said the edifice of this mission stands on five pillars of the economy -- massive infrastructure building, technology, aspects of good governance, leveraging the demographic dividend, and promoting demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/piyush-goyal-calls-for-building-trust-for-trade-at-brics-meeting/story-hdtpkhAmSpSQ4niUJiwInL.html
23-07-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling: After Customs, NIA questions CM Vijayan’s former secretary||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the gold smuggling case on Thursday grilled Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar. He was suspended from service last week after his alleged link with one of the accused in the case Swapna Suresh surfaced.He was interrogated by the Customs department for nine hours on July 14. He was instrumental in getting a key post for Suresh in Kerala Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT department. She allegedly used her proximity with the powerful principal secretary to dabble in corridors of power.There are reports that he arranged a flat just outside the secretariat for the husband of Swapna Suresh and another accused PS Sarith. The accused had later used this flat for their smuggling activities. Sivasankar had earlier told the Customs that he arranged this over friendship and he did not know about their illegal activities. A senior IAS officer, he was the CM’s blue-eyed boy and was instrumental in bringing many IT and social projects to the state. In another development, the NIA has sought the CCTV footage of the state secretariat and sent a letter to chief secretary Biswas Mehta in this regard. Earlier, when customs sought this, his office had told them that the cameras developed snags during lightening in May. The NIA has also sought details of the service provider.When asked about this, the CM did not give a direct reply. “Let the NIA carry out its investigation. Its probe is going in the right direction. Why do you want to jump the gun,” he retorted. But the opposition has stepped up pressure on him. “The probe has reached the office of the CM. He has no moral responsibility to remain in power,” said BJP state president K Surendran. Congress state chief Mullappally Ramachandran also sought his resignation. The gold smuggling case came to light on July 5 when PS Sarith, a former employee of the UAE consulate in the state capital, was arrested when he went to receive a consignment in the name of an official of the consulate. Later, 30 kg of gold was retrieved from the consignment. Five days later, Swapna Suresh, a senior IT official and her friend Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru. Later the case was handed over to the NIA.The Customs department has deferred the transfer of key officials who are investigating the gold smuggling case following an outrage. The Union Home Ministry has also expressed serious reservations over the issue saying such a controversy should have been avoided when the investigation was going in the right track, a senior official familiar with the development said.The sudden transfer of six superintendents and two inspectors attached with Kochi unit of the Customs who are part of the ongoing investigation was issued by Mohammad Yousaf, Commissioner of Customs, late on Wednesday. After the issue triggered a controversy the Customs department made it clear that it was a routine transfer and it had been deferred for the time being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-after-customs-nia-questions-cm-vijayan-s-former-secretary/story-NyJnPWBmR7E4TxMuEeZx5M.html
23-07-2020||India||Kamal Nath writes to PM Modi, alleges govts in opposition-ruled states being toppled||Former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Kamal Nath has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging the federal structure of the country is being hit with attempts to topple governments in opposition ruled states.“The Indian republic has a special place in the world due to its federal structure but for some time now, Baba Saheb’s (Ambedkar) feelings are getting hurt as India’s federal structure is being attacked. The governments in opposition ruled states are being brought down immorally,” the letter put out by ANI says.Kamal Nath’s letter comes in the backdrop of alleged attempts to topple the Congress government in Rajasthan amid allegations of BJP’s involvement in the purported plot to fan dissidence in state Congress led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. The BJP has, however, said the allegations were aimed to distract from an internal crisis in the Congress party.Also Read: Ashok Gehlot asks for testing ‘horse trading’ audio clips in US, escalates attack on BJP ministerIn his letter, Kamal Nath also refers to his government’s fall in Madhya Pradesh earlier this year and alleges senior BJP leaders from the state took Congress rebels to Bengaluru with an aim to topple his government even as the state was busy fighting the coronavirus pandemic.“The act of pulling down Madhya Pradesh government is one of the most despicable events in India’s democratic history,” the letter says.He also alleges that BJP continues to entice opposition MLAs into resigning from their parties before inducting them. He further suggests that the present political turmoil could have a link with the Centre.“My worries are not limited to the falling of the Congress government in the state. Country’s democratic system is undergoing a turmoil today and it is suspected that it could be centered in the capital. But I hope that this suspicion is proven to be without a basis and that you will come forward to save the falling prestige of India’s democracy,” he says in the letter.Kamal Nath’s letter comes on a day when another Congress MLA quit the party and joined the BJP in Madhya Pradesh, taking the total number of party MLAs to have quit the party in the last two weeks to three.

At an online media briefing, MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said another round of diplomatic talks under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) is expected to be scheduled soon. “The maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is the basis of our bilateral relationship,” he said. “Therefore it is our expectation that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas at the earliest as agreed to by the Special Representatives,” Srivastava added. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a nearly two-hour-long telephonic conversation on July 5 to bring down tension between the armies of the two countries in eastern Ladakh. Both sides began the disengagement process from July 6 following the talks between Doval and Wang who were Special Representatives for the boundary question. “We have also made it clear that India is fully committed to observing and respecting the LAC and that we will not accept any unilateral attempts to change the status quo along the LAC,” said Srivastava. He said the two sides have agreed during the conversation of the Special Representatives to work towards complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC and de-escalation from India-China border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquillity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maintenance-of-peace-along-lac-basis-of-bilateral-relationship-with-china-india/story-jDhpEQb7BYUdQNO9Oc5G4O.html

The rejig in the HRD panel comes at a crucial time when the Covid-19 pandemic has altered the traditional education landscape, forced millions of students to go online, deferred key competitive exams and also when the NDA government is set to unveil its new education policy.The newly-elected Rajya Sabha members have been distributed seats in all 24 department-related standing committees of Parliament on Thursday, days before its monsoon session is set to begin. This round of allotment of panel seats to the MPs also come when the Covid-19 pandemic, India-China border tensions, economic situation, migrant labourers are raging issues of debate in the country. The Indian Parliament has 24 standing committees of which 8 are headed by Rajya Sabha members while the remaining 16 are led by lawmakers from Lok Sabha. Every member is entitled to be a member of a standing committee. Seven panels—home affairs, agriculture, external affairs, finance, petroleum, science and technology and industry—got one new member each. And energy panel got the maximum allotment (6), followed by 5 members each in urban development and social justice panels.Nominated MP Gogoi is the lone new entrant in the foreign affairs panel, Pawar is accompanied by RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta and Congress’ Rajiv Satav in the defence committee which also has Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as its member. Former Union Coal Minister Shibu Soren, who had stepped down from the Manmohan Singh cabinet after an arrest warrant was issued, is now part of the coal and steel committee. CPI(M)’s Elamaram Kareem has been given the finance panel whose chairmanship was taken away from the Congress last year.

A senior Rajya Sabha official said, “If a member has not taken oath, he can’t participate in the business of the House and panels are an extension of the House.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ranjan-gogoi-in-external-affairs-panel-pawar-in-defence-scindia-gets-hrd-in-house-panel-rejig/story-HrXzloiV3SB9Rn3F4kEF0M.html
23-07-2020||India||Head of famous Rishikesh ashram, Chidanand Saraswati booked for encroachment of forest land||Uttarakhand forest department has filed a case against Swami Chidanand Saraswati, president and spiritual head of famous Parmarth Niketan Ashram in Rishikesh, for alleged encroachment and construction in 2.5 acres of forest land within Dehradun forest division near Rajaji National Park, said forest officials.The development follows directions by the Uttarakhand High Court on July 6 and July 15 while hearing a PIL filed by one Pauri Garhwal based Archana Shukla, alleging encroachment of forest land near Rajaji National Park by Swami Chidanand Saraswati.Jai Raj, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) Uttarakhand, said a case against Muni Chidanand Saraswati, who heads the famous Parmarth Niketan Ashram in Rishikesh, has been filed for alleged encroachment and construction over 2.5 acres (.999 hectare) of forest land within Dehradun forest division. He said the case has been filed under section 26 of the Indian Forest Act 1927.Section 26 in the Indian Forest Act, 1927 deals with acts prohibited in forests including setting fire to a reserved forest, felling of trees, stone quarrying, clearing or breaking up any forest land for cultivation or any other purpose, erecting any building or construction and so on.Divisional forest officer (DFO) Dehradun also submitted an affidavit in the high court a few days back listing the action taken so far and what further action would be taken in the case. HT has seen a copy of the counter affidavit filed by the state government.A senior forest department official, privy to the developments, said on the condition of anonymity that after the high court had issued directions in December last year, they had taken possession of the 2.5 acre encroached land by Swami Chidanand Saraswati, in March. Earlier this month on July 6 and later on July 15, HC asked what subsequent action the forest department had taken in the matter.“We booked Swami Chidanand Saraswati, under section 26 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 (H2 case) and appointed an inquiry officer who will give his report on the matter. Range officer Rishikesh has been appointed as the inquiry officer. Based on his inquiry report, further action like determining the time period for which the forest land had been under encroachment, the penalty that needs to be imposed and the amount of compensation will be decided,” the official mentioned above said.According to the affidavit filed by the forest department, the inquiry officer will investigate for how long Swami Chidanand Saraswati was in unauthorised possession of the said forest land and the period of illegal occupation will be taken into account for calculation of compensation and subsequent imposition of penalty by DFO Dehradun.Vinay Kumar, who represents Swami Chidanand Saraswati, said the land had been donated by the villagers and part of it was bought from some people before 2005.“The land was around one hectare. We set up a Gurukul there and had plans to set up a school. But when we came to know that it was forest land, we immediately applied online for a lease of the land, which is still pending. When the case was filed in HC, we stopped the Gurukul in February and handed over the land to the forest department,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/head-of-famous-rishikesh-ashram-chidanand-saraswati-booked-for-encroachment-of-forest-land/story-jmN5r0x9cQOQmNgtL8pe1K.html

The man was identified as Kadar Hussain, a resident of Jaora town, about 40 kilometres from Ratlam district headquarters. He is already facing two theft cases lodged earlier, police said. A video of the brutal beating went viral on social media on Thursday prompting the police to conduct an inquiry into it but by then Kadar had been booked under the Arms Act and sent to jail.In the three-minute video clip Hussain’s hands are seen tied behind a pick-up truck and people beating him up with sticks. Those beating him are heard asking him to confess that he had stolen garlic from the market.City superintendent of police (CSP) of Jaora P S Ranawat said, “A group of people handed over Kadar Hussain to Jaora police station. They had also recovered a knife from his. After an inquiry he was arrested under section 25 of the Arms Act. Later, he was sent to jail.” Ranawat said, “Since the video has come to light now I have asked Jaora police station to identify the people who beat him up. We will take action according to findings in the probe.” This is the second incident within a week in Madhya Pradesh in which people have taken the law in their hands and beat up an alleged thief in public. Last week, a 30-year-old man was mercilessly beaten in Guna for allegedly trying to steal a pesticide packet.

23-07-2020||India||Forest officer in MP transferred after complaint against BJP lawmaker||A forest range officer posted in Nauradehi sanctuary in Bundelkhand region in Madhya Pradesh was transferred within a fortnight of lodging a complaint with police against a BJP MLA.Madhya Pradesh’s principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) said the transfer on Wednesday was in the interest of the officer.Forest officer Tilak Singh Raipuria in his complaint lodged with sub-divisional officer of police (SDoP) at Tendukheda in Damoh district on July 10 accused BJP MLA Dharmendra Singh Lodhi of abusing and threatening him with dire consequences for taking action against two persons who were caught fishing in a prohibited area in the forest.The forest officer was transferred on Wednesday to Sheopur which is about 500 km away from Nauradehi.In his complaint to the police, the forest officer had said, “Pankaj Vishwas and Ramkishun Chakraborty of village Sarra were arrested on July 10,2020 under sections 9, 27, 29, 50, 51 (2) of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. I got a call to set them free. The caller introduced himself as Jabera MLA Dharmendra Singh Lodhi who inquired with me as to who had been arrested. When I told him the arrested man was some Doctor saheb who was hunting he said he had received a number of complaints against me and that if I didn’t release the man I would face dire consequences. He used abusive language against me.” Requesting the police to take necessary action, the officer said in the complaint, “MLA Dharmedra Singh Lodhi exerted pressure on me to let go a criminal and also threatened that he would gherao me with 1,000 people. While there was obstruction in discharging my duties as a government servant, I face a threat to my life.” An audio clip went viral on social media in which a man introducing himself as the MLA from Jabera constituency Dharmedra Lodhi is heard using abusive language against the officer Tilak Singh and threatening him. Lodhi, as heard in the clip, wanted no action against the fishing accused ‘doctor’ while the officer stood his ground.The MLA, however, denied that he used abusive language against the officer or threatened him and said there were numerous complaints of excesses against him that he had received from local villagers. When contacted after his transfer Tilak Singh said, “I take it not as a punishment posting but routine administrative exercise in the department.”Divisional conservator of forest at Sagar, Naveen Garg said, “There was no recommendation from my side for the transfer of the ranger officer.” Principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) Rajesh Shrivastava said, “We had received a complaint from the MLA which had in it statements and affidavits of some villagers too. We had sent an officer to conduct an inquiry into the complaint. The officer was transferred based on the inquiry report. We found that the atmosphere over there was against him. Hence, the transfer was effected in his interest.” (With input from Anupam Pateriya in Sagar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forest-officer-in-mp-transferred-after-complaint-against-bjp-lawmaker/story-frPwWXvEHa3O1HSG3L3duK.html
23-07-2020||India||IAF eyes new smart weapon for Rafale jets amid border row with China||Stuck in a seemingly intractable border dispute with China in eastern Ladakh, India is looking at arming its new Rafale fighter jets with an all-weather smart weapon of French origin that will allow combat pilots to engage ground targets from a standoff range of up to 60 km, people familiar with the developments said on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity.The Indian Air Force is likely to initiate the purchase of Hammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) using emergency financial powers granted to the military by the government at a time of heightened military tensions with China, said one of the officials cited above.The IAF will induct its first batch of five Rafale jets imported from France at the Ambala air base on July 29. The air force could deploy the new fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, officials previously indicated to Hindustan Times.The Hammer, consisting of a guidance kit and a range extension kit fitted on a standard bomb of the Mk80 series, is manufactured by French defence firm Safran. The Hammer purchase will necessitate the import of Mk80 series bombs that can later be manufactured in India, said a second official.The other weapons that the Rafale jets will be armed with include Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles.While India initiated discussions with France to buy Hammer two to three years ago, the current border tensions with China have lent fresh urgency to the procurement, said a third official. “Enhancement of capability, especially under the present circumstances, will serve the IAF well. Efforts should be made to fast-track the purchase,” said Air Chief Marshal Fali H Major (retd), a former IAF chief.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to plug gaps in the IAF’s combat capabilities. The jets have been specially tailored for IAF.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases including Leh, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions – ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. It can carry more than nine tonnes of weapons on as many as 14 hard-points.The two Rafale squadrons will be based at Ambala in Haryana and Hasimara in West Bengal, covering the western and eastern fronts.Acting on a special request by the IAF, France has accelerated the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India --- five jets are coming to Ambala instead of four that were originally planned to be delivered in the first batch.According to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected by April-May 2022. Future deliveries will also be expedited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-eyes-new-smart-weapon-for-rafale-jets-amid-border-row/story-zbUjRqL6bjXGdagWPswaOM.html

23-07-2020||India||Pakistan has blocked review of Kulbhushan Jadhav’s case, says India||India on Thursday accused Pakistan of blocking all avenues for an effective review of the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, sentenced to death for alleged involvement in spying, and said it reserved its rights to avail of further remedies.A day after the Pakistan government petitioned the Islamabad high court to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav for filing a review petition against his death sentence, the external affairs ministry charged Islamabad with systematically blocking access to the former naval officer, not providing documents related to his case and violating the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) order for a review of his conviction.“[Pakistan] has blocked all the avenues for an effective remedy available for India,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly briefing.“Pakistan has completely failed to provide the remedy as directed by the ICJ and India reserves its position in the matter, including its rights to avail of further remedies,” he said, without giving details.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India would take the next step after legal consultations. They didn’t preclude the possibility of again approaching the ICJ on Jadhav’s case.The Pakistan government promulgated an ordinance on May 20 to give foreign citizens convicted in the country the right to file a review petition in courts. The ordinance was aimed at complying with ICJ’s order for effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s conviction and sentencing by a Pakistani military court.But even here Pakistan’s actions had led to confusion, Srivastava said. Pakistan created confusion over the last date for filing a review petition, initially saying it was July 19 before changing the date to July 20. Pakistan took two weeks to inform India about the ordinance and shared the copy of it only after a request from New Delhi.India conveyed its concerns about “inadequacies and shortcomings in the ordinance” with Pakistan in June. It also informed Pakistan the ordinance “neither fulfils nor does it give complete weight to the judgment of the ICJ”, Srivastava said.India also made repeated requests to Pakistan to provide documents related to Jadhav’s case and was told they could be handed over only to an authorised Pakistani lawyer. “Thereafter, India appointed a Pakistani lawyer to obtain the relevant documents. To our surprise...when the authorised Pakistani lawyer approached the concerned authorities, they declined to hand over the documents to the lawyer,” he added.In the absence of unhindered consular access to Jadhav and the documents, the Indian side tried, as a last resort, to file a review petition in Islamabad high court on July 18. “However, our Pakistani lawyer [said] that a review petition could not be filed in the absence of power of attorney and supporting documents related to the case of Jadhav,” said Srivastava.Indian officials had walked out of a meeting with Jadhav on July 16 after Pakistan breached assurances about providing unimpeded consular access. “The meeting of consular officers with Jadhav on July 16 was scuttled by Pakistan authorities. The consular officers were instructed not to hand over any document to Jadhav. Hence, the officers could not obtain a power of attorney from Jadhav,” he said.Srivastava said Pakistan was “non-serious in its approach and was not interested in implementing the judgment of the ICJ in letter and spirit”. He added, “The whole exercise of not providing any documents related to the case even after repeated requests, not providing unimpeded consular access and some reported unilateral action of approaching the Islamabad high court on the part of Pakistan again exposes the farcical nature of Pakistan’s approach,” he said.Jadhav, 50, was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. In April 2017, Pakistan announced he had been sentenced to death by a military court.The ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and stayed his execution while calling for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-has-blocked-review-of-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-case-says-india/story-LBTSYmt3I9QFaPbr0yr6cI.html
23-07-2020||India||Railways to begin contactless ticketing via QR codes, airport-like check in at stations soon||Indian Railways will begin a contactless ticketing system with QR code enabled ticket scanning across its stations, along airport-like check in counters for passengers, according to officials aware of the development.Passengers will get an SMS with a QR code and URL after booking their tickets online and at the railway station the TTE will scan the displayed QR code followed by which the details of the passenger will automatically be linked across the station’s data base.“We have introduced a QR code system which will be given on tickets. If one buys online the code will be given on the ticket, even on window tickets, and SMS will be generated and sent on the mobile phone which will have a link and it will show the QR code when the link is touched. Then the TTE at stations or on trains who either with their hand held equipment or on their mobile phones will be able to scan the code and immediately capture details of the passengers,” Railway Board chairman VK Yadav said at a press conference on Thursday.The option of QR codes will also be given to passengers buying tickets from the counter. Yadav also said nearly 85% of railway tickets were being booked online, at present.“It is not possible to shift completely to a paper-less ticketing across stations right now as there are still some passengers who do not use smartphones,” he added.Out of the 230 special passenger trains that are currently operating, 42 trains have an overall occupancy of 75-100% while around 40 are running at less than 30% occupancy and overall the trains are operating at an occupancy of 75%. Yadav said six trains in total have been cancelled following the request of state governments.Railways have already begun using QR code scanning at one division at Prayagraj on a pilot basis, officials said.“Airport-like check-in counters have also been made to minimize the exposure of our checking staff with the passengers,” an official said.“As a passenger enters the station premises, the QR code of his /her ticket will be scanned through a mobile app and this gets updated in the software’s database. The time of scanning the QR code also gets updated in the application…there will also be integrated checking kiosks with facilities for scanning the QR code of passenger tickets and thermal screening to get body temperature,” the official said.At Prayagraj division, onboard checking staff is also provided display modules with information on coaches and berths and total number of tickets issued.Railways is also planning to use a dashboard to know expected passengers for boarding at any time with the aim of deploying suitable number of checking staff and enable crowd management measures. “This will help in proper crowd management at the station. This information will update in real time mode,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-to-begin-contactless-ticketing-via-qr-codes-airport-like-check-in-at-stations-soon/story-pG8LVWLol8fQYrkahx1PdM.html

23-07-2020||India||Odisha reports 1,000+ Covid-19 cases for second consecutive day||A day after Odisha reported more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases, it again reported a similar number of cases including Covid hotspot of Ganjam and Khurda, but state government continued to insist that the situation in Odisha was better than other states.The 1,264 positive cases that the state reported in last 24 hours was its highest single day surge so far taking the total to 21,099. It was the second time when it reported more than 1,000 cases on a single day. While the state took 114 days to record its first 10,000 cases, it took just 15 days to register the next 10,000 cases. The spike of last 2 days has pushed the daily growth rate to 6 though it had remained under 5 for last 12 days. The surge in cases and comparative lower recovery meant the recovery rate has now come down to 65 per cent from more than 70% a week ago.Of the 1,264 cases, 540 were reported from Ganjam district alone where over 99 per cent of the cases were reported from local community while in Khurda district a record 137 cases were reported fuwlled by large number of infections in a flour mill. In Bhubaneswar city under Khurda district, 61 workers in a flour mill have tested positive in last 2 days.Making light of the surging cases, additional chief secretary of health department, PK Mohapatra said the numbers are rising as the government was aggressive in testing. “No State has been able to reverse the trend of the rising number of cases. We are chasing the virus from house to house. That is why cases are increasing in Odisha. The Covid recovery rate in she State is 65% and case fatality rate is 0.54%. We have 37.20 per cent of beds in Covid treatment facilities across Odisha are occupied. The district collectors have been asked to make an assessment of their medical infrastructure requirement for next 5 months,” said Mohapatra, urging for home isolation of asymptomatic patients both in rural and urban areas as over 70% cases reported in Odisha are asymptomatic.The health secretary said Odisha government has a stock of 4 lakh antigen kits and enough stock of PPEs, sanitizers and medicine for at least four months. “We are conducting RT-PCR tests in 19 labs and would add 6 more labs. The focus is on both RT-PCR and antigen tests,” he said.In Bhubaneswar, the civic body said there was little risk of community transmission of the virus as the first round of sero-surveillance showed community level exposure to SARS Cov2 very low. Of the 951 samples drawn by ICMR in Bhubaneswar as part of its sero survey, only 1.42 per cent had exposure to the virus. “This implies that large scale transmission has probably not occured in the city. Hence it ethical not to pass on or disseminate panic messages. But a large majority of the population is still susceptible to the infection,” said a BMC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-reports-1-000-covid-19-cases-for-second-consecutive-day/story-lKmsxkFo5bLZ00K9TAtOzI.html
23-07-2020||India||5 months after SC verdict, Defence Ministry issues order granting Permanent Commission to women||Five months after the Supreme Court ruled that Short Service Commissioned (SSC) women officers in the Indian Army are entitled to permanent commission (PC), the Defence Ministry on Thursday issued a formal sanction letter for granting PC to them, opening doors for women in a male-dominated force.The order will pave the way for “empowering women officers to shoulder larger roles in the organisation,” an army spokesperson said. A selection board will assemble soon to pick women for PC.The order specifies grant of PC to SSC women officers in 10 streams --- Army Air Defence (AAD), Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME), Army Service Corps (ASC), Army Ordnance Corps (AOC), and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General (JAG) and Army Educational Corps (AEC).“In anticipation, the Army Headquarters had set in motion a series of preparatory actions for conduct of the Permanent Commission Selection Board for affected women officers,” the army said in statement. The board will be scheduled as soon as the SSC women officers exercise their option and complete the requisite documentation.“It is wonderful to finally see this. I am elated,” said senior counsel Aishwarya Bhati, who had appeared for petitioners in Supreme Court.The army is committed to provide equal opportunities to all personnel including women officers to serve the country, the statement added.“As they say ‘a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.’ The government needs to be lauded for this leap. The equity has been achieved, however, equality still remains a goal to strive for,” said Wing Commander Anupama Joshi (retd), from the first batch of women officers commissioned into the IAF in the early 1990s. She said the army should allow women in combat roles too.The SC on February 17 ruled that SSC women officers in the army are entitled to PC and they have to be considered irrespective of their service length.The policy of the Centre in this regard to restrict PC to SSC women officers with less than 14 years of service was held to be violative of the Right to Equality by the apex court. It also held that there cannot be an absolute bar on women being considered for command appointments.The judgement was delivered on a petition by the defence ministry challenging a 2010 judgment of the Delhi high court which had ruled that SSC women officers in the army and air force should be granted PC at par with male SSC officers.The central government had issued a notification in this regard in February 2019 granting PC to SSC officers of the army. However, as per its proposal, only SSC women officers with up to 14 years of service were to be considered for PC.The Centre got a one-month extension on July 7 to implement the SC’s path-breaking decision to grant PC to women officers. Citing the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, the Centre moved an application before the apex court to extend the deadline by another six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-months-after-sc-verdict-defence-ministry-issues-order-granting-permanent-commission-to-women/story-XNsjTEuZcLePvVPISf0BMP.html

They claimed that he was brutally assaulted by a mob because he was caught stealing and had also registered a case against eight purported members of the mob.On Thursday, a government lawyer supported the ACP’s stand.She informed the two-member HC bench, comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Anuja Prabhudessai, that in terms of earlier court order she had personally viewed the closed-circuit TV (CCTV) footage that captured the incident of the assault on the deceased, but did not find any mob assaulting him.“Only the four policemen are seen to have used fiber lathis in a bid to discipline the deceased,” she said.She, however, added that further investigation was required to ascertain, if the deceased, indeed, succumbed to the injuries caused because of the use of the fiberglass lathis by the erring policemen.She was responding to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by lawyer and human rights activist Firdause Irani, raising concerns about police excesses during enforcement of the nationwide lockdown restrictions.Besides pointing out the assault on him, his wife and two sons by a team of policemen and civic body personnel outside his house in Goregaon (West), Irani has also highlighted a report of a human rights organisation that had revealed that a total of 15 people, including two from Mumbai, had lost their lives across the country due to police brutalities during the lockdown.Devendra was one of the Mumbai victims.According to the report, Devendra’s family members have alleged that on March 30, when they were going to meet a relative, a police team chased them and caught the deceased. The police personnel, the report added, informed the relatives that they were taking Devendra to Juhu police station, but in the morning they were informed by the police that he was lying at Nehru Nagar Chowk. He was declared brought dead on arrival, when his relatives took him to a hospital. The investigation into the case was entrusted with the ACP, Bandra division, in view of the allegations against the police personnel.On Thursday, HC, however, noted that two important witnesses in the case, Devendra’s mother and the brother did not co-operate with the investigation and though necessary, their statements were not recorded to date.Taking note of this anomaly, the bench has directed the ACP to issue fresh notices to them and make an endeavour to get their statements recorded by August 5.The second case pertained to the death of a porter, Sagir Jamal Khan, who was allegedly caught by police on April 18, when he was driving a handcart to deliver a refrigerator in Null Bazaar locality.The on-duty police personnel hit him on his head, hand and back.Later in the day, Khan suddenly collapsed while having dinner, and was declared brought dead on arrival, when he was taken to a hospital.According to the police, his post-mortem examination report has revealed that he died due to the enlargement of the heart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-policemen-assaulted-22-yr-old-whose-death-was-portrayed-as-a-mob-lynching-case-acp-informs-hc/story-3JdGfQQCifNaZDKD5eKC0O.html

Local transmission accounted for 70 per cent of news cases, the CM said adding it was a worrying factor.With 1,078 new virus cases total climbed to 16,110. Five deaths were also reported taking the death toll to 52. Out of 16,110 cases live cases are 9,458 and recovered 6,596. On Wednesday the state had reported 1,038 cases. The state capital Thiruvananthapuram is worst hit with more than 2,000 active cases. Many areas in coastal belt are under triple lockdown.The government has also decided to postpone one-day special session of the assembly called on July 27 in view of the serious pandemic situation prevailing in the state capital, said Vijayan. “The coming week is really critical for the state. Surge in locally-transmitted cases is really worrying. We need to step up our vigil and our future depends upon the correct steps we take today,” he said adding serious breach in restrictions led to sudden increase in cases. In view of rising cases, he said Muslim religious leaders have agreed not to conduct mass prayers during Eid al-Adha falling on July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharp-increase-in-daily-covid-19-cases-worries-kerala/story-HphYMBLtRkccrP5Zp9jHPJ.html

It caught fire two weeks later killing two firefighters and damaging over a dozen houses and has been blazing since then.“Work at the site resumed on Thursday. Personnel from OIL and other agencies are at the site and final preparation for placing the capping stack is underway,” Jayant Bormudoi, senior manager (corporate communication) OIL, said.Works related to plugging the well like excavation of ramps and cellar, opening of wellhead flange and six high discharge water pumps needed to spray water to the wellhead while capping operation is underway, are ready at the site, OIL said in a statement.“The three experts from Alert, (the Singapore-based firm engaged by OIL to plug the blow out) who sustained minor burn injury on Wednesday while removing the tubing head spool, are doing perfectly all right,” the statement said.According to OIL officials, work on plugging the blow out and putting out the fire are at a final stage and are expected to be over within the next few days.“The next task is to reinstall the blow out preventer (BOP), a three-ton equipment, on the well head. Once the BOP is placed, it is described as capping of the well. That will be followed by killing of the blow out,” OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika said.He informed that capping doesn’t mean that the gas will stop coming out of the well and the fire will be extinguished immediately. A valve on the BOP will inject a fluid inside the well, which will neutralize the pressure of the well slowly and push the gas back from the well into the reservoir.“The operation between capping of the well and killing the blow out can take 2-3 days. The gas was being drawn from a depth of around 3.5 km so the fluid has to fill up that entire column,” Hazarika said.The entire operation is expected to be over by the end of this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/work-on-capping-assam-gas-well-fire-resumes-day-after-explosion/story-TFnyRPCJTmM3b0wJx4rG8I.html

Some of those MLAs held hostage will also come and vote for us. We have a full majority and will come to the house with those numbers. We will prove the mandate,” said the CM.At the third Congress legislature party meeting this week, the CM impressed upon the MLAs to “stand like a rock”. He further added that neither the Congress nor the BJP wanted the assembly to be dissolved and election to take place. “The entire country is watching the way you’re fighting. Your respect has increased manifold. It’s not something ordinary,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier, contrasting the situation of his MLAs with those in team Pilot, the CM alleged that the latter were held against their wishes and have been calling him. The MLAs belonging to the Gehlot camp have been seen singing, doing yoga sessions and even trying their hand at cooking at the luxury resort in Jaipur where they have been sequestered.On the other hand, Team Pilot has been camping in the BJP-ruled Haryana. The Congress has so far claimed that 109 legislators are supporting the Ashok Gehlot government and insisted that the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) too had not yet sought a floor test. The BJP with 72 legislators has been watching the developments from the sidelines. The majority mark in the assembly stands at 101.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-to-call-assembly-session-soon-claims-majority/story-BeEAZnGUgRzpO8kTN3ycFO.html

23-07-2020||India||‘Appreciate Bangladesh’s stand’: India on Imran Khan raising Kashmir issue with Sheikh Hasina||India on Thursday stated that New Delhi appreciates Bangladesh’s consistent stand that Jammu and Kashmir and all its developments are India’s internal matters. The external affairs ministry’s statement was in context of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s attempt to discuss the situation in Jammu and Kashmir with his Bangladeshi counterpart in a telephonic conversation on Wednesday.“Our relations with Bangladesh are time tested and historic...We appreciate their consistent stand that Jammu and Kashmir and all its developments are India’s internal matters. It’s a stand they have always taken,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.According to a news report published by the Associated Press of Pakistan, Imran Khan called Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday and discussed the coronavirus situation in the two countries. He also invited her to visit Islamabad and drew her attention to the situation in Kashmir.He is reported to have “stressed the importance of peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute for a safe and prosperous region”.Khan also underscored the importance Pakistan attaches to closer ties with Bangladesh while underlining the significance of regular bilateral contacts and people to people exchanges, according to a PTI news report.Pakistan’s attempt to muster international support on the Jammu and Kashmir issue has increased since the Indian government abrogated Article 370 that granted special status to the region, and also bifurcated the erstwhile state into two union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh last year.Khan’s attempts to raise the issue at international forums such as the United Nations have been actively countered by India.Earlier today, the government noted another “historic” milestone in India-Bangladesh connectivity and economic partnership as the first ever container cargo from Kolkata via Chattogram port reached Agartala. External affairs ministry tweeted to say that this development will help in further development of the north eastern region.Union minister Mansukh Mandaviya had last week flagged off the first trial container ship from Kolkata carrying cargo meant for Agartala that reached the city via the Chattogram port in Bangladesh.India and Bangladesh have enhanced cooperation in shipping and inland water trade in the recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/appreciate-bangladesh-s-stand-india-on-imran-khan-raising-kashmir-issue-with-sheikh-hasina/story-97bmhhqVfLxCuDWiFvkZFO.html
23-07-2020||India||Pay cuts, compulsory leave can trigger ‘extreme acts’, say Air India pilots||Pay cuts and compulsory leave without pay scheme could have potentially disastrous psychological impact and lead to “desperate and extreme acts,” Air India’s executive pilots committee said on Thursday in a letter written to civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri.At least 60 pilots deployed in government’s Vande Bharat Mission flights have tested positive, the letter said, adding that at least one pilot has lost a family member to Covid-19 and those of many others have also been infected and appealed to the minister to rescind the decision to revise wages. “Our Association is also extremely concerned about the potentially disastrous psychological impact that the massive forced pay cuts and Compulsory Leave Without Pay scheme, may create on some employees. We shudder to think of the kind of desperate and extreme acts that could be triggered off because of the prevailing situation,” the letter said. Hindustan Times has reviewed a copy. The letter also cautioned against a litigation from employees. “As executives, we shall always support all acts and decisions that are financially prudent and serve the company’s best interests. Therefore, we believe that a rising stack of litigations and financial liabilities (contingent and current), arising out of pending financial dues owed to employees could potentially destroy our organization’s future health, and more so, would be unfairly transferred to any prospective buyer of Air India, in case the impending strategic disinvestment,” the letter added. The letter comes a week after the Air India board approved a leave without pay (LWP) scheme for its permanent employees for a period of six months to two years, which is extendable to up to five years. The national carrier had defended its decision last week stating that it was in a very challenging financial situation and is taking recourse to several initiatives with a view to ensuring the continuance of its operations.The airline has also decided to cut the pay of its cockpit and cabin crew with effect from April 1, 2020.“Recent decisions of Air India Board regarding rationalization of staff cost were reviewed in a meeting at the civil aviation ministry this evening. The meeting reiterated that unlike other carriers which have laid off large number of their employees, no employee of Air India will be laid off. There has been no reduction in the Basic pay, DA and HRA of any category of employees. The rationalization of allowances had to be implemented on account of the difficult financial condition of the airline that were exacerbated by Covid-19,” the airline said in a statement issued on Thursday.“Flying crew will be paid as per the actual number of hours flown. As domestic and international operations expand to reach pre-Covid levels and the financial position of Air India improves, the rationalization of allowances will be reviewed,” it added.The recent decision of the management adopting the compulsory leave without pay (LWP) model as well as the “massive wage cut” of the employees/Pilots emoluments has led to “serious discontentment and heartburn amongst the entire workforce”, the pilots said in their letter. “The world has acknowledged and lauded the invaluable contribution and sterling efforts of our Pilots as Corona Warriors during the Covid-19 outbreak. It was the will to respond to national call of duty, that got the Executive & other Pilots to think out of the box, to facilitate operations in the most difficult and challenging times, to keep the aircraft flying, and to keep our airline and its employees relevant, in an era plagued with bankruptcy and layoffs,” the letter said. The Air India’s pilot association the Indian Commercial Pilot Association on Monday also wrote to the national carrier’s management stating that changes in the wage settlement would be illegal and such a situation has the “potential to flare to an unprecedented magnitude.”At a press conference last Thursday, Air India chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal had said the national carrier is working on four fronts to reduce costs by reducing the debt, cutting on lease rentals, trimming staffing costs and reducing operating costs.The cost-cutting drive dovetails with a government plan to sell its entire stake in Air India amid increasing debt and mounting losses. The Centre, in January, started the process by releasing an information document for investors and offering access to financial and other data of Air India and its subsidiaries.The government’s entire stake in Air India, its 100% stake in low-cost subsidiary Air India Express Ltd. and 50% stake in ground handling unit Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited. are on offer.An attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw any bids. The airline’s accumulated debt is estimated to be more than Rs 69,000 crore. It posted a loss of Rs 8,556 crore in financial year 2018-19, as against a net loss of Rs 5,348 crore in the previous financial year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shudder-to-think-desperate-acts-pay-cuts-can-trigger-say-air-india-pilots/story-VcJvfvcEYOoKv6lLkWhPpL.html
23-07-2020||India||Another Congress MLA resigns from Madhya Pradesh assembly||The beleaguered Congress in Madhya Pradesh (MP) suffered another jolt on Thursday, when the third party lawmaker resigned from the state assembly in the past 12 days amid the rumblings of dissent that has rocked Ashok Gehlot-government in neighbouring Rajasthan.Narayan Patel (63), a Congress member of MP legislative assembly, who represents Mandhata assembly constituency in Khandwa district, is the third party legislator in 12 days to resign.Earlier, Pradyumn Singh Lodhi (52) and Sumitra Devi Kasdekar (36) had resigned from the state assembly and later joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Lodhi was promptly rewarded by the BJP, as hours after joining the party he was appointed the chairman of MP state civil supplies corporation. All the three Congress MLAs, who have resigned, were debutant lawmakers, who had won MP assembly polls in December 2018. MP Assembly’s Pro-tem Speaker Rameshwar Sharma said, “Narayan Patel tendered his resignation from the state assembly on Wednesday. I had asked him to take a final decision after giving it a thought. He confirmed on Thursday that he is willing to resign without any pressure on him or inducement.” Sharma made the announcement in presence of the MLA as a video was released to the media, where Patel was seen standing near the Pro-tem Speaker. Patel was unavailable for his comments, despite repeated attempts.Narendra Saluja, state Congress president Kamal Nath’s media coordinator, said, “The BJP has never been known to be a party with a difference. But, it is now overtly playing the dirty game of horse-trading in a bid to save its government as its leaders know the outcome of the assembly by-poll results. In a democracy, the ultimate judge is the public, who will certainly give a befitting reply to the BJP in the upcoming by-polls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-another-congress-mla-resigns-from-state-assembly/story-JetvbnFGnnFJFO8xuUKT3M.html

Both timing and day chosen for bhumi pujan are wrong,” Swaroopanand Saraswati said earlier Thursday. The Trust has fixed August 5 for bhumi poojan of the ram temple in Ayodhya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of the temple at 12.15 pm at Ram Janmabhoomi. Ruling out any change in schedule of bhumi pujan, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das said: “The most auspicious time and day for bhumi pujan has been chosen. This will not be changed.” According to Trust members, the bhumi pujan will take place on ‘Abhijit Muhurta’ at 12.15 pm on August 5, which is the most auspicious time to lay the foundation stone of Ram Mandir. “Abhijit Muhurta is capable of removing all obstacles,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, successor designate of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das. The Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, the body of saints that spearheaded the Ram Mandir movement across the country in 1990s, has always been at loggerheads with the Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati camp. “Opposition of Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati is just a ‘posturing’ and nothing else. It has no meaning. The bhumi pujan will be carried out according to the schedule fixed by the Trust,” said Prof Kaushal Kishore Mishra, political science department, Banaras Hindu University (BHU). Swaroopanand Saraswati has also been opposing the trust constituted by the Centre for construction of Ram Mandir after the Supreme Court’s verdict in favour of Ram Mandir on November 9 last year. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has also ruled out any change in schedule of bhumi pujan of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-change-in-ram-temple-bhumi-pujan-schedule-says-trust-chairman/story-XpedJDjUoSVEo1tprdB5XP.html
23-07-2020||India||Amid political crisis, Congress divided over assembly floor test in Rajasthan||The Congress on Thursday said there are two opinions in the party on holding the floor test in Rajasthan with one section suggesting going for an immediate trust vote while the other group is urging legislators to wait for the proceedings in courts to get over before proving their strength in the assembly.Addressing a virtual press conference, senior Congress leader Ajay Maken also said the party was not “disappointed” with the Supreme Court’s decision on a plea filed by Rajasthan assembly speaker CP Joshi seeking a stay on the proceedings in the high court, saying they were not expecting a favourable verdict and had already prepared a political plan to deal with the crisis.”When we go to the court these days, we don’t expect favourable decisions and we prepare ourselves for a decision which is not in our favour. It is not only a legal battle but mainly a political battle. Legal battle is just a part of the entire political battle. Knowing and understanding fully well that the courts may not give a decision in our favour we have prepared our political plan,” he said.ALSO READ | A mini win for Sachin Pilot in Supreme Court, over to HC at 10.30 am tomorrowThe Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Rajasthan high court to pass orders on Friday on a plea by rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident legislators challenging the speaker’s disqualification notice. It set aside the speaker’s request for a stay on the proceedings.The plea had challenged the high court order of July 21 which had asked the speaker to defer action on his notice to Pilot and other rebel legislators till July 24, arguing that the court’s intervention was premature as he is yet to decide on the issue of disqualification and has only issued notices.“No doubt, floor test is the only solution and we can go for it at any opportune time. We are confident of our numbers and will prove majority on the floor of the House. There are two views in our party. One section feels that we should wait for the proceedings in courts to be over and the other suggests that we should immediately go for the floor test,” Maken said.“But as far as the floor test is concerned we are very confident and will easily cross the majority mark with at least a margin of 15-20 legislators in the final count,” he added.ALSO READ | ‘If I meet him, he cannot say he didn’t know about crisis’: Gehlot on letter to PM ModiMaken and Randeep Singh Surjewala were deputed by the Congress leadership as the party’s two special observers to deal with the political crisis in Rajasthan.The Congress has so far claimed that 109 legislators in the 200-member assembly are supporting the Ashok Gehlot government and insisted that the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) too had not yet sought a floor test.Asked if the party has re-established contact with Pilot and other rebel legislators, Maken said, “We have been repeatedly requesting them to talk to us and tell us about their grievances. We have never said they are not part of the Congress.”The Congress leader said it was the rebel legislators who went to the court first.“I am here for the past 12 days and I am not a part of any group. My sympathies are with the young leadership as I consider myself a part of it. Similarly, Surjewala and KC Venugopal are also part of the same group. We have told them to come and talk to us and attend party meetings,” he added.Maken said it was unheard of till now that the ruling party’s legislators were seeking the floor test from their own chief minister. “If a Congress legislator asks for a floor test from its own government, can we call him a member of the Congress party? Have you ever heard that a sitting state Congress president has turned a dissident?” he asked.“Who demands the floor test? Why are Harish Salve and Mukul Rohtagi appearing for the rebel legislators? Will they ever appear for the Congress? Why is the BJP government in Haryana not letting the Rajasthan Police take voice samples of the rebel legislators lodged in a hotel in Manesar? Who is Gajendra Shekawat? Why are Amit Shah’s police protecting them? Why is ED (Enforcement Directorate) raiding relatives of the chief minister? Isn’t this the BJP’s open support to rebel legislators?”Asked why young leaders are leaving the Congress, Maken shot back: “Has he (Pilot) left the party? I don’t think he has left the party yet. We are in the Congress not for any post or importance but for its ideology. If you take the help of a diametrically opposite party like the BJP to damage the Congress, I don’t think you are a well wisher of the Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-political-crisis-congress-divided-over-assembly-floor-test-in-rajasthan/story-Bm6fKumWkawuNCoeel0FtO.html
23-07-2020||India||Pak approach in Kulbhushan Jadhav case farcical: India||India on Thursday accused Pakistan of blocking all legal remedies to Indian death row convict Kulbhushan Jadhav.MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava also said Pakistan adopted a “farcical approach” in handling the case, adding India is exploring available options in the matter.“In the absence of an unimpeded and unhindered consular access as well as of the relevant documents, as a last resort, India tried to file a petition on July 18,” he said during an online media briefing. “However, our Pakistani lawyer informed that a review petition could not be filed in the absence of power of attorney and supporting documents related to the case of Jadhav,” he added.Pakistan had earlier this month said July 20 is the last date of filing a review petition by Jadhav against the death sentence handed down to him by a Pakistani military court.The 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer was sentenced to death by the Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. India approached the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-approach-in-kulbhushan-jadhav-case-farcical-india/story-TLPurVCpcPeMeCuEHGJePK.html
23-07-2020||India||One Pakistani, 2 Indian-origin persons in US ‘blacklisted’ for anti-India activities||A Pakistani and two Indian-origin persons based in the US have been “blacklisted” by the government for their alleged anti-India activities. The move came after Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shewale wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah apprising them about the alleged anti-India activities of Rehan Siddiqui, a US-based Pakistani, and Rakesh Kaushal and Darshan Mehta. The trio will not be able to travel to India following the blacklisting. In a letter to Shewale, Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy said the issue was examined by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) following his complaint. “The MEA has apprised that Rehan Siddiqui, Rakesh Kaushal and Darshan Mehta have been blacklisted on the recommendations of the Consulate General of India, Houston,” Reddy wrote to Shewale. Siddiqui runs a radio station in Houston and organises cultural events with artistes from Bollywood. Kaushal and Mehta allegedly assist Siddiqui in organising such events. Reddy also conveyed to the MP that the Indian Embassy in Washington DC and the Consulate General in Houston have been requested to engage with prominent influencers, cultural bodies and bona-fide “Bollywood-affiliated” local entities to ensure that appropriate message is conveyed to Indian actors and artistes so that they disassociate themselves from such anti-national elements. Shewale, the MP from Mumbai South Central, said the government has advised the Bollywood celebrities not to participate in events organised by the trio. In his complaint to Home Minister Shah in February 2020, Shewale had said Siddiqui is the owner of a radio station in Houston and promoter of cultural events and has been allegedly involved in anti-India activities and anti-India propaganda. The MP claimed that Siddiqui’s radio station was funded by US-based Pakistanis and the Pakistan government. Shewale said that after the February 2019 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama, Siddiqui “launched a vicious anti-India campaign and tried to malign the dignity and honour” of the Prime Minister. Forty CRPF jawans were killed in the terror attack in Pulwama. India had carried out an air strike at a terror camp in Pakistan, days after the Pulwama attack. Shewale has now demanded investigations by the Enforcement Directorate and the National Investigation Agency on the Bollywood celebrities who had participated in the events organised by Siddiqui and his two accomplices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-pakistani-2-indian-origin-persons-in-us-blacklisted-for-anti-india-activities/story-dSqJuVUfpJrz1E4kbvDD2K.html

23-07-2020||India||India to boost Rafale capabilities with HAMMER missiles under emergency order: Report||With the Rafales arriving in the country in the middle of a dispute with China, the Indian Air Force is further boosting the capabilities of the combat aircraft by equipping it with the HAMMER missiles from France.The order for the HAMMER standoff missiles with the capability to take out any type of targets at the range of around 60-70 kms is being processed under the emergency powers for acquisition given to the armed forces by the Narendra Modi government.“The order for the HAMMER missiles is being processed and the French authorities have agreed to supply them to us at a short notice for our Rafale combat aircraft,” government sources told ANI.In view of the urgent requirement for these missiles by the Air Force, the French authorities would be delivering the systems to India from the existing stock meant for some other customer, they said.HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) is a medium-range air-to-ground weapon designed and manufactured for the French Air Force and Navy initially.The HAMMERs would give India the capability to take out any bunkers or hardened shelters in any type of terrain including the mountainous locations such as Eastern Ladakh, the sources said.When asked to comment, an IAF spokesperson refused to confirm or deny the developments related to the new acquisition.Five Rafale would be arriving in India from France on July 29 and their advanced weaponry including the long-range SCALP and Meteor missiles would have reached India before their touchdown.The first five Rafale fighter aircraft would start arriving in India by July 29 flown by pilots of the 17 Golden Arrows commanding officer.The delivery of the aircraft was earlier supposed to have been done by May end but this was postponed by two months in view of the Covid-19 situation in both India and France.The trainers will have the tail numbers of the RB series in honour of the Air Force Chief RKS Bhadauria who played a pivotal role in finalising India’s largest-ever defence deal for 36 Rafale combat aircraft.The aircraft on their way from France to India would be refuelled by a French Air Force tanker aircraft in the air around Israel or Greece before they make a stopover in the Middle East.India had signed a deal worth over Rs 60,000 crore with France in September 2016 for 36 Rafales to meet the emergency requirements of the Indian Air Force.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria was the Deputy Chief of Air Staff at that time and headed the Indian negotiation team for the deal which is the biggest ever in monetary terms in India. Armed with the long-range Meteor air to air missiles and SCALP, the Rafales would give India an edge over both Pakistan and China in terms of air strike capability.Sources said the air to air and the air to ground strike capabilities of the Rafale cannot be matched by both China and Pakistan and the aircraft would give India an edge over both the rivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-boost-rafale-capabilities-with-hammer-missiles-under-emergency-order-report/story-Xf0SGVcipUgXvL2qRU3FZM.html

The deceased have been identified as Bajrang Vetti and Tido Mandavi, who were a commander and a member of the CPI-Maoist, respectively, and belonged to Potali village,” the SP said.A meeting of Maoists was held in Potali village, where the villagers were hauled up for not digging up the road linking to the hamlet, the SP said.Later, the rebels instructed Vetti and Mandavi to carry out the assigned task, which they refused, citing that it would cause inconvenience to the villagers. The defiance infuriated the Maoists, who killed their two colleagues with sharp weapons and also thrashed three other villagers, the SP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-two-maoists-killed-in-dantewada-by-their-own-party-cadre/story-JKdCWvBqoOEKvLu6ZJu7xJ.html
23-07-2020||India||Verdict in Sachin Pilot, MLAs’ disqualification notice at 10:30 am tomorrow||The action in Rajasthan drama moves back to the desert state with the state high court set to pronounce its verdict on Friday at 10:30 am on the writ petition moved by rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 dissident MLAs challenging the speaker’s disqualification notice to them. Earlier today, the Supreme Court allowed the high court to rule on the petition filed by team Pilot against the speaker’s disqualification notice, adding that it would be subject to the outcome of the petition before the top court.The Pilot camp has argued that they cannot be disqualified for merely disagreeing with the decisions of some leaders outside the assembly. They also say issuance of disqualification notice by the speaker is a violation of their freedom of speech right. Their lawyers further argued that the lawmakers were given only three days’ time to reply during Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier, defying party whip, Team Pilot skipped the two Congress legislature party meetings but underscored that they have not given up their membership of the house. The writ petition challenges the speaker’s notice to rebel MLAs as well as the disqualification on the grounds of defection. If the rebel MLAs are disqualified, the majority mark in the 200-member assembly will automatically come down, making it easier for chief minister Ashok Gehlot to win a floor test. The number of lawmakers present at the two Congress legislature party meetings indicated that the Gehlot government would be able to stay in power even if with a wafer-thin majority. At the third meeting held this week, Gehlot urged the legislators to stand firm like a rock as the country is watching them.The Rajasthan CM hasn’t put a number of lawmakers on his side yet. “You’ll get to know the exact number when we win the floor test by a thumping majority. This time, every MLA will hear the voice of his conscience and vote,” Gehlot told HT on Monday.Sachin Pilot was stripped of his posts in the government and the party after, according to the Congress, he turned down peace overtures from the party leadership that asked him to make it clear that he was a ‘loyal soldier’ of the Congress and not working with the BJP.Encouraged by the support of the party, Gehlot has been launching sharp attacks on Sachin Pilot in an effort to dent his image as the Congress leader who led the party to victory in the 2018 state elections. Pilot was tasked to rebuild the Rajasthan Congress chief in 2014.Gehlot, who has accused Pilot of conspiring with the BJP to bring down his government, said his former deputy had used his command over the language and “his innocent face” to convince the media that he had worked hard to get the party in power. This wasn’t a fact, the chief minister said. “We knew he is nikamma (worthless) and nakara [good for nothing],” Gehlot told reporters on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/verdict-in-sachin-pilot-mlas-disqualification-notice-at-10-30-am-tomorrow/story-L2pIlVG6RlUBPc5yCdnFeI.html
23-07-2020||India||Chinese actions are a challenge for the world community: British envoy||China’s actions around the globe, including imposing a national security law in Hong Kong and the border standoff with India, are a challenge for the world community and Britain will work with partners to call out violations of international law, UK high commissioner Philip Barton said on Thursday.Following its exit from the European Union (EU), the UK will focus on healthcare, a long-term agenda for green growth and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and trade and investment while strengthening its ties with India, Barton said during his first news briefing after presenting his credentials.“There are challenges around the world on all sorts of Chinese actions, for us Hong Kong particularly is a focus, clearly for India the LAC (Line of Actual Control) is a particular focus,” he said.“These are concerning things and our hope would be that there can be de-escalation, and tensions do seem to have eased over the last week or two after the tragic loss of lives,” he said, referring to the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a clash with Chinese forces along the LAC on June 15.Barton welcomed progress by India and China in managing tensions and the commitment by the two Special Representatives on the border issue to disengage and de-escalate. “I hope we’re not about to see a change in that,” he said.Britain, he said, has its own concerns about a range of Chinese actions and has decided to remove Chinese technology giant Huawei’s equipment from all its telecommunications networks by 2027 because of concerns highlighted by the UK National Cyber Security Centre.“We don’t have a border with China but we have particular responsibilities for Hong Kong and the new national security law which China has imposed there, we see this as a very clear and serious violation of the UK-China joint declaration,” he said, referring to the agreement that laid out the administrative arrangement for Hong Kong when the former British colony was handed over to China in 1997.“We are very clear sighted about the challenges China presents in the region and around the world. We in the UK want to work with China and hope for positive, constructive engagement and strive for that...We welcome all partners who join us in calling out what is a serious violation of the UK-China joint declaration...,” Barton said.The UK also has “grave concerns” about human rights abuses, particularly against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, he added. Pointing specifically to Huawei’s role in 5G, he said the UK and India can work together to resolve such “wider global issues” and to diversify markets.Asked about the activities in UK of Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan group banned by India, Barton declined to go into details but said Britain would act if any of its laws were violated.“In the UK, you have the right to protest and the right to freedom of speech is there but there are limits to it. Where people clearly break the law, we will take action. We have a dialogue with the Indian government across a range of issues of mutual interest and extremism of all kinds is one of those,” he said.Barton said there was no inconsistency between the Indian government projecting the country as an open destination for trade and investment while also working for self-reliance through the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiative. The two countries, he said, can work on making critical supply chains more resilient.“It’s perfectly possible for India to be an open trading economy and open to investments and international cooperation while also pursuing the [Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative] and wanting to manufacture in India and wanting to build manufacturing and other capacities and capability...I don’t see any inconsistency,” he said.Barton, a career diplomat with long experience of South Asia and India, advised the need for caution while responding to questions about the two countries cooperating on Covid-19 vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca backed vaccine that has shown encouraging results.He said it wasn’t known for certain if any of the vaccines would work, and the world community needs to keep backing a suite of potential vaccines till research reaches a stage where experts can be confident. Distribution of any successful vaccine would also be based on the ability of countries to pay for it and those needing subsidies, he added.India’s “fantastic vaccine capability” and the tie-up between the Serum Institute of India and AstraZeneca represent a “clear partnership with India” in this field, Barton said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-has-created-challenges-across-the-world-uk-watching-lac-situation-british-envoy/story-9Ku3nsivgicqoThebeUthL.html
23-07-2020||India||General households to cut and store waste masks, gloves for 72 hours before disposing of: CPCB||In its latest guidelines on disposal of Covid-19 waste, pollution watchdog CPCB has directed that masks and gloves used by everyone, whether infected or not, should be cut and kept in paper bags for minimum 72 hours before disposing of them. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) also directed commercial establishments like malls and offices to follow the same procedure with discarded protective personal equipment (PPE) from general public. “Discarded PPEs from general public at commercial establishments, shopping malls, institutions, offices, etc. should be stored in separate bin for 3 days, thereafter, disposed of as dry general solid waste after cutting/shredding. “Waste masks and gloves in general households should be kept in paper bag for a minimum of 72 hours prior to disposal of the same as dry general solid waste after cutting the same to prevent reuse,” the CPCB said. This is the fourth time the CPCB has issued guidelines on management of bio-medical waste generated from coronavirus. It, however, said that leftover food and empty water bottles handled by infected patients should not be collected along with bio-medical waste but with other general solid waste. “Leftover food, empty juice bottles or tetra packs, empty water bottles, packaging material, and any other items, generated or handled by Covid-19 patient should be collected along with other general solid waste in bags securely tied for handing over to waste collectors. “Yellow coloured bag should not be used for general solid waste,” it said. Yellow bags are dedicated for bio-medical waste from Covid-19, as per the guidelines issued time and again. The CPCB also recommended use of bio-degradable or non-disposable cutlery to minimize waste generation. “In order to minimize waste generation, as far as possible, non-disposable items must be used for serving food, which are to be handle with appropriate precautions and cleaned and disinfected as per hospital guidelines. “If use of disposable items is inevitable, use bio-degradable cutlery. The wet and dry solid waste bags to be tied securely in leak-proof bags, sprayed with sodium hypo-chlorite solution and hand over to authorized waste collector. Yellow coloured bags should not be used for collecting general solid waste. Compostable bags should be used for collecting wet-waste,” it said. It has also directed that isolation wards, including temporary healthcare facilities like rail coaches, must keep separate colour coded bins to maintain segregation of waste and use a dedicated bin to collect and store Covid-19 waste and keep it separately, use double layered bags for collection of Covid-19 waste and disinfect all bins/containers every day. From Covid-19 isolation wards, used PPEs such as goggles, face-shield, splash proof apron, plastic coveralls, hazmat suits, nitrile gloves must be collected into a red bag, it said. “Collect used masks (including triple layer mask, N95 mask etc.), head cover/cap, shoe-cover, disposable linen gown, non-plastic or semi-plastic coverall in yellow bags. Used masks, tissues and toiletries, of Covid-19 patient shall become biomedical waste and shall be segregated in yellow bag,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/general-households-to-cut-and-store-waste-masks-gloves-for-72-hours-before-disposing-of-cpcb/story-JUacNhYr3QfKYBEDGSbHRJ.html

They should step forward and undergo a voice test,” Gehlot was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.In an indirect reference to Shekhawat, Gehlot added that Union ministers, MLAs or MPs give speeches and therefore their voice is easily recognizable.Shekhawat, a senior BJP leader from Rajasthan, has denied his involvement in the case and rejected claims that one of the voices on the three audio clips being probed by the police is his.Gehlot dismissed Shekhawat’s defence and said that the truth will win in the end.“Still, the first reaction always is ‘it wasn’t my voice’. They are also threatening people. Nothing is going to work. Satyamev Jayate,” the news agency quoted him as saying.Gehlot has upped the ante against Shekhawat and demanded that he subjects himself to the investigation in the case of alleged horse trading of MLAs aimed to overthrow his government. He and his party has accused BJP leaders of hatching the alleged plot in connivance with Congress rebels led by Sachin Pilot, the former deputy chief minister and head of the party’s state unit.Gehlot even wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Sunday naming Shekhawat as one of the BJP leaders allegedly involved in the act. He also referred to Sachin Pilot and MLAs supporting him as “over ambitious leaders” in his own party, who were purportedly hand in glove with the BJP to bring down his government.Sachin Pilot has denied involvement with the BJP and rejected conjectures that he may join the party soon.The BJP leaders in Rajasthan have, however, rejected Gehlot’s accusations and said his government was in trouble due to internal differences with his own party and alleged failure in governance.Also Read: A mini win for Sachin Pilot in Supreme Court, over to HC at 10.30 am tomorrowGehlot’s government is also locked in a legal battle with Sachin Pilot and his followers over a disqualification notice served to 19 party rebels by the assembly speaker. The Rajasthan High Court is expected to announce its verdict on a petition filed by Pilot, challenging the disqualification notices. Congress has also petitioned the Supreme Court in the same case asking it to prevent any interference in the proceedings before the speaker takes a decision on the matter. The SC, however, refused to stop the high court from announcing its verdict in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-asks-for-testing-horse-trading-audio-clips-in-us-escalates-attack-on-bjp-minister/story-DmrG8OKLuxYHZDzGeO8MoN.html

23-07-2020||India||EC defers bypolls for one LS, 7 assembly seats due to ‘extraordinary circumstances’||The Election Commission has deferred by-elections for one Lok Sabha and seven assembly seats due to “some extraordinary circumstances peculiar to these constituencies” and the poll panel will meet on Friday to discuss scheduling of these bypolls.The states where the bypolls have been deferred are --Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat in Bihar, two assembly seats each in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, and one each in Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. Most of these seats fell vacant due to the death of sitting members.A senior EC official said the Covid-19 pandemic and the flood situation were two reasons behind the decision.As per the electoral law, EC has to hold bye-elections within 180 days (six months) of a seat falling vacant, another official pointed out. The six-month deadline to hold by-elections in these eight seats was ending on different dates in July, August and September respectively.When the EC assessed the situation, it found that it is difficult to adhere to the six-month deadline in these seats, and approached the Union law ministry to defer the polls, the official said.Under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, in certain cases, the EC, in consultation with the Central government (the Union law ministry), certifies that it is difficult to hold the by-election within the six-month period.Using this provision, the poll panel issued a certificate on July 22 to defer the elections in these eight seats.In a statement, the Commission said on Thursday that “this matter of timing etc of by-elections is also slotted for discussion in the Election Commission meeting to be held tomorrow” (Friday).The statement said the total number of by-elections due is 56 assembly constituencies and one Lok Sabha seat (including the eight deferred). However, a letter written by one of its senior officers to the law ministry regarding the eight bypolls is “causing some confusion”, the EC said and clarified that it was only “in respect of eight constituencies regarding which a reference to Ministry of Law and Justice was made ... due to some extraordinary circumstances peculiar to these constituencies.” Out of these total number of 57 by-elections, the Commission has already taken a decision to hold all by-election as per provisions and the deferring of these eight by-elections was only up to September 7, 2020, the statement said.The remaining 49 bypolls are due after September 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-defers-bypolls-for-one-ls-7-assembly-seats-due-to-extraordinary-circumstances/story-Ji3Nw1O4S0yj875RyheeeK.html

The Union Home Ministry has expressed serious reservations over the issue saying such a controversy should have been avoided when the investigation was continuing on the right track, a senior official familiar with the development said.The sudden transfer order of six superintendents and two inspectors attached with the Kochi unit of the Customs who are part of the ongoing investigation was issued by Mohammad Yousaf, Commissioner of Customs, late on Wednesday. After the issue triggered a controversy, the Customs department made it clear that it was a routine transfer and it was deferred for the time being.ALSO READ | Kerala gold smuggling case: NIA custody of accused extended“There are enough pressures as the investigation is progressing. The transfer drama can be part of it. It seems many who are part of the syndicate are rattled,” said a senior official, who did not want to be identified. He said the multi-agency probe is moving in the right direction. The gold smuggling case came to light on July 5, when P S Sarith, a former employee of the UAE consulate in the state capital, was arrested when he came to receive a consignment in the name of an official of the consulate. Later, 30 kg gold was retrieved from the consignment. Five days later, Swapna Suresh, a senior IT official and her friend Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru.The Enforcement Directorate has formally arrested three key accused, Sarith, Suresh and K T Ramees, another accomplice. The ED had registered a case against them under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the NIA court had earlier allowed it to question the accused. Opposition Congress and BJP said since the transfers were deferred they will not comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-after-outrage-transfer-of-customs-officials-deferred-for-now/story-DDErVGA91V77wF8MtzGDVM.html

23-07-2020||India||I am responsible, Digvijaya Singh tells Twitter after some posts blocked||Congress senior leader and Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh on Thursday complained that popular micro blogging site Twitter has been blocking his tweets saying it “includes potentially sensitive content”. The Congress leader said his tweets were being blocked by the social media giant without specifying what was “potentially sensitive” in his tweets. He has demanded a response from the country head of the company.“Twitter has been blocking my tweets saying it “includes potentially sensitive content” such as these without telling me what is “potentially sensitive content” in my tweets? I need to have the response of Twitter Country Head of India,” Digvijaya tweeted on Thursday.Digvijaya Singh added that classifying criticism of Central government leaders as “sensitive content” was an act of political bias.“If saying something against Narendra Modi or Amit Shah you find to be of “sensitive content” then you are being politically biased against me which you have no right to be. I have earlier complained to your Management of your biased attitude against me but without any response,” Digvijaya said in another of his tweets on the matter.In his defence, he said he was a “responsible” Indian citizen with an extensive record of public service.“I am a responsible Indian Citizen who has been elected to MP Assembly 5 times Lok Sabha twice and Rajya Sabha twice. I have been Minister in MP and CM MP for 10 years. Why should I post any objectionable tweet?” Digivjaya asked. Twitter was recently questioned by the Supreme Court of India over alleged defamatory tweets by senior lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan. Twitter’s counsel told the SC that the site can only disable a tweet on orders passed by the Court. According to the rule of contempt, for a publication including web/social media platform, the author and the publisher, both are called out in the matter.Social media have been under an increasing scrutiny for libellous content posted by users. The micro blogging site has a media policy that filters and bars graphic violence, adult content and hateful imagery among others.According to the company, first time violation of these policies leads to removal of the content and the user getting temporarily locked out of his account while a repeat violation leads to permanent suspension of the account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-responsible-digvijaya-singh-tells-twitter-after-some-posts-blocked/story-FHHevr5KnDhzazSHo5milK.html
23-07-2020||India||In highest single-day recovery, 29,557 patients recuperate from Covid-19 in 24 hours: Govt||As many as 29,557 Covid-19 patients have recuperated in the past 24 hours, the highest recorded in a day so far, taking the recovery rate to 63.18 per cent, the Union Health Ministry said on Wednesday. According to data updated at 8 am, total recoveries have surged to 7,82,606 and exceeded the active cases of Covid-19 by 3,56,439 as on date. The number of tests for detection of Covid-19 has also crossed the 15-million mark as the number of cases surged to 12,38,635 on Thursday. A total of 1,50,75,369 samples have been tested up to July 22 with 3,50,823 samples being tested on Wednesday, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) officials said. “One million tests were done in three days till Wednesday. The testing capacity has been increased to around 4 lakh per day,” scientist and media coordinator at ICMR Lokesh Sharma said. “While the total number of recovered cases has jumped to 7,82,606, there has been appreciable growth in the recovery rate, which stands at 63.18 per cent,” the ministry said. This accomplishment can be attributed to the central government-led Covid-19 management strategies, it said. Sustained efforts by the Centre, states and union territories (UTs) are resulting in more effective containment, aggressive testing, and prompt and efficient clinical treatment strategies. These are guided by the teams of domain experts in the Ministry of Health such as the Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) and ably complemented by the technical experts at AIIMS-New Delhi, centres of excellence in various states and UTs, ICMR and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The Union Government continues to coordinate with the efforts of the states and UTs by sending central teams of experts to areas witnessing increase in caseload and hand-holding of COVID hospitals in states through the tele-consultation programme led by AIIMS, New Delhi, the ministry said. “These combined efforts have resulted in Case Fatality Rate being managed at low levels. It is 2.41 per cent, as on date, and steadily declining,” it said. This has also helped in reducing the actual caseload of Covid-19 cases which remains confined to 4,26,167 active patients only. With the highest-ever single-day spike of 45,720 cases, India’s Covid-19 tally crossed the 12-lakh mark on Thursday, while the death toll mounted to 29,861 with a record 1,129 fatalities reported in 24 hours, according to the updated data at 8 am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-highest-single-day-recovery-29-557-patients-recuperate-from-covid-19-in-24-hours-govt/story-TV8IyfgtqTSmNXWIpj8G7M.html

Inhumane act at a time of pandemic distress. There should be a judicial enquiry by a sitting high court judge and there should be a discussion in the assembly,” Siddaramaiah, leader of opposition in the state assembly, tweeted.In another tweet, Siddaramaiahn said the Karnataka government was paying substantially more for ventilators than what others have. “Central govt has procured 50,000 ventilators under PM Cares at a cost of ₹4, lakh per unit. Tamil Nadu has procured at ₹4.78 lakh. But in our state, the price is between ₹5.6 lakh to ₹18.2 lakh.”He also took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a self-reliant India claiming that chief minister B S BS Yediyurappa’s government was importing Chinese medical equipment at exorbitant cost.“On one hand @PMOIndia advocates Aatma Nirbhar Bharat but here in Karnataka, his own Chief Minister @BSYBJP, has procured hundreds of crores worth Made in China medical equipment at exorbitant price. Is this not hypocrisy?” he said in another tweet.The Congress leader said the party will continue to cooperate with the government in saving people’s lives in the pandemic but insisted that “we will not cooperate with corruption and looting of money.”The government dismissed the charges saying no irregularities have taken place in the procurement of medical equipment to fight the pandemic .Health Minister B Sriramulu said, “I said it before and I am saying it now -- no irregularities have taken place,” according to PTI.On Tuesday, during an address to the people of Karnataka, chief minister Yediyurappa had said, “Not one rupee has been misused.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-judicial-probe-into-rs-2-000-cr-covid-management-scam-in-karnataka-siddaramaiah/story-FUScSXG9gfmgHMSEOuL7eI.html

23-07-2020||India||Always knew I would pursue films as career, says Ashish R Shukla||“It has been a long journey from being one of the assistants to the renowned Prahald Kakkar (ad film maker) to directing OTT series. But every day has been a learning experience for me. I had decided when I was in Arts School that film is what I will be pursuing as a career. I was intrigued by the entire process and wanted to be a part of it as soon as possible.” Those are the words of director Ashish R Shukla, who has been in the industry for almost 20 years and has tried his hand at advertising, writing, directing TV thrillers, serials and films.For Ashish, the turning point came when he saw the film ‘Salam Bombay’. “That film always inspired me. I remember I saw it on Doordarshan when I was just a child and I realised that this is what life is. I completed my major in photography and as it is said, life came a full circle. I got to know a gentleman staying in my building was associated with that film and was currently associated with ‘Dil Chahta Hai’. It was Sir Harish Amin. I met him and shared my love for films with him. It was through him that I got the opportunity to join Prahald (Kakkar) Sir’s team.“He (Prahald Kakkar) was my first teacher and after that I worked in ad films for different agencies. It was in 2007 that I made a short film, ‘The Lock,’ which Anurag (Kashyap) liked a lot and called me home. We both had a UP connection as my parents are from Pratapgarh and a number of relatives live in Lucknow too. He gave me a film to write that was based in Varanasi. At the same time, he was preparing for one of his films and he took me along and that’s how I joined the team as the creative head for ‘Dev D’,” said Ashish.It was then that he decided to go solo. “I started making documentaries and my most acclaimed one was a documentary ‘Inside Mumbai Terror Attack-26/11’ that also won an award and turned out to be a milestone for me. Around that time, a friend asked me to direct a feature film and I came on board. And that is how, finally, I got to direct my first feature film ‘Prague’.“The film was critically acclaimed and went to several international film festivals. It was also the biggest learning experience for me and I understood what to do and what not to do. Then I directed a crime show for TV ‘Shaitain- A Criminal Mind’, after which a couple of TV series followed, as did the first daily soap of my career. I was doing TV to support my finances as I had a family to take care of,” Ashish said.Currently, the young director is basking in the success of his second OTT series. “When a friend asked to meet her for a new project, I had no clue that the script would be so edgy and uncanny to direct. I was all game because this was my genre always and getting to work the way I was used to was an added advantage for me. And then in 2019 this riveting web thriller, ‘Undekhi’ happened that is now streaming on an OTT. It was different from my first OTT series ‘Band’ because here I was racing with time as each and every character was an enigma in himself or herself. I am happy with the way the show is being praised by all and especially by the audience. Now, I am waiting for the release of my next directorial ‘Bahut hua Sammaan,’ with one of my favourite actors, Sanjay Mishra. The film was shot extensively in Varanasi last year. Shooting for the next projects will be challenging during this phase but work has to start. Let’s see when we will be able to get back to work,” Ashish said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/always-knew-i-would-pursue-films-as-career-says-ashish-r-shukla/story-QB7aqjjdP7vYh6asDC0bRI.html

Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani, who pronouced the order through video conferencing, granted the relief to Shivinder in furnishing of a person bond of Rs one crore and two sureties by family members of Rs 25 lakh each. The judge also directed the investigating officer of the ED to request the Bureau of Immigration to open LOC in Shivinder’s name to prevent any unannounced exit from the country. The high court imposed various other bail conditions on him, including that he shall not tamper with the evidence or influence witnesses, directly or indirectly.He was arrested in the money laundering case last year.The high court had reserved its order on the bail plea on July 16 after hearing arguments from the counsel for Shivinder and Enforcement Directorate (ED).ED had opposed the bail plea saying that in the present case, money was diverted through a complex web of transactions and finding the trail was not easy. RFL is a group firm of REL - Religare Enterprises Ltd, which was earlier promoted by Malvinder Singh and his brother Shivinder Singh.The EOW registered an FIR in March last year after it received a complaint from RFL’s Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, Godhwani and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies. ED lodged a money laundering case based on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-grants-bail-to-ex-fortis-healthcare-promoter-shivinder-singh-in-money-laundering-case/story-5iRciXg953urbZFxRMKFUN.html

The Ministry of Defence on Thursday issued the formal letter sanctioning the grant of Permanent Commission (PC) for women officers, empowering eligible women personnel to take on more responsibility in the army.The order specifies grant of Permanent Commission to Short Service Commissioned (SSC) women officers in all the ten streams of the Indian Army including Army Air Defence (AAD), Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME), Army Service Corps (ASC), Army Ordnance Corps (AOC), and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General (JAG) and Army Educational Corps (AEC), an Indian Army spokesperson said on Thursday.Earlier, anticipating the grant of Permanent Commission for women, the Indian Army headquarters had started preparing for the Permanent Commission Selection Board for Women Officers. The Selection Board will be scheduled as soon as all eligible SSC Women Officers exercise their option and complete proper documentation. Women officers in the Indian Army have been striving for some time to ensure equal opportunities for all defence personnel, including eligible women officers.

We only want that the temple should be built properly and the foundation stone should be laid at the right time, but this is an ‘ashubh ghadi’ (inauspicious time),” ANI quoted him as sayingPrime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on August 5 after a request by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirtha Kshetra.In February, Swaroopanand Saraswati had expressed unhappiness with the composition of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra trust constituted by the Centre to oversee construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He particularly objected to the inclusion of Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati in the trust as a Shankaracharya, despite different courts having ruled against his use of the title.Swaroopanand had also said that as a Shankaracharya, he should have been made the head of the trust.The groundbreaking ceremony in Ayodhya is scheduled to take place amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh. To cut down the risk of infection, the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirtha Kshetra has decided that there will not be more than 200 people, including 150 invitees at the foundation stone laying ceremony to ensure that social distancing can be properly maintained.Ahead of the groundbreaking ceremony, PM Modi is scheduled to offer prayers to Lord Ram at the temple and Lord Hanuman at Hanuman Garhi Temple in Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inauspicious-time-for-laying-ram-temple-foundation-stone-swaroopanand-saraswati/story-XdCabWXXs5CC0mwozWetCM.html

We are all determined to play our part in any case, and to make sure that we’re working together to ensure that criminals can’t escape justice by crossing national borders,” he said.Mallya’s extradition was ordered in February but “there is an ongoing legal case and I can’t comment any further on that and I can’t say anything at all about timescales”, Barton said. “The UK government understands the importance of the case,” he added.Last month, India said it had asked the UK not to consider any asylum request from Mallya, currently on bail pending his extradition, as there are no grounds for his persecution in the country. India has also said it has sought the early extradition of Mallya from the UK.The UK has so far only said a “confidential” legal issue was holding up Mallya’s extradition but that it was trying to deal with the matter as quickly as possible. Britain’s stance gave rise to speculation the 64-year-old businessman, wanted in India to face charges of financial irregularities, could have applied for asylum.Mallya lost his appeal in the UK high court in April against the 2018 order to extradite him. Last month, the high court also refused Mallya permission to appeal in the UK Supreme Court.He is wanted in India to face charges of financial offences involving Rs 9,000 crore borrowed by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines from several Indian banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-timescale-for-vijay-mallya-s-extradition-to-india-says-uk-envoy/story-xQ2kjbMC0MoWwrYTJoWMBJ.html

He said industry body FICCI and other associations are working with the government in this regard. “We have identified first 12 sectors and now 8 more, so we have 20 sectors in which Ficci and other associations are very much part of our engagement, where we have identified sectors where India can not only meet own domestic needs but also become globally competitive and become global leader supplying to the world,” he said in a Ficci webinar. These sectors include food processing, organic farming, agro chemicals, electronics, industrial machinery, furniture, leather, auto parts and textiles, among others. He also highlighted that despite having skilled carpenters and artisans, India continues to import furniture. “Can we not prepare India to become the factory of the world for furniture, can we not build to scale at competitive prices so that the world looks at India, to source from India,” he added. Further talking about yoga, the minister said yoga holds huge potential for industry and young entrepreneurs as the world is excited about it. “But did India really grab the opportunity that the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) opened up for India. Did we set up 100,000 yoga centres all over the world, did any entrepreneur amongst you or startups thought in terms of the possibilities that yoga offers by planning to train maybe 100,000 or 500,000 yoga teachers who would find an opportunity across the globe,” Goyal noted. He said one has to take a person in yoga room for four sessions only and for the fifth session, the person will come “running and then for the rest of his life, he would want to be a yoga participant, that is the power of yoga”. Cure is not only about medicine or about visiting hospital or a doctor for treatment, the huge possibilities of yoga as a preventive medication are known to many but have not been captured as an opportunity. “I do not know whether all of us have failed the nation and the people of India, where despite the Prime Minister with his vision of opening up door, opening up opportunities, for all of us, (we) have not seized the moment,” the minister asked. He added that post-Covid-19, people may not like to visit a medical practitioner for common cold and illnesses, “so why not look at preventive methods”. “I do not think all is lost, I still think that if some innovative youngsters plan to take it to the rest of the world, India can become a power house providing this technology and it’s a scientific technology. Every aspect of yoga, every ‘aasan’ teaches you something new,” Goyal said. Disruption need not always be technological as it not only comes out of computer screens, he said adding “disruption can come out of a variety of ways. It is for us to see whether we are willing to engage, whether we are willing to offer to the rest of the world India’s traditional strengths”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/identified-20-sectors-where-india-can-become-global-supplier-piyush-goyal/story-F5ouvgverdEDUemiTT3x1I.html
23-07-2020||India||‘Gratuitous’: Indian official’s acerbic retort on China’s advice on foreign policy||China’s advice to New Delhi to follow an independent foreign policy and safeguard regional peace reflects Beijing’s sanctimonious, even duplicitous approach in relations with other countries, a senior government official said on Thursday. “We do hope that China gives up its sanctimonious stand and takes real steps to further peace in the region and the world in accordance with international law. It wants India to give up on its close allies like the United States so that any global effort to get India entry into the UN Security Council as a permanent member or a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) despite an impeccable non-proliferation record unlike its all-weather ally Pakistan is blocked. With the Ladakh aggression, the Chinese perfidy in the garb of peace and tranquillity stands exposed,” the official said.A second official, part of India’s national security establishment, added that Beijing’s track record in its neighbourhood and the world reflected its “duplicitous and hypocritical approach”.Also Read: Navy’s forward posture against PLA in Ladakh muscles out Chinese threat on high seasThe strong remarks are as a reference to China’s assistance to countries such as Pakistan and North Korea develop nuclear weapons and delivery platforms, blocking UNSC sanctions against designated terrorists in Pakistan and flexing muscles along the 3,488 km long LAC and South China Sea as part of its cartographical expansion.ALSO WATCH | ‘Closing more Chinese consulates in US always possible’: Donald Trump The Chinese foreign ministry, responding to external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s assertion that India was never part of an alliance and will never be, said on Wednesday that China hopes and believes that India “will be able to maintain its independent foreign policy and safeguard regional peace and stability through concrete actions, and play a constructive role in international affairs”.The statement was seen in New Delhi to reflect concern in China over India’s growing proximity to the United States and loud voices of support for India from the Trump administration, particularly after China attempted to intrude into India in the Ladakh sector.The external affairs ministry hasn’t responded to Beijing’s statement.Also Read: From Ladakh to Japan’s Senkaku Islands, ‘bully’ China is in an overdrive“What China means to say,” a national security planner said, “was that India should forget about its attempts to intrude into Ladakh and move on. They made the same point when they wanted India to be part of the Belt Road Initiative, saying that it was a connectivity project and India shouldn’t mind if it passes through occupied territories in Pakistan.”Or telling India after trying to take over Indian territory in Ladakh that New Delhi should not let the boundary dispute impact the $ 100 billion bilateral trade.Contrast this approach with Beijing’s super sensitive stance when it comes to its perceived sovereignty issues in Arunachal Pradesh and elsewhere, claiming that state sovereignty is a core interest that is non-negotiable and protesting visits to the state by Indian dignitaries.Or when it fires a barrage of threats over Indian deals to supply Brahmos or Prithivi missiles to Vietnam and Philippines, two of the 20-plus countries it has territorial disputes with. But it goes right ahead to help client state Pakistan to build long range nuclear missiles, supplies fighter jets like JF 17 and other weapons including armed drones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gratuitous-indian-official-s-acerbic-retort-on-china-s-advice-on-foreign-policy/story-P7PWmiQN3R3h80LEXjaRrK.html

23-07-2020||India||Amit Shah urged to increase Chhattisgarh Police funds||Chhattisgarh Home Minister Tamradhwaj Sahu has urged Union Home Minister Amit Shah to increase the Centre’s share in the Police Modernisation Fund (PMF), reminding him of the state’s internecine war with the Left-wing extremism since its inception on November 1, 2000.Sahu drew Shah’s attention to the expansion of the Chhattisgarh Police since the new state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh (MP) two decades ago and 14 of its 27 districts come under the Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) Security Related Expenditure (SRE) scheme.Sahu wrote to Shah on Wednesday and cited facts and figures to underscore a gradual decline in the Centre’s share in PMF.In 2013-14, the funds sanctioned for the modernisation of Chhattisgarh Police were Rs 56 crore, but the requirement fell short by Rs 20 crore, the state home minister’s letter stated. “There has been gradual deduction of allocation under PMF for the state even though Chhattisgarh is fighting the Communist Party of India (CPI)-(Maoist) menace for several years. The trend is disconcerting and I am urging you to increase the Central government’s share in PMF,” he wrote.Sahu further stated that Chhattisgarh’s PMF share has been decreased, despite the fact that 14 of the 27 districts in the districts are LWE-affected and fall under the MHA’s SRE scheme. “ Out of these 14 districts, eight districts are severely Maoist affected and we urgently need funds for police modernisation in these areas,” the letter stated.Sahu also cited that the strength of the Chhattisgarh Police has increased from 22,520 to 75,678 personnel since its formation and during this period, 11 new revenue districts were created and the number of police stations has also gone up from 293 to 467.“Besides the Special Task Force (STF), Chhattisgarh has 22 armed battalions, a special information branch unit and training schools such as Police Academy at Chandrakhuri and Counter-Terrorism and Jungle Warfare (CTJW) College at Kanker. At present, a total of 45 battalions of paramilitary forces are deployed in the state to fight the Maoists,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-urged-to-increase-chhattisgarh-police-funds/story-XHoy8c01dKIY07DKNUxdnM.html

While Tilak was born in 1856, Azad was born in 1906. “Tributes to the two brave sons of Mother India, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Chandrashekhar Azad on their birth anniversary,” the prime minster tweeted.In a series of tweets, the vice president said, “Today, let us pay our tributes to these bravehearts and resolve to strive hard to realise their dreams for this great country.” There should be a greater focus in school books on the tales of sacrifice, patriotism and valour of iconic national leaders and freedom fighters to inspire the younger generation, Naidu said. He added that instead of merely covering commemorative occasions, the media must regularly highlight their stories. “Though Chandrashekhar Azad left his earthly abode too soon, at the age of 25 years, he was one of the most inspirational youth leaders of the freedom movement. He was also a mentor, philosopher and guide to a number of young freedom fighters, most notably Bhagat Singh,” Naidu said. Referring to Tilak, the vice president said he endeavoured to awaken the political consciousness of people through two weekly newspapers that he owned and edited, “Kesari”, published in Marathi and “The Mahratta”, published in English. “He vehemently criticised the British rule through these publications,” he noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vice-president-naidu-pm-modi-pay-tributes-to-bal-gangadhar-tilak-chandrashekhar-azad-on-their-birth-anniversary/story-jbAtsO7n1UyDuYrj1JWeoN.html

23-07-2020||India||Jaipur court directs SOG to probe Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s role in credit society scam||A lower court in Jaipur has ordered the special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan Police to probe the role of Union Minister for Jal Shakti and Jodhpur Member of Parliament (MP) Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and his wife Naunad Kanwar, among several others, in the Rs 884-crore Sanjivani Credit Co-operative Society fraud case that was unearthed in end-September last year.Additional District Judge No. 8 Pawan Kumar gave the order on Tuesday (July 21) on the basis of a revision petition filed by two complainants from Barmer, who had invested Rs 68 lakh in the co-operative society and were denied their dues upon maturity of the sum.They also demanded an investigation into the role of the minister and his wife in the SOG case registered in August 2019.Shekhawat’s office said they would go through the contents of the order before making any comment about it.Ajay Kumar Jain, the complainants’ counsel, said the court accepted the revision petition and ordered the SOG to investigate the role of Shekhawat, Kanwar, and three others, including Mohan Kanwar, Rajendra Baheti and Kewalchand Daglia.“The revision petition was filed on June 20, which stated that despite the money trail to the personal accounts of minister Shekhawat and his wife, the SOG neither arrested them, nor seized their properties purchased from earnings from the fraud,” Jain said.The complainants -- Ladu Singh and Guman Singh of Barmer – moved court against the co-operative society that had started its operations in 2008 in Barmer and accused it of duping 50,000 investors, including them, of Rs 884 crore.The complainants had cumulatively invested Rs 68 lakh in the society, but were denied their maturity dues.“The SOG had also found in its investigation that Shekhawat and his wife’s companies had a 19% share in the co-operative society and had their hands in the till. The agency has found that money was transferred from the co-operative society to them,” Jain alleged.The SOG had registered a case against the co-operative society on August 23, 2019, after a preliminary inquiry on the basis of the complaints of unsuspecting investors and found that 50,000 of them were defrauded of Rs 884 crore. The co-operative society’s director Vikram Singh and others were booked under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by anybody in the capacity of trust), 467(forgery of valuable security), 468(forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document as genuine) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and were later arrested.In its preliminary investigation, SOG found gross financial irregularities after perusing the balance sheets of the co-operative society between 2009 and 2018, and 214,000 documents of its investors.“The SOG found that documents between the year 2008 and 2015 were destroyed by those who held positions in the co-operative society. Until June 30, 2019; 214,472 investors had invested Rs 883.38 crore, but none of them were paid maturity dues,” the preliminary investigation report had said.The SOG noted that the society promised unrealistic returns to lure investors, which offered 10% and up to 12% for the fixed deposit (FD) and the daily deposit schemes, respectively. The promised return was over 40% more than the existing market rate that banks and financial institutions offer for FD schemes. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition in the Congress-ruled desert state, is tight-lipped about the court’s order. “It won’t be prudent to respond to the court’s order in a hurry. We need to go through the content before reacting to it,” said Rajendra Rathore, deputy leader of opposition in the Rajasthan Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaipur-court-directs-sog-to-probe-gajendra-singh-shekhawat-s-role-in-credit-society-scam/story-X9n0yRPYzKbGhzW1WhO3jJ.html

Day by day my faith is getting deeper because peace is now being established in the entire region. The mantra of peace, progress and prosperity is echoing in the Northeast,” the Prime Minister said.“While blockades in Manipur have become a part of history, Assam has witnessed a phase of violence for decades. In Tripura and Mizoram too, youth have abandoned the path of violence. Now Bru-Reang refugees are moving towards a better life,” he said. The Prime Minister said modern infrastructure is being built in the Northeast emphasising that connectivity in the region is important, not for only ease of living, but also for achieving the goal for self-reliant India. He said that tourism potential of the region, including Manipur, is still unexplored.“Natural and cultural diversity of the Northeast is a great symbol of cultural strength. In such a situation, tourism also gets a lot of strength when modern infrastructure is built. Tourism potential of Northeast, including Manipur, is still unexplored,” he said. “Connectivity of Northeast is important for ease of living of people here. But it is also substantial for ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. On one hand, it strengthens our social and trade relations with Myanmar, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh, while also strengthening India’s Act East Policy,” he said. The Prime Minister said that India’s Northeast, in a way, is the gateway to our ancient cultural relationships with East Asia and the future of trade, travel and tourism.“With this thinking, there is a constant emphasis on connectivity-related infrastructure in the entire Northeast, including Manipur. Modern infrastructure is being laid in the Northeast along with roadways, highways, airways, waterways and i-ways as well as gas pipelines. Thousands of crores of rupees have been invested in the infrastructure of the region in the last six years,” he said. “Efforts have been made to connect the four capitals of the Northeastern states, 2 lanes to the district headquarters and all-weather road to the villages. Under this, about 3,000 kilometres of roads have also been prepared and projects are going on for about 6,000 kilometres,” he said. Asserting that there is a huge change in the area of rail connectivity in the region, the Prime Minister said that the work of connecting the capitals of every state of the Northeast with a good rail network is going on at a rapid pace.He highlighted that there are about 13 operational airports in the Northeast today. “To expand the existing airports in the region, including Imphal Airport, more than Rs 3,000 crores are being spent to build modern facilities there,” Modi added. “Another major work is happening for the Northeast, in the area of inland waterways. Work is now underway on more than 20 national waterways. In the future, connectivity here will not be limited to the Siliguri corridor,” he said. “Now clusters are being developed for value addition and marketing in local products under the self-reliant India campaign. In these clusters, all the facilities will be given to agro startups and other industries.The Prime Minister said that the region has the potential to replace India’s bamboo import with local production. “There is such a huge demand for incense sticks in the country. But for this also, we import bamboo worth billions of crores of rupees. A lot of work is being done in the country to change this situation,” he said. “Hundreds of crores of rupees are being invested under the National Bamboo Mission for bamboo farmers, artists associated with handicrafts and other facilities. This will benefit the youth of the region, the startups here,” he said. The Prime Minister said that many institutes are now being built in the region for health, education, skill development, start-ups and other training. “With the formation of sports universities and world-class stadiums, Manipur is becoming a major hub for the country’s sports talent,” he said. The Prime Minister said that ease of living is the right of everyone and his government is doing a lot of work in this direction. He said that the whole of India, including Manipur, is free from open defecation. The Prime Minister said that almost every family in the country is connected with electricity.“Today LPG gas has reached the kitchen of the poorest of the poor. Every village is being connected by a good road. Good homes are being provided to every poor homeless. There was a big shortage of clean water, so to complete it, work is also going on on the mission mode,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northeast-has-potential-to-become-india-s-growth-engine-pm-narendra-modi/story-zgyxCXNQrmkk9lf1mn5L0N.html

23-07-2020||India||A mini win for Sachin Pilot in Supreme Court, over to HC tomorrow||The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Rajasthan high court to pass orders tomorrow on a plea by rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs challenging the speaker’s disqualification notice, setting aside speaker CP Joshi’s request for a stay on the proceedings. “Can a person elected by people not express his dissent? Voice of dissent cannot be suppressed. In a democracy, can somebody be shut down like this?” Justice Arun Misha, heading the Supreme Court bench, asked Kapil Sibal, who is representing the speaker.The plea filed by Rajasthan speaker CP Joshi challenged the state high court order of July 21 which had asked the speaker to defer action on his notice to Pilot and other rebel MLAs till July 24, arguing that the court’s intervention was premature as he is yet to decide on the issue of disqualification and has only issued notices. The Pilot camp filed a caveat petition in the court, saying nothing should be done without notifying them first. The group has argued that if a group of MLAs raises its voice against the style of the CM’s functioning it cannot be termed defection. It further argued that the party whip applies only when the assembly is in session and issuing such a notice is a violation of their freedom of expression.The Congress requested the speaker to initiate proceedings after the Pilot camp absented itself from two Congress Legislature Party meetings. The speaker had argued that the notice issued to the MLAs was in the realm of legislative proceedings under the Tenth Schedule and said the judicial review of an ongoing anti-defection proceedings was limited. It further argued that the high court order on holding off action against the rebels amounted to violation of Article 212 (courts not to enquire into the proceedings of the legislature). The SC bench, however, said that the matter in the Rajasthan high court will be subject to the proceedings before the apex court.“The case requires prolonged hearing. It involves the very question of democracy itself,” said justice Arun Mishra.The top court will consider the question of whether courts can interfere with the disqualification proceedings initiated by the speaker at an interim stage before the speaker takes a decision on the disqualification plea. “We will hear only on the question of whether the court can interfere with the speaker’s proceedings or not. We will not go into whether the speaker acted mala fide or bona fide. We cannot go into that”, the Supreme Court said.The matter will be heard again on July 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-allows-rajasthan-high-court-to-pass-order-on-disqualification-notice-to-sachin-pilot-18-mlas/story-HojyWlr34e9CYaw2p702II.html

23-07-2020||India||Green Card waitlist for Indian is more than 195 years: US senator||The backlog for an Indian national to get permanent residency or Green Card is more than 195 years, a top Republican senator has said, urging his Senate colleagues to come out with a legislative resolution to address this problem. A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently. Senator Mike Lee said on Wednesday that the current Green Card policy did nothing for the child of an immigrant whose dead parent’s Green Card application was ultimately denied because his or her job was no longer available. “Someone from India entering the backlog today would have to wait 195 years to receive an EB-3 green card. Even if we give their children this limbo status, none of them will have a prayer of becoming a US citizen,” Lee said on the Senate floor. In fiscal year 2019, Indian nationals received 9,008 category 1 (EB1), 2,908 category 2 (EB2), and 5,083 category 3 (EB3) Green Cards. EB1-3 are different categories of employment-based Green Cards. Lee, the senator from Utah, was speaking on the legislation moved by Senator Dick Durbin that seeks to protect immigrant workers and their children who are stuck in the green card backlog. “Green Cards are critical in the lives of so many who are here on temporary work visas. The backlog puts families at risk of losing their immigration status as they wait year after weary year to finally make it through this green card backlog,” Durbin said. “Our bipartisan agreement would add critical protections that were not in the original bill for immigrant workers and their immediate family members who are stuck in the backlog. They would be able to switch jobs and travel without losing immigration status. And children of immigrant workers would be protected from aging out so they will not face deportation,” he said. The Lee-Durbin agreement would make three changes to the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. First, it would immediately protect immigrants and their families who are stuck in the backlog by allowing them to “early file” for Green Cards. This would allow workers to switch jobs and travel without losing immigration status and prevent the children of immigrant workers from “aging out” of Green-Card eligibility so they will not face deportation while they are waiting for a Green Card. Second, the amendment would create a green-card set aside for immigrant workers who are unable to “early file” because they are stuck in the backlog overseas. Finally, the amendment would crackdown on abuse of H-1B temporary worker visas by outsourcing companies by prohibiting a company from hiring additional H-1B workers if the company’s workforce is more than 50 employees and more than 50 per cent temporary workers. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. “While we continue to debate the best way to fix the Green Card backlog, let’s make sure that no children of the affected families are harmed or deported. Just that simple. I offered a new bill, very simply stated, to protect children of immigrant workers act. This brief three-page bill would ensure that children do not age out while waiting for a Green Card,” Durbin said. “Imagine if you brought your children to the United States, worked on an H-1B visa and your children are waiting for you for the Green Card, you are paying for them to go to college because they don’t qualify as American Citizens for any type of federal financial aid. You’re making great sacrifices for them and then the day comes when they reach the age of 21 and they can be deported and your family divided,” he said. “Why would we want to let that happen?” Durbin asked. Noting that he has met many of these young people, the senator said it breaks his heart to hear their story that they may reach a point where they age out and be deported. “That’s why I wanted to offer this specific single provision. There is no reason these children should be punished for a broken immigration system. It’s not beyond our control to help them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-card-waitlist-for-indian-is-more-than-195-years-us-senator/story-7QMzcKyOuKVcsGbS7xQFlL.html
23-07-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi says PM failed to come with a vision to deal with China||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has failed to come up with a vision to deal with China even as he advocated a changed approach to resolve the border standoff.He said that as an opposition leader, it is his responsibility to question the prime minister, who in turn has to give a vision.“And I know that the prime minister is an opponent. My responsibility is to question him. My responsibility is to ask questions and to put pressure on him so he does his work. His responsibility is to give the vision. It’s not there,” Gandhi said in a video message issued on Thursday.“I can tell you, guaranteed, it’s not there and that’s why China’s is in there today,” he contended.The short video is the third in a series on the India-China border face-off. Through the brief videos, Gandhi wants to share his thoughts on national issues.Also read: Security agencies red-flag Chinese fronts in education, not just power and telecomIn the first video issued on Friday, he said India’s “troubled economy, foreign policy and neighbourhood” had prompted China to take an aggressive stand against the country.In the second video titled “China’s Strategic Game Plan”, Gandhi talked about how the Chinese had triggered the border issue to pressure Modi.In one of the sharpest attacks on Modi over the India-China border standoff, he said the Chinese are attacking his image as “they understand that for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’ (56-inch)”. Gandhi added that “if [Modi] allowed the Chinese to understand that they can manipulate him because of his image, the prime minister will no longer be worth anything for India”.In the third video titled ‘How should India respond to China?”, Gandhi listed different measures to deal with the Chinese.Also read| ‘Encouraging’: UK welcomes steps taken by India and China to ease border tensions“Psychologically you have to deal with the Chinese from a position of strength. If you deal with them from a position of strength, you can work with them, you can get what you need and it can be actually done. But if they sense weakness then you [have] had it,” he said.“The first thing is you not going to take on China without a vision. And by that I don’t mean a national vision. I mean an international vision,” added Gandhi.The former Congress president said China’s Belt and Road Initiative is an attempt to change the nature of the global order.“India has to have a global vision. India now has to become an idea. And it has to become a global idea. So that’s the thing that’s going to protect India, it is actually thinking big,” he said.Gandhi has been repeatedly targeting Modi and his government over Chinese transgressions and has said the prime minister was not being transparent on the issue. The Congress has been demanding that status quo ante be restored at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and Chinese troops be pushed to their side.Gandhi sought a changed approach to deal with the border issue with China.“Of course we have this border issue and we have to resolve this border issue. But we have to change our approach, we have to change how we think,” he said.“That is why I’m aggravated. Because I can see a huge opportunity is being lost. Why? Because we are not thinking long term, because we are not thinking big, and because we are disturbing our internal balance.”Gandhi lamented that Indians were fighting among themselves. “Just look at the politics. All day long, all day long, Indian is fighting Indian. And it is because there is no clear cut vision going forward,” he said.He also tweeted, “PM is 100% focused on building his own image. India’s captured institutions are all busy doing this task. One man’s image is not a substitute for a national vision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-says-pm-failed-to-come-with-a-vision-to-deal-with-china/story-52vCGgv7J9TWzyFjP03g1J.html
23-07-2020||India||Varavara Rao seeking bail under garb of pandemic, old age: NIA||The application of Elgar Parishad-Maoists links case accused Varavara Rao for bail on health grounds was a mere “ruse” and he was trying to take undue benefit under the garb of the Covid-19 pandemic situation and his old age, the NIA has told the Bombay High Court.His health condition was stable and he did not require treatment in a multispeciality hospital, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said in its affidavit on July 16, the day the 81-year-old poet and activist tested positive for coronavirus.Rao’s application of bail on health grounds thus, was a mere “ruse” and he was “trying to take undue benefit under the garb of current situation on account of global pandemic and his old age,” said the NIA, which is probing the Elgar Parishad-Maoists links case.The NIA also said in its affidavit that otherwise Rao won’t be eligible for bail only on merits of the case.“The prison authorities have responded timely and provided necessary medical aid to the appellant accused Rao.The applicant accused was admitted to J J Hospital for the complaint of giddiness on May 28 and after medical treatment, he was discharged on June 1 as he was found asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable,” it said.Raos medical record and the report submitted by J J Hospital’s superintendent did not suggest he was suffering from any such ailment which necessitated that he immediately obtain treatment in a multi-speciality hospital, the probe agency further said in its affidavit.Rao is currently currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19 and other ailments at Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai. On July 20, the Bombay High Court heard Rao’s bail plea briefly.His lawyer Sudeep Pasbola told the court that Rao was “almost on his deathbed” and even the NIA could not dispute the fact that his health was very critical.“His condition is very serious. He hit his head against the hospital bed while he was at the J J hospital and sustained severe injuries. Besides Covid-19, he suffers from several ailments, he is hallucinating and is delirious,” Pasbola said.“His days are numbered and if he is to die, at least let him die in the presence of his family members,” the lawyer said while seeking that Rao be granted bail.However, NIA’s counsel Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh told the court on July 20 that the state was “taking good care” of Rao and he had been admitted to one of the “best super speciality hospitals in the city”.The NIA is supposed to inform the court on Thursday if Rao’s family can be permitted to see him.Last month, the NIA filed an almost similaraffidavit opposing the bail application of Rao’s co-accused Sudha Bharadwaj, in the case.It said the bail application “pleading with regard to the medical condition of the petitioner is merely a ruse to obtain an order of interim relief which is not available to her otherwise on merits of the case”.Rao and nine other activists have been arrested in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, which was initially probed by the Pune Police and later transferred to the NIA in January this year.The case related to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial.The police have also claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varavara-rao-seeking-bail-under-garb-of-pandemic-old-age-nia/story-3sRYps54rCdrll26RIEOdJ.html
23-07-2020||India||PM Modi is 100% focused on building his own image, says Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that “India’s captured institutions” are all busy building the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Prime Minister is 100 per cent focused on building his own image. India’s captured institutions are all busy doing this task. One man’s image is not a substitute for a national vision,” he tweeted while posting a video on the microblogging site.In continuation of his video series focusing on border tension with the neighbouring country and other issues, the Congress leader posted another video on Twitter today and attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not having a vision and said this is the reason “why China is in there”, indicating Chinese troops are still inside Indian territory.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi suggested that India has to “psychologically” deal with Chinese from a position of strength and said that the country needs to have a global vision.“Psychologically you have to deal with Chinese from a position of strength. If you deal with them from a position of strength, you can work with them, you can get what you need and it can actually be done. If they sense weakness, then you had it. The first thing is you are not going to take on China without a vision and I don’t mean a national vision, but an international vision,” the Congress leader said in the video.He said that a huge opportunity is being lost at this moment.“India has to have a global vision. India has to become an idea and it has to become a global idea. The thing that is going to protect India is actually to think big. Of course, we have this border issue and we have to resolve this border issue. But we have to change our approach and thinking. This is the point at which the road parts if we go this way we become a major player and if choose another way we become irrelevant. That is why I am aggravated because I can see that a huge opportunity is being lost. Why because we are not thinking long term and thinking big because we are disturbing our internal balance,” he said.Attacking the Prime Minister, Gandhi said: “We are fighting amongst each other. Just look all-day Indian is fighting Indian. It is because there is no clear vision going forward. I know the Prime Minister is an opponent. My responsibility is to question him, ask questions and put pressure on him so he does his work. His responsibility is to give the vision. But it is not here that’s why China is in there today.”The former Congress president termed China’s Belt and Road initiative as an “attempt to change the nature of the planet”. This is the fourth video Gandhi has posted as part of his video series attacking the Centre over its handling of the ongoing tussle with the Dragon. Earlier, he released videos on June 17, June 20 and July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-is-100-focused-on-building-his-own-image-says-rahul-gandhi/story-ReehWPhaToMn1GqG1vQkhL.html
23-07-2020||India||Supreme Court holds crucial hearing ahead of Rajasthan HC order on Pilot vs Gehlot crisis||The Supreme Court is hearing a petition filed by Rajasthan assembly Speaker CP Joshi against a high court order directing him to defer disqualification proceedings against Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident Congress MLAs.The petition is being heard by a bench of Justices Arun Mishra, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari. The hearing comes a day before the Rajasthan high court is expected to given an order on a petition by Pilot and other dissidents challenging the disqualification notices.Seeking an interim stay on the high court order, Joshi has said in his petition that it is the top court’s duty to ensure that all constitutional authorities act within the “Lakshman rekha” drawn for each one of them.He argued that the disqualification proceedings under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution are the business of the legislature, and cannot be interfered with.Also Read: ED raids Rajasthan CM’s brother, Congress hits outPilot, too, has moved a caveat in the Supreme Court to ensure that no orders are passed on Joshi’s petition without hearing him and his supporting MLAs. A caveat is a notice seeking that certain actions may not be taken without informing the person who gave the notice.Joshi had said at a press conference on Wednesday that he decided to move the Supreme Court after high court sent an order to his office giving a “direction” to him.The order by the court of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta said its proceedings will resume Friday and requested the Speaker also to put on hold any action on the notices till then, recording that “we direct accordingly”.The disqualification notices were issued on the request of Rajasthan chief whip who said that the dissident MLAs did not attend the party’s CLP meetings. Pilot and other dissidents, meanwhile, argued that a whip cannot be issued when the assembly is not in session.The Congress has 107 members in the 200-member state assembly and the BJP 72.If the 19 dissidents are disqualified, the half-mark in the House will be slashed to 91, seeming making it easier for Gehlot to retain majority support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crucial-hearing-in-supreme-court-today-ahead-of-rajasthan-hc-order-on-pilot-vs-gehlot-crisis/story-1KyCKf8JcgzlAHNJ91YVgJ.html

23-07-2020||India||Ahead of Raksha Bandhan festival, demand for Chinese rakhis fall||Ahead of the Raksha Bandhan festival, the demand for Chinese rakhis have fallen this year, according to shopkeepers from several parts of the country. People are refusing to buy Chinese rakhis due to tensions between India and China. Women are preferring India-made rakhis to Chinese rakhis. The locals also intend to boost the Indian economy by buying local rakhis.In Himachal Pradesh’s Shimla, Aanchal, a customer, said, “We always used to get Chinese rakhis. This year I am buying India-made rakhi. Why should we boost the economy of a country that is a threat to us? I would not tie a rakhi to my brothers which are made in China, the country that attacks our soldier brothers.” “We are not going to buy any Chinese products. This is beneficial for the local artisans as well. I would appeal to all to buy India made rakhis only,” she added. The local traders are also not buying or selling Chinese rakhis for Rakshabandhan. The traders said that India-made rakhis are also increasing employment among locals.“Customers are refusing to buy Chinese rakhis. Their first question is whether the rakhi is Chinese or not. Local handmade rakhis are selling. This would also affect the Chinese market, and benefit the locals. The money used to go abroad earlier, now it stays within the country,” said Mahesh Kumar, shopkeeper. Similarly, customers in Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad have said that they will buy India-made rakhis only.“We have to courier rakhis so we are here. We will buy Indian rakhis only. We are checking if the rakhi is Indian or not. We won’t buy Chinese rakhis at any cost. Be Indian buy Indian,” said Sanjana, a customer.“There is a demand for India-made rakhis only.

It is the same for the top quality of the beverage as well.Jagannath said heavy rains in Assam and north Bengal is adding to the crop shortfall by another 15 per cent and producers are struggling to manage their operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-and-uneven-rainfall-hits-tea-crop-prices-firm-up-at-auctions/story-FtQBXR5UaEddQCie64pMOP.html

23-07-2020||India||In Rahul Gandhi’s latest video, a message to PM on China and ‘national vision’||Congress leader and former party chief Rahul Gandhi on Thursday sharpened his attack on the Centre and PM Modi, tweeting out that the prime minister is “100% focused on building his own image”. “India’s captured institutions are all busy doing this task. One man’s image is not a substitute for a national vision,” Gandhi posted along with a video. In a two-minute-long video, Gandhi talked about India’s ties with China after the brutal Galwan valley faceoff last month wherein 20 Indian Army soldiers were killed. “If you deal with them (China) with a position of strength, you can deal with them,” Gandhi said in the video. Gandhi said that if the Chinese sense weakness, then it will be a problem. “Dealing with the situation with China requires a vision, an international vision,” Gandhi said, adding that India needs to have a global vision and needs to become an idea in itself. Gandhi said that a huge opportunity will be missed by not thinking long-term and big.  Also read: India, China fail to make breakthrough in de-escalating tensions at LACPM is 100% focused on building his own image.

An Indian is fighting an Indian. This shows there is no clear cut vision going forward,” he added.Gandhi said that his responsibility is to question the prime minister and put forth questions, so that “he does his work”. “It is his responsibility to give the vision and I can guarantee you that it is not there and that is why China is in there,” Gandhi concluded.  This comes a couple of days after Gandhi took to Twitter and posted that the prime minister has fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power which has now become India’s biggest weakness as he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’.The Congress leader posted a video message on Twiter and wrote, “PM fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power. It was his biggest strength. It is now India’s biggest weakness.”In the video message, Gandhi spoke on speaking on “China’s Strategic Game Plan” and said, “What is China’s strategic and tactical game plan? It is simply not a border issue. The worry I have is that the Chinese are sitting in our territory today. Chinese don’t do anything without thinking about it strategically.”“In their mind, they have mapped out the world and they are trying to shape the world. That’s the scale of what they are doing. That’s what Gwadar is, that is what belt and road is. It is a restructuring of the planet. So when you are thinking about the Chinese you have to understand that that is the level at which they are thinking,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rahul-gandhi-s-latest-jibe-a-message-on-china-and-advice-on-national-vision/story-vh3E9pwwqCwfXmppqJV2pN.html

The office, Ahirwar alleged, was locked after an order from the secretary, who said he had got the order to the effect from the state government.“Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan cancelled on March 25 all the appointments made on different state commissions and boards by previous Congress-led state government. I challenged the state government’s order in the high court Jabalpur bench and got a stay on the government’s order,” said Ahirwar.“I was coming to office daily and discharging my duties. On July 16 and 17, I visited Guna to probe the matter in which a dalit couple allegedly consumed pesticide and other members of the family were beaten up by police during an anti-encroachment action of the district administration. The police booked all the family members including the couple who consumed pesticide. Police admitted the couple to the hospital but didn’t provide any medical aid to those who were beaten up by police brutally,” he added.“In the report, which I was about to submit to the state government on Wednesday, I recommended withdrawal of the criminal cases against the family and provide them with a ration card and also education to kids in the family. I also recommended that an FIR should be registered against the police. But before I could submit the report, the state government blocked my entry to my own office,” said the Scheduled Caste Commission chairman. Despite repeated attempts, tribal department’s principal secretary Pallavi Jain Govil and commissioner Chandrashekhar Borkar couldn’t be reached for their comments. They didn’t respond to phone calls and text messages. MP BJP spokesperson Rajnesh Agrawal said, “If Anand Ahirwar has any genuine grudge against the government he can lodge a complaint to the government authorities but he seems to be more interested in politicising the issues for obvious reasons. The state government took immediate action in respect with Guna incident and an inquiry has been ordered but still he is trying to draw political mileage from the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-scheduled-caste-commission-chairman-alleges-harassment-by-state-government/story-5epDFOw8Wgc0FK5Jp04XLN.html

After village panchayats, the second-best employers are contractors who have provided jobs to 2,700 while more than 550 got jobs through placement agencies. Builders have provided jobs to about 150 labourers, suppliers to 97 and commercial establishments have employed 67 labourers. In an open letter to employers on July 4, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “Rozgar setu portal has a database of all the migrant labourers after their skill mapping. More than 24,000 employers/job providers have got themselves registered who include those from heavy industries, MSMEs, builders, placement agencies, commercial establishments etc to provide jobs of permanent nature to the labourers for which I am grateful.” However, industries hardly showed any significant interest in the CM’s appeal. Chhindwara district tops the list in facilitating jobs through village panchayats to labourers. About 5,000 labourers have got jobs at the panchayat level, as per the data. Collector of Chhindwara, Saurav Kumar Suman said, “We have certain works other than those offered under MNREGA too, like works related to 226 anganwadi centres, panchayat buildings, mines etc., besides work offered by central government agencies like BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd), NHAI (National Highway Authority of India) etc. They engage labourers as per their need.” However, right to food activist Sachin Jain said, “The state government’s claim of providing jobs through village panchayats is misleading. There is hardly any significant work left after MNREGA at the villages. The fact is that the state government can’t provide or facilitate jobs to labourers overnight particularly because hardly any sincere effort was made in the past on the part of the government to create jobs in the state.” Yusuf Baig, a social activist from Panna district said, “I don’t see any work at the village level other than MNREGA provided to the labourers. Even MNREGA hardly fulfils their need. A family is supposed to get only 100 days a year job under MNREGA. If a family has four members then each of the members will get just 25 days job.” Mohd Makbool Ali, 53, a migrant labourer from village Mahtara under janpad panchayat Gohparu in Shahdol district got himself enrolled on the portal about a month. “Nobody has contacted me so far for any work. Even otherwise, I don’t see any work here. I will return to Mumbai the moment situation becomes normal over there,” he said. Another migrant labourer Rahul Kumar, 22, a resident of village Marpura under janpad panchayat Lahar in Bhind district was engaged with a security agency in Gurugram and echoed similar sentiments. He said, “It has been about a month now since I have been waiting for any response. I am planning to return to Gurugram.” On poor response to labourers from industries, president of the Association of Industries, Indore Pramod Daharia said, “Any industry will like to engage any labourer if it doesn’t have its trusted employees who are already engaged. There is a mutual understanding between the two sides and both understand each other’s needs. Secondly, after the lockdown, the industries are not running with their full capacity. Hence, they don’t need any labourer from outside.” President of Peethampur Audyogik Sangthan Gautam Kothari spoke in a similar vein. He said, “The industrialists prefer their own workforce. They are making phone calls to their workers and getting them back by arranging their transport. None of the industrialists would like to disturb its well-established system until unless there is some emergency or real shortage of workforce due to their employees stuck in other parts of the country.” Additional chief secretary (ACS), labour department, Rajesh Rajora said, “There are a good number of contractors who have provided jobs to labourers. We are making an all-out effort to facilitate as many jobs to labourers as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-govt-s-employment-initiative-for-migrant-workers-falls-flat-private-players-show-little-interest/story-B86DwuUS7kWysHVM9xwXuK.html

Watch Rahul Gandhi explain in the third part of the series. Tune in tomorrow at 10 am.”The Wayanad MP had earlier posted two videos on June 17 and 20, attacking the Centre over its handling of the ongoing tussle with the Dragon.Reiterating that China has still occupied India’s territory, Gandhi had on June 20 attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that he has fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power which has now become India’s biggest weakness as he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’ (56-inch).Taking to Twitter, the Congress leader posted a video message and wrote, “Prime Minister fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power. It was his biggest strength. It is now India’s biggest weakness.”In the video message, speaking on “China’s Strategic Game Plan” the Congress leader said: “What is China’s strategic and tactical game plan? It is simply not a border issue. The worry I have is that the Chinese are sitting in our territory today. Chinese don’t do anything without thinking about it strategically.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-should-india-deal-with-china-rahul-gandhi-to-explain-in-third-part-of-video-series-today/story-JpjOioUZ7xVhP57Pe11NuM.html
23-07-2020||India||Explainer: How foreign experts got injured at Baghjan oil well and what happens to efforts to plug blowout now||Amid expectations that Oil India Limited’s (OIL) natural gas well in Assam’s Baghjan, which suffered a blowout on May 27 and caught fire on June 9, would be plugged anytime soon, three foreign experts involved in the efforts sustained minor burn injuries while working at the site on Wednesday.According to OIL officials, the experts from Singapore-based Alert Disaster Control were trying to remove a spool from the well head when the incident happened. They were provided treatment at a hospital in Dibrugarh and are out of danger. The work on capping the blowout is expected to resume from Thursday.The well, which is among 17 gas wells and five oil wells in Baghjan oil field in Tinsukia district, had a blowout - uncontrolled release of crude oil or gas when pressure control systems fail - while a work over operation was on to produce gas from a new reservoir at a depth of 3729 metres.While efforts were on to plug the blowout and foreign experts were brought in, the well caught fire on June 9 killing two firefighters and damaged 13 houses in the vicinity. Around 2,000 families residing nearby were evacuated and houses in relief camps where they have been staying since.Initially, OIL had stated that it would take about a month to control the fire and plug the blowout, but flooding caused by heavy rains affected work at the site for several days delaying operations.The well, which spewed oil condensate and subsequent fire, was feared to pose threat to ecology and environment of the area as it was located close to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park and the eco-sensitive Maguri Mottapung Wetland, an important bird habitat.Studies by several agencies are underway at Baghjan at present to gauge the damage caused to the area by the blowout and fire. Last month, National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered formation of an expert committee to probe the blowout and subsequent fire and assess the damage caused to human life, wildlife and environment because of it.How the foreign experts got injured?Though the fire at the well, which initially spread to nearby areas, has been under control, it has been on fire since June 9 while tasks needed to be completed to douse it continue.To enable people to work around the edge of the well and close to its head, a water umbrella is sprayed at very high speed, which minimises the fire at the mouth of the well (while it continues to rage few feet above) allowing people to reach the well head.“Today an important operation was underway to open and remove the spool, a connecting equipment between pipes, from the well head. Two flanges on both sides are opened and the spool is lifted,” OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika said on Wednesday.“While they were doing it, the mouth of the well suddenly caught fire and it spread laterally for 3-4 feet. And since the experts were working within that range, they got injured. While two of them escaped with minor injuries, one tripped and fell and the uncovered portion of his hand caught fire,” he added.All three were immediately evacuated from the site by other personnel present and provided medical attention. They were they taken to a burn care unit of a private hospital in Dibrugarh where they got proper treatment. The experts have been discharged and are now at OIL’s hospital in Duliajan.According to Hazarika, one of the experts sustained around 20 per cent burn injury on his hand, another had 12 per cent injury and the third sustained eight per cent burn injury. All three are expected to resume work soon.What happens to efforts to control the fire?The fire incident that caused injuries led to suspension of work at the site on Wednesday. But OIL officials say work is likely to resume from Thursday and the blowout will be plugged soon.“The operation will go on as per schedule. On Wednesday, the damaged spool was removed before the experts got injured. The next task is to reinstall the blow out preventer (BOP) on the well head. It’s a three-tonne equipment which has to be fitted on top of the existing undamaged spool, which is now exposed,” said Hazarika.“It’s a very coordinated operation. We hope to start work on it on Thursday morning and fix it after 3-4 hours. Once the BOP is placed, it is described as capping of the well. That will be followed by killing of the blowout,” he added.Hazarika informed that capping doesn’t mean that the gas will stop coming out of the well and the fire will be extinguished. A valve on the BOP will be injecting a fluid inside the well, which will neutralise the pressure of the well slowly and push the gas back from the well into the reservoir.“The operation between capping of the well and killing the blowout can take 2-3 days. The gas is being drawn from a depth of around 3.5 km so the fluid has to fill up that entire column,” he said.The entire operation should be over by the end of this week, which would complete almost two months since the blowout happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explainer-how-foreign-experts-got-injured-at-baghjan-oil-well-and-what-happens-to-efforts-to-plug-blowout-bow/story-xECRZtqxDkTNgBxyew87SL.html

The project outlay is about Rs 3054.58 crores with a loan component funded by the New Development Bank.Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla, Chief Minister N Biren Singh, and his cabinet colleagues, MPs, and MLAs are expected to join the program from Imphal.The Central government had initiated the Jal Jeevan Mission to provide safe and adequate quantity of drinking water to every rural household of the country by 2024 with the motto Har Ghar Jal.The programme also implements source sustainability measures as mandatory elements, such as recharge and reuse through greywater management, water conservation, rainwater harvesting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-lay-foundation-stone-for-manipur-water-supply-project-today/story-dAiK1teCXtTXruN70HjZFK.html
23-07-2020||India||Petition in Supreme Court seeks Commission to inquire Govt lapses in tackling Covid-19||Five retired bureaucrats and an academician have approached the Supreme Court through lawyer Prashant Bhushan for setting up a Commission of Inquiry to probe the lapses on part of the government in handling the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.On a day when Bhushan was slapped with a contempt notice by the apex court for his tweets accusing the judiciary of “destroying democracy”, the present petition was filed asking Court to hold the government accountable for its “gross mismanagement” of the pandemic situation.The petitioners include former Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officers KP Fabian and Madhu Bhaduri, former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers MG Devasahayam, Meena Gupta, Somasundar Burra and academician Amit Bhaduri.Also read: SC seeks detailed response from Prashant Bhushan on contempt matter over his tweetsThe petition alleges that the government failed on many counts which resulted in depriving citizens of their right to life and livelihood. The petition claims that the government failed to take timely and effective measures to contain the transmission of the disease despite getting notification of the disease from the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. This began with a failure to screen all international passengers arriving in India, according to the petition.Next, the petition alleges failure of the Centre to abide by its statutory obligations under the Disaster Management Act. Further, the petitioners accused the Centre of not consulting the National Task Force constituted on March 18, 2020, before imposing the lockdown. This committee had experts from the fields of epidemiology and public health. Timely and targeted provisions were not made to prevent job loss, income loss, deprivation of livelihood, starvation and exodus of migrant workers, the petition stated.The petition also touched upon the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) to health workers as an added ground for jeopardizing the safety of health workers. “The aforesaid lapses on part of the respondent (Centre) while dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic have led to a severe infraction of the fundamental rights of people,” stated the petition filed by Bhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-in-supreme-court-seeks-commission-to-inquire-govt-lapses-in-tackling-covid-19/story-BMC5LEbLL4pxPvG5lQS5MO.html
23-07-2020||India||Security agencies red-flag Chinese fronts in education, not just power and telecom||An exercise to minimise the role of power and telecom companies believed to be linked to the Chinese government could be expanded to cover other critical sectors such as higher education as well, people familiar with the development said after a July 15 review of the penetration of such companies and institutions in the Indian economy.The high-level meeting attended by national security planners and a select group of secretary-level officials comes against the backdrop of the Chinese army’s aggressive moves along the Line of Actual Control that led to a stand-off from May this year. The two sides earlier this month started disengaging at the face-off points in eastern Ladakh after several rounds of talks but Beijing has been slow to pull back its troops.Last week’s exercise was aimed at coming up with a comprehensive assessment of the footprint of Chinese companies and institutions that could be a proxy for the Chinese government or have close ties to the ruling communist party. “The initiative was driven by the top political leadership,” a government official said.Much of the discussion at the meeting revolved around a presentation made by security agencies that put the spotlight on two core areas; telecom and higher education.Security officials who briefed the top civil servants spoke about several instances of universities and colleges tying up with Chinese institutes through Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) without the requisite approvals.A classic example cited by the security establishment was the Chinese-government funded Confucius Institutes to promote Han Chinese language and culture - typicality set up in association with a local partner institution.In the telecom sector, security agencies pointed to the telecom department’s instructions to state-run phone company Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, BSNL, to amend its tender to exclude Chinese equipment makers from a large 4G upgrade project.But private phone companies often prefer Chinese equipment because they are cheaper. There have also been allegations that large tenders are tailored to suit Chinese companies. Industry body COAI had last month spoken against restrictions on private companies, insisting that geopolitical issues should be kept separate from corporate decisions.The education and telecom ministries have been asked to review the Chinese involvement in the two sectors in light of the presentation made by the security agencies and chart the next steps for the sector.The rule that requires approvals from the education ministry, home ministry and the external affairs ministry before signing pacts with Chinese institutions or universities isn’t new. On 1 October last year, the higher education regulator University Grants Commission told universities about the need for approvals for its courses. But it is unclear if the government followed up to ensure compliance.That exercise is expected to start soon.Beijing started setting up Confucius Institutes across the world in 2004 to promote Chinese language and culture in foreign countries. But as China started rolling out the institutes across the world, the Chinese government-funded outposts also started increasingly coming under the scanner of agencies in host countries. The initial concerns were only about academic freedom, institutional autonomy and reported instances of censorship. But some institutes started to shut after lawmakers expressed concerns that these served as a platform for chinese intelligence and political agenda. Some more, after the law prohibited the defence department from funding Chinese language programmes at institutes that host Confucius Institutes. These institutes have run into trouble in other countries as well including the UK, Canada, France, Australia and Sweden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-agencies-red-flag-chinese-fronts-in-education-not-just-power-and-telecom/story-HmWWF6zkf4n15bKidFv21I.html

23-07-2020||India||With its revenue declining, Odisha to go for more borrowings from environment, mining funds||With its battle against the Covid-19 pandemic becoming tougher by the day due to surge in cases, Odisha would borrow money from the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority and Odisha Mineral Bearing Areas Development Corporation funds.At the meeting of the council of ministers chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, the government decided to borrow more from the CAMPA and OMBADC funds. Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy said as the transfer of central funds to the state will decline this financial year due to economic recession, the borrowing is necessary. Odisha has already borrowed Rs 1,000 crore from these two funds.“When the first case of Covid-19 was detected in Odisha on March 16, we had only a single testing centre- ICMR-RMRC. After that, there have been several new testing labs. A total of Rs 340 crore has been spent from the Chief Minister Relief Fund, Rs 624 crore from State Disaster Relief Fund, Rs 73 crore from MLA LAD funds and the PRI institutions have spent Rs 875 crore for developing critical infrastructure to fight Covid-19. The scale of this pandemic is huge, so to meet the challenge of manpower and infrastructure engaged in the fight has been enormous. Life is above everything else. So priority will be given to manage the evolving crisis,” said Tripathy.Also read: Odisha village renamed after popular folk song Rangabati to honour lyricistSoon after the lockdown started, the Centre had allowed states to use up to 30% of unutilised district mineral funds for spending on Covid-19 infrastructure. So far, 19,835 persons in the state were detected with coronavirus in the state of which 108 succumbed to the virus.The pandemic has already started taking a huge toll on the state’s economy with its revenue earning down by 23 percent in the first quarter of the current financial year in comparison to the corresponding period last year. The total revenue collection between April and June was Rs 8,204 crore against last year’ss collection of Rs 10,645 crore.The chief secretary said most of the money on Covid-19 has been spent on paying salary and incentive to around 2 lakh doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, lab technicians, ASHA and anganwadi workers, ambulance drivers, veterinary docs and counsellors. There has also been a huge expenditure in purchasing masks, PPEs, testing kits and oxygen cylinders.“There have been several interventions for the livelihood of the economically vulnerable sections. Rs 1,500 have been given to construction workers, Rs 2,000 to people who successfully completed their quarantine period. All these figures were presented before the Council of Ministers today,” Tripathy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-its-revenue-declining-odisha-to-go-for-more-borrowings-from-environment-mining-funds/story-P5jCU04zoHIESrn7nSlPTN.html

23-07-2020||India||Covid-19 may further skew India’s tax profile||With Covid-19 infections crossing a million last week, and the virus spreading to new regions, India’s pandemic challenge is bound to become more difficult. Unless daily cases start coming down, business and consumer sentiment is unlikely to recover. This has also raised some doubts about government finances, especially revenue collections. A look at the available numbers suggests that indirect taxes might end up accounting for an even larger proportion of total taxes this year than they typically do. This is more than just an economic curiosity and has an important political economy implication for India, where governments have traditionally guarded against being seen as levying taxes on the poor.Also Read: June saw India make its first trade surplus in 18 years. But this isn’t good newsDirect taxes are progressive in nature – the rich pay at a higher rate than the poor – and a fall in share of direct taxes in total revenue entails retrogression in the tax burden. A person earning Rs 10 lakh per year faces a lower income tax rate than someone who earns Rs 1 crore per year. Indirect taxes do not make this distinction. Petrol is sold at the same rate whether it is meant for a motorcycle or an expensive car.India’s political economy landscape has two basic contradictions. Agriculture produces less than 15% of the GDP, but employs more than 40% of workers. And just a little over fifty million of India’s 400 million workers pay income taxes. These two numbers are often used to caution against any radical redistribution in favour of the ‘have-nots’, at the cost of the ‘haves’ in the economy. The rich are important for economic growth and revenue collection, and penalising them will not be fair, it is argued.That hasn’t stopped the government from taxing the rich more, though. In July 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman imposed a surcharge on the super-rich, which took the peak income tax rate to 42.7%. The move attracted a lot of criticism, and Sitharaman, in principle, accepted the criticism. “Ideally, we should bring it (peak income tax rate) down. Ideally, but we have to see when the timing is proper for this”, she told HT in an interview. In September last year, the government announced a major reduction in corporate tax rates, which it then estimated would lead to a revenue loss of Rs 1.45 lakh crore. Also Read: India’s painful economic recovery: Million cases, trillions of rupees lost and countingThe actual shortfall has turned out to be more . The reduction in corporate tax rates offset the revenue from the increased tax liability on the rich in 2019-20 (at least some of its beneficiaries were the rich). The share of direct taxes in the Centre’s gross total revenue came down by 2.5 percentage points from the 2018-19 level of 54.1%. RBI data shows that direct taxes, which include income tax and corporate tax, had a share of less than 40% in total tax revenue of the centre and states. The share of direct taxes increased sharply in the decade preceding the 2008 financial crisis (it used to be in the low double digits), reached a peak in 2009-10 and has stagnated at a slightly lower value since. In most OECD countries, direct taxes account for much of the total taxes -- up to two-thirds in some cases. Some see this as a sign of efficiency; others, who believe in income redistribution to offset inequality, see it as only fair and equitable.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();How will the pandemic affect this distribution? It is early to comment on this. Data from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) with the ministry of finance has tax collection data until May, 2020. A comparison on a year on year basis shows direct taxes suffered a bigger shortfall in comparison to indirect taxes in the first two months of the fiscal year. Total collection of corporate tax and income tax in April and May was Rs 52,707 crore, which is 14.6% less than the collection in April and May 2019. Collection of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), customs and excise duties, three major indirect tax heads, in April and May was Rs 71,961 crore, which is 52% less than the April and May 2019 collections.We will have a better picture when the June tax collections are released next month. However, a look at monthly rather than cumulative numbers paints a different picture. While indirect tax collections vis-a-vis previous year’s collections improved in May, direct tax numbers seem to have followed the reverse trend.Also Read: GST faces challenge to meet higher revenue expectationsThe recovery in indirect taxes is likely to continue in the month of June. The government reported June GST collections to have crossed Rs 90,000 crore, which was 91% of the collections in June 2019. The June collections could have included tax filings for previous months, as deadlines were extended during the lockdown.Both the central and state governments, especially the former, have increased taxes on petrol and diesel rather than passing the advantage of low crude prices to the consumers. An HT analysis showed that the gap between fuel prices here and international crude prices in the post-pandemic period continues to be the highest ever. With petrol and diesel consumption inching back to normal levels, governments will make a windfall in taxes. Petroleum ministry data shows that petrol and diesel consumption might be close to last year’s figures in July. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();On the other hand, it will not be surprising if the shortfall in direct taxes becomes bigger. Companies might have held back on lay-offs and pay-cuts in April in the hope that the lockdown would yield quick results. Such hopes have been belied. Most institutional and private forecasts for 2020-21 GDP have worsened over time. This means that outlook on profits and salaries, and therefore direct tax collections, will worsen overtime.For example, Indigo, India’s largest private airline, announced on Monday, that it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Also Read: Economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic to vary in sectorsAnecdotal evidence supports this hypothesis. A Mint report by Prashant Kumar Nanda earlier this month said at least 100,000 workers a day dipped into their statutory retirement savings in June as they grappled with income and job losses . With profitability taking a beating, corporate tax collections will also suffer. In effect, the contribution of indirect taxes, seen by some as affecting the poor more than the rich, in overall tax revenue, that was already skewed in India, is likely to become even more so because of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-may-further-skew-india-s-tax-profile/story-0XG75OWNyaklznDTjnfJ8L.html
23-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||There was talk of immunity passports as early as late March, when the Sars-Cov2 virus which causes the coronavirus disease was raging through Europe (Dispatch 18, on April 5, wrote about them). Back then, the thinking was that these passports would be issued on the basis of antibody tests — with anyone with antibodies for Covid-19 being eligible for one. These people, the argument went, could move around, work, travel, and help cities and countries get back on their feet because they couldn’t get infected.The idea was never implemented because researchers could not answer how long the antibodies or immunity (the two aren’t necessarily the same, but we will come to that shortly) would last. A recent study by researchers at the David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, may have the answer — Covid-19 antibodies have a half-life of 73 days, lower than the two years that antibodies for Sars-Cov-1 (which causes the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) last. The two numbers are not directly comparable, but the difference is clearly there and significant. The study covered only 34 patients (and all standard caveats that apply to research based on a sample that small, do). The researchers also did not study what happens to the antibodies after 90 days, but admit that there is a chance the “decay will decelerate”.The study’s finding — published in the New England Journal of Medicine — isn’t very different from another recent study published in pre-print server medRxiv by researchers from Kings College, London that found that Sars-Cov2 antibodies peak three weeks after infection, and then decline, with levels almost approaching the baseline in some cases in as little as two months. This sample size for this study was around 90 people including 64 patients.But these studies do not necessarily mean any immunity we develop to Covid-19 is transient.That’s because of T-cells (on which, suddenly, everyone seems to be an expert).According to recent research at the Karolinska Institute and the Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, twice as many people who have antibodies that fight Covid-19, have T-cells that target cells infected by the disease — which means the actual immunity in a population is higher than that measured by antibody tests. The researchers called this T-cell mediated immunity.If true (the study sampled around 200 people), this would mean that in Delhi, for instance, where a sero survey (blood test) found that 22.86% of a randomly selected sample of around 21,000 people had antibodies, the actual level of immunity could be much higher, perhaps as much as 45%, a little over the 43% a study by the universities of Stockholm and Nottingham came up with as the herd immunity baseline for Covid-19. That could explain a lot of things — including why the number of daily cases started declining in the Capital.This column wondered sometime back whether there was a peak infection rate after which the spread of the disease started declining. If the Swedish study holds, it could mean that the prevalence or infection rate itself is perhaps much higher than what is measured using antibody tests.Indeed, T-cells are emerging as the real heroes of the pandemic. According to another recent study by Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School, Singapore’s National Centre for Infectious Diseases, and others, Sars-Cov2 generates specific T-cells and, more importantly, coronaviruses such as this one activate T-cells with long-lasting memory. For instance, the study found that people who were infected by Sars in 2003, and recovered, still have T-cells specific to Sars-Cov1, and that these T-cells actually help protect them from Sars-Cov2. The researchers said that this cross immunity, as they termed it, could explain why some people are either immune already, or react to the infection differently from others (for instance, they might not infect others, or the intensity of infection could be lower).In essence, if all these studies hold, while the antibodies specific to Covid-19 might not last long, the number of people who are immune is actually higher than the number of those who have antibodies because of T-cells, which, it emerges, continue to be produced long after the infection in the case of coronaviruses.I would treat that as really good news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-41Ww26E5eDvY47BRbvK8QO.html

23-07-2020||India||Supreme Court grants bail to Bengali journalist arrested in alleged ponzi scam||The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted bail to Bengali journalist Suman Chattopadhyay who was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in December 2018 for his alleged involvement in a ponzi scam.A three-judge bench headed by justice Rohinton Nariman noted that Chattopadhyay is admitted to the Apollo Hospital in Bhubaneswar for serious heart trouble and lung infection and may, therefore, be more prone to Covid-19 infection than other prisoners.“We think this (is) one good reason for releasing the petitioner on bail. The petitioner be released on bail to the satisfaction of the trial Court immediately”, the bench comprising justices Navin Sinha and Indira Banerjee ruled.“After being in incarceration for over a year and a half, justice has finally been meted out to Chattopadhyay. The Supreme Court has long been a guardian of personal liberties of citizens, and today’s order is a reflection of that. This may be an important step in his otherwise longer drawn battle”, Chattopadhyay’s lawyer, Sahil Tagotra told HT. Chattopadhyay has served as the editor of Ananda Bazaar Patrika and Ei Shomoy, a Bengali daily. He had then started his own newspaper, Ek Din, and raised money from I-Core services which had come up using chit funds.I-Core group came under scanner after one Ajay Kumar Sahoo filed a complaint with the Bhubaneswar police that after maturity of his deposit with I-Core, the amount was not returned to him. Chattopadhyay and two promoters of I-Core were later arrested by CBI in the matter.While the promoters of I-Core were subsequently released on bail, Chattopadhyay’s bail plea was rejected earlier on several occasions both by the sessions court and the high court.The latest was on June 4 when the high court rejected the plea though Chattopadhyay had highlighted his deteriorating health coupled with the fact that he has been in jail for 18 months.Chattopadhyay submitted before the Supreme Court that the trial has not yet commenced in the case and not even a single question was put to him by CBI in the last 18 months. “Only three accused were arrested in the present case of which two main accused have already been granted bail by the high court. There has not been a single allegation against the petitioner that he may have attempted to influence the course of investigation, tamper with evidence or intimidate any witness”, the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-grants-bail-to-bengali-journalist-arrested-in-alleged-ponzi-scam/story-U7iO1eM9KXZB3DMOmItpjM.html
23-07-2020||India||India a key partner, pillar of US foreign policy: Pompeo||Describing India as one of the few trusted like-minded countries, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that New Delhi is an important partner and a key pillar of President Donald Trump’s foreign policy.In his virtual keynote address to the annual ‘India Ideas Summit’ of the US India Business Council (USIBC), Pompeo said he was happy to report that India is a “rising” US defense and security partner in the Indo-Pacific and globally.The United States, he said, “desires a new age of ambition” in its relationship with India.Asserting that the US has never been more supportive of India’s security, he said New Delhi too, is an important partner and a key pillar of President Trump’s foreign policy.“We don’t just interact on a bilateral basis. We see each other for what we are great democracies, global powers and really good friends. India is one of the few trusted like-minded countries whose leaders I call on a regular basis for counsel and collaboration on issues that span continents,” Pompeo said.“I’m confident that our relationship is only getting stronger. Let’s emerge from this current challenge more resilient and innovative than before. And let’s seize this moment to deepen cooperation between two of the world’s greatest democracies,” he added.Pompeo said the US has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the next G7 meeting to be hosted by President Trump.“We will advance the economic prosperity network. It is the group of countries and organisations that we consider natural partners with we share values like democracy, transparency and rule of law,” Pompeo said.The Group of Seven (G-7) is an international intergovernmental economic organisation consisting of seven major developed countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, which are some of the largest IMF-advanced economies in the world.Pompeo also said that he was happy to report that India is a rising US defense and security partner, in the Indo-Pacific and globally.“I’m confident that with our concerted efforts, we can protect our interests” he said.“We’ve revived the so-called quad that comprised the US, India, Japan and Australia. India is also part of a group of likeminded nations that I’ve convened regularly to advance shared interests,” he said.Navies from the US, India, Australia, Japan and France have been deepening their mutual cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region in view of China’s growing attempt to expand military influence in the resource-rich region.On Monday, a US Navy carrier strike group led by nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz carried out a military drill with a fleet of Indian warships off the coast of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Four frontline warships of the Indian Navy participated in the “PASSEX” exercise when the US carrier strike group was transiting through the Indian Ocean Region on its way from the South China Sea.The USS Nimitz is the world’s largest warship and the exercise between the two navies assumed significance as it took place in the midst of tensions between India and China in eastern Ladakh as well as in China’s military assertiveness in South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-a-key-partner-pillar-of-us-foreign-policy-pompeo/story-YVE14u6Cur7KTSrip44dKM.html

They lay these cables on the ground to drive away animals from farmland. On Wednesday morning, a 25-year-old male elephant was found dead at Bamandanga tea estate area. Forest officers said the elephant touched a low lying wire and not a cable placed by villagers to save vegetation. They described the incident as a fatal outcome of negligence by those who installed the power supply system at that spot.A 15-year-old tusker was found dead on Tuesday on a small patch of land near a house at Ramjhora tea estate in Birpara police station area. It touched an illegally powered cable.Nisha Goswami, divisional forest officer at Gorumara, said “a low lying electric cable killed the pachyderm on Wednesday.”Latiful Islam, a local panchayat member, said “The elephant must have entered the village to eat jack fruit and got electrocuted.” The last two incidents were reported at Buxa tiger Reserve forest and Madarihat near Jaldapara National Park on June 16 and June 24 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-elephant-electrocuted-in-24-hours-in-north-bengal-fourth-death-in-two-months/story-8Jh5EjeMEx5vOt8JddL1mK.html
23-07-2020||India||Invest in a country you can trust, Modi tells US||New Delhi/Washington: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday pitched India as a trustworthy and open business partner for the United States (US), seeking American investments in areas ranging from agriculture to health care to defence in a bid to boost economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.PM Modi also portrayed India as a “perfect combination of openness, opportunities and options”, said India had what was needed to power the global recovery post the pandemic, suggested that India and the US could together help the world recover, and reiterated that India’s domestic campaign for self-reliance would aid this process. The PM’s comments, while delivering the keynote address at the India Ideas Summit organised by the US India Business Council (USIBC), come in the backdrop of increased tensions of both US and India with China, for different reasons, and a search by global businesses with bases in China for alternative investment destinations. “The rise of India means a rise in trade opportunities with a nation that you can trust, a rise in global integration with increasing openness, a rise in your competitiveness with access to a market which offers scale. And a rise in your returns on investment with the availability of skilled human resources,” he said. Experts suggest that the PM’s emphasis on trust and openness is a clear attempt to contrast India with China. The PM referred to his government’s efforts over the past six years to make India’s economy more open and reform-oriented and to ensure increased competitiveness, enhanced transparency, expanded digitisation, greater innovation and policy stability. India’s opportunities, he noted, could help power the global economic recovery.Describing India and the US as natural partners, Modi said: “Now it is time our partnership plays an important role in helping the world bounce back faster after the pandemic. American investors often look out for the perfect timing to enter a sector or a country. To them, I would like to say: there has never been a better time to invest in India.”The approach to the future, the PM also said, must be a more human-centric one while focusing on resilience against external shocks, the lack of which was exposed by the pandemic. He referred to his government’s efforts to increase self-reliance in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis, saying, “Global economic resilience can be achieved by stronger domestic economic capacities. This means improved domestic capacity for manufacturing, restoring the health of the financial system and diversification of international trade.” The PM claimed that through the self-reliant campaign, India was contributing towards a prosperous and resilient world.Modi’s invitation to US business was in line with his efforts to pitch India as a trade and investment destination during the recent India-EU Summit and to build alternative supply and trade chains at a time of the heightened tensions with China following a months-long border standoff. He invited US businesses to invest in technology while pointing out that India has half-a-billion connected people, while an equal number are in the process of being connected. He also cited a recent report to claim that there were more Indians connected in rural areas than in urban areas. There were opportunities in front-line technologies such as 5G, big data analytics, quantum computing, block-chain and internet of things, he said.He also sought investments in agriculture, health care, energy, infrastructure, civil aviation, finance and insurance, and defence and space. India’s food processing sector is expected to be worth more than half a trillion dollars by 2025, while the health care sector is growing at more than 22% every year, he noted.US firms can tap opportunities in India’s efforts to moves toward a gas-based economy and in clean energy, while the number of air travels is expected to more than double within the next eight years and the country’s private airlines plan to induct more than 1,000 new aircraft over the next decade. “This is a huge opportunity for any investor who chooses to set up manufacturing facilities in India, which can become a base for supplying regional markets,” Modi said.Turning to space and defence, he said: “We are raising the FDI cap for investment in the defence sector to 74%. India has established two defence corridors to encourage production of defence equipment and platforms. We offer special incentives for private and foreign investors.” FDI flows into India during 2019-20 were worth $74 billion, an increase of 20% percent from the year before, Modi said, adding USIBC had informed him that the “pledged investment” from the US has crossed $40 billion this year. Amid the pandemic, India attracted foreign investments worth more than $20 billion between April and July, he added.The annual value of India-US trade has jumped to $140 billion and the Modi government has taken steps to increase the purchase of oil and gas from the US in recent years. However, the two sides were unable to bridge differences on key issues such as market access and tariffs to stitch together a mini trade deal in time for US President Donald Trump’s visit in February. Efforts are believed to be underway to conclude this mini trade deal before the US presidential elections at the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/invest-in-a-country-you-can-trust-modi-tells-us/story-6ofqpdINgE5dnucloKJ0gK.html
23-07-2020||India||Former JD(S) Karnataka unit chief AH Vishwanath who helped topple govt, nominated to upper house||Former Janata Dal (Secular) Karnataka unit chief A H Vishwanath who had helped topple the Congress-JD(S) coalition government led by H D Kumaraswamy and who lost the recent by-polls on a BJP ticket, was nominated to the Upper House in Karnataka by Governor Vajubhai Vala.Vishwanath who was earlier with Congress had joined the JD(S) after falling out with Siddaramiah and was made the JD(S) state unit chief. However, after differences with the Gowda family which controls JD(S) he had helped topple the coalition government.However, in the December 2019 by-polls held for 15 seats, Vishwanath was one of the prominent candidates to lose contesting on a BJP ticket. He had over the last few months expressed unhappiness at not being ‘rewarded’ for his role in ensuring a BJP government in the state. He had also promised to write a tell-all book called ‘Bombay Days’ with all the details of ‘Operation Kamala’ which lead to the formation of a BJP government in the state. The title refers to the days that 17 dissident MLAs had stayed put in Bombay (Mumbai) and helped topple the coalition government in Karnataka.Along with Vishwanath, four others have been nominated to the Vidhana Parishad by the Governor including senior BJP leaders C P Yogeshwar and Bharathi Shetty apart from Shantharama Budnna Siddi and Dr Talwar Sabanna. A senior BJP leader who did not want to be identified defended the move of nominating party leaders in the eminent citizens’ category and said: “Vishwanath has been nominated in the literature category as he has written a few books, Yogeshwar in the arts and culture as he was an actor earlier, Bharathi Shetty is a social activist, Siddi belongs to the tribal community and Talwar to the backward community.”Political analyst Manjunath said that by nominating Vishwanath and Yogeshwar to the Upper House, CM Yediyurappa has kept his promise to reward them for helping him come back to power. Yogeshwar is an old political foe of Kumaraswamy. “While it is unfortunate that political leaders who have lost in polls are being sent to the Upper House in this way, all parties have done this and are equally guilty. In a way the current nominations are a careful balancing act of one woman, tribal, a backward class representative as well as two politically important leaders being rewarded. Yediyurappa’s stamp can be seen in the choice of candidates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-jd-s-karnataka-unit-chief-ah-vishwanath-who-helped-topple-govt-nominated-to-upper-house/story-ob3buKEVvLt3W5WckqgtBI.html
23-07-2020||India||Speaker moves SC against order stalling proceedings||The Supreme Court will hear on Thursday a plea by the speaker of Rajasthan legislative assembly, CP Joshi, challenging the July 21 order of the Rajasthan high court asking him to defer till July 24, action on notices he issued to Sachin Pilot and 18 dissident Congress legislators, as the first step in their disqualification process. Joshi said in his plea that the high court order restraining the speaker of the assembly from continuing with disqualification proceedings is in violation of settled legal principles and an intrusion into the exclusive domain of the speaker.“The Supreme Court has a duty to ensure that the all the authorities under the Constitution exercise their jurisdiction within the boundaries and respective ‘Lakshman Rekha’ envisaged by the Constitution itself. Judiciary was never expected under the 10th schedule to interfere in the manner it has done in the instant case resulting in this constitutional impasse,” the plea filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes said.“We need to see if a mere show-cause notice (issued to the MLAs) on a petition (submitted by chief whip Mahesh Joshi) is beyond the speaker’s authority,” Joshi said earlier in the day in a press conference in Jaipur, during which he said he would approach the apex court.Meanwhile, Pilot and the 18 MLAs also filed a caveat before the Supreme Court on Wednesday, which means they will have to be heard by the Supreme Court before any order can be passed.“The law on this aspect is settled since a long time. In 1992, a five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court in Kihoto Hollohan’s case upheld the validity of the 10th Schedule (which deals with disqualification of law makers for defection) of the Constitution and said that courts cannot pass any stay order on proceedings before the speaker. The order of Rajasthan high court stays the disqualification proceedings before the speaker, which is in conflict with the Kihoto judgment and, hence, we have approached the Supreme Court to stay the high court order”, Fernandes said. That case stemmed from disqualification of some MLAs of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly and crystallised many principles regarding the powers of the speaker.In his press conference, Joshi too referred to the case, Kihoto Hollohan vs Zachillhu and Others, dating back to 1992, and that in it, the Supreme Court ruled that till the speaker takes a decision on disqualification applications, injunction orders aren’t passed related to members against whom applications are pending. “I am disappointed with the court’s directions,” he added. “This matter is of urgent nature. The order has reduced my constitutional authority, which is prima facie against the apex court’s decision.”In that case, the top court ruled that the judicial review should not cover any stage prior to the making of a decision by the speaker/chairman. No interference would be permissible at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings, the court said then.Joshi’s petition emphasises that. “In view of the aforesaid, the (high court) order is ex-facie illegal, perverse, and in derogation of the powers of the Speaker under the Constitution and hence deserve to be set aside,” it said. The Rajasthan high court, on Tuesday, directed the speaker not to take any action against Pilot and other MLAs till July 24.This order was passed after Pilot and the other MLAs had approached the high court on July 15, challenging the speaker’s notice which had asked them to furnish an explanation by July 17 on why they shouldn’t be disqualified from the assembly for their conduct, which the Congress party alleged was detrimental to the interest of the party and showed their intention to quit the party.“I am bound to pass orders on these applications as a constitutional authority,” Joshi said in the press conference. Pilot and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot have been at odds since the Congress government came to power in 2018. Gehlot was made CM while Pilot had to settle for the post of Deputy CM. Gehlot blamed Pilot for the party’s rout in the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan last year; Vaibhav Gehlot, the chief minister’s son, lost from Jodhpur in the election. Pilot, in turn, believed that he had no powers, with even appointments in ministries under him being made by Gehlot. The tussle became public earlier this month after Rajasthan police sought to question Pilot over allegations of attempting to pull down the Congress government in Rajasthan. Pilot was eventually sacked as deputy CM.The speaker’s notice to Pilot was based on the disqualification petition filed by the chief whip of the Congress in Rajsthan, Mahesh Joshi. Joshi, in his plea, cited the absence of the MLAs from two Congress legislature party meetings, held on July 13 and 14, despite specific instructions to attend it. This, he claimed, showed their intention to leave the Congress.Pilot and the other dissident MLAs have maintained they never had the intention to leave the Congress party and were exercising their right to criticise the party leadership and the functioning of chief minister Ashok Gehlot. In a democratic set-up, voicing disagreement with policies or decisions made by the party doesn’t amount to acting against the interests of the party, so as to lead to disqualification, they said in their petition before the high court.“Kihoto Hollohan is very specific that no quia-timet actions (injunctions to prevent wrongful acts) can be entertained. The speaker under the 10th schedule, may act as a tribunal, but judicial review is available only after the final judgment. Courts do not get into the internal functioning of legislatures is the principle of law since Bradlaugh v Gosset (UK judgment of 1884) and Keshav Singh case (of 1964) in India”, senior counsel Sanjay Hegde told HT.The matter will be heard by a three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra and also comprising justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari.“The petition by the speaker is pre-mature since the honourable high court has only reserved its order. It is only appropriate that the party to the case wait for the high court order before approaching the Supreme Court in appeal,” Pilot’s lawyer S Hariharan told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speaker-moves-sc-against-order-stalling-proceedings/story-EtJvdrkT1sOINvJDHV0NEI.html
23-07-2020||India||Delhi to conduct sero survey every month||A new citywide blood sampling will be carried out in the first five days of every month beginning in August, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said on Wednesday, announcing a regular survey to determine how much further Covid-19 may have spread in the Capital – a strategy that could show how close the city is to achieving herd immunity and whether it needs to tweak its response measures. The announcement came a day after the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) released results from the first such surveillance – known as a serological study – showing that 22.86% of 21,387 people who were tested showed signs of being exposed to the virus.“Sero-survey identifies people who have recovered from the disease. The 23% result of the previous survey is most likely to be people who got infected around mid-June, because antibodies take around 15 days to develop. It has been more than a month now. The government plans to make it a monthly exercise. We shall be doing the next sero-survey between August 1 and 5,” Jain said.The figures from the NCDC report, if extrapolated, could mean that over 4.5 million people -- or nearly 1 in every 4 - have had the disease and recovered till June end, manifold more than the 126,323 confirmed till Wednesday. They also suggest that the disease kills only 0.07% of people infected, as opposed to the 2.94% fatality rate in the city.The findings led experts to conclude that the peak of infections in the Capital was definitely over. “The biggest silver lining is that if we have such high population that was exposed in the past but did not largely display serious symptoms or succumbed -- then it is as good as a vaccine,” Dr Sujeet K Singh, director, NCDC, told HT on Tuesday. But, experts maintain that there is no room for complacency and people need to continue with precautionary measures such as social distancing and wearing masks.Epidemiologists believe an infection prevalence rate of 40-65% in a particular population could be adequate to reach a level known as herd immunity, when the number of people who have never had the disease (and are not protected by antibodies that infected people build) dwindle to such an extent that an infectious disease dies out due to a lack of vulnerable hosts.Jain, when asked about herd immunity by reporters he was interacting with, said even experts differ on this concept. “Usually, it is perceived as a stage when around 40% to 70% people have recovered from the disease. We cannot comment on herd immunity at this stage. We will get a better picture of that after the numbers of fresh cases stop emerging,” he said.The minister added that “there definitely was spread in the community”. “Whether one can call it community spread is a very technical thing as per the guidelines and protocols that are followed,” he said, asking people to remain cautious. “Around 77% of people are still vulnerable and we cannot be complacent. We should be serious about maintaining social distance, wearing masks and washing our hands regularly.”According to Jain, the protocol for the new surveys is still being finalised. “We are chalking out a strategy. It will be spread across the city, cover both containment zones and normal areas, include individuals of different age groups and the sample size will not be less than the previous survey,” he said.Officials in the health department, who asked not to be named, said the survey will be carried out by district surveillance teams and health department officials between the 1st and 5th of every month. The teams will fan out across neighbourhoods from where they will pick out people according to the stratification they need to follow, varying samples by age, gender and locality to represent as random a set as possible, this person said. The tests will be done through the Covid Kavach kit developed by Gujarat-based Zydus Cadila.NCDC, which carried out the previous survey on behalf of the Delhi government, is unlikely to be involved this time. The local teams carrying out the process will report to the district magistrates. “The sero surveys need to be repeated periodically to be able to establish a trend with respect to the disease spread. When ICMR approved antibody (blood) testing, it had advised all states to conduct sero-surveillance using the test from time to time to get a sense of how the disease has spread within the community. This is to be done by states and the Centre will pitch in if they require assistance, especially those with high disease burden,” said a Union health ministry official, requesting anonymity. Dr Lalit Kant, the former, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “Sero-survey done periodically can help the government focus their efforts – both in terms of speed and scale – in protecting the population still vulnerable to exposure to the Sars-CoV-2 virus.” “As far as the sample size is concerned, it is determined through a formula that primarily depends on prevalence rate of the disease. In Delhi, the prevalence rate has gone up, so the sample size for the upcoming survey is likely to be higher,” he added.Experts cautioned that Covid-19 still is scantly understood, especially with how it can lead to no symptoms in large proportions of the infected population, and that antibody testing in itself was a complicated process due to the way the virus behaves. “We are dealing with a new virus here and there is a lot of unknown. For instance, at this juncture, we do not know how long antibodies would stay in the human body after recovery from Covid. That is what makes trend analysis important,” said Puneet Misra, professor of community medicines in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi. “Methodology and sample selection will play a crucial role in the upcoming sero-surveys and the government should consider involving experts and specialists in this regard,” he added.(With inputs from Rhythma Kaul)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/city-to-conduct-sero-survey-every-month/story-qU3DnBTErfM2czYLytM7fL.html
23-07-2020||India||Rain, lockdown push vegetable prices up across the country||Prices of commonly consumed vegetables, such as potatoes and tomatoes, have risen sharply across the country, with major wholesale markets running low on supplies due to disruptions caused heavy rains and lockdowns, apart from lower output of some items and higher fuel costs. On Tuesday, the average all-India retail price of potatoes stood at Rs 35 a kg, while tomatoes were selling for an average of Rs 55 a kg, up from Rs 20 and Rs 30 on July 1, data from the consumer affairs ministry showed. Rains and partial or complete lockdown in cities such as Bangalore, Pune, Guwahati and Bhopal to contain the spread of Covid-19, have upended supply chains, causing prices of commonly consumed vegetables to spike manifold. Among kitchen staples, households are paying the highest for potatoes and tomatoes. Onion prices are stable or have fallen in some markets due to higher production last winter, officials in wholesale markets said. A combination of factors is behind the rising prices, traders said. “Farmers in many states dumped perishables during the lockdown, unable to find buyers. So, tomatoes are in short supply. Transportation costs have risen 5-10% because of fuel price hikes by the government,” Maruti Mallale, the proprietor of Mahesh Vegetable Company at Maharashtra’s Vashi said.At Delhi’s Azadpur wholesale market, during July 13-19, the average wholesale price of potatoes rose 53.5% from a year ago, the sharpest rise in four years, data from the consumer affairs ministry’s Agmarknet tracker showed. During the same period, potato quantity brought for trade dropped 42% in the market. Azadpur is the national capital’s biggest hub for vegetable trade and sets benchmark retail prices across the national capital region. During the same period, tomato prices at the Azadpur market rose 33.9% from a year ago, while its arrival fell 37%. “Supply of most of the vegetables has been affected. Arrivals in cold storage have been 30% less,” said Anil Chaudhury, an official of Agra Cold Storage Association. This suggests that farmers have grown less potato during 2019-20, he said. Onion prices, on the other hand, have declined. Average prices of onions in the Azadpur market fell 20.9% in the July 13-19 week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-lockdown-push-vegetable-prices-up/story-GAcS0nZ8UfoUFbIM6HFqfN.html
23-07-2020||India||NK Singh stresses on Centre-state ties in fight against pandemic||India’s ability to fight Covid-19 largely rests on how well it manages Centre-state relations, NK Singh, the chairman of the 15th Finance Commission, said.Singh was addressing students of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Bangalore on Wednesday through video conference.“Giving a lecture on ‘Impact of Pandemic on Fiscal Architecture - Fiscal Federalism in the Near Future’, I stressed the need to reset the fiscal architecture in light of the pandemic. Unlike other countries, India has far more harmonious management of the Centre-State polity,” Singh tweeted. He said the states, which are fighting the pandemic, need resources, and the government should relax their borrowing limits. “This is the time for fiscal norms to be suitably relaxed. States need greater room to meet additional obligations caused by the pandemic,” IIM Banglore said in a tweet quoting him.In order to give fiscal space to states in this time of crisis, the Union government recently raised their borrowing limits. Announcing the last tranche of Rs 20 lakh crore ‘Atamnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-Reliant India Initiative) on May 17, finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Centre also accepted the demand of states to raise their borrowing limit from 3% of their respective gross state domestic product (GSDP) to 5%, and this would give them additional resources of Rs 4.28 lakh crore during the Covid crisis.The increased limit, however, depended on implementation of reforms by the states in four areas — one-nation-one-ration-card, ease of doing business, power distribution, and urban local body revenues, she said. In a statement, the finance ministry on July 12 said that it issued a formal communication to state governments raising borrowing limits by 2% of their projected GSDP in 2020-21 subject to implementation of specific state-level reforms.Speaking at IIM Bangalore, Singh explained the concept of “fiscal federalism”, a term first introduced by the German-born American economist Richard Musgrave in 1959 that deals with the division of government functions and financial relations between levels of government.He revisiting the evolution of fiscal federalism in India, which primarily dates back to pre-Independence era and emanates from the government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935. While the 1919 act provided for a separation of revenue heads between the Centre and provinces, the 1935 Act allowed the sharing of Centre’s revenues and the provision of grants-in-aid to provinces.He also explained the difference between “Union” and “Federation”. “Political scientist Alfred Stepan classified India as a “holding together” as opposed to a “coming together” federation. Unlike the federal form of government in the United States, which is described as an indestructible Union composed of indestructible states, India is an indestructible Union of destructible states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nk-singh-stresses-on-centre-state-ties-in-fight-against-pandemic/story-4dyStmoKIaWxeJVubnjIDP.html
23-07-2020||India||Maha becomes first state to add 10k infections in a day||Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 10,576 Covid-19 infections, the first in excess of 10,000 and its steepest single-day increase, as its tally rose to 337,607. The state has 136,980 active cases with a recovery rate of 55.62%. Maharashtra also recorded 280 fatalities on Wednesday, taking its death toll to 12,556.Pune city recorded the highest number of cases on Wednesday at 2,111, followed by Mumbai at 1,310. Confirmed cases in Pune stood at 43,645, while Mumbai’s tally was 104,678. Wednesday also saw the case count in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), excluding Mumbai, going up to 105,300, surpassing Mumbai’s tally.The state has been clocking over 8,000 cases daily for the past six days with infections increasing in the remaining eight municipal corporations outside Mumbai in MMR and in districts such as Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Solapur. The number of active cases in tier-two cities and towns of Maharashtra has seen a steep increase in the past month. Officials said they were confident there will not be any shortage of beds in these districts considering the new wave of infections could stretch health infrastructure. Senior government officials attributed the increase in active cases to the increased daily testing across districts and increased movement of people.An analysis of state health department data showed that Pune district had 7,071 active cases on June 22, and on July 21 it had 36,810 active cases, which its 61.61% of the total infections recorded in the district. A month ago, it had 43.97% active cases.Thane has the second-highest number of active cases at 36,180, which is 45.27% of the total caseload in the district. The Thane district, which has six municipal corporations under it, has been clocking a high number of cases in the past month. On June 22, it had 25,390 cases with 14,555 active infections. On July 22, its tally stood at 79,911 cases with 36,180 active infections.Nashik district has witnessed a similar spike over the past month. It had 1,185 active cases on June 22, which rose to 4,221 on July 21, accounting for 41.16% of the total cases.Solapur, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Jalna, and Latur districts have all seen similar caseload spikes. Kolhapur district, which had 62 active cases on June 22, had 1,401 active cases on July 21, accounting for 58.06% of the total cases in the district. Kolhapur district had 747 Covid-19 cases till June 22, which rose to 2,413, as of Tuesday.“In the past two to three weeks, we have seen a steep increase in the number of cases from rural as well as urban areas of the district. Between March and June, we did not see many cases, but the new wave has increased the active caseload in the district. We have ramped up health infrastructure, we have set up Covid Care Centres and requisitioned ICU beds from private hospitals,” said Dr BC Kempi Patil, civil surgeon, Kolhapur.Latur and Jalna districts, too, have over 50% active cases in comparison to the total cases registered. In Latur, there were 631 active cases as of July 21 (51.25% of the total cases). In the same period, Jalgaon district saw a decrease in the active caseload, from 41.22% to 28.46%. However, the absolute number of cases has gone up from 2,426 on June 22 to 8,138 on Wednesday.Active cases in Parbhani and Washim districts are comparatively lower in absolute numbers with 212 and 217, respectively. However, there has been a substantial increase from June. On June 22, Parbhani had seven active cases, and now it has 212 active, which made up 53.25% of the district’s total. Washim had 31 active cases and now has 217 active cases, which accounted for 56.07% of the total caseload in the district. Buldhana’s active case tally was 417, which was 62.33% of the total caseload.A senior government official said they were carrying out rapid antigen tests that gave faster results so as to stop the spread of virus in the period between tests and results of suspected patients. The official said that the “intermingling” of people of semi-urban areas and rural areas was a “possible explanation” for the wave of infections in these areas. Barring Thane, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Mumbai districts, the restrictions had been lifted much earlier in other districts as the cases were not many.“We do not want the outbreak to go out of hand in rural and semi-urban areas. We have seen an increase in these (rural and semi-urban) areas, but the increase is not exponential. All districts are now starting to use the rapid antigen kits for faster results. We have ramped up testing, tracing and treatment. The availability of beds will not be an issue as cases are not growing exponentially,” a senior government official said, who did not wish to be named. The official added that district administration has been asked to aggressively follow tracing, especially in densely populated areas of their districts.Meanwhile, Mumbai on Wednesday recorded 58 more fatalities, taking its toll to 5,875, while Pune city recorded 36 deaths, which pushed its toll to 1,117. Pimpri-Chinchwad recorded 1,133 new cases and 18 fatalities. Nashik recorded 298 new cases, while Ahmednagar district and city recorded 240 and 201 fresh Covid-19 cases. Kolhapur district reported 193 new infections, while Aurangabad city, which is nearing 8000 confirmed cases, reported 248 new Covid-19 cases.Maharashtra has so far tested 16,87,213 people with an overall positivity rate of 20%. So far, 187,769 Covid-19 patients have recovered and have been discharged. Currently, 858,121 people are in home quarantine and 44,975 people are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-becomes-first-state-to-add-10k-infections-in-a-day/story-Km2879DfnElknmQDiYJABO.html
23-07-2020||India||First antigen kit of Indian make gets ICMR approval||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday approved a second rapid antigen test kit, by Mylab Discovery Solutions, to diagnose coronavirus disease (Covid-19). This is the first Indian made test kit to be granted an approval.The test, named Pathocatch Covid-19 Antigen Rapid testing kit, is developed and manufactured in India. It will be immediately available for orders and will be priced around Rs 450.“Mylab team is working really hard to fight this pandemic in every possible way. After bringing an affordable RT-PCR test to reduce dependence on foreign kits, we launched Compact XL to accelerate Covid-19 testing. Now, with the approval for an antigen testing kit, we will cover whole spectrum of Covid-19 testing and leave no stone unturned to fight this pandemic,” said Hasmukh Rawal, managing director, Mylab Discovery Solutions. Mylab’s real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test kit was also the first indigenous test kit that received ICMR approval for use in India.Antigen-based testing is being used alongside rRT-PCR to scale up the country’s overall testing and treat patients early. Rapid antigen test is quicker than the rRT-PCR, as it takes just about 30 minutes, compared to about five hours for rRT-PCR testing. The process does not require a sophisticated laboratory, which is a key requirement for rRT-PCR tests. “That is the only way to break the transmission scale, by identifying those who are infected and isolating them so that they don’t spread the disease further,” said Jacob John, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore.Prior to this, the ICMR had approved antigen test kits by SD Biosensor, a south Korean company, which has a branch in Manesar of Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-antigen-kit-of-indian-make-gets-icmr-approval/story-Aj1lAHLJLSUOANbOJgNyzL.html
23-07-2020||India||Experts call for national database on coronavirus||India needs a centralised national database on everything related to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including standardised data on turnaround testing time, surveillance, home and hospital isolation, and proportion of cases among people with contact history , say epidemiologists and public health experts.In an opinion article in The New York Times, the former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tom Frieden recommended the compilation of standardised data on a range of parameters to better manage the pandemic that has so far infected 15,154,448 and killed 621,172 across the world. He wrote, specifically of the US that “we aren’t tracking the public health equivalent of vital signs” and that this is a “big reason the US is losing the battle against Covid-19”. Frieden’s article is based on work done by his current organisation, NGO Resolve to Save Lives, which, according to an article in NYT found that states were reporting only 40% of the “data needed to fight the pandemic”. In some ways, experts say, India is similar to the US in terms of its geographical size and diversity. The same data collection and standardisation problems the US has, are also manifest here, they add. The Resolve to Save Lives website lists some of this data. These include: “new confirmed and probable cases and per capita rates by date with 7-day moving average”;“new screening (antigen) and diagnostic (PCR) testing per capita rates by date, with threshold, with 7-day moving average”; “CLI (Covid-19 like illness) and ILI (influenza like illness) trends from emergency departments”; “diagnostic test turnaround time (specimen collection to test report), by week”; “time from specimen collection to isolation of cases”; and “new infections among health care workers not confirmed to have been contracted outside of the workplace, by week”.Epidemiologists in India say this data is crucial for clinical and epidemiological research. “It is all relevant data, especially turnaround time for testing as in most urban areas where there is a surge in cases, we see that there is considerable delay in testing, which further leads to delay in communicating positive results, and can eventually affect the time of isolation of cases. Hence, these are important parameters to document, and should be documented scientifically. What does not get reviewed won’t get done,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, professor, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.Experts also advocate transparency — they suggest national data must be shared real-time with the public to empower them to protect themselves.“Merely documenting information is not enough; what is documented should be put out in public domain for the benefit of people at large. If data is accessible publicly then there will be people willing to analyse it and come to conclusions that can help guide decision makers towards the right direction. As things stand now, the information that is in public domain is only what the government wants you to know. That’s not how it should be,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head, epidemiology and communicable diseases division, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “I should have access to information on, say, who is dying-- is it those who are marginalized and don’t have access to health care services or the section that has access to treatment. Also, which are the hot spots that I should avoid in case I am stepping out .” Union health ministry officials say that the centre has been closely monitoring the Covid-19 situation across states and union territories, and data generated through its testing and surveillance network is regularly updated at the central level.A union health ministry official said India is already collecting much of this data and following many of the suggestions mentioned in the article. “Our integrated disease surveillance programme network is updated on a real-time basis and the data is collected till the grassroots level. There is a dashboard in the ministry that is fed all relevant information from states. Laboratories testing Covid-19 samples are also feeding real-time information digitally on identified online platforms. Central teams are being regularly sent to states with high case load to coordinate with and assist local governments in managing the outbreak and look for gaps that need to be filled,” said a senior health ministry official, who did not wish to be identified.Where there are lapses, the problem is largely with the states, the official added. “At least 80% of the contacts are currently being traced within 72 hours of reporting of a case, but it is not the same across states. States are being asked to ensure test results are put out within 48 hours of sample collection, but many states are not following it. “Separate data is being generated from SARI and ILI cases for which all these patients are being tested for Covid-19 in the country. Some states are doing exceedingly well in data reporting such as Maharashtra and Gujarat where we can say the (real) numbers are what is being reported.” There is a huge variation in tests being done per million population across states. While a lot of data may not be available in the public domain, it is available to those who need it, said an ICMR official. “Testing data is duly documented from all 1270 approved laboratories that are conducting Covid-19 tests. Once a lab receives a sample, it takes up to six hours to process it and enter data into the ICMR web portal. The turnaround time is a maximum of 48 hours. All information is not being put out in public domain but internally the data is accessible to everyone who wants details. It’s an absolutely transparent and streamlined system,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, spokesperson, ICMR. Still, there is a massive discrepancy in testing rates, and opacity about turnaround testing time, surveillance and contact tracing , say experts. “Aggressive testing is needed but we must also keep in mind that it has to be done in a scientific way, as per the requirement of each state given the country is diverse and no two states will have the same requirement. Some states will have lower testing capacity even though they need more. Focus on states that are backwards in comparison and help them build capacity to meet the demand, ” said Dr Jacob John, former head, virology department, CMC Vellore.Frieden adds in his op-ed that the data would help serve as “an early warning system” about potential outbreaks or flare-ups; help improve “turnaround time of tests”; provide information on “size, lethality and status of control of every outbreak”; and make the system accountable for “how many health care workers have been infected each week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-call-for-national-database-on-coronavirus/story-gtk0VU9B1puqizWCaOd8DJ.html
23-07-2020||India||AAP leaders seek Tripura CM’s resignation||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday put forward a Jat and a Sikh leader from their fold to demand the resignation of Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb over comments that triggered outrage among members of both communities.At an event at the Agartala Press Club on Sunday, Deb said that every community in India has “certain characteristics”. He averred that while Bengalis could not be challenged on intelligence, those from Punjabi and Jat communities are known for their physical strength but have “less brains”. Deb later apologised for his comments.Delhi’s revenue and transport minister Kailash Gahlot and AAP’s Jat leader from Najafgarh area and Tilak Nagar MLA Jarnail Singh on Wednesday asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) what action was taken against Deb.“I ask Dushyant Chautala, you’re also a Jat, if you’re feeble-minded or mad, then how did you become Haryana’s deputy chief minister? Chautala should also ask for Tripura CM Biplab Deb’s resignation. We demand Biplab Deb’s resignation. Insult of Jats won’t be tolerated,” Gahlot said.Dushyant Chautala, the chief of the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), is running a coalition government in Haryana with the BJP. Jarnail Singh asked if the BJP has sent a notice to Deb or taken any action. “If they have not done anything that will mean that the BJP agrees with such regressive thought,” he said.On Wednesday, the Delhi assembly’s committee for peace and harmony held a meeting to review the complaints received against the Tripura chief minister.“After the careful examination of the complaints and impugned remarks, it has been prima facie found that these statements are inflammatory, unacceptable by any set of community standards. The committee noted that the impugned remarks are highly unbecoming of a chief minister,” the committee’s chairman Raghav Chadha RP Singh, national general secretary of the BJP who is also the party’s Sikh leader, said the AAP is dragging the issue despite Deb apologising for his remarks. “Deb has already apologised for his comments and people of both the communities have accepted it as well. So, the matter is long resolved. The AAP is unnecessarily dragging the issue to keep itself relevant in the media,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-leaders-seek-tripura-cm-s-resignation/story-cltw2ThCjwkY3Km3XljTeL.html
23-07-2020||India||Assam gas well: 3 foreign experts sustain burns||GUWAHATI: The efforts to plug a blowout of a natural gas well, which has been on fire since June 9 in Assam’s Tinuskia, suffered a setback on Wednesday afternoon when three foreign experts sustained burn injuries while they were working to control the fire.The gas well, which is owned by Oil India Limited (OIL) and is located at Baghjan, suffered a blowout (a sudden and uncontrolled release of gas or oil) on May 27 and caught fire two weeks later, killing two firefighters and destroying over a dozen houses in the area.While some reports said there was a blast near the gas well, OIL denied it. “There was no blast at the site as is being reported. The foreign experts and another person working at the site sustained minor burn injuries while trying to cap the well. They are all out of danger,” said OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika. An official, who spoke to PTI on condition of anonymity, said on-ground reports suggested there was a blast and its scale and nature were being ascertained.An environmental researcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “...A loud sound was heard.”The experts have been taken to a hospital at Dibrugarh, Oil India Limited’s senior manager, public affairs, Jayanata Bormudoi, said. The three experts injured on Wednesday, Anthony Steven Reynolds, Craig Neil Duncan and Doug Dallas, are from Alert Disaster Control, a Singapore-based firm engaged in plugging the blowout.A blowout that began in the oilfield on May 27 led to the uncontrollable flow of oil from gas well 5 – causing extensive damage to biodiversity and wildlife the region, according to a preliminary report on the environmental damage caused by the incident. The wildlife in the region includes, among several other species, the endangered hoolock gibbons and the Gangetic dolphins.According to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, the incident took place when the foreign experts hired by OIL were removing a spool from the well head — a task performed before installing a blowout preventer (BOP) to cap the fire. Work at the site was called off for the day after the incident.“The experts were provided immediate medical attention by doctor at well site and later on, they were taken to burn unit section of Astha Nursing Home at Dibrugarh. They have been released after dressing of the burn injuries. It is expected that operations will resume at Baghjan on Thursday,” OIL said in a statement.Work on capping the well was at an advanced stage when the incident took place. According to OIL, tasks such as excavation of ramps and cellar have been completed and the equipment to cap the well is ready. “Constant water umbrella, dewatering of ramp/cellar works were being carried out to provide a safe working space for personnel (involved in capping the well),” the OIL statement said.“The well control operation continues and capping of the well is expected shortly,” OIL tweeted.Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan took stock of the situation and wished speedy recovery to the three foreign experts. There are 17 oil wells and five gas wells in the Baghjan oil field, Baghjan oil field generates 1,200 kilolitres of crude oil per day and 1.5 to 2 million metric standard cubic metres per day of gas. OIL supplies crude oil to several refineries including Digboi refineries in Assam, it also supplies gas to various power companies and fertiliser companies and 400+ tea estates according to OIL.A preliminary report on the damage, by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) found that oil had leaked into the principal stream of Lohit river, polluting the water and the adjoining Maguri-Motapung wetland. “The toxic fumes and oil coating have universally affected flora and fauna. The contaminants and oil are continuing to be released and immediate steps are needed to contain this spill over. The toxins released are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments,” the report said.The well had a blowout during a work to extract gas from a new depth. While efforts were underway to control the blowout, the well caught fire and damaged houses located nearby. Nearly 2,000 families were evacuated from the area, with many of them residing in relief camps.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered the formation of an expert committee last month to probe the blowout and subsequent fire and assess the damage caused to human life, wildlife and environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-gas-well-3-foreign-experts-sustain-burns/story-cxRrglXF5fcRvU1cQkgKBJ.html
23-07-2020||India||SC rules out physical hearings for now, to take a call in 4 weeks||Resumption of normal court proceedings could jeopardise the health of those who will attend them including judges and lawyers, Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde said on Wednesday, hinting that physical hearings at the Supreme Court might not resume for the time being. The CJI also said a seven-judge administrative committee will decide in four weeks whether or not regular hearings can restart.The remarks were made during hearings of two separate matters including a petition filed by Bar Council of India (BCI) highlighting the financial crunch faced by lawyers after the shutdown of courts due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The other matter relates to the reservation in promotions.“Resumption of normal court proceedings jeopardizes all those who attend Court - judges, lawyers and all those who attend court. Medical advice is to not start resumption of Court immediately. Nonetheless, we find it is not possible to ignore the plight of lawyers,” the CJI said while hearing the BCI case.The court then took up suo motu a case for extending financial assistance to lawyers and issued notices to all high court and the Supreme Court Bar associations to examine the feasibility of setting up a relief fund to support the deserving lawyers.“We issue notice to all recognized HC [high court] and SC [Supreme Court] Bar Associations to show cause why a fund for relief of deserving and eligible lawyers should not be set up and further to enable them to invite donations from own members or legitimate sources,” the court said.Notices were also issued to the Centre and high courts.Later in the day, while hearing the case on the reservation, lawyers appearing in the matter requested the CJI to hear the case in open court and not via videoconferencing. The CJI then said the seven-judge committee will review the situation to take a call on whether or not physical hearing should resume.The Supreme Court has been hearing cases via videoconferencing since March 23 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic that has necessitated social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rules-out-physical-hearings-for-now-to-take-a-call-in-4-weeks/story-IrJyCHD1BjEAznbxIakA6I.html
23-07-2020||India||CAG ensured efficiency in govt ops: Naidu||Vice president M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday lauded the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), saying its reports have led to changes in the regulatory framework, governance structures, and delivery mechanism and thereby ensured efficiency and effectiveness of the government’s operations. “Today, the CAG has evolved as an enabler to Babasaheb’s [Bhimrao Ambedkar] vision that not only ensures public financial accountability but also acts as a friend, philosopher and guide of the executive,” he said while unveiling Ambedkar’s statue at the CAG office in New Delhi.He said Ambedkar, as the Constitution’s architect, is one of the builders of the modern India, which mandates the CAG to promote accountability, transparency and good governance through high-quality auditing and accounting and provide independent assurance to stakeholders, the legislature, the executive and the public, that public funds are being used efficiently and for the intended purposes.He said although the history of the audit department is almost 160-year-old, it was the Constitution that proved catalytic in transforming this organisation of the colonial era into the CAG of India as an independent pillar of Indian parliamentary democracy. “Today CAG is a strong and credible institution and the credit for this must go to the framers of our Constitution, particularly to Dr Ambedkar, who had the vision to ensure independence and wide mandate to the CAG.”He said Ambedkar’s life and work have inspired the nation. Naidu added it is heartening to see that the core values of the CAG—independence, objectivity, integrity, reliability, professional excellence, transparency and positive approach—draw inspiration from Ambedkar’s life and work.“For all the citizens of India, the Constitution remains a sacred book and a guiding beacon on all matters. We should salute the constitution-framers for their vision and statesmanship in giving us a constitution that laid a strong foundation for our parliamentary democracy and stood the test of times.”Naidu said house members should “question themselves if they had acted to enhance the dignity of the institution or to the contrary at the end of each day during the session and if their conduct was ethical during the inter-session period”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cag-ensured-efficiency-in-govt-ops-naidu/story-OY4rK8yNpmyoGBKrgg1ZnN.html
23-07-2020||India||Focus on resolving India-US trade issues: Jaishankar||India and the United States (US) should resolve their pending trade problems and “move on to something bigger” on the economic front by focusing on areas such as innovation and technology, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday.On the geo-political front, the minister said that the US has to learn to “work with a more multi-polar world with more plurilateral arrangements” and “go beyond the alliances which it has grown up [with] over the last two generations”, and suggested that India and the US together can shape the world. Jaishankar made the remarks during a discussion at the India Ideas Summit organised by the US India Business Council (USIBC). Speaking on the theme “Leading in times of crisis: Perspectives on US-India cooperation”, the minister side-stepped a question from the moderator, former US national security advisor Stephen Hadley, on whether the two countries should work towards a free trade agreement and noted that their discussions on trade in the last few years were dominated by “complaints”.It is in the mutual interest of both sides to resolve pending problems and “move on to something bigger”, Jaishankar said. There is a much bigger connect between the two countries beyond trade, as they are already working together on issues such as maritime security, counter-terrorism, connectivity, how to respond to pandemics, and climate change. Jaishankar, however, noted that going beyond the exchange of goods and a better investment climate and working together on innovation and technology will set the relationship apart. There is a need for “convergence on the big picture”, he added. “I would give a lot of emphasis to resolving our trade problems [and] take the journey into a higher gear than it has been before. I do believe it’s very possible,” he said.India and the US were unable to work out a mini trade deal before President Donald Trump’s visit in February due to differences on issues such as market access, tariffs and the data localisation policy. Pointing to the need for the US to go beyond the alliances it has forged over the decades, Jaishankar said: “We have the ability today, by working together, to shape the world.” He added the two sides can strengthen their bilateral agenda while shaping the larger global agenda.In the field of trade too, Jaishankar said, emerging and established players have different concerns amid the rebalancing of the global economy. While established players want the continuation of their advantages, they should be willing to accommodate the legitimate concerns of emerging players, he said.“That harmonisation, how well we do that, is very important,” he said.Jaishankar also noted the important of people-to-people contacts, saying the Indian American community in the US had grown from 3,000 in 1947 to more than four million. The community has added a new quality to the relationship and created bonding between the two societies that was centred round talent in economy, innovation and technology, he said. His remarks come in the wake of visa restrictions imposed by the US administration which substantially affect Indians. Senator Mark Warner, who also participated in the discussion, highlighted the need to increase both trade and defence cooperation. He said the international leadership is being threatened by an aggressive Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping. This threat is now playing out in the sphere of 5G, where Chinese standards, rules and protocols are dominating, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-resolving-india-us-trade-issues-jaishankar/story-MbQMlUR84R5OccmJdK8ugJ.html
23-07-2020||India||All digital platforms must be responsive to nations: Prasad||Union information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad called for digital platforms to be responsive, accountable and sensitive to the concerns of sovereign nations as far as safety, defence and privacy is concerned.Prasad raised the issue on Wednesday during the G20 Digital Minister’s Meet hosted by Saudi Arabia. His comments come in the backdrop of India’s ban on 59 mostly Chinese web and mobile applications including TikTok and UC browser due to security concerns.“In view of these concerns, the digital platforms having presence in many countries must become trustworthy, safe and secure. It is time to acknowledge that digital platforms anywhere in the world have to be responsive and accountable towards the sovereign concerns of countries including defence, privacy and security of citizens,” Prasad was quoted as saying by a press statement.China’s digital minister Miao Wei was also in attendance at the virtual meeting. India’s ban on the popular applications came in the aftermath of deadly border clashes with in the eastern Ladakh Sector in June this year, where 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers were killed. According to Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) officials familiar with the developments, neither China nor India took up the issue directly. “However, the minister did convey to all present at it is the right of a country to protect the data of its citizens,” a MEITY official told HT. Prasad also raised other data security issues and said that data must belong to the sovereign nation concerned. “Digital economy must go hand in hand with the Data economy. We need to acknowledge the sovereignty over data. Data must belong to the sovereign nation concerned, to protect also the privacy concern of its people,” Prasad added.Prasad also asserted that a robust data protection law would soon be passed in India. The concerned bill is still pending in Parliament. According to Internet Freedom Foundation trustee Apar Gupta, the minister mentioning a robust data protection policy was a positive step.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-digital-platforms-must-be-responsive-to-nations-prasad/story-mKJIApqsP5PRzTndH6xjTL.html
23-07-2020||India||Former judge to head Vikas Dubey probe panel, says SC||The Supreme Court approved on Wednesday the Uttar Pradesh government’s draft notification to appoint former top court judge BS Chauhan as the head of a three-member inquiry commission to look into the killing of eight policemen as well as the subsequent deaths of gangster Vikas Dubey and five of his alleged associates. The top court’s bench, headed by chief justice SA Bobde, directed that the inquiry commission should start functioning within a week and the probe be concluded within two months. Former high court judge Shashi Kant Agarwal and retired director general of police of Uttar Pradesh KL Gupta.The bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said: “Both the July 2/3 incident (when Dubey and his men allegedly killed eight policemen) and the July 10 incident when Dubey was killed have to be touched upon. The first was the motive for the second incident.”The commission’s probe will also examine how Dubey got bail/parole despite being accused in over 64 criminal cases. “We consider this as the single most important factor that this incident happened,” the judges said.In a hearing on Monday, the chief justice said giving bail/parole to Dubey reflected “failure of the institution” when such a man ought to have remained behind bars.On July 3, Dubey and his men gunned down a deputy superintendent of police and seven other cops who were attempting to arrest him. In a dramatic week that followed, Dubey went underground while several of his men were killed in police encounters. He was detained in a town in Madhya Pradesh on July 9. On July 10, while being brought back to Kanpur, he was killed in what police described as escape attempt following an accident of the car Dubey was in. The commission will hold its sittings in Lucknow and the government has to set it up within a week, providing it space and all secretarial assistance.A clutch of PILs filed before the court raised doubts over the July 12 decision of the UP government to appoint a one-man commission of justice Shashi Kant Agarwal to conduct the investigation. The action of the state government to pick justice Chauhan was objected to by one of the petitioners Ghanshyam Upadhyay, a lawyer practicing in Mumbai. The CJI shot back: “Even I would have chosen justice Chauhan.” It was the court that suggested the UP government choose a judge from the state. A similar enquiry ordered into an encounter in Telangana in December 2019 came to a halt since lockdown restrictions prevented members of the enquiry panel to travel or meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-judge-to-head-vikas-dubey-probe-panel-says-sc/story-Ge3UyLjn9fbXxiMP1giGnN.html
23-07-2020||India||Security agencies red-flag firms with connection to Chinese govt||Faced with a belligerent People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in East Ladakh, Indian security agencies have red-flagged the penetration of companies believed to have ties with the Chinese government in critical sectors, particularly telecommunications, higher education, and power supply and distribution. While the government remains tight-lipped over the issue, it is understood that last week, the senior-most bureaucrats of the critical ministries met on directions from the top leadership to understand the extent of this penetration. Senior officials of security agencies sensitized the officers on the issue, and the government has since issued verbal instructions to various departments to prevent this intrusion, HT learns. Also Read: The Middle Kingdom’s rush of blood and the need for strong Indian deterrenceTwo core areas highlighted in the presentation made by the security agencies were education and telecommunications. In education, under the garb of cultural promotion, Indian universities and colleges have tied up with their Chinese counterparts through Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), often without the requisite clearance of the designated authority — in this case, the Ministry of External Affairs or the Human Resource Development ministry. A classic example in this are the Chinese-government funded Confucius Institutes to promote Han Chinese language and culture — typicality set up in association with a local partner institution. The other area of serious concern is telecommunications, where private sector companies have preferred cheaper Chinese infrastructure for mobile and internet telephony. Sure, this isn’t unique to India, but security agencies fear that Beijing has made serious inroads into this sector. There have even been allegations that large tenders are sometimes designed to suit the Chinese companies. These concerns aren’t new. But many have been amplified in recent months, especially after relations between India and China took a turn for the worse following Beijing’s aggression in East Ladakh. Some departments acted immediately. Also Read: India bans TikTok, other Chinese appsFor instance, the Department of Telecommunications, last month, asked BSNL to tweak its tender to exclude Chinese equipment makers from a large 4G upgrade project. And the power ministry, on July 2 already issued a detailed order where all equipment, components and parts imported for use in the power supply system and network will be tested in the country to check for any kind of embedded malware/trojans/cyber threat and adherence to Indian standards.The order states that power is a strategic and critical sector that supports not only India’s national defence, vital emergency services and critical national infrastructure but also the entire economy and the day to day life. “Any danger or threat to power supply system can have catastrophic effects and has the potential to cripple the entire country,” said the order, a copy of which has been seen by HT. Also Read: China’s Xi Jinping is a successor to dictator Joseph Stalin: US NSA O’BrienIn order to protect the security, reliability and integrity of the system, the ministry has decided that all testing of equipment for use certification will only be done by laboratories designated by it. In addition, any import of equipment/components/parts from so-called prior reference countries will require permission of the Indian government.HT learns that pressure is now on the HRD and telecom ministries to review Chinese involvement in light of the presentation made by the security agencies. The security agencies, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity, have been instructed to investigate those ministries that are in violation of the directions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-agencies-red-flag-firms-with-connection-to-chinese-govt/story-6CskIGIpTrGhc5tG2fRFsM.html
23-07-2020||India||Monsoon belt receives deficient rain in July; north, central India still dry||Monsoon rains in July haven’t been as bountiful as they were in June mainly because of the monsoon trough (line of low pressure) moving towards the Himalayan foothills repeatedly, leaving many parts of northwest and central India dry this month, according to data from the India Meteorological Department. Until July 22, northwest India has a deficiency of -16% and northeast India has a surplus of 16%, contrary to what was predicted in June. IMD, in its long range forecast issued on June 1 forecast that northwest India is expected to receive excess monsoon rain at 107% of the long period average; Central India is likely to get 103% of LPA while south peninsula and northeast India area likely to receive 102% and 96% of LPA respectively with a model error of 8% (+/-). IMD scientists said these trends could change over the next few months, adding that the main reason for this deviation is an unusually calm Bay of Bengal. At least four to six low pressure systems form over the Bay of Bengal in the monsoon months, bringing rain over the core monsoon region—mainly central India.“There has been no low-pressure systems over Bay of Bengal since June 21. There has been only one low pressure system this monsoon until now. Low pressure systems during the monsoon pull all moisture leaving the north-eastern region dry. These systems then bring a lot of rain along the core monsoon zone,” said DS Pai, senior scientist, IMD Pune. “The western Pacific is also unusually calm, there have been no typhoons there. This could be due to year on year variability.”“Low pressure systems are the main rain producing systems during the monsoon. Their formation depends on monsoon dynamics such as interaction of south-westerly and easterly winds,” added RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.“We haven’t seen any low-pressure system forming possibly because the Bay of Bengal is not as warm. These low-pressure systems move along the monsoon trough bringing rain in east, central, northwest India. Between July 27 and 29 there is likely to be a major confluence of south westerly and easterly winds which can bring a lot of rain in the Indo-Gangetic Plains from UP to the northeast accentuating floods once again in Bihar and northeast,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Skymet Weather. The Centre will soon release Rs 346 crore as an initial amount for handling the flood situation in Assam, an official statement by the central government said.Followed by a discharge of around 3.50 lakh cusecs of water from the Valmikinagar barrage in Nepal, water from an aggravated Gandak river early on Wednesday morning inundated low-lying areas of Bagaha, Gopalganj and Vaishali in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-belt-receives-deficient-rain-in-july-north-central-india-still-dry/story-8JfqtNVN8zmhRNczrUQqFK.html
23-07-2020||India||No breakthrough in de-escalating border tension despite military, diplomatic talks||India and China have lately failed to make a breakthrough in reducing border tensions in the sensitive Ladakh sector despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels, and the disengagement process at some points of the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) has virtually halted, people familiar with recent developments on this front said on Wednesday. The stalemate comes after top Indian and Chinese military commanders held talks on July 14 to discuss the road map for disengagement between their forces. The ground situation remains unchanged in the sector where both armies have amassed almost 100,000 soldiers in their forward and depth areas, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named.Also Read: Twin naval exercises with US supercarriers signal QUAD has arrived“There has been no forward movement in the disengagement of troops in friction areas along the LAC including Pangong Tso and Depsang. The overall de-escalation of conflict is a long way off,” said a second official, who did not wish to be named. He said the conflict was likely to stretch into to the winter months and the Indian armed forces were prepared for a long haul.Defence minister Rajnath Singh indicated last week that the negotiations to resolve tensions were complex. During a visit to Ladakh, he said progress in negotiations should help resolve the border dispute but added that he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved.”The disengagement process has barely made progress after the last round of meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders on July 14. Also Read: With Xi Jinping Centre On Diplomatic Thought, Chinese President is the new MaoOn Wednesday, Singh asked the air force to stay prepared for any eventuality while addressing top commanders. Experts said the situation was complicated and there was no quick fix.“The ball is in India’s court. The Chinese would be happy with status quo as they are already sitting in what we consider to be Indian territory. They have only carried out minimal disengagement. The government now needs to start thinking what to do next to break the deadlock,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).Also Read: How PM Modi called China’s bluff in Ladakh, writes Shishir GuptaIndia has moved three extra army divisions, fighter jets, several squadrons of frontline tanks, additional artillery and fully-ready mechanised infantry squads to the Ladakh sector as part of its efforts to strengthen deployments in response to Chinese military build-up.The build-up on both sides includes fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems.The Indian Air Force could also deploy its new Rafale fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, officials previously indicated to HT.India and China remain committed to “complete disengagement” which is an “intricate process” and “requires constant verification”, the Indian Army said in a statement last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-breakthrough-in-de-escalating-border-tension-despite-military-diplomatic-talks/story-CqMXymeWx2YpQlaTyIeisL.html
23-07-2020||India||Air Force ready to counter aggressive action: IAF chief||With disengagement between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh turning out to be a challenging and sluggish process, Indian Air Force chief RKS Bhadauria on Wednesday asserted that the IAF was poised to counter any aggressive action by the neighbour even as defence minister Rajnath Singh asked the air force to stay prepared for any eventuality while addressing top commanders.Singh said the swift deployment of the air force’s assets at forward locations in response to the current situation in eastern Ladakh “sent a strong message” to the adversary. He was addressing the IAF’s top brass on the opening day of a three-day commanders’ conference.In his address, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria stressed on the need to focus on “the ability to handle situations at a short notice” to ensure a robust response.The defence minister last week said the progress in negotiations with China should help resolve the border dispute but he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved”, underlining the complex nature of the disengagement process along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).The disengagement process has barely made any progress after the last round of meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders on July 14, an official said on condition of anonymity.Addressing top IAF commanders, the minister said the military needs to stay prepared for a collusive threat from China and Pakistan, people familiar with the developments said. The military is keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict.The minister said the professional manner in which IAF conducted air strikes against a terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot last year, and the rapid deployment of IAF assets at forward locations in Ladakh sent a strong message to India’s adversaries.Bhadauria said the IAF was fully prepared to counter short-term as well as strategic threats, and its units were “evenly poised” to counter any aggressive action by the adversary.“The minister’s exhortation to the IAF to stay prepared for any eventuality has great importance in the present security environment. Air power has become the primary instrument of deterrence now and, as the IAF chief said, the air force would rise to the occasion if it comes to a shooting war,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.The defence minister said the country’s resolve to defend its sovereignty stood firm on the faith its people had in the military’s capability. He praised the IAF’s “proactive response” in bolstering its operational capabilities during the last few months, and assured the commanders that all requirements of the armed forces would be met.The conference is taking place days ahead of the IAF inducting its first batch of five Rafale fighter jets imported from France at the Ambala air base on July 29.The IAF could deploy its new Rafale fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, where Indian and Chinese forces were locked in a tense border confrontation for weeks before a protracted process of disengagement began and is still ongoing.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to plug gaps in the IAF’s combat capabilities.The possible deployment of Rafale fighters in Ladakh could be discussed at the commanders’ conference where the air force brass is expected to focus on the border row with China, the IAF’s preparedness and new purchases that have to be made fast.In the Ladakh sector, the IAF is projecting its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters and multi-mission choppers getting airborne regularly for demanding missions from a forward base in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-force-ready-to-counter-aggressive-action-iaf-chief/story-o9yEVL2xwShSGBNmfeU6JO.html

23-07-2020||India||Villages are not as they are shown on screen, says the man behind Panchayat||Inspired by classic Doordarshan shows like ‘Malgudi Days’, ‘Potli Baba Ki’, ‘Swami’, ‘Tenali Rama’, director Deepak Mishra conceptualised the hit series ‘Panchayat’. “Shows like those from our childhood are no longer made. We wanted to make a relatable show and refresh the rural connection of our Indian audience. So, we did extensive research and the connection of my writer Chandan Kumar and mine, with our villages, gave us the edge,” said the Varanasi lad.Initially, they were making it as ‘SDO Saheb’ but later switched to a panchayat setting. “We wanted to show realism. Usually, villagers are portrayed as ‘bhole-bhale’ log (simple people), who are ignorant and are shown in a very strange way. People raised fingers saying that our story was slow, takes time to sink in, and without any action, or a leading lady. But my writer and I were clear that we wanted to show a village in 2020 and probably the audience liked that realism. ”“Today’s rural youth is watching YouTube on mobile, they make TikTok videos, on ‘khaprail’ (clay-tiled) roofs they have dish antennas, flat screen TVs are fitted on mud walls...so it’s a different world now!”It was his UP connection that he set the show in Ballia. “My writer is from Patna, we shot it in MP but we set it in a village in UP East. Besides, we wanted to shoot the contrast between Noida and a desolate village.”After studying in Varanasi till Class 12, he studied mechanical engineering at IIT-Mumbai. “Our drama society fuelled my interest towards acting, dramatics and direction. We did plays in collaboration with Prithvi Theatre. Then, I met TVF founder Arunabh Kumar and that’s how we got associated. I kept learning and nurturing my interest in editing, scripting, direction and acting.”Mishra did some shorts (sketches) and later directed ‘Permanent Roomates-2’ and ‘Humorously Yours-2’. As an actor, he did ‘Rowdies,’ a spoof on ‘Roadies’, where he played Raghu Ram’s role, a broker in ‘Permanent Roommates’, and in its second season, he played a dumb cab driver.He feels that IIT helped him a lot in pursuing this art form. “Being a small-town boy, I would not have known all this, had I not gone to IIT-Mumbai. More than the subjects, they teach us how to live, perseverance, fighting attitude, learning from mistakes and moving ahead. Our field is a beautiful combination of art and science. Since I knew the technical aspects of film-making, it made things a lot easier.”The second season of Panchayat is now being scripted. “It’s in a nascent stage. After a successful series there is always high expectation from the second series. So, we don’t wish to hurry anything. Besides, crime-thrillers also interest me but I will do it in a different manner.”His family has now shifted to Lucknow. “They live in Gomti Nagar and whenever I come to the state capital, we go to Varanasi,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/villages-are-not-as-they-are-shown-on-screen-says-the-man-behind-panchayat/story-6oOrmwfK8RUnS0NJNU9WBI.html
23-07-2020||Editorials||Prepare for another wave of locust attacks| HT Editorial||In an advisory on July 21, the Food and Agriculture Organization said that adult groups and swarms of desert locusts are maturing throughout Rajasthan and that substantial hatching is expected in the coming weeks. This indicates that a second wave of attack — the first happened in western and northern India in May — could happen again in the coming months. In the first installment, parts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh had to battle the scourge. Despite being caught off-guard — the last major attack was in 1993 — the states were moderately successful in tackling the problem by spraying organophosphate to kill locusts.The desert locust is one of 12 species of short-horned grasshoppers; its swarms can have billions and travel up to 130 km in one day. Each day, a locust can eat its own weight — about two grams of fresh vegetation. This means that they not only devour standing crops, but can also devastate livelihoods of those associated with the agricultural supply chain. Now that FAO has issued a warning, the states and the central government must be battle-ready, not just for this round but also for the future because the climate crisis will lead to increase in such episodes. This means that the government must strengthen the Locust Warning Organization, which was almost disbanded because no attack had happened in two decades, by ensuring that they have adequate field staff, sprayers and spray vehicles required for locust control, and make sure that states follow its standard operating procedure for spraying of insecticides by drones, airplanes and helicopters before things get out of hand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/prepare-for-another-wave-of-locust-attacks/story-rw6wmlvMV56nhT1kZZSEOP.html
