24-07-2020||News||China’s assertion also reveals its fragility | Analysis||The clash between Chinese and Indian troops that resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Indian soldiers marked a new low in the Sino-Indian bilateral relationship. While there have been many skirmishes on the border since the war in 1962, this was the first time since 1975 that there had been casualties. As is widely known, the clash took place in the Galwan River Valley in Ladakh at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) — a slight misnomer since the two governments fundamentally disagree not just on where the historic borders lie, but even on LAC itself. Indicating the seriousness of the nosedive in the bilateral relationship, the minister of external affairs, S Jaishankar, and China’s minister of foreign affairs, Wang Yi, scrambled to hold talks over the phone to try to cool down the situation, and this has been followed by other military and diplomatic talks. The Galwan clash has been seen by many as yet another example of China’s rising belligerence. Indeed, in a recent article in the Foreign Affairs journal, Kurt Campbell and Mira Hooper argued that China’s “confidence” and willingness to “court… open hostility” is one in a long line of recent behaviours. China has enacted laws impinging on Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous status, insisted on its claims in the South China Sea (SCS), stepped up its patrols of the contested Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, increased violations of Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ), and harshly condemned western countries for calling its post-pandemic exported medical supplies substandard. While it is true that China’s behaviour on the world stage is beginning, under the powerful leadership of Xi Jinping, to be more active and assertive, in the rush to worry about a rising China and apply assertiveness as a singular label across all foreign policy issue areas, there has been less focus on the fragilities revealed by China’s behaviour.To begin with, there are issues that matter more to China than others which pinpoint the government’s uneasy relationship with its public. The category of territories that China sees as historically integral, for example, is different from other territories. Accordingly, its behaviour is different. China has settled most of its territorial disputes with its neighbours — the ones it has failed to settle are those that it sees as vital to its goal of “national reunification” (guojia tongyi). This includes Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and, yes, Aksai Chin (which links Tibet and Xinjiang). There can be no backing down on these territories because they are linked to aggressive Chinese nationalism. Chinese nationalism is a problematic area for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) — on one hand, it tries to control and direct it, but on the other, it is key in the absence of any other ideology (the word “communist” in its title being entirely redundant), to its domestic legitimacy and support. The CCP government, therefore, constantly worries about Chinese nationalism becoming anti-CCP nationalism, and assiduously protects its claims to these territories.China is deeply insecure about its image and reputation on the world stage. This has been the case since at least the 1990s with the emergence of what has been called “China threat” theories after the events of Tiananmen. This has arguably intensified since the pandemic — China venting about the global backlash, and demanding praise, are examples of its insecurity not assertiveness. Related to these, China not only does not have formal allies but it also does not have deep bilateral relationships with any heavy-hitting states or coalitions which it could lean on for vocal international support to defend it in a crisis. The United States (US) aside, the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, South Korea, and Asean are all suspicious of China while its relationships in Africa have been dubbed “neocolonial”. Thus, when the border clash occurred, anti-China global sentiment, already heightened by the pandemic, was almost uniformly negative. US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called China’s actions “disgraceful”. The Chinese government is aware of this fact, and has moved, for example, to rein in the social media posts of domestic nationalists making aggressive territorial claims, which could further damage its reputation.Finally, China is not a monolithic government. While Xi Jinping is an extremely powerful leader, and has moved to sideline critics with a ruthlessness that has been compared to Mao, the Chinese State remains fragmented. Even its assertiveness is not monolithic — research shows that a strategy such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has no coherent central ideology, and it is left to individual provinces to improvise with flimsy central directions. This means that even with regard to border transgressions, it is difficult to say with certainty when directions have been centrally coordinated in advance as opposed to being the responses of local commanders or even senior army leaders.There has not been a Nixonian moment in the Sino-Indian bilateral relationship since 1962. In the absence of such a game-changing breakthrough, India needs to formulate a long-term strategy keeping these nuances about China’s behaviour in mind. Failure to do so will be costly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/china-s-assertion-also-reveals-its-fragility/story-VQahJPsVy85SZYBf7KdTJK.html
24-07-2020||News||Changing China’s conduct||The disengagement process between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) , initiated after conversations between special representatives on the border issue of both sides (national security adviser Ajit Doval and foreign minister Wang Yi) and military representatives, has hit a roadblock. China is not moving back from Pangong-Tso and Depsang. It hasn’t fulfilled its commitments to step back from Hot Springs and Gogra. Its military build-up remains intact, which means that the next step after disengagement — de-escalation — is a distant proposition. Both Chinese intentions and its capabilities make it clear that Beijing will continue to be belligerent. India has attempted five strategies to counter this. The first was underplaying the nature of incursion. While the government should have been more transparent in April, May, and early June, it is understandable if New Delhi wanted to keep the public glare away from the border to be able to arrive at a quiet understanding and give the Chinese a “face-saver”. This did not work. The second strategy was to warn the Chinese that the border stand-off will have implications for the rest of the relationship. The ban on the Chinese apps, the decision not to award highway contracts to Chinese firms, the clear signalling that the 5G contract to Huawei was now in jeopardy, and the general message within the government to reduce interlinkages with China was meant to deliver the message. It had an impact, but not enough to change Chinese plans. The third was a military response — India has matched the military build-up at the border. Galwan showed India was willing to inflict costs on Beijing, though, to be sure, it incurred costs in the process too. The fourth has been to cement international partnerships, link Chinese actions to its aggression elsewhere, and mobilise international pressure — sometimes discreetly, sometimes publicly — on Beijing. This has been noted in China, but has not been a sufficient enough lever to change Chinese behaviour. And the fifth was a direct dialogue, which hasn’t yielded the desired results. Given the Chinese intransigence, India will have to rely on all but the first option to an even greater degree. There is no point in underplaying the tension. But continue to make China pay economic costs; don’t let the guard down militarily; and be an active part of a coalition to contain Chinese belligerence while continuing the dialogue with Beijing. It will be a tough year in Ladakh, but letting the Chinese have their way and losing territory is not an option.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/changing-china-s-conduct/story-liFS0btRsVzFB0OscipYVK.html
24-07-2020||News||To Beijing, a message from the seas||A new low has been reached in the simmering United States (US)-China discord with the Donald Trump administration forcing the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, and Beijing vowing to retaliate at what it described as an “unprecedented escalation”. The foreign ministry in Beijing announced on July 22 that China planned to “react with firm countermeasures” if the Trump administration did not “revoke this erroneous decision.”This unexpected US decision to raise the diplomatic heat on China comes in the wake of a US carrier strike group led by the nuclear-powered USS Nimitz exercising with warships of the Indian Navy’s eastern fleet on July 20 in the Indian Ocean. While this has been described as a routine “passex” (basic naval exercises when warships of two navies pass by each other in the oceans), the subtext points to a subtle demonstration of US-India partnership even as India and China are engaged in a slow disengagement process — which now appears to have hit a roadblock — after the Galwan incident.As is now well-recognised, the altercation at Galwan in the Ladakh region of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), where the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops ambushed and killed 20 Indian soldiers, marked a different low point in the bilateral relationship between India and China. The template that framed Sino-Indian relations since 1993 and ensured an extended period of guarded “peace and stability” is no longer valid. Delhi is now exploring a new level of diplomatic mediation with layered military messaging. The immediate objective for India is a return to the pre-Galwan status quo along LAC. It appears that PLA is unlikely to withdraw from the locations it has occupied and fortified in a swift and consensual manner. In reviewing other options, Delhi has revived certain naval/maritime possibilities and these include the likelihood of inviting Australia to join the India-US-Japan trilateral Malabar naval exercises towards the end of the year. This points to reviving the Quad — a group of four nations that came under one umbrella for the first time in the aftermath of the December 2004 tsunami. It may be recalled that when India had mounted a Quad-plus Singapore five-nation naval exercise in 2007, China bristled at what it considered to be a latent threat. Delhi, then, chose to placate Beijing’s concerns by reverting to a bilateral Malabar with the US.The abiding anxiety for China is what is referred to as the Malacca dilemma. This refers to Beijing’s perceived vulnerability in the Indo-Pacific given its enormous dependence on unimpeded merchant shipping, which is predicated on the freedom of the oceans and the sea-lines of communication. One strand of this dependence is illustrated by the fact that in 2019, China imported an average of 10.1 million barrels of crude oil per day and most of this passes through the Malacca Strait. The vulnerability-leverage matrix can be suitably calibrated depending on the prevailing geopolitical context and Beijing is sensitive to this factor.Consequently, Beijing has been seeking to mitigate this dilemma in various ways and an ambitious China-Iran strategic partnership is the latest initiative. It envisions a $400-billion Chinese investment in return for long-term hydrocarbon supplies and access to the Chabahar port. Along with Gwadar in Pakistan, this maritime connectivity and access, while ostensibly being part of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative project, will enhance Beijing’s footprint in a strategic location near the Persian Gulf. In summary, the Indian Ocean is being differently animated by China and the US in the main. India has to evolve a short-term and long-term maritime orientation that will enable Delhi to protect and advance core national interests.This is where the presence of the USS Nimitz offers an insight into the suasive nature of the naval capability and the spectrum of options it can provide in managing the relationship with a bellicose China. The US, in recent days, has upped the ante against China in relation to the South China Sea (SCS), and termed Beijing’s actions as “unlawful” and reiterated its commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacific”. It is instructive that the USS Nimitz carried out a freedom of navigation patrol in the SCS before exercising with the Indian Navy and Beijing would be reading the tea leaves carefully. Astute application of military/naval capability can enhance diplomatic efficacy and India needs to acquire the requisite material capability and the partnership with the US has been useful. In an innovative use of naval platforms, the US-supplied P-8I maritime recce aircraft have been deployed along LAC for surveillance and points to maximising limited assets in unexpected exigencies.India’s predicament is resource allocation for the military when the GDP is expected to shrink dramatically due to Covid-19. A focused strategic dialogue with the US and other Indo-Pacific nations that share both anxiety about China’s bellicosity, and an aspiration to realise a rule-based maritime order, may offer some policy options that could be pursued both individually and collectively. For now, how Beijing will “retaliate” against the US whether in relation to the Houston consulate, or the joint naval exercise in the Indian Ocean, will offer some cues about the nature of the India-China relationship in its post-Galwan phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/to-beijing-a-message-from-the-seas/story-RQAhv6uVaRmrVgM7GWCFBN.html

24-07-2020||City||Double jolt to jewellers as gold prices soar amid pandemic blues||Dealing a major blow to the jewellery business amid a pandemic-induced slowdown, gold prices crossed ₹52,000/10 grams on Friday, while silver was valued at ₹61,000/kg.City-based jewellers rued that while the rising prices have attracted a few investors for pure gold (24 carat), there have been no takers for designed jewellery at their stores. They said the Covid-19 pandemic had badly hit the business as no lavish weddings were taking place at the moment, and that uncertainty loomed over trade prospects during the festival season this year.Ludhiana jewellers’ association president Anand Sikri said, “There are no customers and the jewellers are sitting idle, waiting for purchases to happen. Till now, people were restricted by the fear of infection, and now the rising prices have added to the problem. The few showing up buy only pure gold for investment purposes, but the response is tepid due to low purchasing capacity and high rates.”As per the jewellers, no orders for silver rakhis were placed this year, as the lower and middle class families were already struggling to make ends meet amid the financial crisis. Gold and silver were priced at around ₹40,000/10g and ₹46,000/kg respectively before the lockdown. However, the skyrocketing rates are pushing buyers away from the precious metal.A jeweller from Chaar Khamba road in Model Town, Karan Arneja, said, “The business is at an all time low as people, who are hugely impacted by the economic slump caused by Covid-19, can’t afford gold or silver jewellery at the current rates. Jewellers are now working to reduce their fixed expenses to deal with the business slowdown.”“Residents here are instead selling their gold jewellery to manage their finances in these tough times,” said Arneja.Experts believe that gold prices are likely to increase further by Diwali this year.Tribhuvan Thapar, a jeweller from Sarafa Bazar said, “The government should step in and provide some relief to the sector as the business is suffering like never before. The future doesn’t look promising either as gold rates are expected to touch ₹60,000 by Dilwai this year.”Echoing Thapar’s views, silver trader Puneet Kapoor stated that in the demand in the market, the future of their businesses seemed irresolute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/double-jolt-to-jewellers-as-gold-prices-soar-amid-pandemic-blues/story-FlEJvqLN6k0mjWHGivALgO.html
24-07-2020||City||Ludhiana’s 114-year-old Clock Tower being restored to original glory||Despite losing its splendour over time, Victoria Memorial Clock Tower, fondly called Ghanta Ghar, has looked over the city’s shoulder for over a century now. To spring it back to its original glory, the Ludhiana municipal corporation is giving the monument a much-needed makeover.Elated by the tower’s revival, old-timers and historians of the city say they are eager for the completion of works, which are expected to be over by the end of this month.Established in 1906, Clock Tower is the city’s most prominent and last surviving landmark from the pre-Independence era.As per the ₹66-lakh project, which is being taken up under the smart city mission, the MC will touch up the tower’s facade, repair its mechanical clock, and light it up. A few trials of colourful lights installed at the tower were held earlier and the sight had fascinated the residents.Sharing their memories from the Partition, retired Punjab Agricultural University professor Amarjit Singh Hayer (85) and Central University Bathinda chancellor Sardara Singh Johl (92) narrated how the there were only two prominent buildings in the city at that time, and Clock Tower was one of them.Hayer said, “Apart from being an iconic structure, Clock Tower was one of the two major landmarks of the city. The other one was Subhani building. The tower was erected during the British era on Grand Trunk Road which led up to Peshawar. At that time, there was no development in Ludhiana west and the areas like Chaura Bazaar, Field Ganj, Daresi Ground and other parts of the old city were densely populated. Clock Tower and Subhani building were used to convey directions to commuters. But with time, the tower lost its limelight and now numerous multi-storey buildings have come up around it, diminishing its visibility.”Johl recalled the time he used to visit the city in the late 1940s from Noor Mahal, where his family had got temporary allotment after Partition.“The bell of Clock Tower was functional in 1948 and used to ring after every hour. The tower is like a monument of the city and must be preserved. The elevated road and multi-storey buildings have reduced its visibility, but the government should save it for the coming generations. Unfortunately, not much has been given to its maintenance in the past,” he said.Reviewing the status of the smart city project on Friday, Punjab cabinet minister and MLA (Ludhiana west) Bharat Bhushan Ashu said, “Most of the work has been done and the project is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The clock is being repaired and the tower is also being cleaned from the inside. A few lighting trials have also been done and the tower will don a new look soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-s-114-year-old-clock-tower-being-restored-to-original-glory/story-JDgAfa3W1qkXVftaBzhkNK.html

24-07-2020||City||Delhi MCDs target Delhi govt over water logging crisis||New Delhi:  Mayors of the three BJP-led municipal corporations on Friday alleged the Delhi government departments were to be blamed for the waterlogging crisis in parts of the city. They also demanded that funds for this quarter, which has been due to the three civic bodies, be released at the earliest.North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash, South Delhi mayor Anamika Mithilesh and East Delhi mayor Nirmal Jain in a joint press conference alleged that they were not getting enough cooperation from the various Delhi government departments to deal with the Covid crisis as well as in handling issues such as waterlogging.“Delhi has been battling Covid and the city government woke up only after Union home minister Amit Shah took the matter in his own hands. Now, waterlogging is another issue troubling people and even a death has occurred because of it. We have been trying to work with the AAP government, but they are not cooperating enough,” Jai Prakash said.A 56-year-old driver of a mini truck had reportedly drowned near the waterlogged Minto Bridge in central Delhi on Sunday.Prakash said that before the monsoons, the corporation held a meeting with officials of the public works department (PWD) and those from the flood and irrigation department to check preparedness. Five agencies are associated with addressing the issue water logging --- PWD, flood department, Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development (DSIIDC), Delhi Jal Board (DJB) and the three civic bodies.“The Delhi government departments had claimed that they had done de-silting, which proved to be false in the torrential rain on Sunday. Four major agencies are with the city government. Civic bodies only look after drains that are four feet deep. The department must be prepared well in advance. Minto Bridge has been getting submerged in water every year,” said Prakash.He said he will visit Kirari on Saturday, where waterlogging is a major issue. “I have requested Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to join in and help the people,” said Prakash.The three mayors said funds “due” to the corporations must be released so that they are able to pay their staff. “I had met the CM last week, after which he had assured to release the due funds, but it has not been done so far. Rs 1,108 crore of the first and second quarter of the North Corporation is due, which must be released immediately,” said Prakash.The south mayor said they are exploring all possible revenue generation sources to deal with the situation and trying to be self-sustainable. “Our funds have been due. However, rather than expecting financial assistance from the government, we plan to generate funds on our own,” said Anamika Mithilesh.East mayor Jain said, “We had met the team of Delhi finance minister Satyendra Jain. The file for disbursement of funds has still not moved from his table. Of the around Rs 1,600 crore funds due under the planned head as well as BTA (basic tax assignment), only Rs 91 crore has been released so far.”While the east civic body has paid salaries to its staff until June, the south corporation has paid until May. North corporation officials said the salaries of its sanitation staff, junior and senior resident doctors have been paid till May while the rest of the health care staff and teachers on Covid duty have been paid till April. The rest of the staff has been paid only until March.AAP targets MCDsIn a seperate press meet, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday said it would start a protest if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations do not clear the salaries of doctors in hospitals under their jurisdiction in three days.“The whole world is going through the Covid-19 pandemic, which is the worst-ever crisis in the history of mankind. Our country India is also hit by this pandemic and the medical fraternity is relentlessly working to save the citizens. The doctors, nurses, paramedics, other health officials are trying their best to provide the best health facility to all of us,” said AAP’s national spokesperson and Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha.He said, “It is unfortunate that in Delhi, the capital of India, the medical staff in two hospitals under the BJP-ruled MCD have not received their salaries since March. We all talk about respecting doctors, we salute them, and the central government showered flowers from fighter jets to show respect to our Covid warriors. But the BJP cannot pay their salaries.”Spokesperson for AAP and Kalkaji MLA Atishi said, it is very “saddening to see that the BJP has not paid the salaries of doctors of Kasturba Hospital and Hindu Rao Hospital in the time of Covid pandemic . “...The AAP govt has already disbursed the required amount to the MCDs but due to BJP’s corruption, the doctors are not getting the salary...When the audit of North MCD was done, financial irregularities of more than three thousand crores was found. In the South MCD also, financial irregularities of more than Rs 1,250 crore were found,” Atishi alleged.She said, “The MCDs get money from taxes, property taxes, advertisement, etc., but the BJP leaders put this money on their pocket. They do the same with the money given to the MCDs by the Delhi government.”Chadha said, “AAP demands that BJP should not violate the rights of doctors. They should immediately pay the salaries of the doctors who are working relentlessly in the times of pandemic. The BJP has no right to disrespect the health workers and Covid warriors of Delhi. If the BJP cannot respect the health workers of Delhi, then at least they should uphold the rights of the doctors by giving them their salaries...If the BJP does not pay the salaries of the doctors within three days, then AAP will launch a huge protest. We challenge the MCDs that if they do not pay the salaries of the doctors, then AAP will take to the streets for the rights of the health workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-mcds-target-delhi-govt-over-water-logging-crisis/story-FsKKSlYjCowBQIHmcOWasM.html

The matter has been listed for next hearing on July 31.The incident had taken place in February this year. The deceased, Deepak Shukla, had been picked up by the police on February 22 and presented in the court on February 24. The court had sent him to judicial remand but the police allegedly kept him in their custody illegally till February 25.During the hearing of the case, police stated that due to the delay in medical examination, they got late and decided to keep Shukla in custody for one more night. KIN CLAIM HE WAS TORTUREDShukla’s father had stated that the cops had demanded Rs 1.5 lakh bribe from the family for not registering a vehicle-theft case. “On February 26 when I went to meet my son, I found that he was unable to walk properly. Deepak told me that the cops had tortured him. I immediately moved court and lodged an application but the next day around 6am, we got a call from the jail that Deepak had died,” he said.The court of additional chief judicial magistrate had on March 6 ordered an FIR against Division Number 5 SHO sub-inspector Richa Rani, ASI Charanjit Singh, ASI Jaskaran Singh and other police personnel, but the police did not take any action.The victim’s uncle, Rakesh Shukla, claimed that the police constantly tried to keep the family away from court proceedings. He alleged that the summons sent to them had been sent on the wrong address. The family has also filed a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana High court seeking FIR against the errant cops.

24-07-2020||Noida||Noida admin all set to start call centre manned by retired health officials||In a blend of experienced and fresh hands, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has decided to set up an exclusive call centre in the administrative block of the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, wherein only retired doctors/paramedics or young NSS volunteers will speak to Covid-19 patients, who have opted for home isolation, through phones daily, for 10 days continuously.District magistrate Suhas LY said it will be an innovative call centre, which will incorporate the doctors and paramedics who are over 60-years-old. “These retired medical officials can’t go out on field visits. While the young volunteers will help them in building a proper database of the patients, they (the doctors and paramedics) can evaluate and assess the symptoms of the Covid-19 patients given their experience. These doctors will also help patients prevent Covid-19-related complications. In case the patient develops chronic symptoms, they will also be assisted by the call centre for hospital admission,” he said.He also said that patients have to give their health updates, with daily temperature recordings, on the call centre. “Patients could submit their queries and grievances as well with the call centre for easy redressal. It would also provide behaviour change communication to all patients regarding proper usage of three-tier medical masks and hand washing with soap and water for 40 seconds. The call centre would facilitate in monitoring the other people coming in contact with the patient by asking their daily routine from them. It will be manned by doctors, counsellors, volunteers, and Covid heroes,” he said. Suhas further said that there will be two ambulances available with the call centre to facilitate the transfer of patients to the hospital and the allotment of an institutional facility will be allotted by the integrated call centre. “Infrastructure for the call centre will be in the conference room in the academic block of GIMS. The daily calls will certainly help patients increase their awareness and comply with instructions given by the physicians for home isolation strictly,” he said.The DM added that patients once given recommendation for home isolation will also be given a Covid-19 kit containing all essential equipment which will be required. Meanwhile, the district administration, on Friday, declared a fresh list of 361 containment zones, including 320 in category-1 and other 41 in category-2. The DM said that containment zones in urban areas will be of a 250 metre-radius or an entire mohalla (a floor in which the patient resides in a society) in case there is a single positive case and a radius of 500 metres. “If there is more than one positive case, a buffer zone of 250 metres will be taken as containment zone. In rural areas, the entire village will be taken as containment zone if there is one case, if there is more than one case, the adjoining area of the village will also be taken as buffer zone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-admin-all-set-to-start-call-centre-manned-by-retired-health-officials/story-L9qSNZ8EZyD92XUgMr25iM.html
24-07-2020||City||Five killed in two separate accidents in Gautam Budh Nagar||Five people, including two students, were killed in two separate accidents in the Gautam Budh Nagar district on Thursday night. While three of them were crushed under a train in Dadri, two were killed in a road mishap in Surajpur.The Dadri incident took place around 8.30pm in Bodaki village, the police said on Friday. The deceased were identified as brothers Jeetu and Deepak, students of classes 9 and 10, and their friend Sonu, who was in his early twenties. Police officials said that all the three were sitting on the railway tracks with their earphones on and did not hear an incoming train. “We got a call on the police helpline about the accident. But by the time a team rushed to the spot, their families had already taken the bodies and cremated them last night itself,” said Sateesh Kumar, assistant commissioner of police, Zone 3.According to the police, the train had applied brakes and stopped after hitting them, but it could not prevent the accident.The tracks are next to the village where the boys lived, the police said, adding that the deceased’s families have not filed any official complaint.In another incident, two men were killed while two others received minor injuries when a speeding Brezza car crashed into a bicycle and a motorcycle.“The accident took place around 8pm when the car crashed into the two two-wheelers near the railway road,” said Ankur Aggarwal, additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2.The deceased were identified as Sundar (50), the car driver, and Aditya Gaur (25), the cyclist. Another car passenger, Laxmi Devi, and motorcycle rider, Babloo, were injured in the accident, the police said.Police officials said that the car was speeding and hit the cycle and bike after which the driver hit his head on the windshield and the vehicle crashed into a pole, along with the cycle. Locals informed the police and the victims were rushed to a hospital where two of them were declared brought dead.Gaur was the sole earning member of his family and worked at a factory, said the police. His family has filed a complaint against the driver and a case of rash driving and negligence has been registered against him at Surajpur police station, the police said.The bodies were handed over to the family following the autopsy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-killed-in-two-separate-accidents-in-gautam-budh-nagar/story-bGv1vtJjR2viOtyx1CjJaM.html
24-07-2020||Noida||In a first, woman constables get active traffic duty in Noida||For the first time, Noida traffic department has deployed women traffic constables on active duty in the city from Friday.The district currently has 405 constables, including the six new women personnel who had volunteered to join the department.Out of the six, four would be trained under the supervision of a head constable, while the other two are currently on leave and will be deployed as soon as they rejoin.“I joined the police department nearly four years ago and came to the traffic department almost a year ago. All of us are working together and we are equipped for issuing fines also. Today, we were in the sectors 15A to 18 belt and depending on further instructions, we will continue with our assignments,” said 29-year-old Akshita Agarwal, one of the four constables engaged today.Sangeeta (27), Aruna (27), Priyanka (30), Neelam (34) and Antim (29) were the others who volunteered for the job.Senior traffic police officers said that, for now, the women traffic constables are deployed for a few hours during the morning and evening peak hour traffic before they are given a permanent assignment. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) for traffic Rajesh S said that the women were trained in traffic protocols during the lockdown.“We are planning to deploy them near the Indian Oil roundabout near sector 14, which is a comparatively less dense crossing, for now. These women will be an inspiration for others as well to take up the mantle. Afterwards we will move them to busier intersections like the Gaur chowk,” said DCP Rajesh.Officials are hopeful that the commuters would respect women officials more and that will help reduce the arguments between the traffic police and the public.“We have put in a request for more personnel and hopefully more female constables will be sent for active field duty,” said the DCP.The Noida traffic department currently has four traffic inspectors - one for each zone and one for the office, seven traffic sun-inspectors and 105 head constables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/in-a-first-woman-constables-get-active-traffic-duty-in-noida/story-T0oJxLav5ReDGkWq1Bu7aM.html

24-07-2020||Noida||Break in rain for two days, heavy rain likely next week, says IMD||After a wet week, the weather department on Friday predicted no rain for the weekend and a slight rise in temperature.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), monsoon activity will, however, return, with Noida, Ghaziabad and the rest of the National Capital Region likely to see moderate rainfall between July 27 and 29, with heavy rain predicted for Tuesday.On Friday, no rain was recorded in Noida and Ghaziabad. Weather analysts said the monsoon line of trough – a low that oscillates around Delhi and brings rains to the region – has shifted southwards.“The trough line has shifted southwards and is currently passing over Bikaner and Gwalior, so chances of rain for at least the next two days are very low. There is, however, the availability of moisture in the region and a cyclonic circulation is building up over south-west Uttar Pradesh. All of this can lead to very light drizzle over some small patches of NCR like Faridabad and Gurugram. But the chances are less,” Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD, said Friday, adding that these conditions may slightly increase the mercury.He however said that the region will again see monsoon rains next week, when the line of trough oscillates again.“The temperature may rise by a degree and hover around 36 degrees Celsius. However, the line of trough will oscillate again towards the north, passing over Delhi-NCR from Monday July 27, so the region will see good rainfall. July 28 may see heavy rainfall activities as well,” said Srivastava.On Friday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 35.4 degrees Celsius, a notch above the season’s average, against 34.6 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The minimum temperature was recorded at 26.1 degrees Celsius, same as a day earlier.Noida has so far seen moderate and heavy spells of rain over the last five days that covered about 3% of the overall seasonal rainfall deficit. The region has so far seen 15.5mm rainfall since June 1 till date, which is 91% in deficit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/break-in-rain-for-two-days-heavy-rain-likely-next-week-says-imd/story-tWkXS3yjzUoNizk21ksuCN.html

24-07-2020||Delhi||Clear rubble from Laxmi Nagar demolition within 48 hours, HC orders east civic body||The Delhi high court directed the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) to clear the rubble from a demolition drive in east Laxmi Nagar market within the next 48 hours. The drive was conducted on July 6-8 displacing several families, on the orders of the high court. The court also said the onus of providing accommodation to displaced families was on the Delhi government, as over the years, officials of the public works department (PWD) or the road owing agency had either not been vigilant or had ignored the extensive encroachments.The east civic body had demolished 56 houses constructed on a service road of the Master Plan Road following a court order on clearing encroachments. On July 17, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had visited the spot and ordered that the people affected by the drive be immediately shifted to temporary shelters. He had also directed officials to begin an in-depth study of the high court and whether a court order for demolition can be issued in the times of a pandemic.Justice Najmi Waziri on Thursday said the Delhi government may consider appropriate measures for fixing responsibility, as a deterrence, while also noting that the photographs shown to the court show a huge amount of debris littering the street and pavement.“The purpose of the demolition of houses remains unserved -- i.e. to restore the public street to public use immediately. Let the EDMC clear the entire rubble within 48 hours,” the court said, while stating that an affidavit, along with photographs, be filed by the executive engineer of the EDMC before the next date of hearing.On Thursday, advocate Anurag Dhar Dubey, representing 15 petitioners, told the court that the life and health of the 121 displaced families are at stake. He contended that authorities carried out the demolition from July 6 to July 8 with absolute disregard to the plight of even those residents who were home quarantined on account of Covid-19. He said residents were treated in an inhumane manner and all their means of existence were destroyed.Appearing for the Delhi government, its additional standing counsel Gautam Narayan told the court that the displaced persons have been accommodated in a neighbourhood school. He said 50 families have already been shifted there and 50 more are expected to be shifted by Thursday or Friday.The court directed Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and deputy commissioner, Delhi government, to ensure that requisite measures are in place to contain the spread of Covid-19 and provisions are made to ensure the health and well-being of displaced persons.However, the court clarified that the temporary arrangement is only for the next couple of weeks, until the petitioners find an alternative residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/clear-rubble-from-laxmi-nagar-demolition-within-48-hours-hc-orders-east-civic-body/story-rVLZkB9J04h42UXE5Z1msK.html

The advisory body has completed work on the various chapters of the MDP-2041. The first step was to have focussed group discussions with experts, professionals and civil society groups on specific aspects of the plan.“The date and time of the public consultation meetings and events will be shared on the portal,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dda-to-discuss-mpd-2041-with-public/story-56sGq3KjwMID7F1wdRwHML.html
24-07-2020||Noida||Lotus buyers vote for Jaipuria Group to complete over 3,000 unfinished flats||Homebuyers of Lotus Panache and Lotus Boulevard have voted in favour of SMV Agencies Private Limited, also known as Jaipuria Group, for the construction of their pending 3,100 flats in the two delayed housing projects.According to the interim resolution professional (IRP) appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Jaipuria got 85% of votes, while 15% votes went to Purvanchal Projects Limited in the online voting.NCLT had given its nod to start insolvency proceedings against 3C group’s subsidiary Granite Gate Properties, which was developing the two Lotus projects.In January last year, homebuyers had dragged the 3C group to NCLT which appointed Chandra Prakash an IRP in the case. The resolution professional has been trying to select a new developer, who can take over the two projects and deliver flats. Three realty firms -- SMV Agencies, Purvanchal Projects and UV Asset Reconstruction Limited --had submitted their respective bids with an intention to take over the stuck housing projects. In the online voting, UV Asset did not get any vote, said Prakash on Friday.“The Jaipuria’s resolution plan will be submitted to NCLT, which is likely to approve it in a month or so. Once the plan is approved, the two housing projects will be transferred to the new developer. The developer will finish these projects in 24 months,” said Prakash, the NCLT-appointed IRP.As per the resolution plan, Rs 350 crore will be required to finish the two projects and Rs 425 crore will be collected from the homebuyers.“The good part is that Rs 650 crore has to be recovered from the developer, who misused the funds collected from buyers,” said Prakash.In 41-acre Lotus Panache, while 1,200 flats have been delivered so far, around 2,800 units are yet to be finished. In 36-acre Lotus Boulevard, 3,000 buyers have shifted into their flats, while another 300 are yet to get theirs. Despite repeated attempts, officials of Jaipuria Group could not be contacted for comments.“If Jaipuria is finalised by NCLT, then it will be good for the project and the homebuyers because this company is already working in these projects as a contractor. The buyers will be able to get desired quality from this developer,” said Sahil Sehti, lawyer for the homebuyers.NCLT is likely to finish the handover process in the next six months. The homebuyers said that finally they will be able to see the work happening at the site after a long wait.“We have been suffering for the past 10 years due to the fault of the developer. Now, we hope that our flats will be delivered in 24 months,” said Amit Chauhan, president of Lotus Panache welfare association, a group of homebuyers. The 3C group’s subsidiary Granite Gate Properties had started developing these two projects in 2009-10 with a promise of delivery in 2013-14. “We are troubled but never lost hope and kept using legal route to get justice. Finally, we are on way to get the justice,” said Chauhan.In December 2018, the corporate insolvency proceedings were started against 3C group when its promoters were arrested for allegedly diverting funds collected from homebuyers to other projects. While they were released on bail, the cases against them remain pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/lotus-buyers-vote-for-jaipuria-group-to-complete-over-3-000-unfinished-flats/story-TNA8ksCWphbUynwvTlV3ZJ.html

Officials said that the non-availability of labour and the ban on construction during the lockdown delayed the project. The Shankar Chowk flyover project is part of ₹162 crore flyover and underpass project that is being developed by NHAI with contributions from GMDA and private developers. It will help commuters coming from Cyber Hub and DLF phase 3 to move towards Udyog Vihar and Delhi with ease. Recently, the authority had stopped work due to non-payment of funds by some stakeholders but officials said it had been resumed after GMDA released around ₹10 crore. Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI said that flyover would be opened for traffic in first week of September and work was in progress. “We will be able to complete the work by end of August now as construction was delayed due to lack of labour. We are also hoping the remaining contribution will also be paid soon,” said Sharma. Sourabh Singhal, NHAI consultant for the project said that only work of three top slabs is remaining in the flyover and it will be completed by August 10.”The rest of the work like connecting ramps and finish would also be completed by end of August,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/shankar-chowk-flyover-to-open-in-september/story-j3L7rL07cQyEirjK0zqmCJ.html

This park will be home to newly-built group housings. Besides this, the authority is hiring agencies for other horticulture projects that include development of two wetlands and a small park, in a bid to beautify the city.“The Vedvan theme-based park is devoted to Indian scriptures and the saints who wrote these scriptures. The objective is to give residents or visitors an opportunity to understand old scriptures and how these writings can have a positive impact on our lives. The decision on which saints to be included is yet to be taken,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty (OSD) of the Noida authority, who is heading the horticulture department.Vedvan will have different varieties of medicinal plants and traditional Indian fruit bearing trees. “Families would be able to take children to these parks and educate them about spiritual and medicinal values of the trees,” said Singh.The authority has made a detailed project report of this project, which costs ₹30 crore.“We have made the DPR for this project. Now, the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi will vet this project as per rules. And subsequently, the authority will approve this project in its board meeting scheduled next month. Once this is done, we will float a tender to hire an agency to develop this unique park. We will start work at the site soon after these formalities are completed,” said Singh.The authority said it will take a month’s time to finish all formalities and float a tender.Meanwhile, the two wetlands to be developed by the authority are located in sectors 54 and 91, for which the budget is very small.“These wetlands will help in ground water conservation. Apart from this, we will develop a park on a budget of ₹6 crore in Sector 33A in front of the Shilp Haat. We will plant trees and beautify the barren land located in this sector,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/work-to-begin-soon-on-30-crore-park-dedicated-to-indian-scriptures-saints/story-hkIulGKymsM93Rqm47YgLK.html

The police said he was rushed to PGIMS Rohtak, where his condition is said to be stable.According to the police, the inmate, who was arrested and booked under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Sector 14 police station recently, was lodged in Bhondsi Jail. On Wednesday, he experienced fever and after a check-up in jail, he was taken to Sector 10 Civil Hospital, where he was admitted for treatment. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “His samples were taken and on Thursday evening, he was informed that he had tested positive for Covid-19. He was admitted in the prisoner ward at the time. After hearing the results of the tests, he panicked and tried to kill himself but the police officials deputed outside rescued him.

24-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Plasma bank to be ready soon; finding donors remains a challenge||The district’s own dedicated plasma bank will become operational in the next three to four days, officials from the health department and district administration said on Friday. They added that similar facilities are already operational at PGIMS Rohtak and ESI Hospital in Faridabad. The move, they said, would ease the challenge of finding donors — or patients who have recovered from Covid-19 — who are willing to provide plasma for the treatment of critical and moderately ill patients in Gurugram. Responding to a question at a press conference on Friday, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said, “A website has been built to facilitate the functioning of the plasma bank. The district administration has also been working on finding donors. In the next three to four days, we are hoping to start the facility.” Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, added, “We have prepared a database of recovered patients and are reaching out to them for plasma donation.”Shubhi Kesarwani, officer-in-charge of the project, however, said that volunteers are seeing a poor ‘conversion rate’, despite reaching out to several hundreds of recovered patients, urging them to come forward and donate plasma. “We have prepared a data base of over 4,000 recovered patients, and Red Cross volunteers are busy calling them up, one by one. So far, we have seen a poor response. There is a lot of apprehension among recovered patients and most of them cleanly refuse to donate. So far, we only have around 50 consenting donors,” Kesarwani said.While officials were reluctant to point to one singular reason as to why people are refusing to donate, they said that it is likely due to a fear of revisiting hospitals and medical centres, particularly after having endured the ordeal of recovery. They also said that stigma associated around the illness could very well be holding back the search for donors.Once launched, Gurugram’s plasma bank will be the third such facility in Haryana, after Rohtak and Faridabad. Health minister Anil Vij, on Thursday, had inaugurated a plasma bank at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak, which has also been carrying out an independent clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in treating moderately ill patients. So far, as part of the trial, PGIMS Rohtak has administered plasma therapy to at least 10 patients, of whom three have been discharged, one patient has died, two are not responding well, and one more patient is responding relatively better. The status of the other three patients could not be verified. A doctor at PGIMS, Rohtak, who was closely involved in the trial and requested anonymity, said, “We have administered plasma therapy to 10 patients, and the results are not very promising. But then, the sample size is also small. Plasma therapy as a useful modality still needs supporting evidence, but in the absence of other treatments, the ICMR and the Indian government are allowing it as compassionate or off-label use.”The doctor was of the opinion that Gurugram, though well-equipped to administer plasma therapy, would continue to face challenges in finding consenting donors. “We have faced this same issue in Rohtak, and it is the same scenario across the country,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-plasma-bank-to-be-ready-soon-finding-donors-remains-a-challenge/story-FiSycrlOVMcd5qsgpfTvLL.html
24-07-2020||City||No headway in Vikram Tyagi disappearance case, SHO sent to police lines||The Ghaziabad police Friday transferred to police lines the station house officer (SHO) of Sihani Gate after senior officers, during a review, found that in the past month and a half, several major crimes -- car robbery, kidnapping and snatching -- have taken place in his jurisdiction and no headway was made in any of the pending cases. One of the major pending cases is related to the kidnapping of 36-year-old project manager of a construction company, Vikram Tyagi, who went missing on the night of June 26. Nearly a month after Tyagi went missing, the Ghaziabad police is yet to crack the case and the police brass have now roped in the UP special task force (UP-STF) to conduct a parallel investigation in the case. “The SHO of Sihani Gate police station was sent to police lines on account of lax supervision even after several crime incidents took place. On our part, we have investigated every possible angle in the Tyagi case and we will continue with the investigation. The STF has been roped in and their dedicated teams will work to solve the case now. So far, there is no ransom call and no body has been found. The blood found in Tyagi’s car was his, as per forensic reports,” Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city), said. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kalanidhi Naithani did not respond to repeated calls seeking his response on the issue. Tyagi, on the night of June 26, was on way home to Raj Nagar Extension in his Innova Crysta when he went missing. His phone came as “switched off” after 7.45pm when his family tried reaching him and, following a hectic search for him, they filed a complaint with the police. The police registered a case under kidnapping and started investigations. The day after he went missing, Tyagi’s car was found in Muzaffarnagar, about 100km from Ghaziabad, with bloodstains inside and some damage to the rear of the car, which suggested that something has rammed the SUV. The bloodstains were found on the middle seats of the SUV and its registration plates were missing, the police said. The police said they have also come to know that two men were spotted in the car at a checkpoint near Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar district the night before the car was recovered. “Several of our teams were roped in. We scanned dozens of CCTV camera footage from checkpoints at toll plazas and other places. A hectic search was launched to trace the man but we are still clueless. At present, we are treating it as a case of kidnapping but we have no ransom call or a body,” Mishra said. RK Mishra, deputy superintendent of police (STF), said he received directions on assisting with the investigation five days ago. “Dedicated teams from Noida and Meerut units will begin investigation in the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-headway-in-vikram-tyagi-disappearance-case-sho-sent-to-police-lines/story-PHq228qvTWn43y4XGwaE9O.html
24-07-2020||City||In past two days, only 23 qualify for home isolation in Ghaziabad||Two days since Ghaziabad prepared itself to offer home isolation for asymptomatic patients, only 23 patients were found to be eligible for it. District officials said that the patients were asked to submit an undertaking promising to follow home isolation guidelines.With rising cases, the Uttar Pradesh government on July 20 had allowed asymptomatic infected people to isolate themselves at their home thereby reducing the strain on the health infrastructure.The district set up nine rapid response teams at the Covid control room and got in touch with about 200 such people till now, apart from keeping in regular contact with all positive patients daily.“So far 23 positive cases were found eligible for home isolation and 16 consented. It is too early to say how many patients will be eligible for home isolation, but we will be able to get an estimate within a week,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “In the meantime our teams will get in touch with all positive patients to know whether they will opt for home isolation or not.”The conditions for home isolation include the undertaking from the patient, a consulting doctor to declare the patient asymptomatic, round-the-clock availability of a caregiver for the patient, a minimum of two toilets at home and separate isolation room. Patients will also have to purchase medical kits equipped with pulse oximeter, thermometer, mask, gloves, among others. In their revised guidelines issued on Tuesday night, the UP government said that asymptomatic patients in home isolation will be considered as recovered if they do not show any symptoms for 10 days. “Those who were not willing for home isolation considered the potential risk to their family, while there were others who did not have the facilities as mandated by the guidelines. So, we are keeping track of all possibilities and also focussing in early treatment and early discharge of patients from our Covid facilities as per the revised discharge guidelines,” he added. According to official estimates, the asymptomatic patients account for about 70% share in total cases in the district. “As per the latest guidelines, the asymptomatic patient can be discharged from the 10th day of their sample. Earlier, it was on the 10th day from the date of admission to a Covid hospital. So, there was a gap of about 2-3 days which has now been reduced due to delay in receiving test reports. So, asymptomatic patients can be discharged faster,” said an officer from the health department who wished not be named. “Now with rapid antigen tests, the reports are received within an hour and we have made sure that patient is admitted maximum within 12 hours of his test/sample.”Between June 21 and July 21, the district discharged about 2,351 patients. With the latest guidelines, 688 patients were discharged in just three days till July 24.“With active systems in place now and control room working in integrated manner, we have been able to upload 86% of our contact tracing data of patients to our portal. With home isolation in place, we are also scaling up the monitoring of patients at home besides taking care of timely discharge of asymptomatic patients from our Covid facilities,” Pandey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-past-two-days-only-23-qualify-for-home-isolation-in-ghaziabad/story-ZQXugzsyUPC8NDDI9hrUmK.html
24-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Senior citizens least tested group despite being most vulnerable||Even though they are recognised as a high-risk group, those above the age of 60 had been tested the least for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)in Ghaziabad district till date, according to district health data. They also showed the highest test positivity among the age groups. According to the records maintained by the district health department, out of the total 78, 659 samples sent for testing till July 24 afternoon, the share of elderly (60+) tested was 5.37 %. Out of the total 4,277 senior citizens tested so far, at least 428 have tested positive-- a positivity rate of 10.13%. According to the data, those between the age group of 21-40 years have been tested the most at 55.58% (43,717 samples); with a total of 2,068 cases, the TPR—– the proportion of people testing positive to those tested expressed in percentage – for this age group stands at 4.73%. The second most tested people are those in the 41-60 years age group; out of 17,988 tested (22.87 % of total tests), 1,415 have tested positive with a TPR of 7.87%. They are followed by those between 11-20 years of age: out of the total 8,174 tested (10.39% of total tests), 366 have tested positive (TPR 4.48%). Children have the lowest TPR of 3.76; 4,553 (5.79 % of total tests) in the age group of 0-10 years have been tested, out of which 171 have turned positive.The district administration said it plans to ramp testing for senior citizens during the door-to-door surveillance exercise that will start from Saturday on the orders of the chief minister.“Other age groups have been tested more as younger people generally move around more when compared to the elderly who prefer to be at home and follow social distancing. The chief minister on Friday has asked for door-to-door survey activities to be taken up in seven cities, including Ghaziabad, and we have directed our surveillance teams to trace cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and test more senior citizens,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.Experts said that with more testing for senior citizens shall also see a decline in positivity rate.“The senior citizens have been tested the least and only in cases where a family member had positive or they have come in contact with an infected person. The test positivity rate is high as only selected cases were being tested. Once testing expands, the positivity will decline like in other age groups,” said DR VB Jindal, president (Ghaziabad chapter), Indian Medical Association.Residents also want more senior citizens to be tested. “Since the outbreak of Covid-19, senior citizens have been considered as a high-risk group and the majority of them are confined to homes and are taking precautions. As many among the elderly choose to be at home, maybe that is why there were tested less. If the health department deploys some mobile testing vans, we can expect more senior citizens to be tested,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi apartments’ resident’s welfare association.Of the total tests, rapid antigen kits were used to test about 41,859 samples, while the share of tests done through RT-PCR testing (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) is about 35, 243. The rest, 1,557 tests were conducted through TrueNat machines.“For the first four months, till June 24 we could conduct only about 600,000 tests. However, in the next one month (till July 24), 1.1 million more tests were done and the increase in testing is helping us out in early detection of case and subsequent early treatment,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health).Meanwhile, the chief minister has directed for 100,000 daily tests in the state.“The CM has directed that districts with a population over 3 million will conduct 2,000 rapid tests per day while others will take up 1,000 rapid tests per day. The CM has also directed for door-to-door survey in seven districts like Kanpur city, Lucknow, Ghaziabad, and Ballia among others,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-senior-citizens-least-tested-group-despite-being-most-vulnerable/story-rcCjbjITp6Cp6yZjqgHE3M.html

24-07-2020||Gurugram||In two weeks of lockdown, 128 illegal registries done: RTI reply||Over 120 property registrations were carried out in Gurugram without a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the department of town and country planning during a part of the Covid-19 induced lockdown period between April 20 and May 4, according to a reply to a Right to Information (RTI) request.The issue of such illegal registrations, that violated section 7A of the Haryana development and regulation of urban areas Act, 1975, is not new and has been repeatedly raised by the department of town and country planning (DTCP). The rules state that for registration of agricultural land less than two kanals, its owners had to take an NOC from the DTCP before a sale. Following similar allegations in other parts of the state, the Haryana government had banned the registration of property deeds from July 22 to August 17 starting that it wanted to introduce a robust system to curb such malpractices. The RTI was filed by city-based activist Ramesh Yadav. The reply from the district revenue department was provided on July 23. “Taking advantage of the lockdown, a sizeable number of property deeds of agricultural land in controlled area were registered by the revenue authorities across the district, he said. “Such violations have been carried out across the state during the lockdown and the matter should be probed in detail.”The RTI reply stated that 128 such registrations had happened between April 20 and May 4, the period for which the request was filed. Two registries were carried out in Chauma village, 74 in Sohna tehsil, two in Wazirpur tehsil, 10 in Qadipur tehsil, 10 in Harsaru and 30 in Badshahpur tehsil between April 20 and May 4. Yadav says that a scrutiny of records after May 4 will throw up a lot more of such registries, which will boost unauthorized colonization in the city. “Agricultural and whatever is not licensed has been sold as small plots and registered by revenue authorities. I have repeatedly written letters to the government in this regard but the action of banning registries has come too late,” he said. Last month, the director, town and country planning had also written to the district revenue authorities regarding rampant registration of property deeds of small plots without NOC. Following that, the Gurugram deputy commissioner had issued directions and attached DTCP officials with tehsils and sub-tehsils to work in coordination with revenue officials and prevent such registries.Makrand Pandurang, director, DTCP, said that the department had raised the issue several times with the local authorities. “The illegal registration leads to development of unauthorised colonies where people live in poor civic conditions as it has no infrastructure. The government also loses lot of revenue in terms of development fees. This needs to be strictly curbed and the new system is likely to ensure this once it is implemented,” said Pandurang. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, who is also the head of revenue department, said that the issue was being probed. “Employees who have carried out such violations are liable for disciplinary action and punishment will be given as per the civil services rules,” said Khatri. “A more robust and dynamic property registration system will be implemented and it will reduce the human intervention to the minimum.” Basti Ram, district revenue officer, did not respond to repeated phone calls and messages seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/in-two-weeks-of-lockdown-128-illegal-registries-done-rti-reply/story-jLxdlh36HYyzwvYKkYJKsL.html
24-07-2020||Gurugram||Recent spate of crimes, internet calls: What led sleuths to Bhondsi Jail DSP||A day after the deputy jail superintendent (DJS) of Bhondsi Jail was arrested in a raid for allegedly supplying mobile phone SIM cards and narcotics to inmates in jail, the police on Friday said the arrest of the DSJ and his aide was facilitated by an investigation launched by the police, after a spate of recent crimes in Sohna, Pataudi and Rewari areas revealed that jail inmates were increasingly using mobile phones to give directions to their aides outside to plan and execute crimes. On Thursday, DJS Dharmbir Chautala and his alleged associate, Ravi alias Goldy, were arrested after a raid during which 11 4G SIM cards and 230 grams of charas (a type of cannabis) were allegedly recovered from the jail superintendent’s house. A preliminary probe had found that Ravi, who was earlier arrested for drug-peddling, used to allegedly source the contraband and supply it to Chautala, who then sneaked it into the jail and charged ₹20,000 for a 4G SIM and ₹5000 for a packet of 5 grams of charas from inmates. A senior police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that in recent crimes, a pattern was noticed about communication from jail between inmates and some suspects, which led the police to investigate the link. During the probe, it was found that the DJS was involved in supplying the SIM cards and other contraband items to jail inmates. Some recent incidents of crime further deepened the suspicion of the police. “On June 26, a brick kiln owner was shot dead in Sohna by three men, who had arrived in an Alto car. The police arrested the Alto car owner, who told the police that he had received a WhatsApp call from an associate in jail, who told him to provide his car to the inmate’s cousin for the crime. In another recent double murder case in Rewari, a criminal lodged in Bhondsi jail had told his henchmen to execute the crime. In Pataudi, a gangster had made an extortion call from a jail. The crime branch investigated the common link of gangsters increasingly using WhatsApp or voice-over internet protocol calls to run their network which led to the trail,” said the senior police official, adding that senior jail officials are exempted from routine checking, which might have helped the DJS to allegedly sneak in contraband items. On Friday, a crime team of city police questioned several inmates, who were allegedly in touch with the accused deputy jail superintendent, about the alleged nexus. At least two SIM cards and 12 mobile phones were recovered from the inmates after a search operation. Another police official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Several gangsters run their extortion rackets from jail premises using phones. Kaushal, who was arrested last year, had told investigators that his henchmen, who were lodged in Bhondsi Jail, ‘ran his book’ from the jail. From cigarettes and mobile phones to drugs, everything is smuggled and sold at inflated prices in the jail.”Sandeep Malik, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sohna, whose team led the raid on Thursday, said, “ During preliminary questioning, the accused DSJ had confessed to supplying sulpha on one or two occasions. He has revealed the names of certain inmates to whom he had supplied mobile phones. His associate Ravi was earlier arrested. During his arrest, he came in touch with DJS Chautala. Ravi was aware of the network of certain criminals outside the jail and used to supply drugs, phone and other contraband items for them. He later started supplying items to Chautala, who charged hefty sums from inmates.”The accused men, Chautala and Ravi, were produced in a district court on Friday and sent to judicial custody in Bhondsi Jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/recent-spate-of-crimes-internet-calls-what-led-sleuths-to-bhondsi-jail-dsp/story-pYwwywVsjleBx6LXkvdJOP.html
24-07-2020||City||Ludhiana BJP unit stages sit-in against power tariff hike in Punjab||The district unit of BJP on Friday staged a sit-in protest outside the office of electricity board chief engineer against not waiving the fixed charges on industrial connections and hike in domestic power tariff in the state.The protesters also submitted a memorandum to the chief engineer in this regard.BJP district president Pushpinder Singhal said the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government has backtracked from its announcement, which shows that it is not serious about the problems of people and industries in Punjab.Singhal alleged that the state government also increased the charges on domestic electricity supply by tweaking some regulations. He said the government did not withdraw fixed expenditure incurred on electricity bills of industrial consumption medium supply and large supply connections from March 22 to May 22, despite industrialists’ requests.Since the shutdown of industrial units was not voluntary, but done in compliance of official orders, it becomes the responsibility of the government to waive the fixed power expenses, he demanded.“It is a matter of great sorrow and shame that the elected representative of the state is trying to rob people by adopting such tactics. Industries in Punjab are not in a position to pay these charges,” stressed Singhal.BJP district media chief Satish Kumar and district vice-president Yogendra Makol among others were present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-bjp-unit-stages-sit-in-against-power-tariff-hike-in-punjab/story-Z55f4LPQaZczUQC3VCaduK.html
24-07-2020||Gurugram||To resume operations, firms mass test employees in violation of norms||The Gurugram health department on Friday said they have come across private companies and factories conducting mass Covid-19 testing of their employees even if they were asymptomatic, a practice not permitted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The guidelines for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing state that in case of asymptomatic patients, only those who have been in direct contact or are high risk contact of an already confirmed Covid-19 case can give their samples for coronavirus testing. Their samples have to be collected on the fifth and 10th day after coming in contact with a confirmed case. “As per the ICMR guidelines, mass sampling for Covid-19 is not permitted,” said Dr. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. “It has, however, come to the notice of the health department and private labs that factories and companies want all deployed employees to be tested, even if they are asymptomatic,” he said.After 68 days of lockdwon, factories and companies have resumed operations in many parts of the city. However, with the threat of coronavirus infection still large, many have wanted to get their employees tested quickly.Some tied up with private labs to conduct mass testing of their employees. Many who tested positive left the city without information the district officials. “Mass sampling is currently not happening but there have been incidents in the past where such cases have come to notice,” said Yadav.The department has not taken any action against any private lab or company yet.Currently, private labs in Gurugram are collecting 400-500 samples every day. Labs can conduct mass testing, also called pool testing, of all those showing symptoms and those who came in contact with a positive case or are within a containment zone or hot spot area. To ramp up testing, the Union ministry of health and family welfare, in the first week of June, allowed private labs to test for the disease on the prescription of any registered practitioner.“The Centre has strongly advised states/UTs to take immediate steps to facilitate testing at the earliest by enabling all qualified medical practitioners, including private practitioners, to prescribe Covid test to any individual fulfilling the criteria for testing as per the ICMR,” reads the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/to-resume-operations-firms-mass-test-employees-in-violation-of-norms/story-vvYDmPfZOUUo4c2LTACkmJ.html
24-07-2020||Gurugram||MCG increases its target of planting saplings by three times||Following an overwhelming response from the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) of the city, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has now increased its target for planting saplings this monsoon season by almost three times. Prior to the start of its plantation drive on June 27, the MCG had initially set a target of planting 40,000 saplings by the end of the monsoon season. However, officials said, so far, 275 RWAs have registered for the drive, thereby raising the total demand of saplings to 1.2 lakh or almost three times the original target. As a part of the drive, which is being carried out every weekend until the city stops receiving rain, the MCG is providing saplings to the RWAs free of cost. Members of the RWA and officials of the MCG then plant sapling together at a designated point either within the residential area or at vacant land outside the premises. This is the first time that the MCG has initiated a plantation drive on such a large scale. As per MCG officials, the rationale behind this drive is to increase the diminishing green cover of the city. According to a 2019 Forest Survey of India (FSI) report, only 9.2% of Gurugram’s total geographical area is under forest cover In 2017, the same was 9.3%.“We did not expect such a big turnout from the RWAs in the city. As such, initially, we only kept a target of planting 40,000 saplings These saplings have been developed in our own nurseries and are being distributed among the RWAs. We have arranged for more saplings from the forest department and will try our best to distribute as many saplings as possible before the monsoon season ends. Our objective this year is not only to increase the city’s green cover but to also to ensure that the saplings survive,” said Devendra Bhadana, executive engineer, MCG, horticulture wing.Bhadana said that the MCG will also be keeping a record of all the saplings that were planted this monsoon to ensure that they are properly monitored and have a high survival rate.“One of the problems we faced in the past was that after saplings were planted, no proper follow-up was carried out. As a result, a majority of the saplings perished. We now want to ensure our efforts don’t go to waste. By assigning the responsibility of maintaining the saplings to the local RWAs, and by keeping a log of the total number of saplings planted, the type of sapling planted, and the area where it was done, we can keep a constant check on its condition,” said Bhadana.As per MCG officials, with the help of 120 RWAs out of those who have registered, the civic body has so far planted more than 20,000 saplings across the city so far. Some of the sapling planted by the MCG include gulmohar (royal poinciana), simal (bombax ceiba), kachnar, babool (gum arabic tree), and peepal (sacred fig). The MCG is also asking RWAs to donate old, broken or discarded tiles, bottles, crockery, CDs, jute materials, old clothes, metal objects, tyres, glass, plastic and wooden crates so that they can recycle them and make objects, such as face masks, tyres, wooden pots, decorated bottles and tile pieces. Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson Qutub Enclave RWA, said,“Last week we planted 10,000 saplings in our private colony. Since then, more residents have come forward demanding saplings. We will be asking MCG for another round of plant saplings in two weeks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-increases-its-target-of-planting-saplings-by-three-times/story-94ZhFj0HwlTPgEAEbgpIDI.html

My government has already spent Rs 300 crores on providing Covid care and related expenses. We have done much more,” he said, adding, “The CM Relief Fund being questioned by the SAD has been set aside by my government for emergency purposes, to be used as and when needed.” The SAD had questioned the government on only Rs 2.28 crore being spent out of CM Relief Fund. “If the Akalis were at all concerned about covid care in the state, they should ask the Centre why they had failed to support the Punjab government in this critical time,” said the CMHe added Rs 64 crore that the CM fund had was drop in the ocean compared to crores of rupees already spent by his government on infrastructure upgrade, setting up of Covid Care Centres, roping in additional medical and para-medical staff, purchase of PPE kits and other essential equipment.

24-07-2020||City||Do not insist on details of mentally ill for Covid test: HC to ICMR||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Friday said mobile number, government-issued identity card, photographs or even a residential proof should not be insisted upon for Covid-19 test of mentally ill homeless persons and asked the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to come out with a clarification in this regard.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said ICMR should issue a clarification by way of a circular or an official order that the identity proof, address proof and mobile number are not required for testing mentally ill homeless persons.“Guidelines have to be given by you (ICMR). You put it in black and white for the states’ benefit. You only need to clarify in two-three lines that mobile number, address proof and identity cards are not required for testing mentally ill homeless persons,” it said.Earlier, on June 19, the ICMR had issued an advisory that every person who was to be tested for Covid-19 has to provide a government-issued identity proof and should have a valid phone number for tracing and tracking the individual and his/her contacts. The bench was hearing a PIL moved by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal seeking directions to ICMR and Delhi government to issue guidelines for Covid-19 testing of mentally ill homeless persons in the capital.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma, appearing for ICMR, sought time to take instructions from the government regarding the observations made by the bench.The high court, thereafter, listed the matter for further hearing on August 7.The high court on July 9 had asked ICMR to consider the plight of the mentally ill homeless persons and see if they can be tested without insisting upon a mobile number, government identity card and residential address proof.In response, ICMR had filed an affidavit, stating that government identity card and telephone number was sought to ensure proper tracing and treatment of positive cases and their contacts as “Test/Track/Treat” is the best strategy to control the Covid-19 pandemic. It said since health was a state subject, the state health authority concerned may consider adopting a suitable protocol to ensure the strategy of “Test/Track/Treat” is followed and the grievance raised in the PIL is addressed.The plea had said the Delhi government had not taken seriously the lack of guidelines on Covid-19 testing of mentally ill homeless persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/do-not-insist-on-details-of-mentally-ill-for-covid-test-hc-to-icmr/story-XHPWhZ3DCmn8JZeKBuhzeN.html

The high court simultaneously posted the pleas challenging the University Grants Commission’s direction to conduct the exams for a later date after it was informed that the Supreme Court would be hearing similar matters.Justice Pratibha M Singh, during the hearing, also issued a notice to the owner of CSE Academy to appear on July 27 and inform the court about the preparedness of the centres for both mock tests and main exams. CSE Academy has been engaged by the Ministry of Electronics and Technology and has an agreement with the Delhi University.Justice Prathiba M Singh also asked the academy owner to provide the list of centres where the Delhi University final exams will be held. She also asked senior advocate Sachin Datta (ADVOCATE FOR WHOM?) to find out whether a private party or organisation has also been engaged to help conduct the exams.The high court was hearing a plea challenging Delhi University’s decision to hold OBE, as per the UGC guidelines, for final-year undergraduate students.At the outset of the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the University Grants Commission (UGC), told the court that various petitions challenging the UGC guidelines for final-year exams in central universities had been listed before the Supreme Court on Thursday and were likely to be listed again on July 27.He urged that these petitions be taken up for hearing after the apex court hearing. Following this, the court posted the matter for further hearing on July 30.Advocate Apoorv Kurup, appearing for UGC, submitted a report by a UGC committee headed by professor RC Kuhad on the final guidelines for the examination.Earlier this week, the high court had asked UGC to clarify if final-year examinations could be conducted using Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQ), open choice questions, assignments and presentations, instead of long-form exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/how-prepared-are-common-service-centres-for-varsity-final-year-exams-asks-hc/story-FUeqQIAlGLRdDExXbyDPVM.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||Two of an ATM card-cloning gang held||The Delhi Police on Friday said they busted a gang of swindlers who travelled to Delhi from their hometown Hisar in Haryana, lived in hotels or rented rooms and cloned ATM cards by stealing data and overwriting on invalid or stolen plastic cards using hand-held skimming devices.The gang has six members, and the cyber cell of the crime branch arrested two of them, identified as Ramesh Kumar, 29, and Sonu Singh, 22. The police recovered 21 cloned debit cards of various banks, a skimming machine, and two cellphones that they used in the crimes.Senior crime branch officers said that the gang’s modus operandi differs from other gangs’ involved in similar frauds. Unlike other gangs that usually tamper with ATM keypads or replace the card holder’s debit card with a fake while engaging them in a conversation, members of this gang impersonate bank executives and scan the cards’ data via skimming devices on the pretext of rectifying issues faced by the cardholders. The racketeers had purchased the skimming devices online, the officers said.“To avoid getting caught, they mostly visited ATM booths in secluded areas in Delhi-NCR that are not manned by security guards. They usually targeted elderly persons or those with a rural background. They would secretly note the cardholders’ PIN and used it to withdraw money using cloned cards,” said the deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell, crime branch) Bhisham Singh. The gang has been active in Delhi-NCR for the past few months, but its members were never caught as they would maintain a low profile and use several tricks to avoid police attention. “The arrested men told us they would transact low amounts using the cloned cards since they believed that card users rarely lodge complaints with banks or the police for low amount frauds,” said a senior crime branch officer associated with the team that busted the racket.On July 19, one Amit Goel,33, withdrew ₹8,000 and was counting the currency notes when a masked man using the other machine in the ATM booth in Delhi’s Karampura pointed out that the machine was asking for his cellphone number.“I fed my contact number, but the machine did not accept it. Since I was holding cash and other items in my hands, the man offered to help me. He took my debit card, inserted it into the machine and fed my cellphone number, which the machine accepted. Thereafter, we both left,” said Goel.According to Goel, his card stopped working, and he got a ₹500 transaction message. Goel thought the money was deducted by the bank as a usual charge for availing various facilities such as netbanking.“I ignored it and did not lodge a complaint. It was only when I got a call from the crime branch office who told me about the fraud that I realised that I had been cheated,” said Goel.Another crime branch officer said that his team members had received information through their criminal intelligence network about this gang and they were collecting information about the suspects.On July 21, the officer said they received information that the suspects would come to an ATM booth in outer Delhi’s Prem Nagar to withdraw money using the cloned cards. “We conducted a raid and arrested two of the men with 21 cloned cards and a skimming device. We have solved two cases with these arrests and are working to find the original holders of the remaining 19 cards. Raids are on to nab the four other members of the gang who are on the run,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-of-an-atm-card-cloning-gang-held/story-nL1mpYieV6JfD3GsZBG2PL.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||Visitors start trickling in to Dilli Haat, govt to offer artisans a rental cut||Days after it reopened to public, the Dilli Haat near INA Market in south Delhi, a much visited hub of crafts, art, culture and food, is gradually reclaiming its artisans and visitors. The ticket counters are still closed, as entry is free until August 15.Until 3pm Friday, at least 30 visitors had come in, said the security team manning the entry. Many craft shops are yet to open shop, as artisans from far-off states have not been able to return to the capital owing to restrictions on travel on account of Covid-19.According to officials managing the haat, on the occasion of Hariyali Teej (July 23), 163 visitors had come -- the highest footfall since it reopened on July 4 after remaining shut for nearly three months since the nationwide lockdown began on March 25.Many said they dropped in just to get a breath of fresh air. However, many visitors said they had expected food stalls to open, but only one or two were doing business. Except for two government-run food stalls --the Tamil Nadu cafe and Mother Dairy outlet -- all others are expected to open by August 1, said officials.Yashika Joshi, who had come with her family from Gurugram, said, “It was getting too suffocating being at home and working from home for almost four months. Besides, malls do not allow children entry, so we came here to just hang around for a while.”Although sales are yet to pick up, artisans said at least there is something to look forward to, which is better than sitting at home.“I set up my stall on Thursday. The sales are about 20%. In two days, I’ve made around ₹5,000-7,000, while earlier, before the lockdown, I used earn around ₹35,000-40,000 a day,” said Eijaz Hussain, an artisan from Lucknow, who sells traditional women clothing. The craft shop owners, housed in permanent shops, too said visitors are not buying the finer stuff as much as they did earlier. “I opened the shop on July 20. Since then, I have sold just two or three items. People are not purchasing as they used to. We are hoping that the footfall increases over the weekend, as the weather too is now pleasant,” Ritu Parvez, who runs a Banarasi handloom shop, said.A food stall owner, who did not wish to be named, said their major concern was not having enough staff or as much business to pay the rent. “We had requested the Delhi tourism department to consider reducing rent by 50%, as there is not much business. Every food stall used to have at least 10-15 workers, most of whom had gone back to their home states,” he said.Officials from the tourist department said of the 166 craft shops, 28 are open at present while six or seven of the 46 commercial stall artisans are also back.Sanjay Goel, managing director, Delhi Tourism department, said \the footfall is slowly picking up and they also plan to cut the rents in all categories by almost one-third. “A decision has been taken in this regard. We will make the rents for all types of stalls almost one third of the existing rates until August 31. After that, we will review the situation. With reduced rentals, we expect more stall owners to return and business to pick up.”He added that additional staff has been deployed to maintain social distancing while thermal screening is mandatory before entry into the haat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/visitors-start-trickling-in-to-dilli-haat-govt-to-offer-artisans-a-rental-cut/story-vjL4tNNeufU3a4xEWdqEtN.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||Extension of bails, paroles meant to contain Covid-19 spread in jails, clarifies high court||A Delhi high court Friday clarified its order on the extension of interim bail and parole and said it was extending these repeatedly only to prevent the possible spread of Covid-19 among jail inmates from those returning after the expiry of their bail or parole period.A three-judge bench of chief justice DN Patel, justice Siddharth Mridul and justice Talwant Singh said they are extending the bail/parole so that prisoners do not return and spread the virus further.The clarification was given after a plea was moved by a convict whose interim bail was not extended by a judge stating that the July 13 order of the high court, extending all such reliefs till August 31 was not applicable to the convict.The judge said the July 13 order was only applicable to those eligible for interim bail or parole as per the criteria laid down by the high powered committee (HPC) which was set up on the Supreme Court’s directions to decongest prisons and thereby contain the spread of Covid-19 within the prison walls.During the hearing, the bench said it did not go into merits of each case while extending the bails and paroles. It said that the “order of the full bench was being confused with the directions of the HPC”.The bench further said the extension order was passed as the director general of prisons had said the jails were overcrowded and it would be difficult to contain the spread of Covid-19 if they are not decongested.“You cannot approbate and reprobate in the same breath,” the bench told DG Prisons, represented by Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain.The bench said though there was no ambiguity in its July 13 order, it will clarify it further.The July 13 order had come on a suo mottu plea by the high court in April to ensure that expiry of orders during restricted functioning of the courts would not affect litigants, lawyers or prisoners since they would not be able to approach the courts during the lockdown, which was in force then.The detailed order of Friday (July 24) is awaited. The main petition is listed for hearing on August 24 when the bench would decide on whether to further extend the interim orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/extension-of-bails-paroles-meant-to-contain-covid-19-spread-in-jails-clarifies-high-court/story-JWu8Z0Z69nMNAkUGihHnOL.html

These are—- Government Middle School, Kular, Government High School, Babarpur, and Government Senior Secondary School, Karamsar. From all 22 districts of the state, the state education department selected one school in each category after they excelled on five parameters of the grading process-- results, infrastructure, co-curricular activities, school management committee and public contribution and students’ attendance. A grant of ₹4.54 lakh has been issued by the DPI office and e-transferred to the bank accounts of the schools. As per details, GMS, Kular, received ₹ 90,909, GHS, Babarpur, received ₹1,36,363 and GSSS, Karamsar, got ₹2,27,272.On June 26 last year, district education officers and heads of middle, primary and secondary schools were informed regarding the grading process. The school principals or in-charges uploaded their school’s details on e-Punjab web portal. On basis of the information, the state department selected the winner. GMS, Kular, is a self-made smart school and has a strength of 58 students with five teachers. The school in-charge, Bhupinder Singh, said, “Villagers have contributed a lot in improving the school building and infrastructure and now the school can offer better facilities to students. We will utilise the funds sent by the state for the betterment of the school,” he said.GHS, Babarpur, has a strength of 105 students and offers all facilities including smart classrooms, library, edusat lab, computer lab and water facilities with RO installed. Hardev Singh, DPE-cum-incharge, said, “The state funds can be used to maths and science parks so that students get practical exposure.”Principal of GSSS Karamsar, Gurmeet Kaur, said, “I joined the school six months ago and tried to make a difference. After receiving donations from NRI’s and former students, over Rs 2 lakh had been spent on improving infrastructure and repair work. I will utilise the funds sent by the state to maintain the school playground so that students can excel in the sports also. The school’s Class 12 result was 100% and the topper , Pawandeep Kaur, scored 94.4%.” District education officer (secondary), Swaranjit Kaur, said, “I congratulate the heads and staff of the three government schools.

24-07-2020||City||Hold virtual rallies of youths, Sikhs and Dalits in every block, Nadda to Punjab BJP||Chandigarh In his first interaction with the Punjab unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since taking over as the national president of the party, Jagat Prakash Nadda on Friday exhorted the state unit to hold three virtual rallies of youths, Dalits and Sikhs in every organisational block in the state. He gave the party workers a timeline of two months to hold these rallies, as he attended the meeting of the state unit via videoconference. Nadda, who belongs to Himachal Pradesh, has also served as election in-charge for the party on couple of occasions during assembly polls.“Take people from all religions together and let us unitedly work together for the development of state and the party,” he said. “Besides giving the task of holding three virtual rallies at every booth, the party president specifically asked all leaders to infuse energy to make the party strong at every booth,” said state general secretary of the party, Subhash Sharma.Nadda’s remarks hold political significance at a time when local BJP leaders are usually almost always keen to stake their claim on eking out an increased number of seats to contest from their alliance partner in the state, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in the assembly polls. “Nadda also asked state BJP chief Ashwani Sharma to give the party a new direction and work hard to strengthen the organisation at booth level, in order to make history,” a senior leader, who was party of the meeting said.Senior leaders added Nadda called for stronger committees and induction of more youth in the party, with focus on those nearing 20 years. State BJP chief Sharma said, “The party state unit will go all-out to strengthen itself in all 117 assembly segments of the state. We also seek a CBI probe into the embezzlement in distribution of food material that the Centre had sent to Punjab during the covid-19 pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hold-virtual-rallies-of-youths-sikhs-and-dalits-in-every-block-nadda-to-punjab-bjp/story-nXIK3D8e2BXBaErw8PfHxN.html
24-07-2020||City||Release Shagun to all beneficiaries under Ashirwad scheme: SAD||Chandigarh The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday demanded that the Congress government must release “Shagun” money under the Ashirwad scheme immediately to all Scheduled Caste (SC)/Backward Classes (BC) brides. Party spokesman Pawan Kumar Tinu claimed it was shocking that the benefit of the scheme was not disbursed over the past year. The payment paid as Shagun is Rs 21,000. “The Congress government has a history of discrimination towards Dalits, who form a major chunk of the beneficiaries. Earlier it did not release scholarship to SC students leading to the reduction of total strength of students in state colleges. Now, they are denying Shagun to SC brides,” he said.Seeking CM Captain Amarinder Singh’s intervention, Tinu said state government was not taking any steps to correct injustices being done unto Dalits by his government. The SAD leader said SC/BC welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot had also failed in his duties and should be sacked forthwith.Tinu also reminded the chief minister of the promise made to the SC and BC communities that the disbursal under the Ashirwad scheme would be increased to Rs 51,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/release-shagun-to-all-beneficiaries-under-ashirwad-scheme-sad/story-Zwoky0ziHU9cQnvBM1cMYK.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||State universities will have to conduct final year exams: UGC||The University Grants Commission (UGC) in its affidavit filed before the Bombay high court in public interest litigation, which challenged the government’s decision of not conducting final year exams, has reiterated its stand that all state universities will have to conduct final year exams as per the revised guidelines issued by it, on July 6. The revised guidelines have stated that universities may reduce the time from three hours to two hours without compromising the quality, or conduct the exams through online/offline or blended mode till the end of September 2020. The UGC has submitted that appearing for the final year exams is mandatory and state universities have to adhere to its guidelines.The affidavit prepared by Dr Nikhil Kumar, education officer, UGC has mentioned that the UGC had constituted an expert committee under the provisions of the UGC Act to make recommendations regarding the conduction of terminal/final year exams in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The committee in its first decision had recommended that the exams were to be conducted in the month of July. The recommendations issued on April 29, 2020, were in the form of “UGC Guidelines on Examinations and Academic Calendar for the Universities given Covid-19 pandemic and Subsequent Lockdown”.However, in light of the pandemic, the committee was reconvened and on July 6 it made recommendations to extend the deadline for conducting the terminal or final year exams till the end of September. The revised guidelines, however, also gave the option of reduction in time of the exam or conducting the exam through online, offline or blended mode. The affidavit further states that it is the apex regulating body for all state universities and hence they have to abide by the guidelines issued from time to time including the guidelines issued.The affidavit also rebuts the decision of the Maharashtra government to do away with the exams altogether and adopting an evaluation method to grant degrees which is contrary to the guidelines of the apex regulating body. The UGC said, “The decision of the respondent - state of Maharashtra - to hold terminal semester/ final year examinations for undergraduate or postgraduate students of traditional and professional courses (subject to the decisionof the apex regulatory body concerned), at a later date (which may be even beyond September 2020), or to graduate such students and confer on them degrees without appearing for the final year or terminal semester examinations, is contrary to UGC’s guidelines. Such a decision will also be an encroachment on the legislative field of coordinating and determining the standards of higher education which is exclusively reserved for parliament under Entry 66 of List I of Schedule VII of the Constitution.” The affidavit by UGC was filed after the court sought to know its stand with regards to public interest litigation filed by Dhananjay Kulkarni, a former professor through advocate Uday Warunjikar. Kulkarni had challenged the June 19 resolution of the state government which stated that final year exams would not be held due to the Covid situation in the state and they would be assessed and given degrees based on the assessment of the previous exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-universities-will-have-to-conduct-final-year-exams-ugc/story-PD88M461LbmRnFoy4ZXa5O.html

The term of Chinese representative on the Nalanda University’s governing board, Prof Wang Bangwei, ended in November 2019.“There is no movement on this issue. I don’t think in the present circumstances (India-China standoff), there is something like this (having Chinese representative on Nalanda University board) on our minds,” said a Ministry of External Affairs official, who was not willing to be named. Prof Wang Bangwei is professor and director of the Institute of Oriental Studies and Oriental Literature Research Center at Peking University. His research included textual studies of Buddhist literature (of Sanskrit and its Chinese translation), history of Buddhism (both of China and of India) and Sino-Indian cultural interactions, among others. He had been the member of the Nalanda University governing board since its inception and involved with the setting up of the institution.“At present, there is no Chinese representative. It is not decided at the university level. We have representatives from other Asian countries,” said Nalanda University vice-chancellor Sunaina Singh. Ancient Nalanda had profound influence of China. The Chinese traveller Hieun Tsang (now Xuan Zang) stayed here in the 7th century AD and left a detailed description of the excellence of educational system and purity of monastic life practised here. He also gave a vivid account of both the ambience and architecture of this unique university.It was the reason why China was involved in developing the new Nalanda University. The NU governing board had also held its third meeting in Beijing on October 14-15, 2011.The proposed Xuanzang centre for Asian Studies with the Chinese collaboration also remains a non-starter. Former Nalanda University Chancellor George Yeo had signed an MoU with Peking University president Lin Jianhua on May 26, 2016, during President Pranab Mukherjee’s China visit. Later, the Consulate General of People’s Republic of China in Kolkata, Ma Zhanwu, had also visited the university to work out the modalities, but after that nothing happened, while China came up with its own version of Nalanda University, Nanhai Buddhist College on Nanshan Mountains in Hainan Province, in 2017. “Nothing has happened on the Xuanzang centre. It has remained stillborn since its inception. We are starting two new centres, Centre for Bay of Bengal Studies and Centre for Conflict Resolution, this year,” said the V-C, adding the university did not have any student or faculty member from China, though there were quite a few from East Asian Asian countries and even Cambodia and Romania.

The brief four-day monsoon session, the last session of the 16th Assembly, is scheduled from August 3 and will be held at Gyan Bhawan at the Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre in the state capital, which has a much bigger seating capacity than the central hall of the state legislature. Sources said the session could also be further truncated, but the decision would only be taken at the customary all-party meeting before the start of the session or the business advisory committee meeting comprising members from various political parties, which happens on the first day of the session itself. As Governor Phagu Chouhan has already summoned the Legislative Assembly on the recommendation of the cabinet, the Bihar government, acting on the request of the Bihar Legislative Assembly, has recommended him to issue a modified summon letter. Assembly speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary said his secretariat had written to the Bihar government that it would not be possible to hold the session in the central hall, which does not have space to accommodate all 243 members with desired seating arrangement. “The government was requested to look for some other place where social distancing norms could be properly followed. The government has selected Gyan Bhawan at the Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre for it, as it has enough space and open entry and exit points,” said Choudhary. The state-of-the-art convention centre to the north of Gandhi Maidan was inaugurated in 2017 and is one of the iconic structures built during the Nitish Kumar government. Choudhary said the Assembly session would be held in the conference hall on the second floor, which has a seating capacity of 800, while Legislative Council session would be held in the meeting hall on the first floor. Bihar is one of the five states having bicameral legislature having two Houses. “Despite trying various combinations, we could not ensure proper distance between two members in the central hall. Ultimately, the speaker said that the government should be asked to explore other options. For the Bihar Legislative Council, however, there is no space issue, as the 75-member House has 21 vacancies. But both Houses need to run close by. The ministers often have to shift from one House to another,” said a senior Vidhan Sabha official. The Budget session of the Bihar Legislature had come to a premature end on March 16, 15 days before schedule, amid the Covid-19 outbreak and following a unanimous view at the business advisory committee. It was scheduled to end on March 31. Samrat Ashok International Convention CentreFoundation stone laid by Nitish Kumar on February 8, 2014Built at a cost of Rs 500 crore, inaugurated in 2017 Has a 5,000-seat main conference hall, built with around 21,600 tonnes of steel, and is called Bapu Sabhagar Gyan Bhawan got a scholarly start in 2017 with an international seminar on Mahatma Gandhi to launch the year-long centenary celebrations of Champaran Satyagrah||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-concerns-in-a-first-bihar-house-to-meet-under-new-roof-for-more-room/story-tOBGGkVMwxOBXQv0sNcTgM.html

24-07-2020||City||Jalandhar: With spike in cases authorities finding it hard to shift patients||Jalandhar With an average of over 50 persons testing positive for covid-19 in the district for at least the past month, the process of ‘tracing and shifting’ these individuals to the civil hospital’s Covid Care Centre is proving to be a testing one for the health authorities. The two major impediments are the shortage of ambulances, with only 23 available with the administration, and the second is the wrong address that some who test provide to the authorities. In some cases, health functionaries also have to deal with patients who feel stigmatised and refuse to engage with the authorities. From 733 positive cases on July 1, the district now has 1,901 positive cases on July 24, with 65 cases reported on Friday. With ambulances needing proper disinfection and sanitisation after each round, health officials are forced to appeal to patients to come to the hospital or Covid Care Centre in their private vehicle. Deputy Medical Commissioner Jyoti Sharma said that the district has a fleet of 18 (108-ambulances) and 5 from other sources in the district. “Naturally, with increasing cases, we are facing a tough time in managing ambulances. Now, we send out ambulance for positive patients only till 8pm. People who do not share correct information add to our woes.”She said that after procuring the sample for covid-19 testing, people are advised to remain in isolation at home but most people do not comply with norms.“Sometimes, we have to seek the help of police to ensure that positive patients do not continue to roam around, till they are hospitalised or are isolated,” she adds. Officials admit that there have been cases when police and health departments have not been able to trace a patient, as wrong address had been submitted. A senior police officer, on request of anonymity, said, “In some cases, patients are traced. It is usually the migrants who are the most trouble and we fail to trace them.”Nodal officer Dr TP Singh said cases were traced and some took time, but with the help of the police department they tried to trace all patients. “In some cases, migrants have returned to their native places before receiving treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jalandhar-with-spike-in-cases-authorities-finding-it-hard-to-shift-patients/story-d644VmV5mXwgckWXEB5HKN.html

Two Uzbek women were among those arrested from Svain Thai Spa Centre whose manager, identified by police as Taaz, is absconding.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP-North), Sarabjit Singh, said, “Sadar station house officer (SHO) Parveen Kumar got a tip off that a sex racket is being run at the spa centre taken on lease by Taaz. A team led by the SHO raided the spa on Thursday night and made the arrests.”“The uzbek women had come to India on work visas. The men are residents of Amritsar and Tarn Taran. All the accused are in their late 20s. The manager was not present on the spot,” said the ACP.The police have also registered a case under sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, 1956, against the 12 accused and the manager at Civil Lines police station.“Also, the accused have been booked under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of Indian Penal Code as they were operating the spa centre during the Covid-19 lockdown in violation of the norms.

24-07-2020||Mumbai||HPC classification of prisoners discriminatory: PIL||While a petitioner NGO challenged the classification of prisoners to be released on interim bail/parole by the High Power Committee (HPC), the Bombay high court reiterated that the temporary bail/parole was ‘charity’ and ‘grace’ being extended to inmates and hence they could not claim the facility as a right. The observations were made after the NGO submitted that the HPC classification was against fundamental rights of the inmates. The NGO which is run by activist Medha Patkar submitted that the interim bail/parole was directed by the Supreme Court to decongest jails so that social distancing norms recommended by the ICMR, central and state governments to curb the spread of the Covid 19 virus could be observed, thus saving the lives of prisoners and prison authorities, hence it could not be termed as ‘charity’ and ‘grace’.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Madhav Jamdar while hearing the PL filed by National Alliance for People’s Movement was informed by senior advocate Satish Talekar that the HPC had made a classification of prisoners eligible for interim bail/parole/furlough beyond the scope of the directions issued by the Supreme Court for decongestion of jails to curb the spread of the Covid 19 pandemic within jails.Talekar submitted that while the apex court had only said that the release of prisoners who have been convicted or are undertrial for offences for which prescribed punishment is up to 7 years or less, with or without fine as criteria, the HPC had gone ahead and classified prisoners based on the crime. This Talekar said was discriminatory and arbitrary and as the HPC had gone beyond the ambit of the SC directions, the HPC decision should be set aside.The state on its part informed the bench through public prosecutor Deepak Thakare that following order of another bench of the HC, it had been considering the release of prisoners serving life sentences and had released many such prisoners, hence the grouse of the petitioner was not valid.The bench had directed that the pre-condition for emergency release could not be fixed and had to be based on merit. The current bench observed that it would treat the order as a precedent and reserved its order in the present petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hpc-classification-of-prisoners-discriminatory-pil/story-PdlaOpQoXS0fp97jDiZhAN.html

Her videos slapping Sultan Singh were widely circulated on social media. Phogat was on a visit to the grain market after farmers had alleged that Sultan Singh was creating hurdles in the procurement process. It is alleged that she lost her cool after Sultan Singh behaved inappropriately, an allegation the latter has denied stoutly.Both the BJP leader and mandi secretary had lodged complaints against each other.While in her complaint to the police Phogat said the official made indecent remarks against her, Sultan Singh lodged a counter-complaint against her, denying the allegations.SIX POINT RECOMMENDATIONSAccording to Pratibha Suman, chairperson of the state women commission, a three member high-powered committee comprising Suman Bedi, Namrata Gaur and Dr Raj Singh was set up to hold an inquiry into the complaint received from Phogat against Sultan Singh.Suman said she has sent a six-point recommendation to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and agriculture minister JP Dalal on July 23 on the basis of the inquiry committee report.While recommending “disciplinary action” against Sumedha Kataria, administrator of agricultural marketing board for “not taking seriously the directions of the commission,” the inquiry panel has commented adversely about Hisar deputy commissioner (DC).“The commission did not receive the desired help from Hisar DC from whom the commission had sought some certified documents,” Suman said.As one of Haryana’s prominent khaps, Binain Khap, had given the state government ultimatum to arrest Phogat, the inquiry committee has recommended to lodge an FIR against Shamsher Singh Nain, the self styled president of the Binain Khap. “He used obscene language at a public platform in Jind (Sachha Kheda) panchayat against Sonali Phogat...,” the committee mentioned.The inquiry panel has held that the prime accused Sultan Singh sent messages about Phogat through social media platforms and recommended to lodge an FIR under the IT Act.The inquiry panel has also stated that Sultan Singh submitted “tempered documents” before the commission and tried to mislead the inquiry committee on the basis of wrong documents.“Because of this he should be dismissed from service on disciplinary grounds with immediate effect and all the post retirement benefits must be stopped, apart from lodging an FIR,” the commission has said.The inquiry panel has further said the accused official should be arrested on the basis of FIR Phogat had lodged on June 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sack-arrest-hisar-market-committee-secretary-on-basis-of-sonali-phogat-s-complaint-women-panel/story-rSJlZ7IM0wJ0VV8tbiM67O.html

Civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh said, “Three new Covid care centres will come up in Barara, Ambala city and Ambala Cantonment. We already have a centre in Naraingarh’s Bhurewala village. These centres will cater to asymptomatic or patients with mild symptoms.”At a meeting convened here on Friday, deputy commissioner (DC) Ashok Kumar Sharma asked the SDMs of all four blocks to look for places that can be used as Covid care centres. The DC also asked the civil surgeon to ensure that positive report of a patient reaches the concerned SDM, SMO and PMO from the laboratory so that rapid medical action can be implemented to prevent the spread of virus. “In case of a sudden increase in positive cases, the SDM can also stop activities in the particular area and resume it accordingly. The municipal corporation authorities also have to challan those not wearing masks especially in the cloth market areas,” he added.As per the official figures of the health department, the district has reported 321 infections in last one week (till Friday evening) and the total number of positive cases has almost reached 1,200 mark.

24-07-2020||City||Jind man held for killing his 5 kids in last 2 years: Police||A 38-year-old man was arrested in Haryana’s Jind district after he confessed to killing his five children in the last over 2 years, including two of them recently, a senior police official said on Friday. The man, identified as Jumma, is a labourer and belongs to a village in Jind’s Safidon, a police official said, adding that his wife is pregnant with the sixth child. He is a native of Uttar Pradesh.While addressing a press conference, additional superintendent of police (ASP) Ajit Singh Sekhawat said the bodies of two of his daughters, aged 11 and 7, were recovered from the Hansi-Butana Link canal near his home in Didwara village on July 20, five days after the accused had lodged a police complaint stating the duo had gone missing. “However, during the course of investigation, Jumma kept changing his statements which raised suspicion,” the ASP said. The police presumed that he was under mental stress due to the death of his children and did not subject him to sustained questioning at the moment. The village panchayat was later involved in the investigation, and the man confessed before them and later, the police, that he killed his five children. Jumma admitted that he drugged his two minor daughters and threw them in the canal a few days ago, the ASP said. “We arrested him on Thursday evening, and he has been charged with murder,” he added.Earlier, Jumma’s three children, all below 11, had also died mysteriously. At that time, he had told his neighbours that one of his sons died in sleep, a daughter died while playing and another son started vomiting and died. “He has now confessed that he killed those three children as well. While two of them were strangulated by him, one was administered a poisonous tablet,” the ASP said. Shekhawat said in the recent case, while the accused administered some intoxicants to two of his daughters before throwing them in the canal, he had also given some drugs to his wife. “He had kept his wife, who was pregnant with the sixth child, under heavy sedation during past few days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jind-man-held-for-killing-his-5-kids-in-last-2-years-police/story-dTTQBFHmCjH1jxnxoYRZTK.html

This year, our government has decided to pay premium for those farmers who have been switching over to other crops from paddy in specific zones,” the CM said.HT had earlier reported that cotton growers in Haryana are a worried lot as their share of premium under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has been increased from Rs 620 per acre to Rs 1,650 this time after the state government withdrew 3% subsidy provided on the premium.Under PMFBY guidelines, a farmer is required to pay 2% of the sum insured in case of kharif crop and 1.5% in case of rabi crop (5% for horticulture crop) as the premium and the balance is shared 50:50 by the state and the Centre.This year, farmers’ premium share under the government insurance scheme was hiked up to Rs 50 per acre for paddy, Rs 10 per acre for maize, Rs 40 per acre for bajra, Rs 1,030 per acre for cotton, Rs 8 per acre for barley and wheat, Rs 15 per acre each for gram and sunflower and Rs 130 per acre for mustard.‘Political parties should follow social distancing norms’On being asked about political parties, including the BJP, violating social distancing norms, the CM said people associated with political outfits need to follow the protocol. “I am aware that few people are not following the norms. I urge all Haryana residents to follow social distancing norms and wear masks when they step outside their homes,” he added.He said the upcoming Baroda by election is a challenge for the Congress and opportunity for the BJP as they are yet to open their account in the rural dominated constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-govt-cannot-continue-subsidy-on-cotton-crop-insurance-premium-khattar/story-Jr6z9TsNBiXE02BMDzZmqN.html

24-07-2020||Delhi||Haryana govt’s action against industrial units highly inadequate: NGT||Action taken by Haryana government against large scale violation of laws by industrial units for alleged contamination of ground water is highly inadequate, the National Green Tribunal said on Friday. Withdrawal of ground water without any assessment of impact of such extraction needs to be taken seriously against all the non-compliant industries, the green panel said. The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Haryana resident Ramesh Chand with reference to the allegation of pollution caused in the process of dyeing by the industrial units, resulting in contamination of ground water in Khandra village in Panipat district, Haryana. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel noted that as per the analysis results of the underground water samples, few parameters were exceeding the acceptable limits. According to the report filed by State Pollution Control Board (SPCB), two non-complying units have been closed and prosecution is under process. Compensation has been assessed and three units have not resumed their operations after lockdown, the report said. The NGT said the report showed large scale violation of law by the industrial units for which action taken so far is highly inadequate. “Illegal extraction of ground water without any assessment of impact of such extraction needs to be taken seriously against all the non-compliant units... Compensation needs to be recovered for the entire period of violation up to the last five years,” the tribunal said. The NGT asked Haryana government to take further action in the matter and file report filed before the next date by e-mail. The matter is posted for next hearing on January 5, 2021.

24-07-2020||Chandigarh||American congressman seeks refugee status for Afghan Sikhs, Hindus||An influential American congressman has praised India for giving refugee status to Sikhs and Hindus from Afghanistan and urged the Trump administration to do the same for the persecuted religious minorities from the war-torn country. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said on Thursday that there had been a recent spurt of attacks on Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan by terrorists at the behest of their ‘external supporters’ and India has been providing necessary visas to members of these communities . “We have been receiving requests from the members of these communities. They want to move to India, they want to settle down here, and despite the ongoing Covid-19 situation, we are facilitating these requests,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. He said once those who want to come and settle in India arrive in the country, their requests will be examined and acted upon based on existing rules and policies. Responding to India’s move, Congressman Jim Costa said in a tweet, “This marks an important step toward protecting Afghanistan’s Sikh and Hindu communities from imminent destruction at the hands of terrorists”. “While I’m pleased that India has offered them refuge, more needs to be done to ensure their safety in the long term. I will continue to advocate for more permanent solutions that will provide these families with security, economic stability, and a brighter future,” Costa said as he referred to a news story from The New York Times. In April the lawmaker had written a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seeking similar refugee status for Hindus and Sikhs from Afghanistan. “In April, I wrote to Secretary of State Pompeo urging him to provide help to these families and consideration for potential resettlement in the US,” Costa tweeted. In its news story, The New York Times reported the statement of Ministry of External Affairs that India has decided to facilitate the return to India of Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members facing security threats in Afghanistan. MINORITIES EXPERIENCED YEARS OF PERSECUTIONAccording to the daily, the Hindu and Sikh communities in Afghanistan once numbered in the tens, if not the hundreds, of thousands, with well-established businesses and high-ranking positions in the government. But nearly all have fled to India, Europe, or North America over decades of war and persecution. Last month, a bipartisan group of 20 US senators urged the Trump administration to grant emergency refugee protection to Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan facing persecution as religious minorities. “Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan face an existential threat from ISIS-K because of their religion. To protect religious freedom, we urgently ask that you take these essential steps to defend these threatened religious minorities,” they said in the letter. The Sikhs and Hindus once numbered around 2,50,000, but now fewer than 1,000 people live in Afghanistan due to decades of persecution, the senators wrote. A heavily armed Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K) suicide bomber stormed a gurdwara in the heart of Afghanistan’s capital on March 25, killing 25 Sikhs and injuring eight others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/american-congressman-seeks-refugee-status-for-afghan-sikhs-hindus/story-jzlLUjMsSPK0LCCGnfBkAJ.html
24-07-2020||Pune||Positivity rate increases during lockdown in Pune city||If the district administration imposed the lockdown to bring down Covid infection in Pune, the growing positivity rate indicates it hasn’t served its purpose.City’s positivity rate, according to figures shared by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), during the lockdown has increased from 17.11% on July 12 to 19.03% till July 22, a period when PMC drastically increased swab testing. By July 23, when lockdown ended, it stood at 19.18 percent.The PMC had insisted that it will use the lockdown period for 100 per cent contact tracing and 100 per cent testing. However, PMC has not been able to complete this task as the average contact tracing has been 10.79 per cent. At the same time, doubling rate of positives has come down from 19.71 per cent on July 12 to 14.46 per cent on July 22.The 10-day lockdown imposed in the PMC jurisdiction from July 13 to 23, in which its severity was high for first five days, ended on Thursday with Pune returning back to pre-lockdown (June 12) situation.Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “The lockdown has helped us in certain ways, the recovery rate of Pune has increased and it is at top in the country. The current recovery rate of Pune is close to 64 per cent. We all are working to bring down the number of positive cases and through public support I am sure that it will come down.” During the second phase of latest lockdown, the PMC offered some relaxations in its limits with grocery and vegetable shops were allowed.Talking about this increase in the positivity rate Dr Bharat Purandare, infectious disease physicians from Deenanath Mangeshkhar said, “If the positivity rate is increasing of the city which means the infection is getting more intense and there is no need to worry about it. It is good as the herd immunity will come when the positive cases will reach to a certain number and bad news is that some of them will die from these infected people. The positivity rate of Italy and other European countries was around 60 per cent couple of months back.Fortunately in India and in our Pune the rate is still low may be due to our geographical conditions, we have more young population and our immunity power is more. And this increase is accepted the positivity rate will increase geometrically and when a significant portion of population is infected then herd immunity comes and the pandemic comes down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/positivity-rate-increases-during-lockdown-in-pune-city/story-RbIJsuvbngItaqzRISfXHK.html
24-07-2020||Chandigarh||20 held as Punjab Police bust drug cartel spanning 50 districts in 11 states||Chandigarh: In one of the biggest crackdowns on the supply of pharmaceutical opioids across the country, Punjab Police has busted an inter-state drug cartel operating in more than 50 districts of the country spread across 11 states, using the hawala channel route. Twenty people have already been arrested with a cache of drugs, drug money and five vehicles, in an operation that spanned over eight weeks. Punjab director general of police Dinkar Gupta said the drug cartel, known as the Agra Gang, was pushing pharmaceutical opioids (drugs) into markets across India by diverting drugs in huge quantities from the drug manufacturers, suppliers, wholesalers and retail chemists spread out across the country. Of the 20 people arrested so far, 16 are from Punjab, two from Uttar Pradesh and one each from Haryana and Delhi. BARNALA POLICE TEAM BUSTED DRUG SYNDICATE With the arrest of these gang members, a well-oiled network of drug syndicate pushing consignments to the tune of 10-12 crore of intoxicating pharmaceutical opioids in the form of tablets/capsules/injections/syrups per month into Punjab and other parts of the country has been smashed. Thousands of youngsters who were or could have got hooked to these drugs have been saved from abuse and addiction. The gang was busted by a Barnala police team, comprising of Pragya Jain, IPS, ASP Mehal Kalan, Sukhdev Virk SP(D), Ramninder Deol DSP (D), inspector Baljit Singh, in-charge CIA, working under the supervision of Barnala senior superintendent of police Sandeep Goel. The arrest of the 20 men, including one of the cartel’s kingpins, were made from various locations in Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. As many as 27,62,137 intoxicating tablets, capsules, injections and syrup bottles were seized from them, along with drug proceeds money of Rs 70,03,800, said Gupta. BUSTED MATHURA GANG IN MARCH The Barnala police had in March similarly busted a Mathura Gang and seized 44 lakh intoxicants and Rs 1.5 crore drug money in the biggest-ever such haul by Punjab Police. The case began to unravel in May with the arrest of Balwinder Singh, alias Nikka, and four others along with 2.85 lakh intoxicating tablets (Tab Clovidol) during investigation into an NDPS case registered at Mehal Kalan police station. This led to the arrest of Julfikar Ali with 12,000 intoxicating tablets (Tab Clovidol). Julfikar’s questioning revealed the role of Harish as one of the masterminds in the influx and supply of pharmaceutical opioids into Punjab. Following these arrests, the Barnala police spent over two months developing the leads, laying out surveillance plans and a trap, with a special team being sent to West Bengal from where Harish was arrested. It was Harish who disclosed the working of the gang and its chain of supply of psychotropic drugs not only in Punjab but in over 11 states of the country. Subsequent raids in UP, Haryana, Delhi and Punjab led to the arrest of other gang members along with seizure of a large quantity of pharmaceutical opioids, the drug proceeds money and vehicles. KINGPIN POSED AS MEDICAL REPRESENTATIVE The DGP said Harish posed as a medical representative to establish contact with chemists and pharmacists by using address and phone numbers that he easily found over internet and social media. The contraband smugglers used a pre-identified network of couriers /transport /goods carriers, operating from cities such as Delhi, Agra, Amritsar, Jaipur, Gwalior and Bhopal, and delivered consignments to locations in different states with the help of fake/undervalued bills using local transporters. Payment and transfer of money was done using the hawala channels, and also through multiple cash transactions into bank accounts created for this purpose. MISUSE OF PHARMACEUTICAL OPIOIDS The intoxicants seized are mostly pharmaceutical opioids. Many of these pharmaceutical products have legitimate and important medical use; however these products cannot be sold without a medical prescription from a registered practitioner. The gang was diverting these intoxicants, which are medically used for pain relief and treatment for opioid dependence, for extra-medical use, which can lead to drug overdose and even death. The DGP said that the operation carried out by Punjab Police and the recovery of pharmaceutical opioids is significant and is a major hit to the supply of drugs in Punjab, as according to Magnitude of Substance Use in India-2019, a study commissioned by ministry of social justice and empowerment, Government of India, pharmaceutical opioids (which itself includes a variety of medications of the opioid group) are the second most commonly used opioids in India (0.96%), after heroin (1.14%). It is estimated that the harmful use/dependent use of pharmaceutical opioids constitutes 40% of the drug problem in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/20-held-as-punjab-police-bust-drug-cartel-spanning-50-districts-in-11-states/story-N60yMizYSSw7Dqe7ZvxDlJ.html

An official of the health department said, “Successful results of these cases will shatter the fear of covid-19 among the most vulnerable section of population,”Doctors said the process of delivery was challenging, as they have to wear Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits. “Deliveries and surgeries are most challenging, as we are in PPE kits and when in that kit, you cannot hear anything. We communicate through sign language to seek help and equipment from our team. Our vision can also blocked because we are wearing these kits,” said Dr Parneet.Patiala civil surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra, “A separate isolation facility with 13 beds has been setup at the gynae department of the Rajindra Hospital.

24-07-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana man arrested for killing his five children in last four years: Police||A 38-year-old man has been arrested in Haryana’s Jind district after he confessed to killing his five children in the last four years, including two of them recently, a senior police official said on Friday.The man, identified only as Jumma, is a labourer and belongs to a village in Safidon in Jind, he said, adding that his wife is pregnant with the sixth child.The bodies of two of his daughters, ages 11 and 7, were recovered from the Hansi-Butana Link canal near his home in Didwara village on July 20, five days after the accused had lodged a police complaint stating the duo had gone missing.However, during the course of investigation, Jumma kept changing his statements which raised suspicion, Jind Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Ajit Singh Shekhawat told PTI over the phone.The police presumed that he was under mental stress due to the death of his children and did not subject him to sustained questioning at the moment.The village panchayat was later involved in the investigation, and the man confessed before them and later, the police, that he killed his five children.Jumma admitted that he drugged his two minor daughters and threw them in the canal a few days ago, the ASP said.“We arrested him on Thursday evening, and he has been charged with murder,” said Shekhawat.Earlier, Jumma’s three children, all below 11, had also died mysteriously.At that time, he had told his neighbours that one of his sons died in sleep, a daughter died while playing and another son started vomiting and died.“He has now confessed that he killed those three children as well. While two of them were strangulated by him, one was administered a poisonous tablet,” the police officer said.Shekhawat said in the recent case, while the accused administered some intoxicants to two of his daughters before throwing them in the canal, he had also given some drugs to his wife.“He had kept his wife, who was pregnant with the sixth child, under heavy sedation during past few days,” he said.Asked if Jumma had taken the steps under the influence of some ‘tantrik’ (occultist), Shekhawat said the accused is believed to have mentioned something in this regard to the villagers, but no such statement has been made before the police yet.The police will seek the help of a mental health expert in the case to further question the accused and find the exact motive which led him to kill his own children, he added.

24-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration challenges single-bench order allowing registration of car with artwork||Chandigarh: The Chandigarh administration has challenged a Punjab and Haryana high court single-judge judgment allowing the registration of a vehicle with artwork on its body. The administration is learnt to have requested the high court for an urgent hearing in the matter before a division bench. If not allowed, the petition can be filed but won’t be taken up immediately as only urgent cases are being heard in view of the Covid-19 outbreak.On July 15, the single-judge bench of justice Jaishree Thakur had directed the Chandigarh administration to register the car within two weeks. The permission for the same had been denied in 2019.The multi-coloured car, an Ambassador Grand Harit-C-1800, belongs to high court lawyer Ranjit Malhotra, who bought it from a diplomat of the European Union posted in Delhi in July last year.The registering authority in Chandigarh refused to register the vehicle stating that the colour of the original vehicle had been changed from white to multi-colour. No vehicle can be altered to change the original specification made by the manufacturer, the UT maintained.Following this, Malhotra moved the high court, claiming that the reason for buying the vehicle was the artwork by a Mexican artist Senkoe.“The reason for denying registration merely on the ground that there is artwork on the body of the vehicle, where the base remains white, defies logic. Any reasonable person can easily make out that a white car had some artwork done upon it. Like a canvas with a spray of flowers, the base colour of the canvas would remain as it is,” the single-judge bench had said, allowing his plea.POTENTIAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMNow, the UT says allowing registration of this car would cause a serious potential law enforcement problem as in common practice a motor vehicle is identified by its registration number and colour by the authorities. The colour of a motor vehicle takes precedence since it is the most recognisable/distinguishable feature of a vehicle for its prima facie identification by authorities, including law enforcement, the plea prepared by the UT says.The main argument it has taken is that the single-judge bench misinterpreted Section 52 of the Motor Vehicles Act.According to Section 52, no owner of a motor vehicle can alter it beyond the particulars mentioned in the certificate of registration, which are provided by the manufacturer. The manufacturer issues a sale certificate, which contains the colour of the vehicle. Thereafter, it is reflected in the registration certificate and hence the same cannot be altered.It has cited the Chandigarh Motor Vehicle Rules, 1990, which do not allow alteration of colour. Colours such as olive green are not allowed to be painted on motor vehicles except defence vehicles is another argument by it.It has also stated that case of the petitioner was not formally rejected, as contemplated under Section 45 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the administration was treading carefully since any decision in this case would be cited as a precedent in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-administration-to-challenge-single-bench-order-allowing-registration-of-car-with-artwork/story-dMbtzxmguSurN10nBrD1QJ.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||Interim bails, paroles extended to prevent Covid-19 spread in jails, says Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court Friday said it was extending interim bails repeatedly to prevent the possible spread of Covid-19 among inmates from those returning to jail after the expiry of their bail or parole period during the persisting pandemic.“We are only concerned that those released (on bail or parole) should not return and spread the infection amongst the prisoners,” the high court said.The clarification by a full bench headed by Chief Justice D N Patel came as an application was moved by a convict whose interim bail was not extended by a single judge who was of the view that the high court’s July 13 order extending all such reliefs to August 31 was not applicable to the convict.The single judge said that the July 13 order was only applicable to those eligible for interim bail or parole as per the criteria laid down by the High Powered Committee (HPC) which was set up on the Supreme Court’s direction to decongest prisons for preventing spread of Covid-19 there.During the hearing held via video conference on Friday, the full bench, also comprising of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh, said it did not go into merits of each case while extending the bails and paroles.It said that the “fallacy” in the instant matter was that the “order of the full bench was being confused with the directions of the HPC”.“Please do not confuse this (full bench order) with directions of the HPC,” the court said. The bench further said the extension order was passed as the Director General of Prisons said that the jails were overcrowded and it would be difficult to prevent spread of Covid-19 if they are not decongested.“You cannot approbate and reprobate in the same breath,” the bench said to DG Prisons, represented by Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain.The bench said that though there was no ambiguity in its July 13 order, it will clarify it further.The July 13 order had come on a plea initiated by the high court on its own in April to ensure that expiry of orders during restricted functioning of the courts would not affect litigants, lawyers or prisoners since they would not be able to approach the courts during the lockdown prevailing then.The detailed order of Friday (July 24) is awaited.The main petition is listed for hearing on August 24 when the bench would decide whether to further extend the interim orders.Presently, the hearings in the high court and district courts are being done through video conferencing due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/interim-bails-paroles-extended-to-prevent-covid-19-spread-in-jails-says-delhi-hc/story-tkeBrSRN9MVriImOUQKCeI.html
24-07-2020||Chandigarh||From August 1, Himachal Pradesh Police to maintain separate register for crimes against women, children||Shimla: In view of the rising crimes against women and children in the state, the Himachal Pradesh Police will maintain a separate register of offenders who commit crimes against women and children in every police station of the state from August 1.A standing order on the creation and maintenance of register number 26 at every police station was issued by state director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Kundu on Thursday.At present, 25 registers are maintained at every police station of the state.In register number 26, crimes such as rape, unnatural sexual offence, molestation and indecent assault, outraging the modesty of a woman, obscene and indecent representation of women, sexual harassment like passing sexually coloured remarks/sexual gestures/words/ stalking/flashing, eve-teasing, cruelty against women, domestic violence, immoral trafficking of women and children, kidnapping or abduction of women for sexual offence, dowry death, child marriage, forced abortion, child pornography, cyber crime against women and children, abetment of suicide by woman on account of sexual offence and any other crime against women and children will be recorded.Kundu said that the purpose of this order is to make investigation of sexual offences in the state a priority and ensure police action is swift, professional and transparent. To this end, a continuous monitoring of identified perpetrators is required.Kundu said that crime data of the past few years reveals that crimes against women and cases under the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act have been on the rise in the state. Though first information reports (FIRs) are registered and after completion of investigation chargesheets are filed in courts yet the conviction rate leaves much to be desired. Any delay or shortcomings in such investigation creates agitation, anxiety and unrest in the minds of people.Therefore, there is an urgent need to maintain this register in the state for cases of sexual offence so that such cases and offenders of are under surveillance of police and are successfully persecuted, delivering justice to victims, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-august-1-himachal-pradesh-police-to-maintain-separate-register-for-crimes-against-women-children/story-lqgtns75NlKRDi9JlBTxZM.html
24-07-2020||Chandigarh||NGT orders pollution control board panel to look into release of untreated chemical waste from Baddi pharma units into rivers||Shimla: A joint committee of the Central Pollution Control Board and Himachal Pradesh Pollution Control Board will study the dumping of untreated waste into the Sirsa and Sutlej rivers by pharmaceutical companies at Baddi in Solan.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the committee to submit an action taken report within three months. The state board will be the nodal agency for compliance and coordination.The orders were passed by a bench, comprising chairman justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, justice SP Wangdi and expert member Nagin Nanda, on a petition by an NGO, Veterans Forum for Transparency in Public Life on July 22.In its application, the petitioner urged the court to direct the authorities to take remedial action against the discharge of waste in the central effluent treatment plant (CETP) at Baddi by Acme Life Sciences, Nalagarh, and Helio Pharmaceuticals, Solan, to prevent the pollution of Sirsa and Sutlej rivers.According to the applicant, the CETP is not connected to pharmaceutical units at Barotiwala and Nalagarh that are discharging effluents directly into the rivers.Even after treatment in effluent and sewerage plants, pharmaceutical ingredients still come out from the industries unless the ETP/STPs are specialised.At present, the CETP is not designed to neutralise active pharmaceutical ingrediencts (API).NO DISPOSAL SYSTEM IN BBN FOR INDUSTRIAL EFFLUENTSThe treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF) does not receive sludge generated from the industrial units at Nalagarh.The industries in Baddi generate 20,779 kilo litres /day (KLD) of effluent of which 17,894 KLD is being treated at the CETP and the remaining 2,885 KLD is disposed of by occupiers directly into the Sirsa river.There is no existing sewerage system for disposing the industrial effluents in the Baddi Barotiwala Nalagarh (BBN) industrial area and no demarcation in residential and industrial areas.MULTI-RESISTANT PATHOGENS REACHING WATER BODIESThe presence of Ciprofloxacin in the concentration of 296.1 ug/l was found on chemical analysis. The concentration of Ciprofloxacin in the effluent discharge of M/s Acme Life Sciences works out to be 13,455 times of the prescribed limit.Applicants said that the increasing occurrence of multi-resistant pathogens is a global threat to human health and it is finding its way into water bodies through industrial discharge and also due to the heavy use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine.The next hearing is on January 4, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngt-orders-pollution-control-board-panel-to-look-into-release-of-untreated-chemical-waste-from-baddi-pharma-units-into-rivers/story-fV1YdgeasD7aDkSqhxXusM.html

24-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: His moveable feast||The smell is deliciously pungent. A slight scent of garlic also arises, as its cloves start being stir-fried in hissing oil. The curry, however, has been simmering in the blackened pot for some time already. It is late morning and Salman Khan is in his kitchen.Actually, the lungi-clad rickshaw puller has set up a makeshift wood-fired stove just next to Turkman Gate, one of the four surviving Mughal-era gateways to the Walled City.He says he is preparing a mutton dish. Nothing unusual in that really. But what is odd is that Mr Khan is cooking at this hour of the day, when usually he would be busy plying his rickshaw inside the Walled City lanes.“My friend got these goat pieces from a lady near the Amrood Walli Masjid,” he says, referring to a mosque not far from this spot. The woman warned, however, that the meat was a little old, a bit stale maybe. The friend, who too is a rickshaw puller, nevertheless took the meat, which was packed in a plastic bag. He had it tied to his rickshaw’s handle and carried on with work. “He called out on spotting me behind Delite Cinema, and shared half the meat with me.” They discussed the quality of the meat and unanimously agreed that cooking it quickly was the wise thing to do, lest it gets completely spoiled with the day’s increasing heat and humidity.“So I came here, lit the fire and now I’m cooking it for myself,” says Mr Khan. The stove consists of a few pieces of wood shoved inside a tiny shelter of stones—all of this stuff he gathered from the footpath “yaha-vaha (here and there)”.In his late 30s, Mr Khan lives with a few other rickshaw pullers on a footpath near the Red Fort. He says he sleeps on the passenger seat of his rickshaw and that he dines daily on roadside food stalls. But there are exceptions, of course, like this morning. Besides, very rarely he gets to eat mutton. “I always have dal chawal and subzi in the dhaba, near the Ramlila Maidan.” Sometimes he does treat himself to fried fish served in the carts that line the road facing New Delhi railway station, Ajmeri Gate side.Mr Khan, whose family lives in the village in Bihar, says that nobody taught him to cook. “I learnt it on my own,” he says in a flat tone, as if this was no big deal. He picks up the red chilli powder pouch and empties it all into the pan. “The mutton subzi should be very spicy,” he mutters in a very low voice, as if explaining away this indulgence to himself alone.The impromptu cook now covers the pot with a lid—it’s his thali actually—and stares silently at the fire. He admits that he keeps his plate and pan in the storage space inside his rickshaw’s passenger seat all the time. “This way you can cook wherever you want.”Meanwhile a handful of passers-by walk past him without noticing his cooking pot. A stray dog is asleep nearby. A few minutes later, Mr Khan lifts up the thali, peers enquiring into the pan, sniffs, looks thoughtful and declares, “it’s almost done.”He sombrely says he will get some rotis from a dhaba nearby, and finish off half the curry right now. “I will save the rest for dinner, and have it with dal and rice in the dhaba tonight.”The dish will travel with him during the day in his rickshaw, along with his customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-his-moveable-feast/story-RGVQMscmxjzR1Thdzi99RK.html

In Bihar, the water flow depends on rains in Nepal’s Terai region. The evacuation is selective in most places as the rural people decide when they should go to the camp, but they are persuaded to do so if the situation is severe,” said NDRF Director-General (DG) SN Pradhan.No deaths have been reported in the state so far but people are facing snake bites, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/floods-continue-to-wreak-havoc-in-bihar-7-65-lakh-people-affected/story-ta6lQ3RWSNGEb3XvBaHyvN.html

24-07-2020||Mumbai||IMD downgrades yellow alert for Mumbai, predicts moderate showers||A day after issuing a yellow alert for heavy rain in isolated areas for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the weather bureau on Thursday downgraded its warning, predicting only light to moderate showers from Friday to Monday.While the city could witness occasional intense rain spells between Thursday night and Friday morning, light to moderate thundershowers are expected throughout Friday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast said.Independent meteorologists, however, said an increase in rain activity was expected, but unlikely to cause any inconvenience to commuters or waterlogging.Meanwhile on Thursday morning, residents in the suburbs woke up to moderate thundershowers, even as light showers were reported from remaining parts of the city. The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 49mm of rain between 5.30am and 8.30am, while 0.2mm rain was recorded in Colaba, representative of south Mumbai. Parts of eastern suburbs recorded moderate showers, with Vidyavihar and Chembur receiving 45.8mm and 34.6mm rainfall. In the western suburbs, the rainfall ranged between 25mm and 33m for most locations, with Oshiwara recording the heaviest rainfall at 33mm. In the island city, Dadar and Worli recorded 33.2mm and 32.8mm of rainfall between 5.30am and 8.30am. Thane and Navi Mumbai recorded isolated moderate to heavy rain since Wednesday. IMD classifies 2.5mm to 15.5mm as light rain, 15.6mm to 64.4mm as moderate rain and 64.5mm to 115.5mm as heavy rain.“Owing to a lack of strong weather system, monsoon conditions are not likely to be as active as expected along the north Konkan coast, and the rain activity is expected to shift towards interior Maharashtra and along south Konkan,” said an IMD official.Professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, said, “Due to an offshore trough created by an Arabian Sea system, the west coast is very likely to receive moderate to heavy rain between Friday and Sunday. Mumbai may witness some heavy rain (70-80mm over 24 hours), mostly on Sunday.”Owing to an increase in moisture incursions over the city, the frequency of showers is expected to increase over the weekend, said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom. “It will be light rain with few moderate spells towards the suburbs,” he said.Meanwhile, both the meteorologists said that the city was unlikely to receive any more major heavy rain spells till the end of the month. “No significant weather systems would lead to weak monsoon winds and less moisture,” said Deoras.Balasubramanian added that subdued rain activity till the end of the month may be followed by heavy rainfall during August first week, if a weather system develops in the Bay of Bengal.Mumbai received its July rainfall target on the 15th of the month, and recorded 1,300mm rainfall (154% excess) until Thursday, against the target of 840.7mm. The city received 75% of its seasonal rainfall target until now over 53 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/imd-downgrades-yellow-alert-for-mumbai-predicts-moderate-showers/story-nj3NpxiDDLgJpQBGvdXErJ.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||India’s 1st low-cost air monitoring study to be conducted across 15 MMR spots in November, says Maharashtra pollution control body||Come November, a first-of-its kind study in India using low-cost sensor-based technology will be undertaken across 15 locations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) to accurately measure the harmful pollutant concentration in the air.The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur (IIT-K) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) last week to undertake the sensor technology assessment between November 1 this year and May 31, 2021. Based on the study’s success, such monitors would be rolled out across MMR, followed by 18 non-attainment cities (cities with particulate matter concentration below the national ambient standards), to identify pollution hot spots through hyper-local air monitoring, source distribution and associated health impacts.MPCB made the announcement during a web-based seminar on Thursday organised by Delhi-based communications initiative Climate Trends.The sensors will be installed across MPCB’s 15 existing real-time air monitoring stations –10 in Mumbai, one each in Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan, Vasai-Virar, and Dombivli. They will monitor PM (particulate matter) 10, PM2.5, ozone, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx).“We want to identify if the data received from these sensors is technically sound and the readings match with our existing technology. If the results are accurate, we will submit a report to the Centre and scale the programme,” said VM Motghare, joint director (air quality), MPCB.Professor SN Tripathi, head of civil engineering, IIT-K and apex committee member, National Clean Air Programme said that such a study has not been conducted anywhere in the country before. “The idea is to look into the stability and accuracy of low-cost sensors. The end goal is to assess how they measure pollutants, stability of calibration models and the final use for hyper-local monitoring,” he said.MPCB also announced the expansion of the state’s existing air quality monitoring network across 18 most polluted cities, with the installation of 98 real-time and 126 manual monitors.“Tenders will be invited for the first phase [47 monitors] of real-time monitor installation in less than a week. Maharashtra will soon have India’s largest air quality monitoring network by next year, including 207 manual [122 new and 81 existing] and 122 real-time [98 new and 24 existing] monitors,” said Motghare. Motghare said that the motive behind the sensor-based study is to initiate air pollution hot spot monitoring, for which it is important to understand the applicability of low-cost sensors first. “This type of technology has not been approved by the Central Pollution Control Board so far. A much smaller exercise carried out last year, failed to yield encouraging results,” he added.Ambient air quality monitoring is conducted through a manual method (analysis of pollutants measured once every six days where data is transferred manually), continuous method (automatic real-time data collection of pollutants measured) and real-time low-cost sensors (based on light scattering technology using small equipment).According to MPCB, manual monitors cost ₹8 lakh per station per annum, while the continuous ones cost ₹1.5 crore per station every year. This includes the purchasing cost, maintenance and number of pollutants measured. Independent researchers said low-cost monitors are bought for ₹50,000 to ₹2 lakh (including maintenance), based on the number of pollutants they measure. States such as Meghalaya, Bihar and Haryana carried out similar studies, but used only five low-cost sensors each. Tripathi said in consultation with MPCB, leading startups had been invited for the project.“Their sensors will be co-located with MPCB’s reference monitors. A report on the results will be submitted to MPCB, followed by further deliberations to scale this for the entire state,” he said.Independent experts said the country needed a much wider network of air quality monitors combined with constructive data usage.“Currently, monitors are unevenly placed in urban areas, which means our understanding of rural air pollution is limited. The current monitoring requirement will cost the country ₹10,000 crore, even as researchers estimate the need for at least 4,000 monitors to bridge the data gap,” said Shloka Nath, executive director, India Climate Collaborative, a philanthropic organisation working on solutions for climate crisis challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/india-s-1st-low-cost-air-monitoring-study-to-be-conducted-across-15-mmr-spots-in-november-says-maharashtra-pollution-control-body/story-RWAccErSE5UmRrykbPpRUK.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||Defer undergraduate medical exams, start the new academic year: Maharashtra minister||The state has objected to the exams of undergraduate medical students in the state – scheduled to take place between August 3 and 29 this year – and has asked the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) to postpone them until Covid-19 situation comes under control. The decision will affect around 24,000 medical and dental students in the state. State medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said that the exams should not be held putting at risk the lives of students. He also directed MUHS to start the academic year of the first three years. “Covid-19 is highly infectious. Parents are very worried about students’ health. The state is ready to hold exams, but students are not ready to appear for them. We suggested [MUHS] to start the academic year for first, second and third-year medical students without conducting exams. They can be conducted whenever the situation becomes conducive,” the medical education minister said.Deshmukh said final-year students should be allowed to commence with their internship, so that their services can be used for the ongoing health crisis, and they also will not have to lose their time.“Final-year students should be allowed to start internship even without conducting exams so that their services can be used in the battle against the pandemic and students also won’t lose their time,” he said.The directives came at a time when the state is already having differences with the University Grants Commission (UGC) over the issue of conducting final-year exams of non-professional and professional courses.The state disaster management authority, headed by the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in its meeting held on July 13, decided that Maharashtra is not in a position to hold final-year exams, considering the high number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the state. The July 13 decision came a week after UGC directed all universities to conduct final-year exams either in online, offline or blended modes by September-end.When asked about the UGC directives, Deshmukh said that the state is ready to conduct the entrance exams of super specialty courses for postgraduate students, scheduled on September 15, as students are on campus and do not need to travel unlike undergraduate students who are at their respective districts. “We will also discuss the issue with the Medical Council of India (MCI) to make this possible,” the medical education minister said.Officials transferredThe state appointed Parimal Singh as commissioner of family welfare and director of National Health Mission. He will take charge from Anup Kumar Yadav, who has been appointed as special sales tax commissioner in Singh’s place. Chief secretary’s deputy secretary, Kiran Patil, has been appointed as Raigad CEO, while Anil Dongre is the new chief officer of the Mumbai Building Repairs and Reconstruction Board. Yogesh Mhase has been appointed as chief officer Mhada.(Inputs from Surendra P Gangan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/defer-undergraduate-medical-exams-start-the-new-academic-year-maharashtra-minister/story-D911zFoYfVxmkuzURllhuM.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||4 cops assaulted 22-year-old, claimed death was due to mob lynching: ACP informs Bombay HC||The assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Bandra division, on Thursday, informed the Bombay high court (HC) that he has identified four personnel from Juhu police station who assaulted Raju Velu Devendra, a victim found outdoors during the Covid-19 lockdown. The ACP said he would propose the initiation of departmental action against the four personnel.Juhu police had so far maintained that the 22-year-old was a victim of mob lynching. They claimed that on March 30, Devendra was brutally assaulted by a mob when he attempted to commit a robbery. The police had registered an offence against eight purported members of the mob.On Thursday, government lawyer Purnima Katharia supported the ACP’s stand. She informed the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Anuja Prabhudessai that she had viewed the CCTV footage covering the incident of assault on the deceased and did not find any proof of a mob lynching.“Only the four policemen are seen to have used fiber lathis in a bid to discipline the deceased,” she said. The lawyer, however, added that further investigation was required to ascertain if the deceased succumbed to the injuries caused by the policemen.The lawyer was responding to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by lawyer and human rights activist Firdause Irani, which raised concerns about police excesses during enforcement of the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection.On March 30, Devendra and his family were going to visit a relative when a police team chased them and caught the deceased. The policemen allegedly informed the relatives that Devendra was being taken to Juhu police station. The next morning, police claimed the 22-year-old was found lying at Nehru Nagar Chowk. They took him to a hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.The investigation into the case was entrusted to the ACP, Bandra division, in view of the allegations against the policemen.On Thursday, HC noted that two important witnesses in the case, the mother and brother of the deceased, have not cooperated with the investigation, and their statements have not been recorded. Taking note of this anomaly, the bench has directed the ACP to issue fresh notices to them and make an endeavor to get their statements recorded.Expressing displeasure over the delay in investigating the case, HC also directed the ACP to speed up the probe and submit a progress report by August 5. The next hearing on the matter has been posted for August 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-cops-assaulted-22-year-old-claimed-death-was-due-to-mob-lynching-acp-informs-bombay-hc/story-9JCOrCZasp5jYiOoYNDHPP.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||Parents in Mumbai welcome new guidelines on online learning for students upto Class 2||Parents in the city welcomed the state education department’s recent decision to allow online learning for students up to Class 2. Many, however, said the government has to regulate the timings prescribed and should ensure that schools follow all the guidelines to conduct online classes. “Students in the lower classes require some form of interaction with their teachers and peers even if it is not actual ‘learning’. Considering the current situation, kids cannot go out and play or meet their friends. Having an online session helps them at least meet their teachers and peers virtually,” said Avantika Sinha, an Andheri-based parent. Arundhati Chavan, president of the PTA United Forum, said that schools should adhere to all the norms laid down by the government concerning such classes. “For the younger students, these classes should be more on the lines of interaction than one-way teaching. This will keep kids engaged without putting them under too much stress. Timings laid down by the government also need to be followed. The government should keep schools in check as far as these norms are concerned,” she said. On Wednesday, the education department amended its earlier standard operating procedures (SOPs) for online classes in the state and allowed schools to conduct e-classes for students from pre-primary to Class 2. As per the new guidelines, pre-primary students can attend up to 30 minutes of daily online instruction from Monday to Friday. This has to primarily consist of assisting and guiding parents about the education of their children. Students of Classes 1 and 2 can attend two sessions of 30 minutes each daily.Swati Popat Vats, president of the Early Childhood Association, said, “As we grapple with this pandemic, I am very happy with the revised guidelines of the Maharashtra government. It is high time that all the states realise that banning something is not going to help the students, parents, or teachers. Our priority right now should be that the education of our children will continue in developmentally appropriate ways.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parents-in-mumbai-welcome-new-guidelines-on-online-learning-for-students-upto-class-2/story-Nxsv9k3dbfRfLgL29XOyOO.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to start jumbo Covid-19 testing for front line staff from Friday||As part of its jumbo antigen testing drive, starting July 24, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will begin test 10,000 Covid-19 frontline workers, including police officers, medicos and volunteers. Additionally, eight private laboratories will also begin testing residents quarantined in housing societies in north Mumbai.After procuring 1 lakh antigen kits earlier this month, BMC has been testing around 500 people every day since July 3. The jumbo antigen testing drive will target more than 3,000 people daily.Similar to the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, which is considered a gold standard, rapid antigen kits detect the presence of molecular pathogens of the novel coronavirus. While RT-PCR takes almost eight hours to give results, antigen-based test use nasal swab samples and results are available in 30 minutes.“Of the more than 9,000 people tested at both CCCs [Covid care centres] and hospitals, only 1% who tested negative have turned positive in the RT-PCR tests. With this promising success rate, we have decided to test around 10,000 frontliners from Friday,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “At present, the civic body is conducting an average of 5,500 RT-PCR and around 500 antigen tests every day, which will now increase to 9,000 with the jumbo testing scheme. While positive cases are likely to rise, it will help diagnose asymptomatic frontliners and speed up treatment,” he said.Since early July, BMC has been testing high risk contacts at the CCC-1 centres (where high risk contacts are kept for observation) in Dahisar, Borivli (West), Kandivli, Malad, Goregaon, Mulund, Ghatkopar and Andheri (East). Sanjog Kabare, assistant municipal commissioner of P (South) ward said, “We are making a list of private residential buildings with the highest number of Covid-19 cases. Currently, antigen testing is being carried out in nine wards, and have instructed the laboratories to so the same.”Kabare said antigen tests in south Mumbai are being undertaken at certain hospitals like King Edward Memorial (KEM), BYL Nair and Kasturba Gandhi Hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-start-jumbo-covid-19-testing-for-front-line-staff-from-friday/story-NOhg7XlTlhJQHfZL7xJbwL.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||Rapid antigen tests: 5 wards in north Mumbai see 7% positivity||Rapid antigen tests conducted on more than 9,000 people across the city have shown that Mumbai has a Covid-positivity rate of 13%. The infection rate is highest in residential areas, say authorities, but the spread is limited. In the five wards with the most Covid-19 cases, the positivity rate is 7%.On July 2, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started rapid antigen tests at the five wards with the most Covid-19 cases — R (North), covering Dahisar; R (Central), covering Borivli (West); R (South), covering Kandivli; P (North), covering Malad; and P (South), covering Goregaon. The tests are being conducted on high-risk contacts who are under observation in Covid care centres (CCC1).As of Thursday, 3,923 high-risk contacts from these five wards have been tested and 277 are Covid-positive. In R (Central) ward, 99 out of the 1,000 tested were positive for Covid-19. In R south, 81 of the 905 tested were positive. P (North) ward has the most active cases (1,816) and of the 1,026 high-risk contacts tested, 57 were Covid-positive. In P (South) ward, out of 435, 32 tested positive. R (North) ward has the lowest number of positive patients (554) in antigen testing and of them, eight were found positive. “We have observed that the infection rate is the highest among people in residential areas. But thankfully, the spread of the virus among high-risk contacts is still under control due to timely contact tracing and isolation,” said Sandhya Nandekar, ward officer for R (North) ward.BMC confirms Covid diagnoses by running a second analysis through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests on individuals with symptoms even if their samples test negative in rapid antigen tests. Of the 3,923 who have undergone rapid antigen testing, only one false negative case was reported from P (South) ward. “Three people with symptoms were again tested using RT-PCR. Of this, one negative person turned positive in the second analysis,” said a ward official.Till Thursday afternoon, 9,371 people from eight wards, private hospitals and three civic-run hospitals had been tested with rapid antigen kits. Of them, 1,214 are Covid-positive, giving the city a positivity rate of 13%. The positivity rate is highest in hospitals where a large number of symptomatic close contacts were tested with rapid antigen. At BYL Nair Hospital of the 805 people tested, 252 were Covid-positive, giving the hospital a positivity rate of 31%. “At CCCs, we run antigen tests on a large number of symptomatic individuals. Thus, the count of positive patients will be higher in hospitals,” said an officer from Nair Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rapid-antigen-tests-5-wards-in-north-mumbai-see-7-positivity/story-F00fXHE3UzcyFyYRLBqjTO.html

Singh also posted images of the officials handing gifts to her.Singh said, “The girl, who had influenza-like symptoms was hospitalized at GMC Rajouri on July 7. She tested positive on July 10. She was hospitalised with her mother at Government Medical College, Rajouri.”“The one-year-old was discharged on Wednesday. It was a heartening sight. I decided to share the news to motivate people and to express gratitude to our corona warriors, be it from health, administration or police,” he added.The girl and her family had travelled from Punjab.“We had to admit the girl’s mother because she was too young. Her mother did not test positive,” he said.Rajouri has witnessed a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases. The district has so far recorded 497 positive cases of which 374 cases are active. There have been 121 recoveries and two deaths.Rajouri has established a new Covid-care center in Rajouri hospital, which has a 180-bed capacity and is equipped with all required infrastructure and basic facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/one-year-old-girl-recovers-from-covid-19-in-jammu/story-h4uc5ilh3qV1lpTapU6UoN.html
24-07-2020||City||Hospital refunds ₹3.36 lakh to Covid patient after civic body sends notice||A private hospital in Dombivli, which had charged Covid patients exorbitant bills for treatment, faced action by the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) and had to return ₹3.36 lakh to the patient after the civic body’s intervention.Last month, KDMC formed a committee to look into complaints of overcharging or denying admission to patients. This committee found that the private hospital had charged the patient a bill of ₹4.81 lakhs. The patient’s family complained to the civic body on July 13, following which the civic committee intervened.“There was a complaint from a family about overcharging. We served a show-cause notice to the hospital asking the hospital to return the excessive amount,” said Vinay Kulkarni, officer in-charge of the committee.KDMC on Thursday said it has deployed its staffs at all the 24 hospitals that has tied up with the civic body to treat Covid patients. The staff will check bills of patients during discharge and in case of over-charging will report to the committee. The appointed staff will update the committee on weekly basis.“So far 24 hospitals have agreed to treat Covid patients and 80% of the beds in these hospitals will be under our control. In order to ensure there is no overcharging or denial of beds, we have appointed our staffs at these hospitals. If we receive any complaint, action will be taken,” said Madhavi Pophale, public relations officer, KDMC.The committee had received complaints against four hospitals followed, following which show-cause notices were served. A dedicated helpline number 0251-2211866 is also functional for such complaints from patients.Sreeniwas Ghanekar, founder of Alert Citizens Forum, Kalyan, said, “We have been asking the civic body to act against hospitals which are overcharging or denying beds to patients. This move by KDMC is a remarkable one and it will help the patients in many ways. People can still approach us if they have complaints, we will follow it up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hospital-refunds-3-36-lakh-to-covid-patient-after-civic-body-sends-notice/story-HXF3TlC36XEAnYTNdZpYnL.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||Shivaji slogan in House does not violate norms: Sanjay Raut||The Shiv Sena on Thursday said that slogan hailing Shivaji does not violate constitutional norms after a controversy erupted as Vice-President and chairman of Rajya Sabha M Venkaiah Naidu expressed his disapproval over BJP MP Udayanraje Bhosale chanting “Jai Bhavani, Jai Shivaji” after taking oath on Wednesday. “I have never thought that this slogan violates any constitutional norms. The slogan ‘Jai Bhavani, Jai Shivaji’ was as important as ‘Jai Hind’ and ‘Vande Mataram’,” Raut said and added that various other slogans in the both the Houses of Parliament have been shouted by lawmakers earlier. Raut added that Naidu is a person who follows the rules and therefore this issue should not be dragged. “Rules of the House and sentiments of members are two different issues,” the Sena MP said.In a video clip of the oath ceremony, Naidu is heard telling Udayan Raje: “For your future reference, no other slogans are allowed in the House”. On Thursday, Naidu tweeted making it clear that he did not mean to insult anybody. “Always been a strong and vocal admirer of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and worshipper of Goddess Bhawani. Reminded members that as per conventional practice at the time of taking oath no slogans are given. No disrespect at all,” he tweeted.Former Lok Sabha MP and Shiv Sena leader Chandrakant Khaire staged a protest in Aurangabad against the “insult” of king Shivaji. Shiv sainiks also protested in Navi Mumbai over the issue.Raje, a descendant of Shivaji, dismissed the issue and said there was no insult to the 17th-century warrior king. “He (Naidu) said you can take the oath, but do not add anything else to it... it is not in line with the Constitution… But some people have created a controversy out of it. Had (Shivaji) Maharaj been insulted, I am not the one to keep quiet. I would have resigned at the very moment,” he said. “Naidu did no wrong. Had he done so, I would have sought his apology,” Bhosale added.Raut added that he agrees with the BJP MP and said he merely brought up the issue after followers of Shivaji Maharaj felt that the descendants of Shivaji were insulted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shivaji-slogan-in-house-does-not-violate-norms-sanjay-raut/story-vvBSyJc7wT3Xgd3qRfnsQL.html
24-07-2020||City||4 of family held for woman’s murder in Boisar||Boisar MIDC police on Thursday arrested four members of a family for murdering Bulbul Jha, 20. The accused are Jha’s husband Deepak, 21; his father Pawan Jha, 50; mother Bachudevi, 45; and his sister Nitu Mukesh Thakur, 30. The four were arrested from Gurugram, Haryana, where they were allegedly living under false identity, said senior inspector Pradip Kasbe of Boisar MIDC police station. The four arrested accused have confessed to the crime but are not revealing how they murdered Jha in February 2019. They will be produced before Palghar court on Friday, said Kasbe.The murder came to light after the landlord of their chawl in Ganesh Nagar, Boisar broke open the door of their room following non-payment of rent for three months, and found the remains of Jha stuffed in a plastic drum. Kasbe said the murder took place in February 2019 and the room has since been locked. The accused had allegedly told the landlord not to rent out the room to anyone else and paid rent for March through money transfer. “We traced the money transfer shop in Gurugram and sent a team of four policemen there. The accused somehow learnt about police coming to arrest them and were planning to leave, but were caught,” said Kasbe. In February 2019, Deepak had attempted to set Jha on fire, following which he was arrested and then released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-of-family-held-for-woman-s-murder-in-boisar/story-vtORAUJUMuGGK6W6dU4BnO.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||Seamless travel: MMRDA invites bids for common mobility phone app||The city has taken its first step towards contactless, seamless travel. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on Thursday has invited bids for a mobile technology partner to develop and operate a common mobility application under its integrated ticketing services (ITS) project as well as a banking partner for transactions. Owing to the pandemic, the authority set aside various options and has decided to create a “journey planner”, a mobile application to enable a contactless and seamless travel across public transport systems. MMRDA metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said, “We are very happy to take a big step towards seamless travel in Mumbai. We worked on this project during lockdown and have coordinated with different public transport authorities to enable this. The platform will enable commuters to plan their entire journey with just a click.” In a meeting earlier in July, chaired by the state’s urban development minister, MMRDA approved the revised proposal which is likely to roll-out from December 2020. Once operational, Mumbaiites can use the application to plan their journey by making a payment on the app, which will create a QR code that can be used for the journey. The application will work across Metros, monorail, BEST buses, app-based cabs and the suburban railways. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday tweeted, “A long standing promise now being realised by CM Uddhav Thackeray ji for MMR. Ease of living and travelling is the main intent.”Currently, each transport mode in Mumbai has its own ticketing system — for suburban trains, commuters can use the ATVM card apart from the physical tickets, Mumbai Metro One also its own card, Mumbai monorail has a token system, while all payments for taxis and auto-rickshaws, even BEST buses, need to be done through cash. Across the world, big metros have single or multiple common mobility cards — London has the Oyster card; Hong Kong, the Octopus card; Sydney has the Opal card; Toronto has Presto; and Manila has the Beep card.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/seamless-travel-mmrda-invites-bids-for-common-mobility-phone-app/story-7Pq6FkOnJRlzPgFAkAHXlJ.html
24-07-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER to build digital repository of health records, patient data||The Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) is planning to set up a public digital infrastructure with individuals, doctors and health records connected to a grid as part of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM). The institute in collaboration with NDHM will provide a comprehensive health ecosystem that will have digitally empowered individuals, doctors, and health facilities, facilitate electronic signatures, enabling paperless registrations and payments, leading to streamlining of healthcare information.The system will digitise health records of patients, inclusive of various documents, such as diagnostic reports, discharge summary and prescriptions, shared by various health establishments and doctors to help patients effectively manage their care.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said they had received intimation from the Union health ministry to develop the system for which they had appointed a nodal officer.“Last year we received 30 lakh patients, so maintaining the record is a huge task. The activity will be completed in a time-bound manner, and all norms of data privacy will be strictly adhered to,” he said.Dr Ram has nominated Dr Sarita Mahajan, chief medical officer, Staff Clinic, as the nodal officer for the purpose of support and cooperation with the National Health Agency (NHA). Gaurav Kumar Dhawan, deputy director of administration, PGIMER, said discussions with NHA, which was implementing the system, were underway. “In this regard Dr Indu Bhushan, CEO, Ayushman Bharat, had visited the institute and delivered a detailed presentation of NDHM implementation. We will be holding more meetings on the requirements and development of this system. We presented our digital system to them and more features will be added,” Dhawan said. Among the first features to be rolled out will be the digital health identifier, “Swasthya Account”, which will help individuals create their identity in the national healthcare system for ease of access to their personal health information.A comprehensive central repository known as “Digi Doctor” will also be compiled of all healthcare providers and practitioners (HCPs), uniquely identified in India, to provide a one-stop solution for streamlined medical practice.A health facility registry will collate information on healthcare facilities uniquely identified in India, which will maintain, store and facilitate exchange of standardised data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-to-build-repository-of-health-records-patient-data/story-lGeDoxVuxh4EMxGcEpHpJN.html
24-07-2020||City||School-turned-Covid centre in Kalyan to begin operations in 3 days||The first school in Kalyan to be converted into a dedicated Covid health centre is set to open in next two to three days. Haji Kalsekar English Medium School at Govindwadi, once transformed, will help locals get treatment for Covid-19 on time. Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi on Wednesday took a stock of the centre spread across 1 acre. Asra foundation, which runs the school, had approached KDMC offering the school premises to help battle Covid-19, following which the decision was taken to convert the school.An associate of the foundation said, “When curbs were imposed in our area in June due to increasing cases, we decided to offer the school space for treatment and isolation of people living in the locality so that they don’t have to rush to other places in search of beds. Also isolation at homes in Govidwadi and nearby areas is not possible as most of them live in small houses. The school will not reopen anytime soon, so why not use the infrastructure.” The centre is set to admit patients in the coming two to three days while the work of setting up 110 oxygen beds, 10 intensive care unit beds and 70 normal beds is currently under progress. The centre will have 12 doctors, 20 nurses and 20 ward boys and a physician. The open area of the school will be used as isolation centre, while three floors with seven classrooms each will be used to set up the beds.A fever clinic and testing facility in the school premises has already been set up and began operation in June.Suryavanshi said, “Patients from nearby areas can get tested at the centre and also get admitted if required. The work of the centre is almost done. Patients will be admitted there in two-three days. Several doctors and residents have come forward to help the civic body to set up the Covid care centre.”The centre will be useful for residents of areas like Ghass Bazar, Ansari Chowk, Doodh Naka, Rohidas Wada and Govindwadi in Kalyan (West) which has a population of around 80,000 people and has been recording around 30-40 cases each day, according to KDMC health department.“Earlier when the civic body initiated surveying these areas in June, residents insisted upon setting up a centre in their locality as they don’t want to go to other quarantines centres. The locals living there came up with the idea of using the school. This will help in early admission and treatment, thus reducing fatality count in the area,” said Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/school-turned-covid-centre-in-kalyan-to-begin-operations-in-3-days/story-5wXKSESv9Acqyt36KzwztJ.html
24-07-2020||City||Now, you can deposit earnest money online during bidding for UT tenders||Chandigarh The UT administration has finally implemented the online payment of earnest money for participation in its e-tenders. The online application was awaiting implementation for around a year since it was developed.It is intended to remove scope for manipulation in the tendering process.The implementation follows the recent allegations made against the UT engineering department for allotment of tenders when most bidders couldn’t deposit earnest money to participate in the tendering process because of the lockdown.An online payment gateway has been integrated within the e-tendering mechanism, which allows the bidders to deposit the earnest money through online banking transactions.The system, developed by the National Informatics Center, Chandigarh, in June last year was to become operational by July-end.Before its implementation, while the tenders were floated online, many other steps involved in the tendering process were manual rather than online. The details of the tenders were available online, but bidders had to deposit earnest money physically, though the tendering was done online.The decision to introduce it came after some contractors complained that they couldn’t participate in bidding process of a hostel in government educational institution on account of their inability to deposit earnest money due to the lockdown. In the said tender only two local bidders could deposit the earnest money.Also, depositing earnest money through physical banking transaction exposes the identity of the bidder, as well as the total number of bidders. It shows how many people have come to participate in the tendering process. This opens up the scope for manipulation of the entire e-tendering process,” said a senior UT official.The new system allows for the protection of identity of the bidders. “There have been instances in the past when the disclosing of the bidder’s identity and their number had impacted the outcome of the process. Bidders have been even pressured in some cases,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-you-can-deposit-earnest-money-online-during-bidding-for-ut-tenders/story-Dzojszj1kr5N0vo2aEx5KM.html
24-07-2020||City||4 schools get notice for pressuring parents for fees; schools deny claim||Thane zilla parishad education department has served notice to four schools seeking explanation after the schools demanded fees from parents. The education officer has given a warning to the schools to abide by the guidelines issued by the state government and not to pressure parents for fees during the lockdown.The Maharashtra government, in a government resolution issued on March 30, has directed all the schools in the state not to pressure parents of students for fees during lockdown. The four schools are Universal High School, Lokpuram Public School, Rainbow International School and New Horizon Scholars School. Sheshrav Bade, education officer of Thane district, said, “We received a few complaints from parents regarding fees, so we sent a notice to these schools. The schools can discuss with the parents teachers association and only collect basic fees.” However, Bade insisted that no schools should enforce fee payment during the pandemic.All the schools denied having forced any parent to pay fees. However, a parent from Universal High School, on condition of anonymity, said, “The school is compelling us to take a loan from an organisation suggested by them and pay the fees. If I could afford a loan, I would have already paid the fees.Jesus Lal, CEO of Universal High School, said, “We have a tie-up with an organisation that will offer loan to the parents to pay school fees wherein we will be paying the interest for the same. Most of our parents have paid the fees already and around 10% who are facing problems during the lockdown have been given concession or waiver of fees.”Lipika Chandra, principal of Lokpuram High School, said, “We have given concessions to parents who are not in a position to pay fees. We are considering the current scenario. However, those who are interested to pay are also welcome as we have other expenses to meet as well.”Jyoti Nair, principal of New Horizon Scholars School, and Raju Balbale, owner of Rainbow International School, has denied receiving any letter from the education department and complaint from parents. Both the schools have been giving parents concession in fees during lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-schools-get-notice-for-pressuring-parents-for-fees-schools-deny-claim/story-p8REnAHTRmTqs9KP9cH6pN.html
24-07-2020||City||Housing societies to check residents: TMC chief||As part of the various efforts to flatten the curve, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) on Thursday has asked housing societies to check residents with pulse oximeter and thermal gun. Society members aged below 10, those who are unwell and senior citizens should be tested regularly. TMC commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma said, “If the oxygen saturation levels are low for any individual, the concerned person should be recommended to a fever clinic or a general physician for further check-up at the earliest. A record should be maintained of those who are unwell, children and senior citizens. Also, all rules of social distancing and wearing masks should be mandatorily followed within the premises of housing societies as well.”The civic body must also be informed if any resident is admitted to hospital for non-Covid reasons.Shirish Shinde, a resident of Everest Complex, Kolshet, said, “We are already taking a lot of measures and have asked residents to inform us if anyone feels unwell. Moreover, we do not allow any outsiders into the premises. All essentials are made available through home delivery. Barring those who step out to go to work, all others have been asked to mention at the gate the reason for going out. We shall accept this decision as it is helpful for society members.” Meanwhile, cabinet Minister and Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde on Thursday asked all those who visit people’s houses such as house helps, cleaners, electricians, plumbers to be tested via rapid antigen tests. “As they visit various households, it is essential to ensure their well-being first. We have noticed a spike in cases in high-rises in Mumbai after the lockdown ended, so we need to take certain measures to ensure the same is not repeated in Thane,” said Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/housing-societies-to-check-residents-tmc-chief/story-nLVK7iPVP5XIS9a6ZMy9iO.html
24-07-2020||City||GPs, volunteers, priests: Mumbra’s Covid warriors||On April 3, Mumbra reported its first case of Covid-19. Soon enough, the number of cases increased. In May, there were 351 Covid-positive cases and 547 were recorded in June. Yet in the past three weeks, the daily caseload from this congested suburb has been less than 10. In July, Mumbra has reported 193 cases so far. From struggling to implement the lockdown to containing Covid-19, the success story in Mumbra was made possible by local volunteers, general physicians (GPs) and Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) working in tandem.Mumbra, with its 9 lakh population, is approximately 31 kilometres from Mumbai and lags behind in terms of development and infrastructure. The area saw an influx of residents after the 1992 riots in Mumbai, when many Muslim families fled to Mumbra. Today, 80% of the population is Muslim and many live in unauthorized chawls and vertical slums.When the lockdown was initially announced, residents of Mumbra did not take the threat of Covid-19 seriously, say locals. “Till Ramzan [April 24 to May 24], the markets were flooded, there was no social distancing,” said Mumbra-resident Imran Hakim. When TMC attempted to survey neighbourhoods to detect patients, locals refused to cooperate. Barricades set up around containment zones were occasionally torn down, said assistant municipal commissioner of Mumbra, Mahesh Aher. On April 10, TMC actually locked over 38 buildings – with lock and key – to keep residents inside. However, the number of cases kept rising. “The number of cases increased the most in May, during Ramzan, after which we started the strict implementation [of lockdown],” said Aher.Faced with these obstacles, TMC took help from locals: GPs who kept their clinics open; volunteers who helped the civic body conduct its surveys; and maulvis who spread awareness regarding Covid-19 with their morning calls to prayer.Hakim, 32, is among the 30 volunteers who worked with TMC to survey residents. “People were not allowing the survey in most areas so the corporation hired us volunteers who went door to door to convince people. Most residents knew us and were more open to us. We surveyed the residents of the buildings where positive cases were found, especially targeting those who are old or have comorbidities. We explained to them the consequences of not allowing the survey,” said Hakim.Another volunteer Haroon Dalvi, 30, said, “Gradually, we along with TMC officials managed to reach out and convince most people, especially in areas like Chand Nagar, Rashid Compound and Amrut Nagar where there were more cases than in the rest of Mumbra. We also sanitized each and every building where positive cases were found. The temperature and oxygen levels of the people in the building were recorded.”Mumbra has one dedicated Covid hospital (Kalsekar Hospital) and one Covid care centre (at Kausa Stadium). Hemange Ghode, medical officer at Kausa Stadium, said, “We did not allow home quarantine in Mumbra at all. Compulsory institutional quarantine was imposed. This helped prevent the spread. Extensive screening, contact tracing, cracking down on violators and compulsory quarantine helped to flatten the curve. We also kept a tab on migrants who left and also on those who are now returning. It is true that people don’t listen 100%, but in Mumbra, we have managed to convince 70% residents to stay at home.”Local GPs have played a big part in tracing and counselling patients. Dr Moinuddin Raut, 49, president of Medical Practitioners’ Association, said that while most GPs across Thane city closed down their clinics, those in Mumbra remained open. “There was lot of fear of being quarantined among people, due to which they did not visit fever clinics or any TMC-run medical camps. People are always comfortable sharing their illness with their family physician and with this motive, we opened all clinics in Mumbra. Residents trust these family physicians and got treated for most ailments. We also counselled those with Covid-like symptoms to get tested and treated.” Only doctors who are above 55 years of age did not keep their clinics open.Asif Shaikh, 32, a resident of Amrut Nagar in Mumbra, said, “There were many cases of malaria and typhoid. GPs helped reduce these cases. Senior citizens who had comorbidities like diabetes or blood pressure also could seek help from their regular GPs.”To curb the spread of Covid-19 through overcrowding in markets and bylanes, TMC imposed heavy fines and set up barricades. Aher said, “We imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 on shopkeepers who violated lockdown. People were fined Rs500 for not wearing masks and crowding vegetable markets. We collected over Rs.7.5 lakh as fines and over 15 cases under section 188 were registered against people who tried to obstruct surveys.”A police official from Mumbra said approximately 200 cases were registered against those violating lockdown restrictions and patrolling was increased. Teams of police officers also worked to spread awareness in over 5,000 buildings in Mumbra.TMC also set up a perimeter of 250 metres around containment zones and those within this area were not allowed to leave even for essentials. “Essentials were delivered near the barricades and one person was allowed to carry them inside. We also appointed five nodal officers in charge of co-ordinating contact tracing, transportation of people to quarantine centres, implementation of containment zones, coordination with general practitioners and to crackdown on violators,” said Aher.The corporation used mobile apps and global positioning system (GPS) to track Covid-positive patients.Mumbra now accounts for 1,142 of Thane’s 16,542 positive cases. At Kausa Stadium, where patients with mild symptoms are admitted, 225 have been admitted altogether and 150 have been discharged. There are 91 active patients at present. So far, Mumbra has had 74 deaths due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gps-volunteers-priests-mumbra-s-covid-warriors/story-1U2uV0xa1RE8DGRTWHskJM.html
24-07-2020||Chandigarh||Reconsider holding exam for final-year students: HC to Panjab University||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday asked the Panjab University to consider whether it can promote final-year students on the basis of their score in the previous semesters. The direction was passed after the petitioner students, who have approached the court demanding scrapping of the exams, told the court that the Maharashtra government and Central University of Tamil Nadu have decided to pass students on the basis of their performance in previous semesters.Some PU students will have to travel from far-off places like Leh and Ladakh to take examinations for the final semester, they told the court. The order was passed by the HC bench of justice Ritu Bahri on the plea of six students. The students have challenged the varsity’s directive for final-year students to appear for their last-semester exams. They have argued that students from across the country study at PU and due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most of them have had to travel back to their home towns, which has further made it impossible to return without risking their health.PU has nearly 200 colleges affiliated to it in Chandigarh and Punjab, with a huge base of students from Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, besides some students from far-off places, including north-eastern states. “The travel will not just force students to face uncertainty and risk, but they will also have to self-quarantine for multiple days according to the state guidelines. Thus, practically making it impossible for students to come and give the examinations and head back to their home after every exam,” they have told court. The high court, while deferring the hearing till August 13, said the interim order as passed on July 15 will continue. It was on July 15 that high court had restrained PU from holding exams in July. On July 18, the varsity had decided to promote all students except outgoing batches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/reconsider-holding-exam-for-final-year-students-hc-to-panjab-university/story-lwJQvuKLSe2GGwXOkwciUI.html

24-07-2020||Mumbai||Air India defends differential pay cut for senior pilots and management||A day after Air India’s (AI) senior pilots expressed discontent over the differences in pay cuts for pilots and senior management, the national carrier on Thursday defended its decision saying wages would later be reviewed in accordance with the airline’s improved financial condition.In a tweet, after a review meeting with the ministry of civil aviation, Air India said the move to rationalise wages has been taken due to the impact of Covid-19 on the airline’s finances.One of the airline’s three tweets read, “Recent decisions of Air India board regarding rationalisation of staff cost were reviewed in a meeting at @MoCA_goi this evening. The meeting reiterated that unlike other carriers which have laid off large number of their employees, no employee of Air India will be laid off.”On July 22, HT had reported on claims made by senior pilots that salaries of top AI officials have been reduced by a smaller percentage, as compared to their own. The pay of AI pilots have been reduced by 60% on an average — 40% on salary and 85% on flying allowances — owing to the unilaterally applied new wage structure, in addition to implementing leave without pay policy for employees. The airline management, on the other hand, has taken a 50% cut on just their allowances.The national carrier said they had not deducted basic salaries for any employee. “There has been no reduction in the basic pay, DA and HRA of any category of employees. The rationalisation of allowances had to be implemented on account of the difficult financial condition of the airline that were exacerbated by COVID-19. (sic)”“Flying crew will be paid as per the actual number of hours flown. As domestic and international operations expand to reach pre-Covid levels and the financial position of Air India improves, the rationalisation of allowances will be reviewed,” the national carrier concluded. The airline, however, did not comment on pay cuts of its management officials. “Our question still remains unanswered: How much pay cut is being given to management officials, and why are they not charged on their major component of the salaries instead of allowances, which barely contributes to their total salary,” said a senior pilot. Mumbai-based Executive Pilots Association (EPA), a union comprising senior-most pilots flying long (more than seven hours) and ultra-long flights (for more than 12 hours), wrote to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Thursday that the decisions are adversely impacting the morale of pilots. “The recent decision of the management adopting compulsory leave without pay (LWP) model as well as the massive wage cut of the employees/pilots’ emoluments has led to serious discontentment and heart burn among the entire workforce,” read the letter. They also pointed out that decisions related to LWP scheme and wage reduction have been made without consent of any unions. The airline has been facing backlash for its imbalanced pay cuts for flying crew and management officials. Airline employees from various departments, including engineering and ground staff, have written letters to the airline management on the LWP scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-defends-differential-pay-cut-for-senior-pilots-and-management/story-x4PpbJvXkucMOvpunzbNbP.html

24-07-2020||Mumbai||Adapt and adjust: City finds its new survival mantra after 4 months of lockdown||Mumbaiites have restyled their life to adjust to the lockdown due to Covid-19 – from juggling work and personal life while working from home, battling insomnia, a disrupted body clock cycle, to rethinking how outdoor businesses can adapt, managing house work without hired helps, and making key life events such as engagements and birthday parties happen as per plan.Corporate professionals say they experience longer working hours and increased workload while working from home, with little distinction between work life and family life. Parents are looking for newer and innovative ways to keep their children engaged productively. Homemakers, mostly women, say housework never gets over, and those dependent on businesses that demand outdoor work or material interactions, such as dancers, photographers, shop owners, restaurateurs, are looking for ways to keep their finances flowing. “This is not here to stay forever. But we don’t know when it is going to go. It is a matter of being patient and overcoming this tide. We have to adapt,” said Archana Basu, 37, an Odissi dance teacher. Basu moved her dance classes online after lockdown, and interacts with her students over video calls and recorded videos. She also juggles home schooling her daughters, and working a corporate job online that is based in another time zone halfway across the world. “I am lucky my primary income is not from dance. There are a lot of challenges in taking dance classes to the virtual world. In dance, everything is based on rhythm, but there is usually a lag in video calls.”Basu has begun to record her dance sessions and send them to students, who replicate them for homework and send back recorded videos. “I have also started taking fewer students per batch on a video call, but that means more batches and more work. Many students are signing up, as parents have also reached a tipping point with children,” Basu said. Anuradha Gupta, 47, who works in a corporate firm, said, “It takes discipline while working from home to log in at a certain time, meet deadlines. It is also important to clearly distinguish between work and personal life. I find myself thinking, if I am not doing office work, I am doing house work. Then why not put a few more hours completing office work?”Gupta, who is a single parent, has found a way to meet work and personal life balance by sticking to a strict schedule. “I wake up, cook and set up my seven-year daughter’s school lessons on the computer. Then I take a bath and change into work clothes as though I was going to office. By 8pm, I change out of work clothes. This way I am able to distinguish between work hours and time with my daughter. Also, I am always ready for a video call! When I am working, I tell the people at home ‘I am not here. Assume I went to work as usual’.”Bhagyashree Parab, 46, who lives in Dombivli, and works with a private shipping firm in Fort, said, “There is a discipline in catching a train early morning for work, even though I now save four hours of commute and I can use that time elsewhere. I am also saving the money I spent on commute. Now I spend more time with my daughter, but there is a flip side to staying at home - housework never gets over. What I would do in a rush before leaving for work every morning, I now pace out throughout the day. I get disappointed when no one at home helps me with house work. Earlier I had the opportunity to at least share this with my girl-gang at work. The prospect of meeting my colleagues and friends was exciting. Now it gets monotonous.” On the other hand, Suraj Balakrishnan, 31, a corporate media professional, said, “My body clock cycle has gone for a toss. I end up watching something till 3am or 4am, and barely get sleep on a working day. Then I sleep a lot over the weekend and wake up at 2 pm or later. But I am trying to maintain a routine.”Balakrishnan, who is also a football enthusiast, is now hooked to the football season. He said, “For three months there were no live games, or television shows. This live football season has given me something to look forward to in the present.”Balakrishnan also got engaged three weeks ago, in the middle of lockdown, in a small ceremony with family. “It had to be done at some point and this was planned for May. We still pushed it forward a little, but it looks like this scenario is here to stay. So we should get on with our lives,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/adapt-and-adjust-city-finds-its-new-survival-mantra-after-4-months-of-lockdown/story-jOVv188hPWvMdkvQkoHxaL.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||4 months of Maha lockdown: Did city’s health infrastructure get better?||While the city remained on its toes through the four months of lockdown, as the case count crossed 1.04 lakh and toll crossed 5,800, it managed to ramp up its health infrastructure in the period, according to both Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and experts. The latter, however, feel the city still needs to boost the testing numbers.HOW IT ALL BEGANAs the first case was detected in mid- March, BMC and the state urged citizens to work from home and shut gyms and restaurants on March 13. On March 19, BMC said non-essential shops will be opened on odd and even days, but three days later, the state announced a lockdown, a day before the nationwide lockdown, allowing only essential shops to remain open for two months.The first relaxation came in the form of opening electrical and hardware shops, considering the complaints from essential businesses that electrical appliances had developed a snag and required to be fixed. Later, wine shops were opened in the first week of May owing to revenue deficit. However, they were shut on May 5 owing to violation of norms of social distancing. On May 8, the state transferred BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi to the urban development department, making 1989 batch Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer Iqbal Singh Chahal the new commissioner. In mid-May, Chahal allowed home delivery of liquor with help of e-commerce websites. On June 2, BMC allowed re-opening of parks and playgrounds for physical activity, non-essential shops to remain open on odd and even days and private offices to work with 10% strength as part of Mission Begin Again. In the last week of June, BMC allowed reopening of salons and beauty parlours, and reopened hotels from the second week of July.HEALTH INFRAIn the initial phase of lockdown, the major challenge for BMC was to create health infrastructure and scale up testing and tracing. BMC went from having sole Kasturba Hospital for isolating Covid-19 patients in March to more than 22,000 beds to handle critical cases and additional 74,000 beds in quarantine centres to isolate high-risk contacts and those having mild symptoms.According to data from the state health department, Mumbai recorded 151 positive cases and seven deaths as of March 31, which went up to over 6,000 cases and 250 deaths by the end of April. By the end of May, Mumbai had over 39,000 cases and over 1,200 deaths that went up to over 77,000 cases and over 4,500 deaths by the end of June. As of July 22, Mumbai had over 1.04 lakh cases and over 5,800 deaths. In the past 51 days after relaxations, 61,186 cases have been reported in the city. In this period, the fatality rate increased to 5.68% from 3.25%. One of the reasons is the addition of 1,500 deaths by BMC after reconciliation of figures. In this period, the recovery rate of the city, too, went up to over 70%, from 40%.BMC currently has 17 private labs in addition to the government labs, where daily collection of samples has gone up from 100 in March to 7,000 samples in July. The first 1 lakh mark of testing samples was crossed on May 6, followed by crossing the 4 lakh mark on July 14. As of July 21, BMC had tested 4.50 lakh samples.In this span of four months, BMC undertook several measures to liberalise testing policy, from initially allowing only symptomatic patients and high-risk symptomatic patients. On June 23, BMC announced that it was procuring 1 lakh rapid antigen kits. On July 7, BMC announced a protocol that allowed everybody to get tested without any prescription.Downward curveSeveral areas like Worli, Dharavi, Mankhurd, Govandi, Byculla, Mumbai Central and Mazgaon that were earlier known as hotspots are now showing signs of improvements. According to the data for the past one month, 50% cases are from suburban areas namely Dahisar, Borivali, Kandivli, Malad, Andheri, Bhandup, Mulund, etc. BMC said cases in these areas have increased owing to aggressive screening and testing in these areas. On the other hand, daily cases in the earlier hotspots have gone down. Experts claim to conclude that the curve is going downwards or flattening in certain areas of the city, BMC needs to release area-wise testing data.Siddarth Paliwal, a private health consultant from Mumbai, said, “Area-wise testing data will help analyse and comment on why a particular area may be seeing more or less cases.”BMC said the focus now is on detecting cases from high-rises, considering post relaxations people have started going out, allowing house helps, electricians, mechanics in their house. Dr Shashank Joshi, an expert member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task-force, said, “This virus has taught us a lot of things in four months. It started to spread from those who were coming from abroad initially from where it spread in the densely populated slum population. Post relaxations, it has gone towards high-rises, where maximum cases are being reported currently.”BMC in the last two months has also announced several initiatives such as ‘Chase the virus’ that involves aggressive screening and tracing maximum high-risk contacts behind every positive case, followed by ‘Mission Zero’ that involved aggressive screening, tracing and testing in areas that have high growth rate. Other initiatives include ‘Mission Universal Testing’ that involves changing testing protocols from time to time to ‘Mission Save Life’ to change treatment protocols to bring down the fatality rate.DID LOCKDOWN HELP?Madhav Sathe, former professor of microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “Globally, the first four to six weeks of lockdown are very useful, and subsequent relaxations give a much better picture when it comes to the number of cases. We can’t imagine the situation without lockdown in a city like Mumbai. The lockdown gave a buffer period for the authorities to tackle and handle the pandemic, and Mumbai did very well at scaling up health infrastructure, however, it was not done in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and rest of Maharashtra. In Mumbai, 6,000 RT-PCR tests are being done daily, by now, this number should have been around 12,000 to 15,000 tests daily. In MMR and Thane, the tests are fewer.”Dr Shashank Joshi from Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force said, “We might have lost economically, but we can’t afford to not have a lockdown. We have much better health infrastructure. Testing should have been liberalised earlier. We also had citizens who did not follow lockdown. We could have tackled the issue of migrant labourers earlier.”Going ahead, there will be a staggered re-opening, civic officials said. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, last week told HT, “We are planning to reopen restaurants in the coming days. Theatres, malls might be reopened in a staggered manner. The monsoon will be crucial. We have to control cases considering we can’t eliminate them until the vaccine arrives”Chahal in an interaction with HT last week had said, “Mumbai does not have a lockdown in the real sense anymore. If you leave aside malls, every shopis opening. On an average, we have one crore people on the road every day, so it can’t be called a lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-months-of-maha-lockdown-did-city-s-health-infrastructure-get-better/story-7mhEe2n2Bc1r2eHWPBnvQJ.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||4 months of Maha lockdown: State government lost ₹55,000 crore in tax revenue||The four months of lockdown cost the state exchequer ₹55,000 crore in tax revenue against the budget estimates. Although there are no estimates available for the economic losses and how it will affect the state GDP, manufacturing, services, real estate and hospitality are the worst-hit sectors, according to government officials and industry insiders. After starting a partial shutdown from March 14, the Maharashtra government imposed a complete lockdown across the state from March 23. By then almost all commercial-industrial activities had come to a halt, as shops, establishments and offices were shut down and local train services were stopped.Rajiv Podar, president, Indian Merchants Chamber, said, “The industrial sector witnessed 50%-70% production losses during the lockdown, mainly because of scarcity of labour, insufficient mobility and logistical support. Although it would be early to predict, Maharashtra can see a shrinkage of 3.5%-4.5% in state GDP compared to last year. It will depend on the duration of the lockdown and time taken to bounce back. The state should now provide support to the manufacturing sector, with working capital and focus on creating rural demand. By engaging the rural population in agriculture activities, rural agriculture infrastructure and their income level can be raised, which can in turn help revive other sectors like FMCG, infrastructure.”Nayan Shah, president, Credai-MCHI, said most of the ongoing 11,000 real estate projects in Mumbai Metropolitan Region have either been stalled or are progressing at 15% of their expected pace. “The industry is going through major challenges, be it in terms of operational costs or interest paid on the loans or shortfall of construction workers. Gaining back the confidence of financial institutions, customers and even labourers is a challenge. A majority of the 11,000 projects registered with RERA are stalled due to the lockdown. The government should immediately extend a helping hand by reducing stamp duty, premium rate and fees for nod by local authorities,” he said. Amitabh Taneja, chairman, Shopping Centres Association of India, said, “A mall usually generates sales of ₹60 crore a month and stores goods worth ₹300crore-₹400 crore at any given point. Stocks worth hundred of lakhs with the retailers are getting damaged and the value is expected to be lost, if not sold immediately. On the other hand, the exchequer has lost at least ₹8,000 crore in four months towards GST. The lockdown may see a loss of 50 lakh jobs employed in malls and with retailers,” he said. Maharashtra has 75 malls and 50% of them are in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.Although the state relaxed the curbs and allowed industrial units to operate from April 20, only 65,208 of the 7.34 lakh industrial units started their operations. Besides the fear of Covid-19, shortage of labourers, disruption of supply chain, logistics and slowdown have resulted in lukewarm response from industries. Deepak Sood, secretary general, Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), said, “The losses to the economy could go up if we look at the drop in GST collection and GDP growth rate. India is in a better position than most other countries and things are moving back to normalcy rapidly. It may take three-six months to revive, depending on the sector. The rural economy is doing well and is expected to perform better this year, owing to satisfactory rainfall. Although Maharashtra is the worst-hit by Covid, it is a major contributor to the country’s GDP and is expected to bounce back sharply.”The Maharashtra government suffered losses of ₹26,000 crore against a targeted revenue of ₹45,000 crore in March, the last month of the fiscal. With the tax revenue losses of more than ₹23,000 crore in April and May and estimated losses of more than ₹10,000 crore in July, the state exchequer’s accumulated losses have reached over ₹55,000 crore. “We were expecting the annual revenue receipt to be hit by ₹70,000 crore, but in the current scenario, it may be more. We have already borrowed ₹30,000 crore for monthly salary and pension bills, recurring establishment cost and incidental expenses such as Covid-19 and cyclone. We have already curtailed the expenditure on development works worth ₹70,000 crore,” said a state government official.A major chunk of the state revenue comes from GST, excise on liquor, stamp duty and registration and taxes on vehicles. “The revenue from excise dropped to ₹2,436 crore against estimates of more than ₹5,000 crore till July 20. Similarly, the GST revenue dropped to ₹12,906 crore against the estimated collection of ₹25,600 crore till July 20. With the extended lockdown in various parts of the state this month, the revenue losses are more than ₹10,000 crore than the estimated collection in July,” another official from the finance department said. “From raising revenue and borrowing to austerity measures and cutting capital expenditure, steps are being taken to cope with the situation,” said Manoj Saunik, additional chief secretary, finance. Industries minister Subhash Desai said, “The losses are huge, but it is also difficult to predict the economic losses to the state owing to the lockdown. The state economy will bounce back after the unlocking is completed. We have taken steps to attract industries and investment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-months-of-maha-lockdown-state-government-lost-55-000-crore-in-tax-revenue/story-RVn8vrdG5cL9twkV7IWtGP.html

24-07-2020||Mumbai||4 months of lockdown in Maharashtra: Ground reality||Even after four months of lockdown with relaxations in curbs, the spread of Sars-Cov-2 is not showing any signs of slowing down in Maharashtra, even though the situation seems to be improving in Mumbai.The Maharashtra government started a gradual lockdown since mid-March, after the first case of Covid-19 was reported in Pune on March 9. It announced lockdown across the state, sealing district and state boundaries, a day before the nationwide lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24. However, the numbers of cases and fatalities are rising to record highs, after the curbs were lifted to boost the state economy. According to the data, nearly 78% of the total cases have been recorded after the lockdown restrictions were lifted by the state government. State officials said the number of patients and toll could have been more had it not been for timely lockdown, travel restrictions, social distancing, and other interventions.The state on Thursday reported 9,895 new Covid-19 infections — its second-highest single-day spike — taking the tally to 347,502. Maharashtra has 140,092 active cases with 194,253 recoveries. The state’s recovery rate improved to 55.9% after 6,484 more patients recovered in the past 24 hours.Mumbai reported 1,245 new infections and 55 deaths, taking the caseload to 1,05,923 and toll to 5,930. With 298 fatalities reported in 24 hours, the state toll was pushed to 12,854.State health department officials said the surge in cases was expected to continue through August, and the cases can plateau in September. Health department officials also dismissed that Maharashtra has reached the community transmission stage.LOCK, UNLOCKThe Maharashtra government announced a gradual relaxation in curbs from June, as part of its Mission Begin Again. It provided relaxations for outdoor physical activities, including running, jogging, cycling, among others, from June 3. Subsequently, it opened up market areas, shops, except malls and shopping centres, from June 5. It also allowed private offices to open up with 10% of its staff from June 8.Maharashtra recorded 74,647 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 2,855 fatalities during the lockdown between March 24 and June 3. Since the relaxations were gradually lifted, while keeping the lockdown intact, the state has registered a whopping 262,747 cases and 9,699 fatalities between June 3 and July 22.Anup Kumar Yadav, health commissioner of Maharashtra, said the lockdown helped ready the infrastructure needed to tackle the cases. “The lockdown has been beneficial not just in terms of low numbers, but it has given time to prepare the health infrastructure needed to tackle the cases that come after the restrictions are lifted,” Yadav said. He added that restrictions were lifted to restart economic activities as Covid-19 will not go away so soon.In the past one month, the active case count has gone up in semi-urban areas, rural areas and satellite towns in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The local administrations have resorted to stringent curbs on movement of people and introduced lockdowns. “Municipal commissioners or district collectors can decide on lockdown. It has proven to be an effective way to contain the spread. The effects of such limited period lockdown show after 10 to 15 days,” a senior bureaucrat said.In Mumbai, the daily average rise in cases has been 1,200 for the past couple of weeks. State authorities said lower positivity rate amid more testing is a good sign. Dr Om Shrivastav, an infectious diseases specialist and a member of state government-appointed task force on Covid-19, argued that higher number of cases should not be the parameter for assessment. “Instead of going into the numbers, we should look at the case fatality rate (CFR), which is lower in the state (at 3.72%). We have done quite well in the lockdown period and later too. Dharavi has emerged as a model for the entire country and even state on how to contain the spread,” Dr Shrivastav said, adding that the Dharavi model can be replicated elsewhere in the state.the controlOn May 1, the overall positivity rate in the state was 7.51%, which doubled in a month to 14.84% on June 1. The positivity rate has increased to 20.01% on July 22. In other words, seven out of every 100 samples were turning out to be positive on May 1, which climbed to nearly 15 samples on June 1.Experts said high positivity rate is a reflection of the increase in the prevalence of the virus. However, state health department officials differed. They said a higher strike rate in tests was a result of targeted testing.The positivity rate in most days of July has been between 22% and 25%. The state has been conducting an average of 35,000 tests for the past few days. Maharashtra has been seeing over 8,000 cases daily for the past seven days, including 10,576 new cases on July 22.“The decision to unlock activities in the state was taken consciously. It was made keeping the economy in mind. How long can a lockdown last and at what cost? Initially, the industries, shops and businesses were allowed in areas that did not have a high number of cases. Gradually, the state decided to extend it to Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Pune districts as well areas that see a major chunk of business activities. We had anticipated that the cases would rise once the restrictions are lifted and that has happened. However, things are not out of control,” a senior state bureaucrat said requesting anonymity.Following the unlocking of activities, the number of daily cases shot up in parts of MMR, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad and Solapur districts. “There are no projections, but looking at the current trend, the cases are expected to rise till August, after which we can probably see a plateau. In Mumbai, it is expected to happen earlier, as the cases are not growing at that speed now,” Yadav said.While Kerala became the first state in the country to announce that it has reached the community transmission stage, the Maharashtra health department has denied it. “We are not in the community transmission stage. The numbers are growing, but are not multiplying, which happens in that stage,” Yadav said. Dr Shrivastav said people must continue to adopt measures they did during lockdown. “We need to make sure that we don’t lose the advantage we had during the lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-months-of-lockdown-in-maharashtra-ground-reality/story-NR2QHQ7041JcTtdcNM4IyN.html
24-07-2020||City||28-year-old held with 8kg poppy straw in Vashi||An LPG cylinder delivery man was arrested on Wednesday by Navi Mumbai police with 8kg of poppy straws worth ₹3.2 lakh. The drug is commonly used by truck drivers, who consume it to remain awake during long hours on the road.The special squad of the zonal deputy commissioner of police received a tip-off, following which the team, led by assistant inspector Gangadhar Devde, conducted a raid in the village of Kopri in Vashi on Wednesday afternoon. The accused Sunil Bishnoi, 28, a resident of the village, was arrested, and the drugs were found in his possession.“During the search of his person, we found around 312 grams of the poppy straws in crushed form. After Bishnoi was taken into custody, we raided his house and found the remaining drugs. They are valued at ₹3.2 lakh,” said Devde.Bishnoi had reportedly been peddling drugs for extra income for the last two years. He procured the contraband from Rajasthan, said police, adding that they suspect the drugs were smuggled via the Afghanistan-Pakistan route.“Poppy straw is often used to make heroin, but in India, it is more commonly used by truck drivers in powder form [bukki]. The drug is sold at ₹40,000 per kg in the Indian black market,” said a Navi Mumbai police officer.Bishnoi was charged under relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Police are now attempting to identify Bishnoi’s contacts in the chain of command to find out from whom he procured the drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/28-year-old-held-with-8kg-poppy-straw-in-vashi/story-p7yVOe0qtBctuEgKXcAOQI.html

24-07-2020||Mumbai||4 months of Maha lockdown: Economy needs a boost, say experts||How long will the lockdown continue? Four months after the country’s most industrialised state went into a lockdown, a day before the national lockdown was imposed on the midnight of March 24, Maharashtra is treading cautiously while answering this question. While some curbs have been lifted, the surge in cases has made the government defer the plan for more relaxations, even as experts stress the need to open the economy faster.After four phases of the lockdown till May 31, the state government rolled out its Mission Begin Again from June 3, allowing activities in a calibrated manner. Beginning with jogging, cycling at grounds and parks, shops and establishments were allowed to open on alternate days and private offices were allowed to open with 10% of their staff. Salons and beauty parlours were opened from June 28, and hotels from July 8 in subsequent phases.“We were planning to allow more staff in private offices and add more means of public transport to enable smooth operations of offices from the first week of July. However, a sudden spike in cases in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, excluding Mumbai, and Pune and other districts forced us to defer it. Stricter curbs were imposed in these areas. Although cases in Mumbai have stabilised, activities can’t open up in the city due to heavy movement of floating population from the neighbouring cities,” said a Sena minister.A section of the state cabinet and even the bureaucracy is split over the strategy. The differences between the three ruling parties came to the fore during the lockdown as NCP chief Sharad Pawar was in favour of opening up more activities, while CM Uddhav Thackeray exercised caution. “Barring containment zones, activities should be opened up now, as the economy is badly hampered. The state lacks consistency in its strategy of unlocking the activities. At this pace, there will be no normalcy at least for two months,” said a senior state government official.Neeraj Hatekar, professor of economics, Mumbai University said, “Serological surveys in areas like Dharavi show 40% of the population has already been infected. If the doubling rate in Dharavi is more than a year, as projected, let us open up industries there. Offices, industries, shops in Mumbai should be opened up, as the growth rate has dropped to 1.07%. If the government fears transmission from neighbouring cities like Kalyan-Dombivli and Thane, unlocking can be rolled out in Mumbai first. Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik are the nerve centres of the economy,” he said. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said there would be no more lockdowns and gradual unlocking will be rolled out. He said the government was also thinking about increasing the percentage of employees in offices. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant, said, “It has been four months of lockdown and nobody knows if the risk of the infection recedes in the next six months. Instead of waiting more, the state should start opening the sectors which are organised, disciplined and require lower footfall. Instead of asking people to stay home, they should be sensitised.”Industries minister and Sena leader Subhash Desai said, “The decisions will depend on the preparedness. Many political leaders like deputy CM Ajit Pawar were against the lockdown in their districts a few weeks ago, but they had to impose it in their areas like Pune. The situation was similar in Aurangabad, which I represent as the guardian minister. We had allowed industrial activities which led to a large number of patients in areas like Waluj. After a 10-day lockdown, there is drop in patients and deaths.” He said lockdown and unlocking will be a back-and-forth process. “It may or may not take two months to get to normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-months-of-maha-lockdown-economy-needs-a-boost-say-experts/story-99sShMIgazxUQ9Xsu2YSoI.html
24-07-2020||City||Migratory birds throng the Vasai-Virar, Palghar saltpans||A flock of around 200 to 300 flamingos, white ibis, storks, open bills and other migratory birds have been sighted along the saltpans and tracks between Naigaon and Vasai in the past few weeks.“Attracted by the wetlands and lush greenery of the twin cities of Vasai-Virar during the monsoon, many migratory birds are seen visiting the area,” said Sachin Main, president, Nature and Environment Society of Thane (NEST), an animal welfare organisation based in Vasai.Nature photographers captured the birds in their lens at Gogte salt pan, Umelmaan, Vasant Nagari, Rajivli and the marshy patches near Vasai fort and other surrounding areas, said Main.“The birds, particularly the flamingos, come from Kutch in Gujarat, and it is a pleasant sight to find a new bird species every day along the Vasai-Virar stretch,” said Sanjay Rahate, another bird lover from Vasai, who has clicked many pictures of the birds. “Flamingos and open bills also visit the Kelwe beach area in Palghar in winters,” said Rahate.The birds feed on crabs, worms, small fish and other marine products in the marshy wetlands. “However, as there are rice fields in Vasai-Virar also, the birds also flock there, but are under threat from locals, who kill the flamingos for their meat. NEST has decided to undertake a campaign to create awareness on the issue among the locals,” said Main.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migratory-birds-throng-the-vasai-virar-palghar-saltpans/story-nBYEKS4t74UmK6vKNfjwzM.html

According to the complainant, the consignment was delayed by a couple of days, and only one-third of the material reached the companies in a different truck.The complainant, Manohar Patil, 45, recorded his statement with Taloja police on Monday, naming the transporter, identified only as Rahman, and an unknown truck driver, for stealing the metal.Patil had accepted orders for two companies in Nashik, one of which was to receive 7,320kg of steel sheets while another consignment of 7,380kg steel sheets and 17,000kg steel coil was for the second company.On June 22, the consignment was loaded on a truck provided by Rehman. The delivery was to be made the same night.Patil told police that Rehman only provided the driver’s contact number and did not mention his name.When Patil called the driver the same night, his phone was unavailable. Rehman later informed Patil that the driver’s phone fell in the water and was not working. He promised that the delivery would happen the following day.When neither of the companies received the material on June 23, Patil went to Nashik to look for the driver. Rehman told him the truck was along the Satpur-Ambad Link Road, but Patil did not find it there.“Rehman then told Patil that the driver must have slept off after getting drunk. On June 25, the companies received a partial consignment in a different truck,” said an officer from Taloja police station.Patil alleged that Rehman, in connivance with the driver, stole 1,320kg steel sheets and 15,880kg of steel coil during transit. Taloja police have registered a case of criminal breach of trust under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Rehman and the unknown truck driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/8-94-lakh-worth-steel-stolen-during-transit-taloja-police-book-transporter-truck-driver/story-RrG0kKRheVnSXFfhvWc6IK.html

24-07-2020||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray, Ajit Pawar meet as Shiv Sena, NCP work on an alliance plan for future elections||The Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), partners in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in state, have begun working on a pre-election tie-up for future polls. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is also the Sena chief, and senior NCP leader and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar held a closed-door meeting on Thursday to discuss a future alliance plan, multiple leaders from both parties told HT on the condition of anonymity, as no decision has been formally made. The parties, according to the leaders, are looking at forging an electoral alliance to contest future polls together, and as a first step, they may contest local elections in Raigad district as allies. After their meeting, Thackeray and Pawar met legislators of both parties from the district at the Bal Thackeray memorial. NCP MP Sunil Tatkare and Sena secretary Milind Narvekar were also present at the meeting with the legislators. The parties are keen to contest district council (zilla parishad) and civic polls, which will be held in the next couple of years. This would include the Mumbai civic polls, which are significant for Sena. The three MVA partners, Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, had earlier discussed an electoral alliance plan. While Sena and NCP have started work on it, the Congress is undecided about it as certain factions within the party are not in favour of contesting elections in alliance with Sena. “Both Thackeray and Pawar are of the opinion that they should finalise the alliance plans instead of waiting for Congress to decide. If this plan clicks, then the two parties can go ahead with pre-election alliance for next Assembly and Lok Sabha elections too,” said a key NCP functionary. Political analyst Hemant Desai called it a “tactical move” by the two parties and said it could be significant for them. “Their strongholds are largely different and their alliance can help them. But will their cadre accept it and respond accordingly is what remains to be seen. This also raises the question over where Congress stands. Will they join or stay away? The move may lead to mistrust between Congress and its two ruling partners,” said Desai.Significantly, Thursday’s meeting also indicates that Thackeray and Ajit Pawar are “working together”. Pawar had tried to scuttle Thackeray’s chances of becoming chief minister when he had taken oath as deputy chief minister along with Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Devendra Fadnavis in the middle of e discussions to form a three-party alliance after the 2019 Assembly elections. While it was a short-lived move, with most NCP MLAs sticking with party chief Sharad Pawar, Ajit soon had returned to the party and made deputy chief minister. “That Uddhavji chose to discuss such a crucial issue with Ajitdada indicates the two are probably working together now,” said a senior Sena leader. Shiv Sena contested the 2019 Assembly elections in alliance with BJP, but parted ways with the latter after the elections over the issue of chief ministership. It then forged an alliance with NCP and Congress to form the MVA government in the state in November 2019, with Thackeray as the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-ajit-pawar-meet-as-shiv-sena-ncp-work-on-an-alliance-plan-for-future-elections/story-paf1L1tQow9KVK0zF53rCN.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||State allows existing housing societies to continue until new body is elected||The Maharashtra government on Thursday decided to allow existing cooperative housing societies to continue until a new body is elected. The decision is only applicable to housing societies with up to 250 members. The decision was taken by the state cabinet, considering the surge in Covid-19 cases in the state. The government has postponed elections of housing societies three times this year, in the backdrop of the health crisis. This move allows societies to conduct elections whenever it is comfortable for them, and until then, the existing body will continue to manage the affairs, officials said.The cabinet has also decided to offer housing societies an extension of five months, till December 31, to complete the audit of society books. The decision applies to all cooperative societies such as banks, sugar, dairy, etc. According to the existing rules, societies are required to complete their financial audit by July, four months after completion of the financial year.The state government has also allowed all cooperative societies, including housing societies, to conduct their annual general body meeting by March 31, 2021. This was done considering the possibility of active members losing their membership if they are unable to attend the meeting due to the Covid-19 situation. According to section 27 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, an active member can cast his vote to elect a cooperative body. However, he or she has to attend the annual general body meeting at least once in a five-year term to be eligible to vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-allows-existing-housing-societies-to-continue-until-new-body-is-elected/story-HopDbmgpPJRMZjQtMrMvdJ.html
24-07-2020||Mumbai||SEC social media contract given to BJP member: Congress||The Congress has alleged that the company of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) youth wing office-bearer was instrumental in handling the social media of the chief electoral officer (CEO), Maharashtra, in the run-up to the 2019 state Assembly elections. The Congress is demanding an inquiry into the matter. While the leader was not available for a comment despite several attempts by HT, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has sought a report from CEO, Maharashtra.On Thursday, social activist Saket Gokhale posted a series of tweets claiming that the State Election Commission (SEC) hired a digital agency owned by Devang Dave, the national convener of the information technology (IT) and social media cell of the BJP youth wing. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “How can someone who is involved with a political party be given a contract of a non-partisan agency which conducts polls? This is a serious case of conflict of interest, and there should be an independent probe.” Sheyphali Sharan, spokesperson, ECI, tweeted: “Regarding tweet of Mr Gokhale @SaketGokhale, Commission has sought detailed factual report in this matter from CEO Maharashtra with respect to alleged locale of the incidence immediately.”The state BJP confirmed that Dave is a party member, but opined that there was nothing wrong with him taking other contracts. “Dave has his own digital marketing company and services various clients. Just because he is associated with the BJP, that does not mean he cannot take up other assignments. He must have taken the SEC contract through the proper procedure,” said BJP spokesperson Bhalchandra Shirsat.Through his Twitter posts, Gokhale claimed that when he browsed through the old social media advertisements of CEO Maharashtra, the address given was of 202 Pressman House, Vile Parle. The said address was of the advertising agency Signpost India as well as the digital agency Social Central, which is owned by Dave. Dave is also instrumental in forming websites and pages like ‘I support Narendra Modi’ and ‘The fearless Indian’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sec-social-media-contract-given-to-bjp-member-congress/story-vopIJTL3Za5ydOHCGYuUfO.html

But there are also acts of kindness that have inspired many.Dubai-based philanthropist S P Singh Oberoi, who also runs Sarbat Da Bhala Charitable Trust, decided to dedicate himself to the noble cause of providing food and ration to the needy. Oberoi has distributed more than 1 lakh ration kits in all districts of Punjab for the past three months and more than 1 lakh medical kits and equipment in 23 civil hospitals in the state.Not only this, but he has also arranged flight tickets for Indians stuck in Dubai. He aims to bring back all those stranded there in the next two months. He paid for air tickets for 50 Punjabis stuck in UAE, who reached Chandigarh on Wednesday.The 65-year-old businessman, a native of Punjab and based in Dubai, is also known for depositing his blood money to save Indians who faced a death sentence for any crime in the UAE.Speaking to HT, Oberoi said, “We have a team of around 80 people, who are working to distribute dry ration every month in all districts of Punjab and even Jammu and Kashmir. In the past three months, our trust has distributed nearly 1 lakh dry ration kits to needy families and will continue till September and if required, till the virus disappears.”He said, “We have distributed 20,000 PPE kits, 30,000 N95 masks and one lakh surgical masks in 23 civil hospitals.”Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit said, “The trust has helped the needy in our district and whenever we need anything we approach them.”Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said, “The trust has provided medical kits to our hospital staff and all the government departments of the districts. His contribution to society is immense.”Oberoi said, “In the last two weeks, our trust has paid for tickets for around 90 youth stuck in Dubai. Now our aim is to bring back all Punjabis, most of them unemployed, stuck in the UAE in the next two months. I have already spoken to Punjab chief minister to provide jobs to the unemployed youth.”For SPS Oberoi, philanthropy is a way of life. So much so that Oxford University had bestowed an honorary doctorate on him for his work. Oberoi had moved to Dubai in 1992 and later came back to settle with his family in Patiala.His philanthropy work is expanding from Punjab — where he runs offices to provide pension to around 11,000 widows — to Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, where he plans to open dialysis units and crèches, and donating computers for jail inmates.He said he got into philanthropy after seeing the conditions of a village in Punjab. “Many people have no money to buy food, medicines. I am doing very little,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/philanthropist-oberoi-aims-to-bring-back-all-punjabis-stuck-in-dubai-within-2-months/story-PDhVqAFeKmP0YmuICg2EsN.html

24-07-2020||Noida||Lockdown, lesser human interference leads to more nestings in Surajpur wetland||Negligible human disturbance due to the Covid-19 lockdown and favourable climatic conditions has led to an improvement in habitat at Greater Noida’s Surajpur wetland, where more nestings and birds are being observed.According to an ecologist of Wetlands International, a global not-for-profit organisation dedicated to the conservation and restoration of wetlands, more nestings have been spotted this breeding season at Surajpur when compared to last year.“We have observed mixed nesting colonies which were spread out on a larger part of the wetland. Also, there are definitely more nests than last year. We cannot hold a census right now as the breeding season has just started. But we saw more resident water birds like egrets, black-headed ibis, Indian spot-billed ducks, purple herons, purple swamphen, common moorhens and white-breasted waterhen in comparison to previous years. They also occupied larger area for roosting, feeding across the wetland. Earlier, they would be confined to a certain pocket only,” said TK Roy, ecologist and Delhi state coordinator, Wetlands International.He added that favourable climatic conditions has helped and lack of disturbance is essential for the breeding season of terrestrial and water birds.“Last year during this same period in summer — from May to June — the ground habitat was quite dry due to lack of rainfall and moisture. Human activities in the wetland made the situation worse,” Roy added.According to the forest department, unlike Okhla Bird Sanctuary —where there is a ticketing system — Surajpur wetland was never officially opened to the public. A large number of local visitors and birders, however, were daily being allowed inside the wetland prior to the lockdown.“The climatic conditions were less harsh this year. The number of visitors dwindled after the lockdown. We have observed that the number of nesting colonies have increased and expect better results during the annual census due in winters,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.He also pointed out a large number of nests of black-headed Ibis – a near-threatened species– were observed on the palm grooves. The ibis annually nest during summer-monsoon in Surajpur Reserve Forest (Surajpur wetland), Sultanpur National Park (Haryana) and Delhi Zoo in NCR-Delhi“They usually nest on thorny trees but rarely on the palm groves. Looks like they (the ibis) are adapting to the date palms groves, which are in abundance in Surajpur,” Roy addedSpread over 308 hectares, of which 38 hectares is a lake, the Surajpur forest reserve area is home to a total of 186 species of resident, winter migratory, summer migratory and passage migratory birds. A census held in January 2020 had noted that the bird population in the area had dropped to 2,092 birds from a total 39 species against 3,034 birds from 42 species in January 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/lockdown-lesser-human-interference-leads-to-more-nestings-in-surajpur-wetland/story-fYLrNdZNCD7oyWGEe57WnO.html

The suspects, too, are yet to recover and have been moved to another hospital while they remain in judicial custody,” said Parvinder Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (south).A case has been registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act at the Maidan Garhi police station.The alleged crime took place at the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP)-run facility on July 15 night — within a week of the girl and the two men getting admitted to the centre.The facility, billed as the biggest in the world, is operating out of the Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Chhatarpur and has about 10,200 beds. But just 250 of them are currently occupied.That leaves much of the space unmanned.When the facility was opened on July 5, the ITBP said it will deploy 1,000 personnel for security arrangements. But with only a small section of the facility currently occupied, about 100 ITBP personnel work in shifts here to provide security.“The survivor and the rape accused became familiar with each other during their stay there. On July 15, the suspect called the survivor to a common but isolated spot in the facility on the pretext of speaking to her,” a police investigator said on condition of anonymity.The suspect asked his 20-year-old friend to stand guard and alert him if someone approached them. Then he allegedly raped the girl in the facility’s washroom area, the investigator said.The police said the girl also alleged “the suspect’s friend went on to record the crime on his mobile phone and officials were trying to verify the charge”.The girl reported the crime to an attendant at the facility the next morning. Authorities at the facility then informed the police.The girl was shifted to a hospital and sent for a medical examination, which allegedly confirmed the sexual assault, according to the police investigator.The girl came to the centre a week before the alleged crime as her home had no extra room where she could be put under home isolation, said another police officer who didn’t want to be identified. “There was just another patient who knew her family,” said the officer. Both suspects have relatives who are admitted in the centre.Covid care centres are used to house pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and those with mild infections who do not have appropriate isolation facilities at home.An ITBP officer, who didn’t want to be identified, said: “ITBP’s security personnel are usually not deployed in the bathroom area...This is a disease in which we are supposed to maintain a safe distance from the patients. While we are investigating how the crime happened, we have enhanced the security arrangements here,” he said.The ITBP officer said the agency’s personnel deployed at the centre reacted “proactively”. “Our doctors immediately spoke to the survivor and made sure the crime was actively pursued by the police,” he said.At the facility, a small section is occupied by the ITBP service providers while the patients’ sections are on the other side.About 30% of all patients admitted here are female, a government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/minor-raped-in-covid-care-centre/story-zMgjZBLGrEqdkgAGmDRLdM.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||First-time offenders get a chance at life and livelihood, courtesy police’ Yuva scheme||In May this year, Arjun Kumar Das, 18, was arrested on charges of pickpocketing passengers on a train at Sarai Rohila railway station. That was the first time he had committed a crime, according to Delhi Police records, and was to become a turning point in his life. Two months later, Das is out on bail and has enrolled in the Delhi Police’s self-sufficiency programme, ‘Yuva’, and will soon be assisting the Covid-19 front-line workers to fight against the pandemic. By August, when he completes his classroom as well as practical training, Das will be given a chance to work at nursing homes and private hospitals in the capital as a clerical assistant to the medical staff.Recalling what he calls his “biggest mistake”, Das, who had come to Delhi in January, says all he wanted to do was earn enough to take care of his family of three in Kishanganj, Bihar.“I used to work as an electrician, but in April, the owner of the electronics shop where I was employed asked me to leave as the shop was shut due to the lockdown. Left penniless, one day, I boarded a train at Sarai Rohila railway station along with a group of six other men I knew. After some time, a few of them were caught by the public for trying to pickpocket passengers and all of us were handed over to the police. After spending a week in the lock-up we managed to get bail. My crime was that I was in the wrong company. I am not a criminal and I will regret that incident for the rest of my life,” Das said.Das now lives in central Delhi’s Anand Parbat and he got himself enrolled in the Yuva programme in June, with the help of the beat constable in his area. “We are being trained in managing files and clerical work and are being made familiar with the work at a nursing home or a small hospital. We’ve been told that after a month of classroom training, because of the coronavirus outbreak, we will attend a few days of practical training. After that, we will be employed in nursing homes or private hospitals with the help of the police,” said Das, a class 8 drop-out.Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava said, “We believe that first-time offenders must be given a chance to reform. As a crime control strategy, we are segregating them from repeat offenders and arranging for their vocational training to make them self-reliant.”Another candidate, Deepak Goswami, 18, lives in Baljeet Nagar and is currently out on bail in a case of cell phone theft. Goswami said he used to work in Shakurpur at a garments factory when the lockdown started.“I and many others who were employed for sewing sherwanis were suddenly laid off. I was desperate to earn money. I started working as a carpenter at a furniture shop but early May, the owner made me quit. A week later, I was caught trying to steal a mobile phone and was jailed for theft. When I came out on bail, I got in touch with our beat policemen who helped me enrol for Yuva programme,” Goswami said.He said the training not only teaches them how to work efficiently but also educates them about how to keep away from anti-social elements and lead a healthy and safe life.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said, “We have roped in a few nursing homes and private hospitals that are willing to hire such persons once they complete the training.” “Currently, we have around 10 first-time offenders enrolled in the Yuva programme. They all lost their livelihood due to the pandemic. These men are undergoing training in a batch of 50 along with others who come from different backgrounds,” he said.Amit Kumar, 22, who has a gambling case registered against him, said this training will not only give his life a direction but also help him earn a good living. Kumar is out on bail and supports a family of five, including his parents and two siblings. DCP Bhatia said the idea of enrolling first-time offenders in such a programme came when it was noticed that many labourers, contractual employees and those involved in similar jobs have lost their livelihood due to lockdown. “At the same time, there was also a spurt in the number of first-time offenders. Analysing the situation, we directed our beat staff to keep a record of such offenders in the central district and get in touch with their families. We made sure that as soon as they were released on bail, they were made aware about Yuva scheme and persuaded them to enrol,” he said.Amita Baviskar, sociologist, Ashoka University, said in order to find a permanent solution to unemployed people resorting to crime, a basic income programme is much needed.“Training is not the issue. Since even skilled workers are out of work, we need more jobs and income support. This calls for a much bigger initiative which won’t be possible with the efforts of the police alone,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/first-time-offenders-get-a-chance-at-life-and-livelihood-courtesy-police-yuva-scheme/story-B5fx1ZfYDQqleHvwaQS7dJ.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||‘Rainwater can’t flow out as drains choked’: Gosain||Delhi is losing its capacity to handle monsoons, even when it is rain-deficient. This is mainly because Delhi has a drainage master plan from 1976 that does not factor in the construction boom in recent years.  AK Gosain, professor of civil engineering at IIT Delhi,who submitted a drainage master plan to Delhi government in 2017, tells Jayashree Nandi that Delhi can see a calamity anytime. Edited excerpts: First, paved area in Delhi is on the increase. The run-off from paved area is far higher than natural areas. For example, for one unit of rain, a paved area will generate 95% of run-off compared to 50% for a natural area. With a rise in paved area, we are seeing a rise in the volume of water that needs to drain. Second, in Delhi we get rain for four months; the drains are supposed to be dry for the rest of the year. But no drain is ever dry. They carry sewage instead. Third, stormwater drains need to be cleaned at least biannually or rainwater cannot flow freely.The drain was choked. It should have been de-silted. Water level kept going up, eventually washing away houses. We need to check if they were authorised. And why were they constructed on a drain?Yes there are many locations like that, which are in a depression. These cannot drain naturally. The water has to be pumped out immediately.  We have completed our job and its up to the government. The plan captures all the issues with flooding and drainage I have mentioned.If the floodplains are constricted, then the level at which water will pass through will be higher. So when there is a big flood, embankments will breach and there will be calamity. Also, if the water level in the river is high, all the drains flowing into it will be surcharged and there will be backflow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rainwater-can-t-flow-out-as-drains-choked-ak-gosain-prof-of-civil-engineering-iit-delhi/story-w9pSSsXhSr3jnFzXhJISZK.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||3 days, 7 cave-ins: Delhi’s roads fail to withstand heavy rain spells||Just three days of heavy rain in the national capital have caused cave-ins on sections of at least seven major roads in the city, further slowing traffic that was already moving at snail’s pace due to the showers and floods.Just a day after parts of roads slumped in two vital stretches in central and south Delhi —Ashoka Road and Mahipalpur bypass—another section of NH-48 leading to Mahipalpur and a portion of the service lane near the Rajouri Garden main market caved in on Thursday morning.Delhi traffic police officials said that with two portions on the Mahipalpur route affected, traffic on Thursday was severely hit. Traffic from NH-48 towards Mahipalpur bypass, which is under the jurisdiction of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), and that coming from Vasant Kunj towards the airport, on both sides of the carriageway, was diverted on the day, as a result.PWD minister Satyendar Jain did not respond to requests for comment.On Tuesday, traffic on and around Bhairon Marg came to a standstill after a section of the primary connection between central and east Delhi caved in, forcing traffic police to divert traffic. Since Tuesday, such incidents have also been reported from ITO in Central Delhi and Nawada in West Delhi. In the three days since then, Delhi has seen 122mm of rain. But why do such cave-ins take place?Senior officials of the city’s road-owning agencies — the Public Works Department (PWD), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), and the four municipalities (east, north and south Delhi municipal corporations and the New Delhi Municipal Council) said these are recurrent incidents every monsoon, and attributed cave-ins to damaged water or sewer pipelines beneath roads. Experts added that shoddy quality control during construction compounded the problem.A PWD official said a small portion of Rajouri Garden market road caved in due to sewerage leakage. “The leakage was attended to promptly and fixed. The portion is cordoned off and will be repaired soon,” the official said.Officials said there was a similar problem at Ashoka Road on Wednesday afternoon. Officials of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), under whose jurisdiction Ashoka Road is, said there was a leakage in a sewer line passing beneath the road, which led to the incident. “A small portion caved in because of a leak in the underground sewer line. Our engineering team is working to repair the sewer line and the road on priority,” NDMC spokesperson RN Singh had said Thursday.NHAI and CPWD did not respond on the details of the cave-in on Mahipalpur bypass and NH-48.Estimates from the traffic police show that over the last five years, the most complaints of roads caving in have come from central Delhi, which experts said was because most underground systems in the area were laid during British rule, and have not been replaced since. A large portion of Bhairon Marg, just a few metres away from the present cave-in, had slumped in 2016. Sections of Ashoka Road have caved in at least thrice in the last two years, official records confirmed.Sarvagya Srivastava, former engineer-in-chief of PWD, said many old utilities in Delhi such as water and sewer lines are laid beneath roads, and that whenever there is damage to these utilities, water seeps in, and the lower soil layer becomes soft.“Before constructing a road, the water or sewerage pipelines should be shifted to a multi-utility duct or underneath a footpath or to the side. But at many places in Delhi, roads are built on these utilities due to a shortage of space. So, when these utilities leak, the water makes the soil soft and after some time, with continuous load portions of the road collapse,” Srivastava said.Sewa Ram, a professor at School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said that apart from leakage in utilities, another cause for such incidents is “bad engineering” while laying roads. “If the lower layers are not compacted properly, the chances of a road cave-in increase,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-days-7-cave-ins-capital-s-roads-fail-to-withstand-heavy-rain-spells/story-FpibdCkxpmzh13wxJR1YJO.html
24-07-2020||Noida||UP journalist killed by goons complained to cops, was shot dead 2 hours later: Kin||The family of slain 35-year-old journalist, Vikram Joshi, on Thursday alleged that the suspects who shot him were roaming around Joshi’s sister’s house in Mata Colony — it was outside her house that he was shot -- about two hours before the shooting took place on the night of July 20. The family alleged that despite Joshi making several calls to the police on spotting them, the local police post in-charge put the matter off, saying he would look into it the next morning.Joshi had gone to his sister’s house to attend his niece’s birthday party. Around 10.30pm, when he and his daughters were returning home, a group of assailants, with whom he had a previous run-in, cornered him and shot him in the head. He succumbed to the gunshot wound on July 22.Also Read: Shot in front of daughters, Ghaziabad journalist dies“On the night of the shooting, the suspects, including Ravi and Chotu, were seen near our house in Mata Colony. When my uncle (Joshi) saw them, he called the local police post in-charge around 8.30pm and told him about it. But the post in-charge told him that he will look into the matter the next morning,” said Vimal Joshi, Joshi’s nephew.“Two hours later, when my uncle left the house on his two-wheeler with his daughters, the men shot him. Had the police post in-charge acted on time, my uncle would be alive today,” he added.Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, did not respond to repeated attempts to reach him for comment.Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city), said the police post in-charge was suspended soon after the incident. “All complaints raised by Joshi’s family are being looked into and an inquiry against the police post in-charge has been initiated. It is being taken up by circle officer (city 1). Anyone found guilty will not be spared,” he said.Also Read: Ghaziabad journalist shot at in front of his daughters; 9 held in the caseOn July 16, Joshi’s family and the suspects had got into a fight and later both parties approached the local police post with complaints. The family has alleged that the police did not lodge Joshi’s complaint in which he had accused the suspects of harassing his niece. An FIR on this complaint was registered only the day after Joshi was shot. The FIR names prime suspect Ravi Kumar, Shahnoor alias Chotu (who allegedly shot Joshi with a countrymade weapon) and two other unidentified men. The Ghaziabad police has so far arrested nine suspects, including Ravi Kumar and Shahnoor alias Chotu. On Thursday, Ghaziabad MP general (retired) VK Singh visited Joshi’s family at his house in Krishna Nagar Colony and handed over a cheque of Rs 10 lakh which was promised by the state government as ex-gratia. Joshi’s wife has also been promised a job by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/journalist-s-family-says-suspects-were-seen-near-house-two-hours-before-joshi-was-shot-cops-ignored-calls/story-J0dMFSNdPsYcdLdG5kQz0I.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||Revamped Chandni Chowk to be open by November: Kejriwal||The long-delayed Chandni Chowk redevelopment project, which visualises a decongested and pedestrianised heritage market along the 1.5-km road between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid, will be thrown open to the public in the first week of November, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said after inspecting the site on Thursday.The project’s aim is to have a pedestrian-friendly stretch that is devoid of the clutter caused by electrical and telephone wires in the skyline and noisy vehicles on the road. “The heart of Chandni Chowk or its main area is getting a complete makeover. It is a historical place. We will bring back the historical glory of this area by beautifying it in every way possible. This 1.5-km stretch will be a non-motorised vehicle (NMV) area from 9am to 9pm,” Kejriwal told reporters.Kejriwal hoped the area will attract tourists from across the world. “We hope the place will be opened by the first week of November. It was supposed to start in May but the process was delayed due to the coronavirus,” he said.Stating that the project has seen a cost escalation of around ₹25-30 crore, he said, “The delay owing to the pandemic has now increased the estimated total project cost to ₹90 crore.” Work on the project started in December 2018 and was scheduled to be done by March 2020. The deadline was pushed to May 31 due to an embargo imposed by the National Green Tribunal on construction to curb pollution. Covid-19, and the shortage of labour that stemmed out of the nationwide lockdown forced the authorities to further postpone it to the end of October .Garima Gupta, managing director of the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), said major works such as laying underground electricity and water lines and constructing a stormwater drain were 95% complete and trials on energising these would begin. “Now mostly superficial works are left such as covering the roads and beautifying them. A major time-consuming work that will soon begin is laying granite slabs. Granite is very delicate and often breaks if not handled carefully. Footpaths and benches have to be built and poles need to be installed with signage,” she said. Asked if the CM issued any directions, Gupta said, “Not really. The CM just wanted to take stock of the project.”Gupta said the 1.5km stretch has been divided into four parts -- 1) Red Fort to Fountain Chowk or Gurudwara Sisganj; 2) Fountain Chowk or Gurudwara Sisganj to Town Hall; 3) Town Hall to Ballimaran; 4) Ballimaran to Fatehpuri Masjid. The entire stretch will be ready by October-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/revamped-chandni-chowk-to-be-thrown-open-by-nov-kejriwal/story-XmsZit6LCiVrWDG8Ndj6RJ.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi Asha workers’ strike enters Day 4; Covid-19 services likely to be hit||Around 4,000 Asha workers, deployed at the front lines in the fight against Covid-19 in the national capital, have been on strike since Tuesday, demanding incentives and better wages. Despite the Delhi government on Thursday promising them more incentives, Asha workers said they will continue their strike till they are not paid Rs 10,000 per month as fixed salary, up from the Rs 4,000 monthly remuneration they have been paid since April. A Majority of the Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) in Delhi are currently engaged in pandemic management work, such as conducting door-to-door surveys, especially in the containment zones, putting up posters outside Covid-19 patients' homes, keeping tabs on people in home isolation and supplying medicines at their doorsteps. Usha Thakur, general secretary of Delhi Asha Workers’ Association (DAWA), said, “Most Asha workers are on covid-19 duty and are not able to do other work. Normally, every month, we managed to earn between Rs 7,000 and Rs 9,000 through incentives. Now we are being paid Rs 3,000 as core incentive and Rs 1,000 for Covid-19 duty per month. Many Ashas are sole bread-earners for their families. They are struggling to make ends meet even after working for hours,” she said. Asha workers are community health workers who work with state health missions constituted under a Union health ministry programme. Apart from the fixed Rs 3,000 as core incentive, these workers are given incentives for every health activity such as immunisation, hospital delivery, routine checks. They are mostly assigned to local government-run dispensaries. The association members on Thursday evening were invited by state health minister Satyendar Jain’s office for a dialogue. Sonu, president of DAWA, said, “We have been promised some incentives, but they have not accepted the demand of Rs 10,000 per month as fixed salary. We have decided to continue our strike until our demands are met. We will not report to work on Friday as well.”The Delhi government refused to comment on the matter. The protesting Asha workers on Thursday also wrote to MLAs and councillors of their localities, requesting them to intervene and also held protests in different areas across the city including Sagarpur, Sudarshan Park and Qutub Vihar.Kavita Yadav, state coordinator for Asha workers, All India United Traders Union Centre (AITUC), said that by Thursday around 4,000 Asha workers had joined the strike. “The government has paid Rs 5,000 as compensation to those who lost their work amid the pandemic. But, they are giving us Rs 4,000 per month even after working for 12-13 hours. Some Asha workers are not even paid the full amount of Rs 4,000,” she said.Officials at several district magistrate offices said the Covid-19 services in their districts will get affected if the strike continues. “There have been complaints from some dispensaries in my district that Asha workers are not reporting to work. Even though we have trained teachers and civil defence volunteers, there will be a staff crisis if Asha workers continue the strike. It will be difficult to continue surveillance work,” said a district magistrate, who wished not to be named.An official at the west district magistrate office said, “Asha workers have not been reported to work at several dispensaries in our district for the last three days due to which we had to deploy teachers at their place. Their incentive issue should be resolved as soon as possible to avoid any crises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-asha-workers-strike-enters-day-4-covid-19-services-likely-to-be-hit/story-dfJwFTmctM9p8rWAhC04BP.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi cabinet to meet on Tuesday, decide on lawyers for riots cases||The Delhi government will hold a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday to decide if it approves the panel of lawyers proposed by the Delhi Police for the northeast Delhi riot cases, senior officials in the home department said on Thursday. The decision to hold a cabinet meeting comes after Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal last week gave the Delhi government a week to decide on the panel of lawyers it wants to appoint to represent the state in the cases related to the riots and the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests. The L-G, in his letter to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on July 16, had said: “Since the difference of opinion still persists, I would request the chief minister to expeditiously refer the matter to the Council of Ministers under Rule 49 of TBR of GNCTD, 1992 with Section 45 (c) of the Government of NCT Act, 1991. In view of urgency and sensitivity of matter, it is requested that the decision of Cabinet be communicated expeditiously, preferably within a week.”However, the Delhi government, despite holding a Cabinet meeting this week, did not take up the matter and approved only its flagship doorstep delivery of ration scheme. “Since the time given by the L-G lapsed on Thursday, the Delhi government decided to hold the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. While the Delhi government is demanding its own panel of lawyers led by senior counsel Rahul Mehra to be tasked with the job for a free and fair trial, the L-G wants the Delhi government to approve the lawyer panel selected by the Delhi Police,” a senior official said. The L-G’s office did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-will-hold-cabinet-meeting-on-tuesday-to-decide-panel-of-lawyers-for-riots-cases/story-rCfiyK5dlV06E6lxx9HV2H.html
24-07-2020||Delhi||Showers over past 4 days lower Delhi’s rain deficit to 16%||Safdarjung, Palam and Lodhi Road stations in Delhi have already recorded 50%, 37% and 64% rain in excess for July. The monsoon deficiency (since June 1) which was 29% on July 21 reduced to 16% on Thursday, according to data with India Meteorological Department (IMD).An excess of 19% to a deficiency of 19% is considered the normal range by IMD, so Delhi is not categorised as rain-deficient anymore.Most of the rainfall which helped cover a massive monsoon deficiency of 52% (as on July 16) was recorded in the past four days between the evening of July 18 and July 22. “The heavy and moderate spells of rain received within four days helped cover the deficiency. Since July 1 though, Delhi has received rain in 20 or 21 days but it has been extremely light or trace rainfall at most,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.But now rainfall over northwest India, including Delhi, will reduce significantly with the western end of the monsoon trough moving northwards. “The monsoon trough is moving to the Himalayan foothills and the wind direction has changed to northwesterly over north-west India. Even in the hills there is no wind convergence as such. So, there will be very light rain in the hills and northern plains, if at all. Around July 26, the monsoon trough will start shifting, bringing a lot of rain to north-west India,” added Shrivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/showers-over-past-4-days-lower-delhi-s-rain-deficit-to-16/story-FFyW8Xe6LIGCQTkHopvUgK.html
24-07-2020||Gurugram||Shop owners protest demolition drive, district town planner injured||An enforcement team of the department of town and country planning (DTCP), deployed to carry out a demolition drive in Sector 108 on Thursday afternoon, faced strong resistance from property owners.According to officials, while some protesters lay on the road and did not allow the earth moving machines to operate, one tried to hit the district town planner with a tractor, who was injured during the drive.The DTCP team had gone to demolish a commercial structure allegedly built illegally in the centre of a private licensed residential colony in Sector 108. A large team of Gurugram police, led by the station house officer of the Rajendra Park station, accompanied the enforcement officials and ensured that the demolition drive was carried out after the protest, which went on for two hours.RS Bhath, district town planner, who was also the duty magistrate, said they managed to demolish 25 unauthorised shops. “Despite prior notice, the owners refused to budge and continued protesting and trying to stop our work. One of them was riding a tractor and he suddenly charged upon me. Other officials and we saved ourselves with great difficulty. But we carried out the demolition,” he said, adding that he got injured in the melee. Bhath added that the two-storey structure had 25 shops in the building and a notice was issued to the owners three months ago. “We did not receive any satisfactory reply from the owners and the action was initiated with the help of the police,” he said.Hari Om Tyagi, sarpanch of Dharmpur village, where the drive was carried out, however, said there was a minor protest at the site but there was no violence. “It is an unfortunate development and owners will have to bear losses. We will try and seek permission for regularisation. The shops belong to local villagers,” he said. Officials said all owners were allowed to remove their goods from the shops before the structures were razed. One shopkeeper, however, had goods worth Rs 25 lakh stored and he was given some time on the basis of an undertaking. “All unauthorised constructions without permission from the government will be demolished. We did not file an FIR against the protesters after they apologised and admitted that they were at fault, but in the future we will take strict action,” Bhath said.A team of 20 DTCP officials participated during the demolition drive, which began around 12.30pm and continued till 6 pm, said DTCP officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-shop-owners-protest-demolition-drive-district-town-planner-injured/story-7yvcCvj7PxhBeG59kCy40M.html

In the recording, the three-time MLA appears to be abusing the official, identified as block development officer (BDO) Sukhdev Singh. According to information, a supporter of Mann had gone to the BDO office for some property-related matter and made a phone call to the Congress leader. The supporter then allegedly handed over the phone to the BDO who enquired as to who was on the line. Mann purportedly replied, “I am Mann,” to which the BDO asked, “Who Mann.”This allegedly infuriated the Congress leader who used some expletives against the official. The BDO is then heard telling the Congress leader, “You may be Mann or a leader at home but I am a Grade-1 officer.” When contacted, Mann, who is currently the chairman of Punjab Agro Industries Corporation, accused the BDO of corruption and said he had received several complaints against the official. He also said some residents had filed a complaint against the official with the Kapurthala DC and SSP.Phagwara ADC said he has not received any complaint about the incident. The BDO could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/senior-cong-leader-abuses-bdo-over-phone-recording-goes-viral/story-XFpVX7xyg7eKxevu10AH9J.html
24-07-2020||City||Rakhi traders’ business affected due to market closure amid spike in Covid-19 cases in Ambala||Known for large-scale packaging and trade of rakhi, wholesale markets in Ambala are struggling to make ends meet due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.On an average, rakhi trade in Ambala generates a revenue of Rs 20-30 crore, which is down to nearly Rs 6-8 crore this year, traders claim. Around 10,000 people, including some self-help groups, are directly or indirectly involved in the packaging, boxing and pasting of rakhis. Due to a sudden spike in coronavirus cases in the last few weeks, a temporary closure of markets on alternate days has been imposed. Wholesale General Merchant Dealers Association president Krishan Gambhir, “Now, no customers from other states will visit Ambala. Most of them will buy rakhis from Ludhiana this season.” “Manufacturing of rakhis generally begins in March. Production was already affected due to the lockdown. However, closure of markets in Ambala has further strained matters. We’ve asked the administration to open markets at least for the rakhi season but they say they are bound because of the rising cases in the district,” Gambhir said.CHINESE RAKHIS FIND NO BUYERSOn being asked about the sale or demand for Chinese rakhis, Gambhir said, “Buyers are demanding Indian rakhis and customers, too, are asking for the same. Amid tensions with China, I expected this season to be an opportunity to ensure double-fold sale of Indian products, but everything is ruined.”Kolkata is the biggest hub of Rakhi-related raw material and manufacturing and packaging-related activities are done largely in 50-60 units in Ambala.Another popular wholesaler, Hira Lal of KD Rakhi said almost no Chinese rakhis are to be found in the market. He said sale was down by half due to the pandemic. “There is no fresh Chinese stock but there is some old stock in the market. We are getting our supply from Ahmadabad, Rajkot and Kolkata. But, due to temporary closure of markets we are only able to sell our wares three-four days a week,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rakhi-traders-business-affected-due-to-market-closure-amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases-in-ambala/story-PnmE0X9eY3NoID5CI4XeTK.html
24-07-2020||Gurugram||Covid lockdown foils kidnapper’s ransom plan, police nab three||The countrywide lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19, came as a boon for a businessman, saving him from being fleeced by his alleged kidnappers and helping police nab three suspects.The businessman was allegedly kidnapped at gun point, blind folded, assaulted and taken to Panipat by three men, who asked for a ransom of Rs 3 crore on March 5. When he expressed inability to pay, the ransom was bargained down to Rs 20 lakh, which was to be paid by the businessman at a designated location on March 20. However, the outbreak of coronavirus foiled the kidnappers’ plan, as they were unable to collect the ransom for three months due to ongoing lockdown. Last month, after the lockdown restrictions were eased, the kidnappers resurfaced and sent a typed letter in English, reminding the businessman to ‘honour the commitment’. The businessman paid a part of the ransom but after repeated threats approached the police, who arrested the trio on Thursday. According to the police, on March 5 at 9.15 pm, a city-based businessman was talking on his phone in his SUV and had reached near Narsingpur when two men forcibly got into his car. They assaulted him, tied his hands and blind folded him, as a third accused followed them in another car. They took away his three mobile phones and wallet. Police said the suspects parked the victim’s SUV in a school and took him to an abandoned factory where they held him hostage till 5.30 am the next day. Four hours later, he was taken to Panipat, where the suspects demanded Rs 3 crore ransom . Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police, crime, said, the businessman negotiated it down to Rs 20 lakh and the kidnappers asked him to arrange the money by March 20. “They dropped him off in Narela in Delhi from where he returned to his house. Meanwhile, his family had filed a missing persons complaint and when the police questioned him, he said that he had gone somewhere on his own. He was quite scared and did not mention the kidnapping,” said the ACP. Police said on March 20, the suspects did not contact the victim. “Shortly after, the lockdown was imposed. The suspects did not contact the businessman during the lockdown, fearing arrest,” said a police official, requesting anonymity.On June 19, over three months later, an unidentified man threw a letter in the businessman’s house. The letter, which was typed in English, mentioned that the businessman ‘must honour his commitment’ and come with the money to the same location at 10 am or he would be killed. Police said the businessman went to the location, where two of the suspects were waiting. He gave them Rs 10 lakh but the suspects put a gun to his waist and demanded the rest of the money. They gave him another ultimatum to come up with the money till July 21.“Over the next one month, the suspects made several threats to the victim. They sent an enclosed envelope to the businessman’s manager. The envelope had another letter addressed to his wife and daughter, in which kidnappers made more threats. On July 17, the businessman’s wife received an abusive phone call from the men and on July 20, the suspects met his manager near Anaj Mandi and threatened to kill him the following day if the money was not paid,” said the police official.Fed up with the repeated threats, the businessman went to the police on Wednesday and on Thursday, the crime branch of sector 17 arrested the three suspects. The suspects, Saurabh Singh, 35, Kulwant, 33, and Vikas, 27, were arrested and remanded to police custody for four days. Police said one of the suspects worked in an automobile company and lost his job four years ago, following which he set up a garage in Basai, which was not successful and he was under debt. So he planned this kidnapping bid with his aides for money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-lockdown-foils-kidnapper-s-ransom-plan-police-nab-three/story-zGnCmbCa2zzebhB084OSvM.html
24-07-2020||Gurugram||Signature Hospital under scanner in Covid-19 negligence case||Police on Wednesday registered a case against a private city hospital after a medical board inquiry deemed its negligence resulted in the death of a 44-year-old Covid-19 patient last month.According to the 44-year-old patient’s husband, his wife had complained of high fever on June 1, following which she was admitted to Signature Hospital in sector 37- D. On June 2, the hospital informed them that she had tested positive for the coronavirus. “Over the next few days, she had trouble breathing and her health deteriorated. So, we decided to shift her to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Jhajjar. On June 9 morning, we told the hospital that we wanted to get her discharged, and by 2.30 pm cleared all dues. The hospital authorities made us wait on the pretext of documentation and delayed the process of shifting her. At 6 pm, my wife called my son and told him over the phone that her oxygen had been removed and no doctor was providing assistance,” he said.He said they pleaded with the hospital to arrange for an ambulance immediately. “First, they said we would have to arrange an ambulance on our own. Later, they said they would provide the ambulance but they delayed it till 8 pm. Her health worsened in the ambulance. One doctor accompanied us in the ambulance but the oxygen cylinder was not full. Shortly after she was admitted to the hospital in Jhajjar, she passed away,” he said. Dr. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “The medical negligence board conducted an inquiry and gave the opinion that there was negligence on part of the doctor of the hospital who had accompanied the patient in the ambulance.”Sanjay Kumar, station house officer (SHO), sector 10 A police station, said, “A case has been registered against the Signature Hospital. We will record their statement and involve them in the investigation.”The case was registered under Indian Penal Code section 304- A (death by negligence). “This is not a case of negligence. The hospital has challenged the medical board inquiry in this case to the appellate authority. We believe that proper investigation had not been conducted and all the facts have not been considered,” said an administrator of Signature Hospital authorised to speak on their behalf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/signature-hospital-under-scanner-in-covid-negligence-case/story-LGzVV262iNQptGFwbRCByI.html
24-07-2020||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu who exited Cabinet last year writes to ex-boss. He has a complaint||Almost a month after targeting his own government over mounting debt and corruption at the Overseas Congress’ “Speak Up India” initiative, former cabinet minister and Amritsar East MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu wrote a letter to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh saying that his constituency was being ignored and all development works have come to a standstill. It is Sidhu’s first communication with the CM after the cricketer-turned politician quit the Punjab cabinet on July 15 last year after he was stripped of key portfolios. Amarinder and Sidhu had been at loggerheads since his (Sidhu’s) controversial visit to Pakistan for the swearing-in ceremony of Imran Khan where he had hugged the Pak army chief leading to a huge controversy back home.The rift was further widened during the general elections when Sidhu and his wife accused Amarinder of having had a hand in the denial of ticket to her to from either Chandigarh or Amritsar.In the letter addressed to the CM on July 16, Sidhu points out at “serious lapses” in development works in his constituency. The copy of the letter has also been marked to chief principal secretary to the CM Suresh Kumar and Amritsar deputy commissioner Shivdular Singh Dhillon.“The work on five bridges that the CM inaugurated in October 2018, costing Rs 137 crore, (two of these bridges are in Amritsar East), has been going on at snail’s pace. Even after I personally made efforts to take approvals by hand from the railway ministry, which otherwise takes years, tenders done, permissions taken and funds submitted, nothing has fructified so far,” reads the letter.“In December last year, the CM had recommended works worth Rs 5 crore under the Punjab Environmental Improvement Project (Phase-1) for Amritsar East. But nothing has been done so far,” Sidhu said in the letter. The MLA further says that the CM had allotted Rs 24 crore under Punjab Environmental Improvement Project (Phase-2) in June this year and “I had submitted details and specifications for Rs 11 crore worth development works under the aforesaid scheme. But the MC has sent me details for the projects worth Rs 7 crore to be recommended for future development of my constituency”. Sidhu, who is keeping distance from the media for several months, was not available for comments regarding the letter.The letter further reads that the Amritsar Improvement Trust had sanctioned Rs 13 crore for his constituency, but the “works have been stalled”. “It is unfortunate but true that nothing has moved in my constituency since I resigned. Patiently waiting for over a year for these works to start. Repeatedly enquiring from the deputy commissioner and various departments, but these works exist only on papers,” the letter concludes. Officials who don’t want to be named said the DC has forwarded a copy of the letter to the municipal corporation and the improvement trust authorities and has sought a status report of these projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sidhu-shoots-off-letter-to-capt-says-his-segment-being-ignored/story-zsgTr6UNU5nOQUm072E1QO.html
24-07-2020||Pune||No artificial ponds for Ganpati immersion this year, PMC announces||In order to prevent crowding due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided not to build artificial tanks for Ganpati immersions this year.Instead, the civic body has appealed citizens to go for eco-friendly idols and immerse them at home.The decision was taken by PMC during a meeting chaired by mayor Murlidhar Mohol on Wednesday where other PMC officials were also present. Around 2.5 lakh Ganpati idols were immersed last year in artificial tanks built by civic body as part of its eco-friendly drive.Dynaneshwar Molak, department head of solid waste management said, “The artificial ponds will remain closed as we do not want people to violate the norms of social distancing which can lead to the spread of infection. We are focusing more on promoting the use of ammonium bicarbonate powder. PMC will provide a free ammonium bicarbonate powder packet of two kilograms to everyone who will be purchasing the Ganesh idols. We just hope this decision would not make people perform Ganesh Visarjan in the rivers of Pune violating the rules for the sake of devotion.”This year, the 10-day Ganesh festival will be celebrated from August 22 to September 1. In view of the Covid pandemic, the government has already appealed mandals to not celebrate the festival in a big way. During the meeting, PMC officials also decided to not issue fresh passes for mandals this year and instead mandals can use last year’s passes for erecting a mandap.Sachin Punekar, an environmentalist, stated, “I think, this is a great decision for the environment as well as for the safety of the citizens of Pune. The artificial tanks can also be installed at a society level. If PMC successfully promotes this initiative of visarjan at home then I believe that citizens of Pune would not violate the government guidelines as they have followed the previous guidelines effectively.” Varsha Mandke, a resident of Warje said, “We enjoy the Ganesh visarjan at home as it saves the environment and helps blossoms my plants in the balcony. I got the ammonium bicarbonate powder for free along with the Ganesh Idol last year and the experiment was successful. I choose to stay home and stay safe in the Covid-19 crises and I would not perform visarjan in an artificial pond even if there is an option for it.”Saket Ambardekar, a resident of Sahakar Nagar said, “I am not even sure whether this year we are going to bring a Ganesh Idol at home. Instead, we might worship the existing metallic idol which we have in our house. It also becomes easier to perform visarjan at home without using the ammonium bicarbonate powder. I believe it is a safer and smarter option at this crucial time where everyone is struggling to stay safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-artificial-ponds-for-ganpati-immersion-this-year-pmc-announces/story-TuRbX7o8dV5CSUNvDt2CaN.html

However, they did not have any oxygen beds and so, from 11am to 8:30pm we tried several hospitals, but no one accepted the patient. Finally, we had to get police intervention to ensure the patient got a bed at Kasturba hospital in Vishrantwadi.”Pujari alleged that the PMC dashboard showed an empty bed at a particular hospital, but the doctors informed that it was reserved for emergency patients.“The family is in a complete state of shock,” Pujari added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-search-of-ventilator-bed-34-year-old-covid-positive-paani-puri-vendor-dies-in-hospital/story-r8O1rMrZsDkoGSNd69WfgM.html

24-07-2020||World||Iran slams interception by US jet over Syria as ‘illegal’||Iranian officials on Friday slammed the interception of an Iranian passenger plane by a US fighter jet in the skies over Syria as “illegal,” threatening action against Washington over the incident.Iran had said that one of its airliners, flying from Tehran to Beirut on Thursday, was “harassed” by fighter jets, but later landed safely in Lebanon. A U.S. official confirmed a U.S. jet had passed by the Iranian airliner, but at a safe distance.According to Iranian state TV, two fighter jets came within a distance of 100 meters (328 feet) of the Iranian Airbus A310. The pilot of Mahan Air Flight 1152 quickly took the aircraft to a lower altitude to avoid a collision, the report said. The sharp maneuver caused slight injuries among some of the passengers.However, U.S. Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a Central Command spokesman, told The Associated Press that a U.S. F-15 fighter jet “conducted a standard visual inspection” of the Iranian plane “at a safe distance of approximately 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) from the airliner.”He said the inspection was meant to ensure the safety of U.S. coalition troops in al-Tanf in Syria as the plane was flying over that area. He said once the aircraft was identified as a passenger plane, “the F-15 safely opened distance from the aircraft.”Aircraft at that altitude are to maintain a distance of at least 600 meters (2,000 feet) to ensure they don’t hit each other, though planes traveling that close can encounter wake turbulence.Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said Friday that what happened was an act of “lawlessness upon lawlessness.”Zarif tweeted: “U.S. illegally occupies territory of another State and then harasses a scheduled civil airliner—endangering innocent civilian passengers—ostensibly to protect its occupation forces.”Iran’s Transportation Minister Mohammad Eslami described the incident as a “terrorist act” and said Tehran would complain to the International Civil Aviation Organization. “We expect this to lead to condemnation of the terrorist act by the U.S. government,” Eslami said.The ICAO said Friday it had not yet received a complaint from Iran.Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group echoed Elsmai and said the close encounter could have had “incalculable ramifications” across the region. The Iran-backed group, which has militiamen fighting in Syria on the side of President Bashar Assad’s forces, called the U.S. an occupier of Syrian skies and territories.The interception comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S. after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers over two years ago.In the time since, there have been several incidents across the Mideast between the two countries, including the U.S. airstrike that killed an Iranian general in Baghdad and Tehran launching ballistic missiles that targeted American forces in Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-slams-interception-by-us-jet-over-syria-as-illegal/story-PwPln2xC2i6UOdQ8HOqvuJ.html
24-07-2020||World||Donald Trump reverses his stance, says schools in hotspots should delay reopening||President Donald Trump on Thursday stepped back from his insistence on the reopening of schools and said those in Covid-19 hotspots could remain closed longer.Continuing his retreat from unconditional reopening generally, the president also announced the cancellation of Republican convention in Florida, one of states his the hardest by the second surge in Covid-19 cases.Trump has reversed himself on an increasing number of positions he had taken earlier to get the country back on the rails irrespective of the ferocity of the epidemic that is raging through the south and the west. He has embraced the use of masks, acknowledged the epidemic “will get worse before it gets better”.“In cities or states that are current hotspots,” Trump told reporters at the daily coronavirus that he resumed earlier this week after a gap of three months, “districts may need to delay reopening (of schools) for a few weeks, and that’s possible.”The president had earlier threatened to cut federal funds for schools that refused to reopen. And had alleged that were being kept closed for political reasons.Trump had been pushing for the return of normalcy, lifting of restriction, reopening of businesses, schools and colleges with an eye on elections in November, when he will seek a second term. Then came the a slew of polls showing him falling way behind his presumptive Democratic rival, Joe Biden, even in swing states that he had won in 2016. “It’s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP Convention,” Trump said, replaying a conversation he had with his campaign team earlier in the day.Some parts of the event will move back to Charlottesville in North Carolina, the original venue which he had abandoned for Florida when local officials had refused to yield to his demands for an in-person convention with all the attendant pomp and pageantry and without social-distancing norms.Florida is among the souther and western states hit the hardest by a second surge of Covid-19 cases and fatalities. It has reinstated many of the restrictions and officials have publicly expressed concerns about the convention and their ability to ensure the and it has slapped back restrictions Biden cancelled his Milwaukee convention weeks ago, turning it into a largely on-line event.

24-07-2020||World||Amid new Covid-19 cases, masks becoming mandatory in Europe||New rules on wearing masks in England came into effect Friday, with people going to shops, banks and supermarkets now required to wear face coverings. The move came a day after Belgium imposed its own mask requirement to slow increasing coronavirus infections.Those in England can be fined as much as 100 pounds ($127) by police if they refuse. The British government had given mixed signals for weeks before deciding on the policy. Venues like restaurants, pubs, gyms and hairdressers are exempt.John Apter, the national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, says officers will be available as a last resort but that he hopes the public “will continue to do the right thing” to protect other citizens.In Belgium, health authorities said a three-year old girl has died after testing positive for COVID-19 as new infections surged 89% from the previous week.On Thursday, Belgian authorities beefed up restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus, including making masks mandatory in crowded outdoor public spaces. A country of 11.5 million, Belgium has been hard hit by the pandemic with 64,847 cases and 9,812 deaths recorded so far.In Italy, the number of daily new infections reported Thursday jumped to over 300, the first time they had surpassed more than 300 since mid-June. Most of the new cases have occurred in northern Italy, where the outbreak in Europe began in February. But southern regions, relatively spared from the worst of the pandemic, have lately been seeing clusters of infections.Many recent cases have been traced to people returning from abroad, most of them foreign workers from Asia, Eastern Europe or the Balkans. Other clusters were among migrants rescued at sea and southern Italy.But there have also been clusters sparked among vacationers, including in Riccione, a beach resort town on the Adriatic Sea, linked to a young woman’s contacts in a disco.Last week, the mayor of Capri, one of the two main towns on the tourist-mecca island in the Mediterranean off Naples, ordered people to wear masks while walking in the streets. Capri’s main square, with its trendy cafes, and its narrow streets lined with luxury fashion shops, had been jammed with holiday-goers, many of them not wearing masks.Three young Romans who returned home this week after a holiday were positive for Covid-19, Italian media said Friday.In Italy, masks must be worn in shops, banks, churches, on public transport and in all places where it’s impossible to keep a safe distance apart, including outdoors.Amid fears in Spain that poor living conditions for seasonal agricultural workers are creating coronavirus hotspots, that nation’s farm minister on Friday said authorities are pressing employers to provide decent accommodations and transport. Spain’s Health Ministry reported 971 new infections on Thursday in the last 24 hours, the biggest daily increase in the country since lockdown ended.Some clusters in Europe have been linked to workplaces, including at a slaughterhouse in Germany. The company that runs the slaughterhouse that was at the center of a major outbreak last month said 30 more employees have tested positive for the coronavirus -- but most of them were old cases.Authorities have linked more than 2,000 cases to the outbreak at the Toennies slaughterhouse in the western German town of Rheda-Wiedenbrueck, which led last month to a partial lockdown of the surrounding area. Those restrictions have since been lifted and the facility has reopened after a four-week closure.And as scientists around the world search for a vaccine to halt the pandemic, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has dismissed activists seeking to oppose vaccinations as “nuts.”Johnson was promoting a campaign for flu vaccinations ahead of winter. Britain has Europe’s worst recorded pandemic toll at over 45,600 deaths.Overall, Europe has seen over 201,000 deaths in the pandemic, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the true toll of the pandemic worldwide is much higher than all reported numbers, due to limited testing and other issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-new-covid-19-cases-masks-becoming-mandatory-in-europe/story-9EqB5HSXbkAIucxAjnLleN.html
24-07-2020||World||Positive progress made by soldiers to disengage, says China after border talks||Positive progress has been made by the border troops of both India and China to disengage and ease the situation on the ground, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Friday at the end of the latest round of diplomatic talks between the two countries.The talks focused on both New Delhi and Beijing aiming at further “cooling” the situation at the border, China said.“The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on the recent Sino-Indian border situation and fully affirmed the positive progress made by the front-line border defence forces of the two countries to disengage from contact and ease the situation on the ground,” the foreign ministry said in a statement released Friday evening.The statement was referring to the 17th meeting of the India-China Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs held online between senior diplomats from the two countries on Friday.New Delhi and Beijing are closely monitoring each other’s disengagement process and levels of withdrawal as both countries cautiously attempt to resolve the latest – and the worst in decades – crisis in bilateral ties.China is yet to reveal the PLA’s casualty figures but the Indian army lost 20 soldiers in a violent brawl between the border troops of the two countries on the night of June 15. Both sides have amassed large numbers of well-armed troops on their side.Friday’s statement from China said both sides “…emphasised that they will maintain bilateral military and diplomatic dialogues and consultations in accordance with the important consensus reached by the two foreign ministers and special representatives on border issues, properly handle remaining issues on the ground, and promote further cooling of the border situation.”The statement, issued in Mandarin, added that New Delhi and Beijing will continue to hold both diplomatic and military talks to calm the situation along the line of actual control (LAC).“The two sides agreed that they will continue to hold meetings on the China-India border affairs consultation and coordination mechanism and the commander-level meeting of the border defence forces of the two countries to strengthen the building of confidence in the border area and jointly maintain peace and tranquility in the border area,” the statement said.The WMCC meeting was co-chaired by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and director general Hong Liang of the boundary and oceanic affairs department of China’s foreign ministry.Ahead of Friday’s talks, external affairs ministry spokesperson, Anurag Srivastava had spoken in New Delhi about the importance of maintaining peace along the LAC.“As we have stated earlier, the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is the basis of our bilateral relationship. Therefore, it is our expectation that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas at the earliest as agreed to by the special representatives,” Srivastava said a day earlier.Friday’s bilateral diplomatic interaction was the fourth round of WMCC talks between the two countries since the current tension at the LAC, which started in May – indicating the complex nature of the ongoing negotiations between the two neighbours.The two sides have had four rounds of commander-level military talks as well.Crucially, separate phone conversations have also been held between external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, national security adviser AK Doval with China’s Wang Yi, who has multiple designations including state councilor, foreign minister and China’s special representative for border talks with India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/positive-progress-made-by-soldiers-to-disengage-says-china-after-border-talks/story-bkqR44NqhvZ1s1iuo0vwfO.html

The other two sectors are chemicals and services.India’s experience with existing FTAs with various countries has been mixed. The UK’s eagerness for the FTA with India has been met with a wait-and-watch approach in New Delhi, where a review of all FTAs is envisaged by Goyal to protect the interests of Indian industry and traders.In the long-stalled EU-India free trade talks, easier mobility of Indian professionals (the so-called Mode 4) is one of the key areas New Delhi has been insisting on. Brussels believes there will be better chances of reaching the agreement with India after Britain leaves the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-uk-set-stage-for-post-brexit-free-trade-pact/story-Jhxb06pVgcEheTzADZLNOL.html
24-07-2020||World||When a Premier League club was targeted by hackers, almost lost £1 million||A cyber-security wing of the British intelligence agency GCHQ has revealed that the UK’s sports sector has become a ‘high-value target’ for cyber criminals, who, in one instance, almost walked away with nearly £1 million during a Premier League transfer season.The National Cyber Security Centre has revealed that sports organisations experience more cyber attacks than companies. Its first such review concludes that nearly 30% of the incidents caused financial damage, averaging £10,000 each time; the biggest single loss was over £4 million.During the transfer negotiation with an overseas football team, the centre said the email address of the managing director of the club was hacked by cyber criminals. Only a late intervention from the bank prevented the club losing almost £1 million.The centre’s report focussing on the sports sector, titled ‘Cyber Threat to Sports Organisations’, says that in another instance, an employee at an organisation which holds athlete performance data had email address compromised, allowing hackers access to sensitive information over several months.The report does not identify the geographical location or source of the cyber attacks.An English Football League club also suffered a significant ransomware attack which crippled their corporate and security systems. As a result of the attack, the CCTV and turnstiles at the ground were unable to operate, almost leading to a fixture cancellation.The centre said that a member of staff at a UK racecourse identified an item of grounds keeping equipment for sale on eBay, and agreed to a price of £15,000. The sale turned out to be fraudulent – a spoofed version of eBay had been created.The centre identified three common tactics used by criminals to assault the sector on a daily basis. These are: business email compromise, cyber-enabled fraud, and ransomware being used to shut down critical event systems and stadiums. Paul Chichester of the NCSC said: ““While cyber security might not be an obvious consideration for the sports sector as it thinks about its return, our findings show the impact of cyber criminals cashing in on this industry is very real”.Hugh Robertson, chair of the British Olympic Association, added: “Improving cyber security across the sports sector is critical. The British Olympic Association sees this report as a crucial first step, helping sports organisations to better understand the threat and highlighting practical steps that organisation should take to improve cyber security practices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-a-premier-league-club-was-targeted-by-hackers-almost-lost-1-million/story-VZQ4HBJhJUsiKJw8CS1Y3J.html
24-07-2020||World||Chinese Covid-19 vaccine candidate shows promise in animal tests||Animal tests of a potential Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Chinese researchers show it triggers an immune response against the novel coronavirus, offering some promise as it goes into early-stage human trials, according to a peer-reviewed study.ARCoV is a messenger RNA vaccine which uses technology similar to candidates being developed by Moderna and BioNtech and Pfizer. It is the second potential Covid-19 vaccine that China’s military-backed research unit has moved into clinical trials.Results of trials of ARCoV in mice and monkeys, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Cell on Thursday, show both single and two-dose inoculations induced strong antibody and T-cell responses against several Covid-19-causing virus strains. However, researchers conducting the trial cautioned they were not yet able to see how long the ARCoV-induced antibodies might last or how strong their protection might be to other strains that cause Covid-19 but were not tested in the study.ARCoV is stable at 25°C (77°F) for at least a week, researchers said, which could make it more attractive for potential immunisation campaigns in hard-to-reach populations in places where cold-chain storage and transportation are not always reliable.While no Covid-19 vaccine has been approved for sale yet, more than 150 are in development globally with an aim to help end the global pandemic that has claimed over 600,000 lives. But whether any will succeed remains far from clear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-shows-promise-in-animal-tests/story-vmCzaKQFh5FeX37j0PaJPN.html

And I think by the middle of next year we will be well on the way past it,” he told reporters.Speaking a year since he became prime minister, Johnson said his experience was that government needed “to move faster and be more responsive to the needs of the people.”He mentioned that people were unable to get their passports in time and a backlog of court cases.“Sometimes government can be slow,” Johnson told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-will-be-past-coronavirus-by-mid-2021-uk-pm-johnson/story-5Lc2teORkDzgGBQfJJELPI.html
24-07-2020||World||Thousands gather around Hagia Sophia for first Friday prayers||Thousands of Turks gathered near Hagia Sophia early on Friday for the first prayers there since President Tayyip Erdogan declared the monument, revered by Christians and Muslims for almost 1,500 years, a mosque once again.Crowds formed at checkpoints surrounding the historic heart of Istanbul, where thousands of police maintained security. On entering the secured area the worshippers, wearing face masks, sat spaced out on prayer mats in the city’s Sultanahmet Square.“We are ending our 86 years of longing today,” said one man Sait Colak, referring to the nearly nine decades since Hagia Sophia was declared a museum and ceased to be a place of worship. “Thanks to our president and the court decision today we are going to have our Friday prayers in Hagia Sophia.”A top Turkish court announced this month it annulled Hagia Sophia’s status as a museum. Erdogan immediately turned back into a mosque a building which was a Christian Byzantine cathedral for 900 years before being seized by Ottoman conquerors and serving as a mosque until 1934.The president was scheduled to attend Friday prayers shortly after 1 pm (1000 GMT) along with several hundred invitees for the ceremony in the sixth-century building.During his 17-year rule, Erdogan has championed Islam and religious observance and backed efforts to restore Hagia Sophia’s mosque status. He said Muslims should be able to pray there again and raised the issue - popular with many pious AKP-voting Turks - during local elections last year.The conversion triggered fierce criticism from church leaders, who said the conversion to exclusively Muslim worship risked deepening religious divisions. Turkey says the site will remain open for visitors and its Christian artworks protected.Erdogan has reshaped Turkey’s modern republic, established nearly a century ago by the staunchly secularist Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, lifting a ban on Muslim headscarves in public, promoting religious education and taming Turkey’s powerful military, once a bastion of Ataturk’s secular values.Inside Hagia Sophia, the Christian frescoes and the glittering mosaics adorning the cavernous dome and central hall will be concealed by curtains during Muslim prayer times, but remain on display for the rest of the time.On Friday morning, the interior echoed to the sound of Koranic recitations from white-robed clerics, sat on blue carpets freshly laid this week ahead of the prayers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-gather-around-hagia-sophia-for-first-friday-prayers/story-DHVSKwcZtxW65Ae2XIuurO.html

24-07-2020||World||Critic of President Xi Jinping expelled from Communist Party||The ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) has expelled a real estate tycoon and an outspoken critic of President Xi Jinping for violating party discipline in what is being seen as a message to the business elite to toe the party line.A court statement released late on Thursday announced the expulsion of Ren Zhiqiang from the party for “seriously” violating the “party’s political, organisational, integrity, work and life disciplines”.Ren, 69, was also accused of “corruption, bribe-taking and misappropriation of public funds” including buying “golf membership cards”.The expulsion was announced by the District Supervisory Committee, Xicheng District Commission for Discipline Inspection, Beijing.Ren, former chairperson of Huayuan Properties, a real estate development company, was detained in March for criticising President Xi’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Ren had a massive following on China’s social media and was known as “cannon” for his outspoken and controversial views.In early 2016, Ren was banned from Chinese social media after he criticised a much-publicised Xi speech on how the media should serve the CPC.According to Chinese state media, Ren also suggested controversial ideas like the “...poor young migrant workers who cannot afford apartments in cities should return to the countryside.”Ren was detained in March after his critique of Xi’s response to the coronavirus outbreak was published.In the essay, he called Xi a “clown” and raised several questions about the sequence of events leading to and in the aftermath of the outbreak.“The reality shown by this epidemic is that the party defends its own interests, the government officials defend their own interests, and the monarch only defends the status and interests of the core. Precisely this type of system is capable of a situation where only the ruler’s order is obeyed with no regard for the people,” Ren wrote in the essay attributed to him and translated in English by China Digital Times.The expulsion order was passed a day after Xi chaired a symposium with entrepreneurs where he, according to official media, said: “A cordial and upright relationship between government and business should be fostered”.Ren’s expulsion comes within weeks of Xu Zhangrun, 58, a law professor at Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University who had criticised Xi’s style of functioning and questioned the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic was taken away by the police.Xu published an essay in February blaming the culture of censorship under Xi for the spread of the coronavirus in China, which first appeared in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.In the essay, which appeared on overseas websites, Xu wrote China’s “leader system is itself destroying the structure of governance”, adding that the chaos in the first virus epicentre of Hubei province reflected systemic problems in the Chinese state.Xu was released about a week later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/critic-of-president-xi-jinping-expelled-from-communist-party/story-t6Br0NgOMrfTkvYFrX6s6H.html
24-07-2020||World||From appreciating efforts to declaring a tyrant: How Covid hit US-China ties||The United States had its first Covid-19 case on January 21.“China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus,” President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter three days later, taking an indulgent view of Beijing’s alleged culpability. “The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American people, I want to thank President Xi.”Six months later, on Thursday, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, was declared a tyrant by Trump’s top diplomat Mike Pompeo.There have been more than four million Covid-19 cases in the United States, and over 144,000 fatalities. SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), may be the “China virus” or the “Wuhan virus”, as Trump and his aides have sought to portray it to shift blame, but it is an American problem, more than anything else.And one that could rob President Trump of a second term.Polls have been brutal on Trump’s handling of the epidemic. Joe Biden, the former vice-president and the presumptive Democratic nominee, leads the President by nearly nine points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Trump is also trailing Biden in the swing states that gave him the presidency in 2016.Trump is trailing Biden in more than just the polls.He is in such a desperately bad situation politically that he been forced to walk back his earlier attempts to downplay the epidemic. Trump has had to embrace masks (or any facial covering) after mocking Biden for wearing them; and cancel the Republican convention that he had wanted so badly to showcase his first term. He will accept the nomination virtually, it seems, following Biden’s lead.Also read: US abandons China appeasement policy, outsources hostilitiesHis frustration with China has grown exponentially at the same time. He has attacked Beijing for letting the virus escape its borders. “So it’s a shame that it happened. It shouldn’t have happened. China should have stopped it,” he said Thursday, re-litigating his case against China.Trump ran his 2016 campaign for the White House on the promise of ending China’s rogue behaviour on trade, including currency manipulation. He set into motion a series of measures soon after coming into office that led to a full-fledged trade war between the world’s two largest economies shortly.He pursued a trade deal even though it had become clear that China was not interested in conceding the main American asks, such as ending forced transfer of technology. He won a limited Phase 1 deal, but never got to the larger agreement that he had wanted to claim complete victory.It is no longer a priority. “The trade deal means less to me now than it did when I made it,” Trump told reporters Thursday.Trade ceded centre stage to Covid-19 as the main China issue when infections and fatalities began shooting around March. New York city and state soon replaced China’s Wuhan and Hubei province as the new epicentres of the raging pandemic, and Trump was left defending his shoddy handling of his administration’s first major crisis.Also read: WHO chief says comments questioning his independence ‘untrue and unacceptable’Trump and his aides sought to deflect blame by putting it all on China, and soon US-China relations were in a precipitous downward spiral. This led to slew of sanctions, visa restrictions; and harsh remarks over the mistreatment of Uighur Muslims, restrictions in Hong Kong, and aggressive military postures in hot spots such as the South China Sea, and the disputed areas along its borders with India and Bhutan.Earlier this week, the Trump administration ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, alleging it was being used as an intelligence-gathering hub. On Friday, China notified the US that it’s revoking the operating permit for the US consulate in Chengdu, according to a statement from Chinese foreign ministry.On Thursday, secretary of state Pompeo signalled the end of the decades-old US policy of engaging China with the hope of changing it and its behaviour.“The old paradigm of blind engagement with China has failed,” Pompeo said in a widely anticipated policy speech at a legacy California library run by the foundation of late President Richard Nixon, who re-established diplomatic ties with China and paved the way for its opening with a historic visit in 1972. “If the free world doesn’t change Communist China — [it] will surely change us,” Pompeo added, setting up his call for an international alliance of “like-minded” nations.There is a need for “a new grouping of like-minded nations -- a new alliance of democracies”, Pompeo said, without specifying which nations.In a question-answer session following the speech, the secretary of state said these nations will have the backing of the US for sure. When asked if he was urging nations to pick between the US and China, in line with a choice the US presented to the world in the 1940s between itself and the USSR, Pompeo said the choice for them was between “freedom and tyranny”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-appreciating-efforts-to-declaring-a-tyrant-how-covid-hit-us-china-ties/story-H7UxMOsljGyqDt7gisNYhO.html

The US move seriously breached international law, the basic norms of international relations, and the terms of the China-US Consular Convention. It gravely harmed China-US relations,” the statement added.Speaking at the regular Chinese foreign ministry briefing, spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that some personnel from the US consulate in Chengdu had “…engaged in activities inconsistent with their identities.”“China has made representations and the US side is fully aware of them,” he said.Wang added that China had made specific requirements for the US embassy to cease all operations and events by the mission in Chengdu.“Diplomacy is reciprocal,” Wang said.“The measure taken by China is a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified act by the US. It conforms with international law, the basic norms of international relations, and customary diplomatic practices,” the Chinese foreign ministry statement had said in the morning.“It conforms with international law, the basic norms of international relations, and customary diplomatic practices.”The statement added: “The current situation in China-US relations is not what China desires to see, and the US is responsible for all this. We once again urge the US to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.”On Wednesday, Beijing had called the US’s decision to close the Chinese consulate in Houston an “unprecedented escalation” in Washington’s recent actions against China and warned of “legitimate and necessary” response against the decision.The tit-for-tat closing of consulates is sure to further sour the rapidly deteriorating bilateral ties with the two countries already at loggerheads over South China Sea disputes, the Hong Kong security bill, US arms-sales to Taiwan, the condition of minorities in Xinjiang, and the origin of the coronavirus besides an ongoing trade war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-tit-for-tat-action-china-orders-closure-of-us-consulate-in-chengdu-after-its-houston-consulate-is-shut-down/story-NGK6U6NzRz8ahNffJ5oibM.html
24-07-2020||World||More than 1,000 people at Twitter had ability to aid hack of accounts: Report||More than a thousand Twitter employees and contractors as of earlier this year had access to internal tools that could change user account settings and hand control to others, two former employees said, making it hard to defend against the hacking that occurred last week.Twitter Inc and the FBI are investigating the breach that allowed hackers to repeatedly tweet from verified accounts of the likes of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg.Twitter said on Saturday that the perpetrators “manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials” to log into tools and turn over access to 45 accounts. https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html On Wednesday, it said that the hackers could have read direct messages to and from 36 accounts but did not identify the affected users. The former employees familiar with Twitter security practices said that too many people could have done the same thing, more than 1,000 as of earlier in 2020, including some at contractors like Cognizant.Twitter declined to comment on that figure and would not say whether the number declined before the hack or since. The company was looking for a new security head, working to better secure its systems and training employees on resisting tricks from outsiders, Twitter said. Cognizant did not respond to a request for comment.“That sounds like there are too many people with access,” said Edward Amoroso, former chief security officer at AT&T. Responsibilities among the staff should have been split up, with access rights limited to those responsibilities and more than one person required to agree to make the most sensitive account changes. “In order to do cyber security right, you can’t forget the boring stuff.”Threats from insiders, especially lower-paid outside support staff, are a constant worry for companies serving large numbers of users, cyber security experts said. They said that the greater the number of people who can change key settings, the stronger oversight must be.StumblesThe former employees said that Twitter had gotten better about logging the activity of its people in the wake of previous stumbles, including searches of records by an employee accused last November of spying for the government of Saudi Arabia.But while logging helps with investigations, only alarms or constant reviews can turn logs into something that can prevent breaches.Former Cisco Systems Chief Security Officer John Stewart said companies with broad access need to adopt a long series of mitigations and “ultimately ensuring that the most powerful authorized people are only doing what they are supposed to be doing.”Who exactly pulled off the hacking spree isn’t clear, but outside researchers such as Allison Nixon of Unit 221B say the incident appears linked to a cluster of cybercriminals who regularly traded in novelty handles – especially rare one-or-two character account names – that are treated a bit like the vanity license plates of the online world.Although the public evidence tying the hacking to those was circumstantial, ultra-short Twitter handles were among the first to be hijacked.In addition, the forums where those hackers were active have long been replete with boasts about having access to Twitter insiders, according to Nixon and Nick Bax, an analyst with StopSIMCrime, a group that lobbies for greater protection against “SIM swapping” – a phone number hijacking technique often used by these kinds of hackers.Bax said he had seen reference on forums to “Twitter plugs” or “Twitter reps” – the terms used to describe cooperative Twitter employees – since as far back as 2017.The potential involvement of low-level cybercriminals has particularly alarmed professionals because of the implication that a hostile government might be able to cause even greater havoc.Access to accounts for national leaders was limited to a much smaller number of people after a rogue employee briefly deleted President Donald Trump’s account two years ago. That could explain why Biden’s account was hijacked but not Trump’s.Twitter should expand the number of protected accounts, said former Twitter security engineer John Adams. Among other things, accounts with more than 10,000 followers should at least need two people to change key settings.Security experts said they were worried that Twitter has too much work to do and too little time before the campaign for the Nov. 3 U.S. election intensifies, with potential inference domestically and from other countries.Said Ron Gula, a cybersecurity investor who co-founded network security company Tenable, “The question really is: Does Twitter do enough to prevent account takeovers for our presidential candidates and news outlets when faced with sophisticated threats that leverage whole-of-nation approaches?”On a call to discuss company earnings on Thursday, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey acknowledged past missteps.“We fell behind, both in our protections against social engineering of our employees and restrictions on our internal tools,” Dorsey told investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-1-000-people-at-twitter-had-ability-to-aid-hack-of-accounts-report/story-PBgx6zmrABYwiPy1lD19jI.html
24-07-2020||World||Israel anti-govt protests: Police use water cannons to disperse protesters||Israeli police used water cannons to disperse protesters in central Jerusalem and arrested at least 55 of them as clashes broke out overnight after thousands staged a protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Israelis have held a series of demonstrations in recent weeks calling on Netanyahu to resign, citing his trial on corruption charges and his fractious unity government’s poor handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The protest near the prime minister’s residence began around sundown on Thursday and was initially largely peaceful. A smaller counterprotest in support of Netanyahu was held nearby, with the two camps separated by metal barricades and a large police presence.Police say they moved in to disperse the protesters when they tried to stage a procession through the city. Police scuffled with demonstrators before four large trucks roared into action, spraying water cannons back and forth, scattering the protesters.At times, it appeared the trucks were spraying protesters from behind as they tried to leave the area peacefully.Israel imposed a general lockdown when the first coronavirus cases appeared in March and by May had largely succeeded in containing the outbreak. But then it moved quickly to lift virtually all restrictions, and in the following weeks cases surged.The country has reported a total of more than 57,000 cases and at least 442 deaths. More than 24,000 patients have recovered.A unity government formed in May following three inconclusive elections in less than a year was supposed to prioritize the pandemic. Instead, it has been plagued by infighting and unable to agree on clear policies to combat the pandemic.Netanyahu meanwhile faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust over a series of long-running corruption investigations. Critics say he is more focused on escaping legal accountability than on containing the pandemic. Many have speculated he intends to call yet another election, allegations he dismissed as “absurd” in a Thursday press conference.At the same conference, held as the protests were underway, he called on demonstrators not to clash with police, saying it would “lead to anarchy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-anti-govt-protests-police-use-water-cannons-to-disperse-protesters/story-rTnFc34vejyQMZIkMukjpK.html
24-07-2020||World||WHO chief says comments questioning his independence ‘untrue and unacceptable’||The head of the World Health Organization said on Thursday that reported comments by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo questioning his independence were untrue and would not distract the organisation from its work in fighting the coronavirus.Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has come under criticism, especially from US President Donald Trump and Pompeo, who have accused him of being pro-China.“And the comments are untrue and unacceptable and without any foundation, for that matter,” Tedros said in response to a question at a Geneva briefing about remarks by Pompeo reported in London on Tuesday, questioning his independence.“Our sole focus - and the focus of the entire organisation - is on saving lives... And WHO will not be distracted by these comments. We don’t want the international community also to be distracted.”A WHO advance team has been in China for nearly two weeks, organising a WHO-led international mission to investigate the origins of the virus. Scientists believe it emerged in a food market in the central city of Wuhan late last year.“We are already beginning to reach out to experts at the international level to see who will be available and most appropriate to be able to support an international mission in the coming weeks,” Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergencies expert, said.Tedros said the WHO was seeing intense transmission of the coronavirus in relatively few countries.“Two-thirds of all cases are from 10 countries. Almost half of all cases reported so far are from just three countries,” he said, referring to the United States, Brazil and India.Worldwide more than 15 million cases have been reported and nearly 620,000 deaths, he said.Recorded US coronavirus infections exceeded 4 million on Thursday, with more than 2,600 new ones every hour on average, the highest rate in the world, according to a Reuters tally.Infections in the United States have rapidly accelerated since the first Covid-19 case was detected on Jan. 21. It took the country 98 days to reach 1 million cases. It took another 43 days to reach 2 million and then 27 days to reach 3 million.It has only taken 16 days to reach 4 million at a rate of 43 new cases a minute.Tedros also said that just because cases may be at a low level where someone lives, it doesn’t mean they should let down their guard.“Know your situation - do you know how many cases were reported where you live yesterday? Do you know how to find that information? Do you know how to minimise your exposure?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-says-comments-questioning-his-independence-untrue-and-unacceptable/story-ZMpCDkZe8JuSOcavfQvdML.html

Hundreds have been displaced as landslides have swept away their homes. They ended up taking refuge in local schools and community centers.Nepal’s Meteorological Forecasting Division earlier last week had predicted heavy downpour across the country. The Division had warned of monsoon winds being near the low-pressure line in the Terai belt, which would consequently cause more rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-due-to-floods-in-nepal-reaches-132/story-7npL0JEVuHFpZKi2Ogs52N.html
24-07-2020||World||Tropical storm Hanna forms; Gonzalo strength remains steady||A gulf depression strengthened into a tropical storm late Thursday, triggering watches and warnings along the southern coast of the continental United States. Tropical Storm Hanna was the earliest eighth Atlantic named storm on record, breaking the previous record of Harvey in 2005. Hanna was located 385 miles (620 kilometers) east, southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, according to the 10 p.m. CDT advisory from the National Hurricane Center. The formation of Hanna came as Tropical Storm Gonzalo continued to move across the Atlantic about 730 miles (1,170 km) east of the southern Windward Islands. Forecasters said Gonzalo had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph). A U.S. National Hurricane Center advisory said the storm was heading west at 14 mph (22 kph). Tropical-storm-force winds extended outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the center. The Hurricane Center said that those in the Windward Islands should monitor the storm as it is expected to approach the islands late Friday and Saturday. As some strengthening is forecast, there is still a chance that Gonzalo could become a hurricane, but the storm is expected to weaken as it moves into the Caribbean Sea. A hurricane watch has been issued for Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. A tropical storm watch is in effect for Tobago and Grenada. When Gonzalo strengthened into a named storm Wednesday, it became the earliest named seventh tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. The previous record was held by Tropical Storm Gert, which formed on July 24, 2005. So far this year, Cristobal, Danielle, Edouard and Fay also set records for being the earliest named Atlantic storms of their respective place in the alphabet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-hanna-forms-gonzalo-strength-remains-steady/story-f9060RQvqTgYCZ6cE8CqDL.html

That took total deaths in the state to 55.The number of new infections is down from 403 yesterday and Wednesday’s record of 484.The spike has forced around 5 million people in Melbourne back into a six-week lockdown, and masks became mandatory in the city this week.Andrews yesterday announced payments to encourage people to get tested and stay at home, after data showed almost all those feeling unwell didn’t isolate between first feeling sick and getting a test.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-victoria-reports-mounting-death-toll-during-lockdown/story-F6LBFA0u9GSynZqkFnj60H.html
24-07-2020||World||US abandons China appeasement policy, outsources hostilities||US Secretary of State Michael R Pompeo on Thursday repudiated decades-old American policy of engaging communist China to change it as a failure and called for an international alliance of countries to take it from here, framing it as a choice for them between freedom and tyranny.“The old paradigm of blind engagement with China has failed,” Pompeo said in a widely anticipated policy speech at a legacy California library run by the foundation of late President Richard Nixon, who re-established diplomatic ties with China and paved the way for its opening with a historic visit in 1972.“If the free world doesn’t change Communist China — (it) will surely change us,,” Pompeo added, blithely outsourcing Trump administration’s political beef with China.The Thursday speech was the fourth in a formatted series by senior members of the Trump administration framing deteriorating relations with China, marked by a slew of punitive measures, including most recently, the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, under allegations it was being used as an intelligence gathering hub. The earlier three were delivered by National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien who had focussed on ideological underpinnings of the Chinese Communist Party; Attorney General William Barr had addressed business and trade ties and FBI director Christopher Wray spoke on intelligence and hacking. Pompeo wrapped it up with the widely anticipated speech Thursday.The top US diplomat said, citing Nixon, the purpose of engaging with China was to “induce change”. The thinking among policymakers then was that as China became more prosperous it would become “freer at home” and “friendlier abroad”. It did not quite happen that way.“The kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change in China that President Nixon hoped to induce,” Pompeo said, adding, “Whatever the reason, China today is increasingly authoritarian at home, and more aggressive in its hostility to freedom abroad.”Nations must change the way they deal with China. “We cannot treat this incarnation of China as a normal country,” Pompeo said, adding the United States cannot do it alone because the Chinese have spread far too wide and deep into the world, unlike the Soviet Union, which had remained closed.There is a need for “a new grouping of like-minded nations - a new alliance of democracies”. He did not specify which nations. In a question-answer session following the speech, the secretary of state said these nations will have the backing of the US for sure.When asked if he was urging nations to pick between the US and China, in line with a choice the US presented to the world in the 1940s between itself and the USSR, Pompeo said the choice for them was between “freedom and tyranny”.“If we bend the knee now, our children’s children may be at the mercy of the CCP (the Chinese Communist Party), whose actions are the primary challenge to the free world,” he had said in his speech, as he was laying out the threat the world faced form China. President Xi Jinping “Xi isn’t destined to tyrannize inside and outside of China forever, unless we let him”.The secretary of state also argued for involving Chinese people. in changing the regime — not overthrow it. “We must also engage and empower the Chinese people...a dynamic, freedom-loving people who are completely distinct from the Chinese Communist Party.” he said. He has been meeting Chinese dissidents and victims and survivors of Chinese oppression in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and some of them were present in the audience at the invitation-only event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-abandons-china-appeasement-policy-outsources-hostilities/story-1bTN5CXWZb6NJZ64dBaSSL.html

He had to cancel upcoming travel plans after a new test came back positive again Wednesday.The far-right leader admitted in a live Facebook video Thursday that he was feeling “a bit wretched at being imprisoned here.”Photographs captured him taking a motorcycle for a spin on the palace grounds, stopping at one point to talk to a team of groundskeepers raking leaves -- despite his positive test result and the fact that neither he nor the workers appeared to be wearing face masks.The president’s office told AFP it “will not be commenting” on the pictures.Bolsonaro, who has been called a “Tropical Trump,” has repeatedly defied social distancing guidelines. He regularly hit the streets for rallies by his supporters even as the pandemic exploded in Brazil.The South American country has the second-biggest outbreak in the world, after the United States, with nearly 2.3 million infections and more than 84,000 deaths.Brazil registered its two highest daily numbers of new infections Wednesday and Thursday, with 67,860 and 59,961, respectively.Bolsonaro, who has compared the virus to a “little flu” and condemned the economic impact of stay-at-home measures to contain it, said on Facebook he was feeling “great.”“You have to be careful, but there’s no reason to live in terror,” he said.“We’re concerned with protecting lives, but the collateral damage from these (stay-at-home) policies is going to kill a lot more people than the virus.”Critics condemned the presidential outing.“This shows Bolsonaro’s monstrosity and contempt for Brazilians’ lives,” tweeted Congressman Marcelo Freixo, leader of the left-wing Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL).Bolsonaro has continued greeting supporters from quarantine, separated by a narrow reflecting pond but maskless.He has also been spotted in the gardens feeding -- and occasionally getting bitten by -- rheas, a South American bird related to the emu.val/jhb/to||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-infection-brazil-s-bolsonaro-takes-spin-chats-up-workers/story-lufc2cprBIM9GhMViRlT8J.html
24-07-2020||World||‘Chinese consulate in Houston was hub of spying’: Mike Pompeo||Top officials in the United States have escalated their public condemnations of China in the last several weeks, with speeches by FBI Director Chris Wray, Attorney General William Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.The allegation comes amid rising tension between the US and China, particularly related to theft of intellectual property for Beijing’s benefit. Just this week, the US ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, and the Justice Department charged two Chinese hackers with targeting firms working on vaccines for the coronavirus.In a speech in California on Thursday, Pompeo said the consulate had been “a hub of spying”.“This week we closed down China’s consulate in Houston because it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft,” Pompeo said.This was the first major speech delivered by Pompeo after Washington’s surprise order this week for China to close its Houston consulate, where the US Secretary of State called for an end to “blind engagement” with China. He also repeated frequently levelled US charges about its unfair trade practices, human rights abuses and efforts to infiltrate American society.The remarks came after the US Justice Department said that the Chinese consulate in San Francisco is harbouring a harbouring a researcher who lied about her links with the country’s military. The justice department announced charges against that scientist and three others accused of concealing their government ties.According to federal prosecutors quoted by CNN, the scientist Tang Juan is hiding in China’s consulate in San Francisco. Juan is a researcher who focuses on biology, the CNN reported.She was charged with visa fraud on June 26.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), meanwhile, has interviewed visa holders in more than 25 American cities who are suspected of concealing their ties to the Chinese military. The Justice Department believes that the deception is part of an ongoing, government-sponsored effort to steal research and innovation from American universities for Beijing’s economic gain.China, meanwhile, said that the US decision to close its Houston consulate had “severely harmed” relations and warned it “must” retaliate, without detailing what it would do.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-consulate-in-houston-was-hub-of-spying-mike-pompeo/story-ZgjQs3dTNBOWcLKdHr42AK.html

The move was met with dismay in Greece and the United States and from Christian church leaders.On Thursday, the Turkish leader, joined by a large entourage, paid a surprise visit to inspect final preparations at the structure, including the unveiling of a sign at the entrance that reads: “The Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque.”The head of Turkey’s religious authority, Ali Erbas, on Thursday announced the appointment of the three imams who will lead prayers at the reconverted mosque: Mehmet Boynukalin, a professor of Islamic law at Istanbul’s Marmara University, and Ferruh Mustuer and Bunjamin Topcuoglu, the imams of two other Istanbul mosques.Erbas also named five muezzins — the officials who make the Muslim call for prayer — for Hagia Sophia, including two from Istanbul’s famed Blue Mosque.Authorities have designated segregated areas outside of the Hagia Sophia for men and women wanting to join Friday’s inaugural prayers.Several roads leading to the building are being blocked. Authorities have said as many as 17,000 security personnel would be on duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-s-erdogan-to-join-hundreds-of-worshippers-for-prayers-in-hagia-sophia-after-conversion/story-VwYqowzFaO64cenh8HVqEJ.html
24-07-2020||World||US coronavirus deaths top 1,000 for a third day in a row||The United States on Thursday recorded more than 1,000 deaths from Covid-19, marking the third straight day the nation passed that grim milestone as the pandemic escalates in southern and western U.S. states.Fatalities nationwide were recorded at 1,014 on Thursday, with not all states reporting. Deaths were 1,135 on Wednesday and 1,141 on Tuesday. Even though deaths are rising in the United States for a second week in a row, they remain well below levels seen in April, when 2,000 people a day on average died from the virus.The United States on Thursday also passed a total of more than 4 million coronavirus infections since the first U.S. case was documented in January, according to a Reuters tally, reflecting a nationwide escalation of the pandemic.The United States took 98 days to reach one million confirmed cases of Covid-19 but just 16 days to increase from 3 million to 4 million, the tally showed. The total suggests at least one in 82 Americans have been infected at some point in the pandemic. The average number of new cases is now rising by more than 2,600 per hour nationwide, the highest rate in the world.As the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak has spread from New York to the South and West, federal, state and local officials have clashed over how to ease lockdowns imposed on Americans and businesses.Requirements that residents wear masks in public have become the subject of a fierce political divide, as many conservatives argue that such orders violate the U.S. Constitution.U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican who has rejected a nationwide mask rule and been reluctant to wear one himself, this week reversed course and encouraged Americans to do so.‘Wear mask, avoid crowds’“We have to do our mitigation steps: Wear a mask, avoid the crowds. We won’t see hospitalizations and deaths go down for a couple of weeks because (they are) lagging indicators, but we are turning that tide,” U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir told the Fox News Network in an interview.Trump told a White House briefing on Thursday that hot spot states may need to delay re-opening schools by a few weeks but pushed for most students to be able to return to classrooms in the fall. Schools have become another point of contention. In Florida, the state teachers’ union has sued to stop in-class instruction. Florida reported a record one-day increase in Covid-19 deaths on Thursday at 173.Florida’s health commissioner said earlier this month that schools must reopen, but Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has since said that parents should have the option to keep their children home. Trump administration officials have said a quicker reopening is essential to get the staggered economy moving again, a central plank of the president’s re-election campaign.Trump also said he would no longer hold part of the Republican Party’s nominating convention in Florida in August because of a spike in coronavirus cases in the state.“The timing for this event is not right,” Trump told the White House briefing. “It’s just not right with what’s happened recently, the flare-up in Florida. To have a big convention it’s not the right time.”Trump has been holding his first coronavirus briefings in months without the experts on his task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Fauci, who became a household name in the early days of the pandemic, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch on Thursday on Opening Day of the truncated Major League Baseball season at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.Trump’s rival for the presidency, Democrat Joe Biden, blasted his handling of the pandemic in a campaign video aired on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/u-s-coronavirus-deaths-top-1-000-for-a-third-day-in-a-row/story-Ju2avrvy4LhC6T0VDtYM2H.html
24-07-2020||World||Trump initially ‘downplayed’ Covid-19 threat, says Maryland governor||The nation’s governors were priming for battle against the coronavirus as early as February, but President Donald Trump’s lackadaisical approach to the spreading disease hindered a national response, according to Maryland governor Larry Hogan, chairman of the National Governors Association.Trump initially was “downplaying” the threat and saying “this virus is going to disappear,” despite grave warnings from top national experts, Hogan told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday.“All of the leaders in the administration, the experts and the public health doctors at the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), they were aware and providing this information. And yet it seemed as if the president was downplaying it and saying, you know, this virus is going to disappear,” Hogan said.The biggest mistake in the first couple of months, the governor said, was not developing a national testing strategy.“Throughout the pandemic, it (the federal government) was not assisting the states enough with testing and now as it’s spiking back up again and we have a resurgence of this virus all across the country, the No. 1 thing we can do is to put more into testing and contact tracing to identify and stop the spread,” Hogan said.Hogan criticized the president repeatedly in his upcoming book, “Still Standing: Surviving Cancer, Riots, a Global Pandemic and the Toxic Politics that Divide America,” which is set for release July 28.In the book, Hogan highlights a closed-door meeting in Washington on Feb. 9 between governors and leading health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert and Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Hogan wrote the governors received a series of detailed presentations about how the virus could be catastrophic; the death toll could be significant. Hogan described it as “a harrowing warning of an imminent threat” with a “huge contrast between the experts’ warnings and the president’s public dismissals.”Hogan writes that Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, advised the governors to consult with their legal teams to find out what public health emergency powers they had and whether they could order quarantines.“That eye-opening briefing in early February gave the governors a giant leg up before the epidemic was officially declared a global pandemic,” Hogan wrote. “With the president largely unengaged in this crucial early period, the governors were ready to step up and lead in the early months of what was quickly becoming a terrible plague.”The US Department of Health and Human Services announced the meeting in a brief news release, but without the details Hogan writes about concerning the gravity of the presentations.“The panel reiterated that while this is a serious public health matter, the risk to the American public remains low at this time, and that the federal government will continue working in close coordination with state and local governments to keep it that way,” the news release said.But Hogan said Thursday that he and most of the governors “came out of there with a sense of this was going to be the most serious health crisis that America’s ever faced.”Hogan wrote he was able to “feel the friction” with the president on calls Trump participated in with the nation’s governors due to earlier criticism.“I did not go out of my way to criticize the president,” Hogan said Thursday. “But unlike a lot of Republicans, I’m not the guy that’s just going to sit down and shut up and not stand up and say something if I think something’s going wrong.” Hogan said he will consider a run for the presidency in 2024.Hogan ran into friction with Trump in April, when the governor announced he had obtained 500,000 virus test kits from South Korea. At the time, Trump said Hogan didn’t need to go to South Korea for tests.“I think the president made some ridiculous comment that we didn’t have to go find tests, that we can just call Mike Pence and get all the tests we wanted. It was obviously not true,” Hogan said Thursday. “If I didn’t have to spend three weeks searching all over the world, to find these tests I certainly wouldn’t have.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-initially-downplayed-covid-19-threat-says-maryland-governor/story-1yua2ORxrHlP7TjjB1LpoN.html

I also want to thank the British public for all the sacrifices they are making to help keep this country safe,” he said.He said businesses are encouraged to take reasonable steps to encourage customers to follow the law, including through signs and providing other information in store.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Wearing a face covering will not be made mandatory in other venues that have measures in place to protect staff and the public from Covid-19, including eat-in restaurants and pubs, hairdressers and other treatment salons, gyms and leisure centres, cinemas, concert halls and theatres.For transport hubs in England, the requirements mean face coverings must be worn in indoor train stations and terminals, airports, maritime ports, and indoor bus and coach stations or terminals.Anyone who doesn’t abide by the regulations — and is not exempt under one of the categories set out in the regulations — could face a fine by the police of up to GBP 100, as is currently the case on public transport in most parts of the UK. The police say they have been very clear throughout the pandemic that they will “engage, explain, encourage and finally enforce as a last resort”.People wearing face coverings are still strongly advised to wash their hands or use hand sanitiser before putting one on or taking it off, avoid taking it off and putting it back on again a lot in quick succession, store it in a plastic bag in between washes or wearing, and avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth while wearing one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/face-masks-now-compulsory-in-uk-shops-supermarkets-to-check-covid-19-spread/story-l7zRgKJGpcxcm3RLZZWVjN.html

Helicopters have flown over as early as 5:30 a.m., waking Archie and neighbors, and some photographers have cut holes in their mesh fence attempting to get shots of them.Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and sixth in line to the British throne, married Meghan Markle, an American actress who grew up in Los Angeles, at Windsor Castle in 2018, in a posh ceremony watched around the world.In January, the couple announced they planned to quit as senior royals, seek financial independence and move to North America. The split became official at the end of March.The couple chose to live at least part-time in North America “to escape the incessant UK tabloid fabrications,” the lawsuit says. Meghan is also suing a pair of media outlets there for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement.They were able to live quietly in North Saanich, Canada, for six weeks, the lawsuit says, before a British tabloid published their exact location and hordes of photographers descended, prompting them to head to the California home where their location was again published and paparazzi appeared in droves again.“The plaintiffs have done everything in their power to stay out of the limelight, except in connection with their work, which they freely admit is newsworthy,” according to the lawsuit, which says they “simply want to continue the public impact work that is so important to them while having the private life to which any family or individual has the right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-and-meghan-sue-over-photo-of-son-at-california-home/story-hrg34J2ZgDllFrjG7w8PqM.html

One US consulate in China will be asked to close.”He had said earlier that shutting the Wuhan consulate would be insufficiently disruptive and suggested China could cut US staff at its large consulate in Hong Kong, which he described as an “intelligence center.”“This will make Washington suffer much pain,” he wrote.The other US consulates in China are in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang.China has four other consulates in the United States - in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York - as well as an embassy in Washington.Trump said in answer to a question at a news briefing on Wednesday it was “always possible” other Chinese missions could be closed too.Richard Grenell, special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo who served until recently as acting director of US national intelligence, told Reuters the US strategy was “very much start with one and move on to others if need be.”“The whole goal is to change the behavior of the Chinese... this is emerging as the Trump doctrine, which is very harsh actions, sanctions and isolation while at the same time always offering a chance to exit if the behavior changes.”Chinese state media editorials said the US move against the Houston consulate was an attempt to blame Beijing for US failures ahead of Trump’s reelection bid. Opinion polls have shown Trump trailing Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-urges-more-assertive-approach-to-frankenstein-china/story-lSbXhEHAMWdScWBaUhK2FK.html
24-07-2020||World||Trump scraps big Republican convention in Florida as Covid-19 rages||President Donald Trump relented Thursday to worries about the coronavirus and canceled his Florida nominating convention, the biggest event of his re-election campaign, as the host state posted record deaths from the pandemic.“I told my team it’s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida component of the GOP convention,” Trump said Thursday at the White House. “We didn’t want to take any chances.”Trump had insisted for months that he would still hold his four-day extravaganza despite worries that the gathering would become a super-spreader event. The party decided June 11 to move the convention from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida, after Governor Roy Cooper refused to waive social-distancing and other measures to prevent contagion.But just as preparations for the Florida event got underway, Florida was hit with a surge of infections and now is one of the country’s hardest-hit areas, with a total so far of 389,868 confirmed cases of the virus — about 1.8% of the state’s population — and the number growing by an average of more than 10,000 cases a day. The state posted a record 173 deaths on Thursday.With support plunging in public opinion polls over his handling of the virus, Trump appeared to start over this week, offering daily news conferences where he encouraged people to wear masks after disdaining them for months, and acknowledging the seriousness of the virus after minimizing its impact.A Quinnipiac poll of Florida voters released Thursday showed him running 13 points behind Joe Biden.But Trump, who thrives on the large crowds that attend his campaign rallies, was clearly looking forward to an event that would give his campaign a jolt of enthusiasm.He tried that with a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, his only one so far since the pandemic began in March. The event was only filled to about one-third of capacity and numerous people, including state officials, became ill.Democrats scaled back their convention earlier this summer, dispensinf with the full pageantry and celebration that normally marks the nomination of a presidential candidate. The Democratic National Committee is allowing delegates to vote remotely and most of the speeches, except for the acceptance speech for Joe Biden, will be livestreamed. Biden will speak in Milwaukee but before a limited audience.The Republicans, urged on by Trump, had persisted in planning a full convention right up until Trump’s announcement at his daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday.He offered few details of how the GOP virtual event would work, except to say there would be a “reasonably quick meeting in North Carolina.”“I’ll still do a convention speech in a different form but we won’t do a big crowded convention per se,”he said.“We’ll have a very nice something,” he added. “We’ll figure it out.”Local officials in the Republican-led city applauded the decision.In a joint statement, Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry and Sheriff Mike Williams applauded the move. “We appreciate President Donald Trump considering our public health and safety concerns in making this incredibly difficult decision,” they said on Twitter.When Trump made the decision to move the convention in early June, Florida’s rate of coronavirus infections was well below the national average. But the rate spiked as beaches and Disney resorts started to reopen, fueled in part by growing infections in younger patients.As recently as two weeks ago, the White House denied there were any second thoughts about holding a convention. “No, we’re still moving forward with Jacksonville,” said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. “It’ll be a safe event. It will be a good event. And it will be up to the RNC as to how those details are hashed out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-scraps-big-republican-convention-in-florida-as-covid-19-rages/story-Bk1xoYYKFfilyZwRKCsyQO.html
24-07-2020||World||India facilitating visa requests of Afghanistan’s Hindu and Sikh minorities||India said on Thursday it has been getting requests from members of the Hindu and Sikh minorities of Afghanistan to settle down in the country following a spike in terror attacks on these communities.“There has been a recent spurt in attacks on the Hindu and Sikh communities in Afghanistan. These attacks have been done by terrorists at the behest of their external supporters,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing.“We have been receiving requests from the members of these communities, they want to move to India, they want to settle down here. Despite the ongoing Covid-19 situation, we have been facilitating these requests,” he added.The Indian embassy in Kabul is providing visas to members of the minority communities to come to the country. “Once they reach here, their requests will be examined and acted upon based on extant rules and policies,” Srivastava said.After Nidan Singh Sachdeva, a leader of Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan was released from captivity on July 18 after being kidnapped on June 22, the external affairs ministry had said the targeting and persecution of minority communities by terrorists was a “matter of grave concern”.“In a recent decision, India has decided to facilitate the return of Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members facing security threats in Afghanistan to India,” the ministry had said in a statement at the time.The controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act provides for a speedy process for members of non-Muslim minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to seek refuge in India.In a separate development, India has again asked Pakistan to ensure the safety of its minorities after a Gandhara-style Buddha statue found during the excavation of a house at Mardan in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province was demolished on July 18 at the behest of an Islamic cleric.This act was widely condemned and Buddhist monks in Gaya have condemned the vandalism, Srivastava said.“We have expressed our concerns to Pakistan. We have conveyed our expectation that they would ensure the safety, security and well-being of minority communities there, as well as protect their cultural heritage,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-facilitating-visa-requests-of-afghanistan-s-hindu-and-sikh-minorities/story-bhT4CSKPXH4TmAiNkB52WN.html
24-07-2020||World||300-400 mn doses of Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine to be ready by Dec: Serum Institute||Serum Institute of India (SII) has said the company is going to produce 300 to 400 million doses of the experimental Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca by December this year.Adar Poonawalla, SII’s chief executive officer, said Covishield is the first Covid-19 vaccine they hope to launch if the trials are successful both in the UK and in India.SII, the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world, has been chosen by Oxford and its AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine once it gets ready.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe vaccine from AstraZeneca and Britain’s University of Oxford prompted no serious side effects and elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses, according to trial results published in The Lancet medical journal on Monday.Poonawalla said they will start the trials of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate by the end of August on up to 5,000 Indian volunteers after getting the necessary nods and launch the vaccine by June next year if all goes well.“We will be going for large scale manufacturing in mid-August-early-August… By the end of this year, we should be able to produce 300 to 400 million doses come end of December. That’s the target and I hope we can do that,” Adar Poonawalla said in an interview to news channel India Today.As he said they expect the vaccine to reach the people of India in large numbers by the first quarter of 2021, he added that is “still a bit early of how much is going to cost”. “We are going to give it at a very affordable price… We are planning to put it at about Rs 1000 or less than that… I don’t think any citizen of India or of any other country is going to have to pay for it because it is going to be bought by the government and distributed free,” he said.“It is going to be very affordable… in line with our general philosophy of giving everything at a very affordable price. We generally don’t want to make a profit at all, in fact, in the Covid crisis and after the pandemic is over, we may look at a more commercial price that could be available in the market,” he said.Oxford University had on Monday announced satisfactory progress with the vaccine, making it one of the leading ones among the dozens of vaccine candidates being developed around the world.It has tied up with Serum Institute to manufacture and supply the vaccine to India and over 60 other countries having a combined population of 3 billion.SII, he said, is putting $200 million at risk by manufacturing nearly 300 million doses before the final nod to launch the vaccine in market.“We are making this application within the next 48 hours to the Drug Controller General of India’s office. They will probably take about 1-2 weeks on what kind of study and trial we will have to do,” Poonawalla said, speaking to the CNBC-TV-18 news channel.It will take another three weeks to inject patients in hospitals, he said, adding, “We are talking about a month or month and a half maximum from today...maybe even sooner.”“The vaccine under development will be injected into 4,000-5,000 volunteers in Pune and Mumbai, which have high rates of coronavirus infections, as part of the crucial phase three of the trial which will determine if the antidote can be introduced in the market or not,” he said.Poonawalla said unlike the exclusion of older people in the initial phase of trials at Oxford, the Indian trials will include elderly people and health workers as well because the initial phase has conclusively proven the safety of the vaccine.Other than the process of applying for trials and having actual trials on humans in India, the company will also be applying for special permission to start manufacturing the vaccine in the country, which exposes it to a commercial risk if the vaccine fails at the last stage, he said.The company will manufacture up to 70 million doses of the vaccine per month up to October as part of the special permission and plans to take it up to 100 million per month by December so that it is ready to hit the market once the final approvals are in place.If this goes to plan, the phase three trials will take two months after the patients get injected and the vaccine gets a final nod by November, he said, adding that in such a scenario, it can get introduced either in the “first quarter of 2021”.The company has already manufactured around 2-3 million doses of the vaccine for getting the process correct and also stabilising its machinery, Poonawalla said, clarifying that these will never be used on humans.“If you look at the process right now, the risk of the opex (operating expenditure) which we are putting in is more than $200 million. If this vaccine fails, we will be down (by) $200 million,” he said, adding the expenses exclude the opportunity cost of using the same facility for some other purpose.Poonawalla also said SII is looking at external investors for the vaccine-related endeavour and added that it has tie-ups with five other vaccine candidates which will be housed into a separate step-down subsidiary, where the family will dilute its stake by 15-20%.Apart from the five tie-ups already forged, SII is in talks with two other candidates, he said, adding that a manufacturing plant with a capacity to produce 1 billion units of the vaccine per year will also get housed in the subsidiary.He said it is extremely likely that the Covid-19 vaccine would require two or more doses, like in the case of antidotes for measles and other diseases.“We have got a lot on the line and bet big on this (Oxford-AstraZeneca) candidate. And we really hope it works,” he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-4-million-doses-of-oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-ready-by-december-serum-institute/story-EFnyf1XN6HZcHW8DIm8W0I.html
24-07-2020||India||China figures in Rajnath’s call with Israel||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday spoke with his Israeli counterpart Lt Gen Benjamin Gantz over the telephone, with the strengthening of bilateral defence ties being the focus of the conversation. The conversation comes as India is making emergency purchases from several countries including Israel to bolster the military’s capabilities amid border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh. The border row was also discussed, officials said.“Both ministers expressed satisfaction at the progress of strategic cooperation between the two countries and discussed possibilities of further strengthening defence engagements,” the defence ministry said in a statement.Singh updated Gantz on the situation along the contested Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. India and China have lately failed to make a breakthrough in reducing border tensions despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels. The disengagement process at some friction points has virtually stopped, people familiar with the developments said.The border conflict has forced India to speed up the purchase of military hardware, including fighter jets, smart air-to-ground weapons, missiles, rockets, multi-mission drones, air defence systems, GPS-guided artillery ammunition, tank ammunition and even assault rifles. The US, Russia, France and Israel are among the countries that India plans to import the weaponry from.India is looking at sourcing from Israel the Firefly loitering ammunition, Spike anti-tank guided missiles, Spice guidance kits that can be mounted on standard bombs to convert them into smart weapons and an operational surface-to-air missile system. A 2017 order worth $2 billion for such advanced systems to take down hostile aircraft and missiles has not translated into deliveries yet, the officials said.Israel has been a reliable military partner and has stood by India, said Air Marshal KK Nohwar (retd), director-general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “Israel has always given us niche technologies in areas of electronic warfare systems and weapons systems that were not readily forthcoming from other countries,” Nohwar said.The government has authorised the armed forces to process cases for buying urgently-needed weapons and equipment worth up to ₹300 crore to meet their critical operational requirements. The decision was taken at a special meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council—India’ apex procurement body—on July 15 to fast-track key purchases.Singh sought greater participation of Israeli defence companies in the defence manufacturing sector under the new liberalised Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) regime, the statement cited above said.From raising FDI in defence manufacturing to creating a separate budget for buying locally-made military hardware and notifying a list of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported, the government in May announced a raft of measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector.In early July, the defence ministry approved the purchase of weapons and ammunition worth ₹38,900 crore. The cost of military hardware cleared for purchase from the domestic industry is pegged at ₹31,130 crore. The orders are expected to give a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-Reliant India Movement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-figures-in-rajnath-s-call-with-israel/story-BS8TTTQyczo1oEwYI2WxBM.html
24-07-2020||India||Odisha forest official dies of Covid-19, kin get test results after his death||The result of the swab test of a forest official in Odisha’s Covid-19 hotspot of Ganjam district was revealed at least 24 hours after he died, his family members have alleged.Basant Mohanty, a forest official from Bhanjanagar area of Ganjam gave his swab for a Covid-19 test on July 12, days after he started getting fever. While taking the swab, Mohanty was told that if he does not get any phone call on his registered number, then the test result can be deemed as negative.The forest official was, however, admitted to the ICU of the MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town of the district on July 19 after his condition turned serious. He passed away on July 21 at the hospital and was cremated on July 22 in the presence of family friends.On July 23 evening, Mohanty’s near and dear were however shocked when they received a call on his mobile to keep him ready as he had tested positive for Covid-19. “I thought someone was playing a prank on us. My father had passed away 2 days ago and we were getting calls to shift him to a Covid-19 hospital. I told the official at the other end about his death,” said his son Diganta Mohanty.The deceased forest official’s son said the callousness of the government was shocking. “If the government is claiming that it provides the swab test results in 3 days, why did they take 11 days in case of my father? Is this some kind of a joke,” he asked. “After my father was admitted to ICU, several family members visited him. After he died, at least 20 people in our locality had come. All of us now have been quarantined.”Bhanjanagar tehsildar Alok Pradhan said normally the swab test results are available within 3 days of collection of samples. “But in Mohanty’s case, we got it on 21st night. I don’t know why there was so much delay,” Pradhan said.Two days ago, an additional district magistrate of a Covid-19 hotspot district had passed away before his swab test results returned positive. The initial swab test reports of Gajapati ADM Karunakar Raika had come negative in antigen and Truenat tests, but the RT-PCR test of his swab after his death came positive. Ganjam on Friday reported a record 732 cases taking the total to 7,634 cases in the district. Incidentally, all the 732 cases reported today were outside quarantine centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-forest-official-dies-of-covid-19-kin-get-test-results-after-his-death/story-hq3UJixdr1GnLIq0BxQvuN.html
24-07-2020||India||Differences emerge over border troop withdrawal||New Delhi/Beijing Differences between India and China on the disengagement process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) spilled into the open on Friday, with New Delhi calling on Beijing to “sincerely implement” all understandings on troop withdrawals reached by senior military commanders of the two sides.The issue figured in a nearly three-hour meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, which reviewed the situation in the border areas and the disengagement process in the western sector of the LAC.The Indian side sent a “strong message” on the need for the Chinese side to deliver on commitments regarding the withdrawal of forces at friction points on the LAC, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.A statement from the external affairs ministry said the two sides agreed “it was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between senior [military] commanders in their meetings till date”.The two sides also agreed another meeting of the corps commanders “may be held soon so as to work out further steps to ensure expeditiously complete disengagement and de-escalation” along the LAC, the statement added.The people cited above said another meeting of the corps commanders is expected to be held next week but no dates have been finalised as yet. The fourth and most recent meeting of the generals from the two sides was held on July 14, with marathon discussions continuing till early morning the next day.The Indian side at the WMCC meeting, the fourth engagement at the diplomatic level since the border standoff emerged into the open, focused on the need for China to completely withdraw its forces from key friction points in Ladakh sector in keeping with commitments made at the meetings of the corps commanders and the July 5 phone conversation between the two Special Representatives on the border issue, the people said.The main problem areas continue to be the presence of Chinese troops at Pangong Lake and Depsang plains, the people said. While there has been some pullback by Chinese forces at Hot Springs and Gogra, this was not in line with the understandings reached so far and more needs to be done, the people added.The Chinese readout on the WMCC meeting, issued in Beijing in Mandarin, referred to “positive progress made by the frontline border defence forces of the two countries to disengage and ease the situation on the ground”.It said the two sides will “maintain bilateral military and diplomatic dialogues and consultations in accordance with the important consensus reached by the two foreign ministers and Special Representatives on border issues, properly handle remaining issues on the ground, and promote further cooling of the border situation”.The Chinese readout also spoke of the two sides continuing meetings of WMCC and the corps commanders to “strengthen the building of confidence” and “jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas”.However, the people cited above disagreed with the Chinese side’s characterisation of the troop withdrawals as “positive”.The Indian statement also noted the two sides had “agreed that early and complete disengagement of the troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and de-escalation from India-China border areas in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols and full restoration of peace and tranquillity was essential for smooth overall development of bilateral relations”.Such a complete disengagement will also be “in accordance with the agreement reached between the two Special Representatives (SRs) during their telephonic conversation on July 5”, the statement said.Experts believe the troop withdrawal has virtually stalled because the Chinese side has dug in at key points along the LAC.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said it would be very difficult to predict the next moves by China. “It is possible the Chinese side is not withdrawing as a reaction to economic and other actions taken by India. Even the Indian ban on Chinese apps has been backed by other countries and India has been able to mobilise global support on the issue of China’s aggressive actions,” he said.“For now, India has the option of waiting and watching, or escalating by mounting pressure at places where it has an advantage. But as defence minister Rajnath Singh pointed out, this will be a prolonged process,” Patil added.The Indian side at the WMCC meeting was led by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry, and the Chinese side was led by Hong Liang, director general of the boundary and maritime affairs department of the foreign ministry.(With inputs from Rahul Singh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/differences-emerge-over-border-troop-withdrawal/story-vH9u0FoldIJynJASG2SBIL.html
24-07-2020||India||HC makes Centre a party in rebel MLAs’ petition||New DelhiThe Rajasthan high court on Friday allowed the application filed by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 dissident Congress MLAs asking the court to include the Union government as a party to the case filed by them challenging speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notice of July 14.In their application moved through counsel S Hariharan and Divyesh Maheshwari, the rebel camp said the Union government should be included as a party because the validity of constitutional provisions (10th schedule) are under challenge.In their petition filed on July 15, the Pilot camp made the speaker and secretary of Rajasthan legislative assembly as respondents.The original version of the petition challenged only the speaker’s notice issued to them. However, the petition was amended later in the day to include an additional prayer challenging paragraph 2(1)(a) of tenth schedule of the Constitution. Para 2(1)(a) provides for disqualification of lawmakers on the ground of voluntarily giving up party membership.Since, the Constitutional provision was challenged, it became imperative to hear the central government due to which the application was moved on Thursday to add the Centre as party to the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-makes-centre-a-party-in-rebel-mlas-petition/story-DgMuLGXFKZbsI0Sr6cAbtJ.html
24-07-2020||India||Govt extends curbs, domestic flight fare caps until Nov 24||New Delhi The ministry of civil aviation on Friday extended restrictions on limited domestic flight operations and caps on air fares till November 24.Currently, the Centre has allowed domestic flight operations to function at 45% of their total capacity. “We will be extending our capacity of flight operations. At present, flight operations are at around 28%, we will extended the capacity beyond the 45 % limit soon,” a senior ministry official said.The ministry had last month cleared an increase in capacity of flight operations to 45% from 33% allowed previously. It had capped domestic flights to a third of their approved summer schedule in an order passed on May 21.Domestic flight operations were resumed from May 25, two months after their suspension in the wake of the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. Union aviation minister Hardeep Puri had earlier this month said that he hoped that the number of domestic flights will reach 55 – 60% of the pre-coronavirus level by Diwali this year.Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation in May had imposed fare limits for these bands -- domestic flights of less than 40-minute duration to have lower and upper limits of Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000. Fare limits for flights of 40-60 minutes are Rs 2,500 and Rs 7,500, for 60-90 minute flights, they are Rs 3,000 and Rs 9,000 and fare limits for 90-120 minute-flights are Rs 3,500 and Rs 10,000. Flights of 120-150 minute duration have Rs 4,500 and Rs 13,000 and those of 150-180 minutes have Rs 5,500 and Rs 15,700 as the lower and upper limits respectively.Airlines should adhere to the upper and lower limit of fares prescribed by the ministry during the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry had said.The aviation minister had said the move will mean that the lowest fare between Delhi and Mumbai, the busiest route in the country, will be capped at ₹3,500 and ₹10,000 at the higher end.The government’s decision to temporarily fix a cap on air fares following the resumption of domestic passenger flight services in a graded manner is impacting air travel demand as airlines are unable to offer tickets at lower prices to customers, aviation think tank Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) said earlier this month.CAPA said adopting such a mechanism takes away an airline’s flexibility to charge fares at a lower rate when demand is on the lower side. “The temporary fare caps by the regulator are impacting demand. The pricing restrictions mean that the airlines have less flexibility to offer lower fare to stimulate demand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-extends-curbs-domestic-flight-fare-caps-until-nov-24/story-X5XzzsBo4Z5gr7C8hA2YrN.html
24-07-2020||India||Not held hostage, say 3 MLAs||JaipurThree legislators from the Sachin Pilot camp, currently lodged at a hotel in Manesar, released video messages on Friday to counter chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s allegations that the Bharatiya Janata Party had held them hostage. “We are not hostage, we are here to voice our dissent to the CM’s style of working,” Congress MLAs Murari Lal Meena, Ved Prakash Solanki, and Suresh Modi said in the video. Addressing mediapersons in Jaipur earlier in the day, Gehlot said, “Our friends had been held hostage in Gurugram and they are under control of BJP. There are bouncers to prevent their return to Jaipur.” Meena, Congress MLA from Dausa, said the involvement of anti-corruption bureau and the special operations group in the probe has scared their families. “They are in fear. We are here to tell the high command that we are ignored in the party. We have not left the Congress or joined the BJP,” he said in the video message. Gehlot, Meena added, was a seasoned politician but he is leveling baseless allegations against the legislators in Haryana. Solanki, Congress MLA from Chaksu, also said they were not under anyone’s siege. “Some people in Jaipur are making allegation that we have been held hostage; that is wrong, we came here on our own will. As a matter of fact, I took a pass from the collector from travelling outside the state.” Modi, the third Congress legislator, also denied the allegations that they were being held hostage. “His [Gehlot] statements against us are undignified. We are here to complain against his style of working,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-held-hostage-say-3-mlas/story-hjWqlEbxG3rWpmO2kfq8fN.html

24-07-2020||India||‘Lives at stake’: Karnataka doctors protest attacks by Covid patients’ kin||Hundreds of doctors across Karnataka in both government and private hospitals wore black bands and held placards demanding that they be provided adequate security and protection while they perform their duties during the ongoing pandemic. There have been several incidents of violence and attacks by relatives of Covid patients - in some cases due to alleged delay in attending to them or handing over bodies only after undertaking necessary safety precautions.Doctors, speaking to the media, pointed out how the torching of an ambulance and stone-pelting at BIMS in Belgavi by relatives of a dead Covid patient as well as the assault on nurses and doctors at KC General Hospital in Bangalore due to delay in handing over a Covid patient body as medical procedures were being carried out has created a sense of fear and insecurity.Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors President Dr Dayanand Sagar said that the government should take the strictest possible action under law as medical personnel were already working under heavy odds.“Violence and assault on doctors, nurses or paramedical staff, damaging property under any circumstances is not acceptable. We should be able to work without fear for our lives. All of us are working by putting our lives at stake and for this, the reward should not be being violently attacked by a mob,” said Dr Sagar.KARD also outlined a charter of 11 demands, including arrest and legal action, against culprits involved in the Belgavi, Bidar and KC General hospital incidents, ensuring safety protocols and security are provided at all Covid care centres with police presence. Other demands in the charter include special allowances for Covid and night duty, providing good quality PPEs, N95 masks, shields, gloves and other equipment, no hierarchy among doctors and ensuring a common work design for everybody. They also said that funds should be released to ensure stipends which were hiked recently to be paid promptly.The Medical Education minister Dr K Sudhakar has assured that strictest action would be taken against those who threaten frontline Covid warriors. In the Belagavi case, already three have been detained for questioning and an FIR has been registered against 12 others. A senior health department official, who did not want to be identified, said: “Of course we will ensure safety and security. In all the cases, FIRs have been registered and in some culprits have been arrested with investigations are on. But on enhanced allowances and other financial matters a decision would be taken after due consideration.”For the second successive day, Karnataka recorded more than 5,000 Covid positive cases. On Friday, it recorded 5,007 new Covid-19 cases taking the cumulative tally to 85,870 which includes 31,347 discharges and 1,724 deaths. Bengaluru recorded 2,267 new cases on Friday and continues to account for nearly 60 per cent of all active cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lives-at-stake-karnataka-doctors-protest-attacks-by-covid-patients-kin/story-fV8qtbPftFltSBgbWmDc5J.html
24-07-2020||India||Telangana encounter probe panel gets six-month extension due to Covid-19 pandemic||The Supreme Court has granted a six-month extension to an inquiry commission probing the alleged encounter killings of four rape-murder accused in Telangana. The extension came on a request made by the Commission Chairman, former apex court judge, Justice VS Sirpurkar who cited the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions for its inability to complete the enquiry by the allotted deadline of September 3. The commission requested for a six-month extension.Passing an order on the commission’s application, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and comprising of Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “We grant six months’ further time to the Inquiry Commission to submit its final report.”The application filed on July 16 stated, “Even though the work of the commission is continuing, the same could not be completed because of the prevailing pandemic situation…Therefore, the inquiry commission is constrained to apply for an extension of time of six months from the date the commission is able to function with physical hearings, spot inspections etc.” The other two members of the Inquiry Commission are former judge of the Bombay High Court, Justice Rekha Baldota and former Director of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) DR Karthikeyan. The Commission was constituted on December 12, 2019 by a bench headed by CJI SA Bobde on a petition filed by two lawyers GS Mani and Pradeep Kumar Yadav. The petition sought an independent probe into the killing of the four people accused of raping and murdering a 26-year old veterinarian amid growing public outrage. The ghastly rape-murder took place in the outskirts of Hyderabad on November 27 and had shocked the entire country. On December 6, in a shootout with the police, the four men were killed as they tried to escape.The apex court tasked the Commission to verify the claims of the petition and examine the veracity of police claims. The Commission met once in February and was scheduled to meet next in March, this year. Due to their advanced age, none of the members could travel or meet amid the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-encounter-probe-panel-gets-six-month-extension-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-9uk7WJBaGbhxGTgA97Z4xN.html
24-07-2020||India||BJP’s Bengal leaders called for Delhi interviews as party gets poll ready||Despite complete or partial lockdown in parts of many districts and biweekly lockdown in Bengal, all BJP district presidents, many of whom are newly elected, have been summoned in phases to Delhi to evaluate party’s position in each of the state’s 294 assembly seats. The BJP has declared that it will win at least 200 seats in the 2021 Bengal polls. The exercise was set in motion on Wednesday and will continue till next week.The constituency-wise evaluation began on Thursday with north Bengal districts where BJP wrested all seven Lok Sabha seats in 2019. It set a record by winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats while TMC won 22. BJP’s vote share was 40.64 % against 43.69 % of the TMC.“Each district president is being given a questionnaire. One of the difficult questions is how the BJP would perform if polls are held right now. They are being asked to state the party’s strengths and weaknesses right down to local unit level. They have to give their assessment on voters as well as the TMC’s strategies and weaknesses,” said a leader who did not want to be quoted. Each district president is being interviewed for two hours, he said. The exercise is being conducted by BJP central leaders such as Arvind Menon, who is in charge of West Bengal, joint general secretary (organisation) Shivprakash and general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh and national secretary Rahul Sinha are representing the state leadership. National general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh is overseeing the exercise. BJP currently has 16 legislators but most of them are defectors from the TMC and other parties. In the 2016 polls, the BJP won only three seats while its ally, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha of Darjeeling district, won three more. The BJP contested 291 seats but had only 10.16 % vote share.BJP leaders believe that although the situation has improved drastically since 2019 there is no space for complacency as TMC chief Mamata Banerjee is trying to regain lost ground by overhauling the party and stop more defections.“We have gone into election mode. The BJP will fight with full strength,” said BJP national executive member Mukul Roy, a former Rajya Sabha member, who switched over from the TMC in 2017 and played a key role in several defections and the party’s impressive 2019 Lok Sabha polls performance. Roy also flew to Delhi for a meeting but returned to Kolkata on Friday for an eye treatment. Interestingly, the Bengal chief minister is figuring in the BJP’s ongoing exercise for non-political reasons as well. Since direct flights between Kolkata and Delhi are banned, Bengal BJP leaders are flying to Lucknow or Indore to catch connecting flights and then following the same route on the return journey.“The chief minister has no sense. Has she been able to stop people from travelling between Kolkata and Delhi? Her whims are only costing people more money and travel time,” said Bengal BJP vice-president Ritesh Tiwari who reached Delhi on Friday via Lucknow.“I have to attend a meeting on July 26. I will travel via Indore,” said Arjun Singh, another vice-president and Lok Sabha member from Barrackpore in North 24 Parganas district. The constituency has witnessed maximum political violence since the Lok Sabha polls.Since flights from Bagdogra airport in Darjeeling district are operating without restriction, only the BJP district presidents from north Bengal flew directly to Delhi. Reacting to the exercise, TMC leaders said it only proves that Mamata Banerjee was right in saying that the BJP is a party of “outsiders”. “If BJP has to get its Bengal leaders to fly to Delhi to explain ground reality one can easily conclude that the party knows nothing about the state and its people,” said minister of state for parliamentary affairs Tapas Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-bengal-leaders-called-for-delhi-interviews-as-party-gets-polls-ready/story-VQKXAPka1kBpz9uFCDXkTL.html
24-07-2020||India||India, China statements on border talks reflect a wide gap in perceptions||Differences between India and China on the disengagement process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) spilled into the open on Friday, with New Delhi calling on Beijing to “sincerely implement” all understandings on troop withdrawals reached by senior military commanders of the two sides.The issue figured in a nearly three-hour meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, which reviewed the situation in the border areas and the disengagement process in the western sector of the LAC.The Indian side sent a “strong message” on the need for the Chinese side to deliver on commitments regarding the withdrawal of forces at friction points on the LAC, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.A statement from the external affairs ministry said the two sides agreed “it was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between senior [military] commanders in their meetings till date”.The two sides also agreed another meeting of the corps commanders “may be held soon so as to work out further steps to ensure expeditiously complete disengagement and de-escalation” along the LAC, the statement added.The people cited above said another meeting of the corps commanders is expected to be held next week but no dates have been finalised as yet. The fourth and most recent meeting of the generals from the two sides was held on July 14, with marathon discussions continuing till early morning the next day.The Indian side at the WMCC meeting, the fourth engagement at the diplomatic level since the border standoff emerged into the open, focused on the need for China to completely withdraw its forces from key friction points in Ladakh sector in keeping with commitments made at the meetings of the corps commanders and the July 5 phone conversation between the two Special Representatives on the border issue, the people said.The main problem areas continue to be the presence of Chinese troops at Pangong Lake and Depsang plains, the people said. While there has been some pullback by Chinese forces at Hot Springs and Gogra, this was not in line with the understandings reached so far and more needs to be done, the people added.The Chinese readout on the WMCC meeting, issued in Beijing in Mandarin, referred to “positive progress made by the frontline border defence forces of the two countries to disengage and ease the situation on the ground”.It said the two sides will “maintain bilateral military and diplomatic dialogues and consultations in accordance with the important consensus reached by the two foreign ministers and Special Representatives on border issues, properly handle remaining issues on the ground, and promote further cooling of the border situation”.The Chinese readout also spoke of the two sides continuing meetings of WMCC and the corps commanders to “strengthen the building of confidence” and “jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas”.However, the people cited above disagreed with the Chinese side’s characterisation of the troop withdrawals as “positive”.The Indian statement also noted the two sides had “agreed that early and complete disengagement of the troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and de-escalation from India-China border areas in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols and full restoration of peace and tranquillity was essential for smooth overall development of bilateral relations”.Such a complete disengagement will also be “in accordance with the agreement reached between the two Special Representatives (SRs) during their telephonic conversation on July 5”, the statement said.Experts believe the troop withdrawal has virtually stalled because the Chinese side has dug in at key points along the LAC.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said it would be very difficult to predict the next moves by China. “It is possible the Chinese side is not withdrawing as a reaction to economic and other actions taken by India. Even the Indian ban on Chinese apps has been backed by other countries and India has been able to mobilise global support on the issue of China’s aggressive actions,” he said.“For now, India has the option of waiting and watching, or escalating by mounting pressure at places where it has an advantage. But as defence minister Rajnath Singh pointed out, this will be a prolonged process,” Patil added.(With inputs from Rahul Singh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-statements-on-border-talks-reflect-a-wide-gap-in-perceptions/story-vOE6wDn9mk4zv7BvkqjGHM.html

The legislators were demanding that the Governor should convene an assembly session so that the chief minister and his colleagues could prove their majority in the House.In his letter to the chief minister, the Governor wrote, “Before I could discuss the matter with experts regarding an assembly session, you have openly said that if Raj Bhawan is ‘gheraoed’ then it is not your responsibility.”“If you and your Home Ministry cannot protect the Governor then what about law and order in the state? What agency should be contacted for the Governor’s security? I’ve never heard such a statement from any CM. Is this not the beginning of a wrong trend where MLAs protest at Raj Bhawan?” Mishra questioned in his communication to Gehlot.ALSO READ | Congress MLAs end protest at Raj Bhawan, Gehlot to chair cabinet meet in Jaipur tonightReportedly last night, the Rajasthan government presented a paper to convene the session of the Assembly at very short notice. The paper was analysed and legal experts were consulted over it, according to the Governor’s Secretariat, news agency ANI reported.The date on which the assembly session is to be convened has not yet been mentioned in the Cabinet note and no approval has been given by the Cabinet for it.The Governor pointed out that the state government should ensure freedom and free movement of all MLAs. “There is no justification provided for holding of the session at short notice nor any agenda has been proposed for the same.

24-07-2020||India||Railways earned Rs 430 crore from Shramik Special train fares||The Indian Railways earned Rs 429.90 crore revenue through the fares of its Shramik Special trains till July 9, data shared by the railway ministry shows.The national carrier received the highest revenue of Rs 102 crore from Gujarat followed by Maharashtra ( Rs 85 crore) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 34 crore ), according to the data reviewed by Hindustan Times.However, railways spent much more than it earned through fares - around Rs 2,400 crore - in operating the Shramik trains, a senior ministry official said.“This should be taken as receipt only in lieu of expenses incurred by the Railways in running of Shramik Trains. Roughly that would amount to more than Rs 2,400 crore. The fares were not taken by railways from passengers but released from state governments,” the official added.In June, the ministry had said the average cost of fares for migrants aboard Shramik Special trains was Rs 600 and added that it spent around Rs 3,400 per person to operate the train.“It may be noted that railways incurred 85% of the cost of operating Shramik Trains. It was an important operation to rise up for the need of the nation during the lockdown,” a spokesperson for the railway ministry said.According to Rajendran Narayanan, assistant professor at Azim Premji University, “The actual number of migrants that have been transported during the lockdown is around 1 crore and there are still many more migrants estimated to be stranded. Due to the obstacles in the procedures in getting on board the trains and the fact that curbs are easing, many are choosing to stay put now. In terms of fares, many migrants ended up paying fares in the month of May though it did get free later on towards June in most places. Migrants ended up paying about Rs 800 to Rs 1000. When the regular IRCTC trains also began in June, many migrants decided to book them due to lack of availability in shramik trains and ended up paying dynamic fares in the IRCTC trains.”Shramik Special trains began from May 1 in the Centre’s bid to ferry stranded migrant workers to their native states amid the Covid-19 lockdown.But soon the national carrier had come under criticism over the issue of train fare being charged from the migrants. The ministry had also issued guidelines stating that the sending state will pay the consolidated fare to railways. “Sending state may decide to bear this cost or take it from passengers or take it from the receiving state after mutual consultation or may charge it to any fund. It is purely their prerogative,” it had said in its guidelines for operating the trains.The Ministry of railways had clarified it subsidised the ticket prices for migrant workers by agreeing to pay 85 %, while state governments had been asked to pay the remaining 15%.The fare structure for the trains included the price of regular sleeper class tickets plus superfast charges of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20.The Shramik train operations have finally come to an end with the last service on July 9. However, the ministry has said that it will run more trains if there is demand. Railway board chairman VK Yadav said on Thursday that the railways would continue to run the trains if the demand arose from the states.On July 9, the last two trains departed from the Chennai Central station - one to Jodhpur with 1,449 passengers and second one to Howrah with 1,620 passengers, according to the data.Till date, railways have ferried 63.14 lakh migrants to their home states aboard 4,496 Shramik trains.Gujarat and Mahrashtra accounted for the highest number of Shramik trains originating from the states with 1027 and 844 trains, respectively. The maximum number of trains ferrying migrants were sent to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar with 1712 and 1507 trains, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-earned-rs-430-crore-from-shramik-special-train-fares/story-duFiaV9EILYEkbF4NpLiDK.html
24-07-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi accuses BJP of conspiracy to topple Rajasthan government||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of conspiring to bring down the Rajasthan government and advocated convening of assembly in the state on Friday evening following a prolonged siege at the Governor’s house by the state unit of the party led by chief minister Ashok Gehlot.“Country is ruled by the constitution and the laws. Governments are formed and run with a majority. BJP’s conspiracy to topple the Rajasthan government is very clear. This is an insult to eight crore people of the state. The governor should call for a session of the state’s assembly so that the nation gets to know the truth,” Rahul tweeted.Earlier, Ashok Gehlot led a large contingent of MLAs supporting him in buses to the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, where they laid siege on the lawns and shouted slogans demanding that Kalraj Mishra calls a session of the Rajasthan assembly.Gehlot, too, met the governor during the day seeking assurance that he will not succumb to “pressure” from above and take a decision on the matter in line with the constitution. Before the Congress MLAs gathered for a show of strength at the Raj Bhawan, Gehlot had issued a warning, saying his government will not be responsible if people of the state surrounded the governor’s house to protest against the delay in calling the session.Also Read: Rajasthan Guv writes to CM Gehlot, asks who is responsible for his security after MLAs’ protestGehlot has said that he will prove his government’s majority in the house ending speculations that it may not have the numbers after the rebellion by his former deputy and state congress chief Sachin Pilot and his 18 followers, also MLAs of the Congress party.The Congress MLAs left the governor house premises around 9 pm followed by a cabinet meeting called by Gehlot to discuss the current situation.Watch: Rajasthan Crisis | Mukul Rohatgi on high court’s order on disqualification rowCongress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said that governor Kalraj Mishra had given a note to Gehlot, which would be responded to immediately.“CM wants to prove majority, call the assembly session on Covid crisis and wants to silence those who say Congress doesn’t have a majority.

24-07-2020||India||Air Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari to take charge of Western Air Command amid tension at LAC||The Indian Air Force’s Western Air Command (WAC), whose responsibilities include the sensitive Ladakh sector, is set to get a new chief even as the IAF remains on its highest state of alert to deal with any military provocation by the Chinese forces amid tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the upcoming change of guard said on Friday.Air Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari will take charge of the Delhi-based WAC on August 1, said one of the officials cited above. Chaudhari was closely associated with the Rafale programme in a previous role, and the IAF is inducting its first batch of the fighters imported from France next week.He will replace Air Marshal B Suresh who will retire on July 31. Chaudhari is currently serving as the Senior Air Staff Officer at the Shillong-based Eastern Air Command. He earlier held the appointment of IAF deputy chief at the Air Headquarters in Delhi and steered a raft of key procurements.An experienced pilot, Chaudhari has logged more than 3,800 hours of flying on a variety of fighter planes such as MiG-21, Mig-29 and Sukhoi-30. He has commanded important fighter bases in his military career including one in Kashmir. He also flew air defence missions during the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan.Chaudhari, who was commissioned into air force’s fighter stream in December 1982, is assuming command of the WAC at a time when the IAF is inducting its new Rafale fighter jets and operationalising them at the earliest is a top priority for the air force.He was closely associated with the Rafale programme as IAF deputy chief --- he was the head of the bilateral high-level group monitoring the progress of the fighter jet project, said a second official.The IAF will induct its first batch of five Rafale jets at the Ambala air base, which comes under the WAC, on July 29. The air force could deploy the new fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, officials previously indicated to Hindustan Times. India is looking at arming its Rafale jets with an all-weather smart weapon of French origin that will allow combat pilots to engage ground targets from a standoff range of up to 60 km, as reported by HT on Thursday.The IAF is likely to initiate the purchase of Hammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) using the emergency financial powers granted to the military by the government at a time of heightened military tension with China.The other weapons that the Rafales will be armed with include Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to plug gaps in the IAF’s combat capabilities.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases including Leh, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-marshal-vivek-ram-chaudhari-to-take-charge-of-western-air-command-amid-tension-at-lac/story-XVW25BvpR7LYyGSQVgZyyH.html

This is the 23rd quake to jolt the northeastern state in the last five weeks. The quake on Friday occurred at 11.16 am and the epicentre was 29 km southeast of Champhai, the NCS said. The earthquake and heavy rains caused landslides at several places in the district, Champhai Deputy Commissioner Maria CT Zuali told PTI. She said two buildings have been vacated and the water supply pipeline to Dungtlang village was damaged due to landslides. The quantum of damage is yet to be ascertained as officials are assessing it, Zuali added Many people have set up makeshift tents and camps, and are sleeping outside their houses spooked by frequent quakes. The district administration has provided them tarpaulins, water tanks, solar lamps, first aid kits and eatables, according to officials. A series of earthquakes have hit the state since June 18 with remote Champhai being the worst-affected. Earthquakes have also rocked Saitual, Serchhip and Siaha districts. Earlier in the day, newly elected Rajya Sabha member from Mizoram K Vanlalvena, who is at present in the national capital, called on the secretary at the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences, M Rajeevan, and asked him to send a team to the state. Speaking to PTI from New Delhi, Vanlalvena said he urged the ministry to send seismologists to assess the cause of the frequent earthquakes. He said the secretary told him that they were taking the earthquakes in Mizoram seriously and would put forward the matter before higher authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earthquake-triggers-landslides-in-mizoram-23rd-to-hit-state-in-5-weeks/story-7KpnsdewNJUU9Ei5zICHHJ.html
24-07-2020||India||India, UK agree on steps to bolster trade relationship||India and the UK agreed on Friday to deepen their economic ties by removing additional barriers and working on an enhanced trade partnership that could possibly pave the way for a free trade agreement.During a virtual meeting of the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO), India’s commerce minister Piyush Goyal and UK’s international trade secretary Liz Truss also agreed to work on maximising the potential of the digital economies of the two countries, including on data regulation and interoperability.The meeting was held against the backdrop of India’s efforts to boost economic activity to overcome the impact of the Covid-19 crisis and to forge cooperation aimed at shaping new supply chains and the economic order in the post-pandemic era.The UK, which is in the process of exiting the European Union (EU), is keen to bolster economic ties with India, which is also being wooed by the 27 remaining countries in the bloc. India-UK trade was worth £24 billion last year, and India is now the second largest investor in the British economyTruss and Goyal agreed to explore opportunities for expanding and deepening the trade relationship. “This will include an enhanced trade partnership as the first step on a wider roadmap for a deeper trade partnership, and subject to progress could lead to a future free trade agreement,” a statement from the British high commission said.An Indian official familiar with developments, who declined to be named, said: “The UK is a very important ally of India and at this point in time, cooperation from the UK will be of immense importance. The UK has been supporting India’s cause at multilateral forums and we will further strengthen this relationship, which will span through trade, investment and cultural and strategic ties.”Britain’s international trade minister Ranil Jayawardena, who also joined the meeting, raised the issue of removing barriers for businesses in a range of sectors, including food and drink, healthcare, life sciences, IT, data, chemicals and services.The British side noted that the UK’s new Global Tariff, which comes into force on January 1 next year, will benefit Indian exporters by reducing tariffs on their goods by up to £40 million a year, assuming all duties are levied. It was also pointed out that UK companies have secured registration for polyhalite, a multi-nutrient fertiliser mined in Britain that could help Indian farmers to increase yields while supporting a cleaner and sustainable environment.“Increasing investment in each other’s markets is more important than ever as both economies seek to recover from the impact of Covid-19,” the British high commission’s statement said.The statement quoted Truss as saying that the meeting was an opportunity to “look at barriers preventing our trading relationship from reaching its full potential”. She described India as an “incredibly important partner” and said: “Today we agreed to look in detail at a framework for a deeper relationship. At this stage we want to keep all options on the table, including the possibility of a free trade agreement at some point in the future.”Jayawardena also led a business plenary, organised by the UK India Business Council (UKIBC), where the ministers spoke with businesses from both sides about the shared ambition to deepen the economic partnership.Jayawardena said: “We want to knock down existing trade barriers, create more good jobs and encourage innovation between two of the greatest democracies in the world.”Indian and British investments support more than half-a-million jobs in each other’s economies. There are 842 Indian companies based in the UK, employing more than 110,000 people and their revenues in the last fiscal were almost £41 billion.The UK is the second fastest growing G20 investor in India over the past 10 years, investing more than £22 billion and helping create more than 422,000 jobs. India is currently the second biggest investor in the UK, with 120 new projects and more than 5,000 new jobs in 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-uk-agree-on-steps-to-bolster-trade-relationship/story-HsRkywjEZx9DCBKGgbsbrI.html

The Governor told us he’ll abide by the Constitution. He gave the CM a note that is to be looked into, and then the Governor will have to follow Article 174 of the Constitution,” Randeep Singh Surjewala said. The Congress leader is one of the special observers appointed by the party to look into the Rajasthan political crisis.ALSO READ | ‘Confident Governor won’t buckle under pressure to defer assembly session’: Gehlot“We believe the Governor. A state cabinet meeting will be held tonight, the note will be looked into and a reply will be sent to the Governor by today,” Surjewala explained.Earlier on Friday, Gehlot accompanied by Congress legislators supporting him visited Governor Kalraj Mishra to urge him to convene the Rajasthan assembly by Monday and let him face a floor test. Gehlot’s meeting with the Governor came minutes after he accused Raj Bhavan of holding back orders to convene the assembly by Monday to let him prove his majority in the 200-member assembly.Gehlot has been stressing the need for an assembly session to discuss the coronavirus pandemic and the political situation in the state, which has been continuing for over two weeks now. ALSO READ | At Rajasthan Guv’s house, ‘Ashok Gehlot zindabad’ slogans to make a pointSurjewala has alleged that the entire nation has witnessed the way BJP is going against the mandate of the people in several states and trying to topple elected governments led by rival political parties.“The Rajasthan government and the CM are trying to prove their mandate, and want to call an assembly session to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis; and also to put an end to speculations which suggest that Congress does not have a mandate,” he said.Beginning tomorrow, the Congress in Rajasthan will hold a demonstration across the state against BJP. “Congress workers will hold protests at all district headquarters tomorrow at 11 am against the conspiracy to murder democracy by BJP,” said Govind Singh Dotasar, state Congress president. He added that if needed, Congress workers will also hold demonstrations at block, ward and panchayat level.“The BJP is conspiring to topple our government and the public is watching this. Efforts are also being made by “invisible powers” sitting in Delhi to influence the Governor. People want the elected government to complete its tenure,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mlas-end-protest-at-raj-bhawan-gehlot-to-chair-cabinet-meet-tonight/story-ZuhlGXmsLjyrmn19J3S2RL.html

Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, army chief General MM Naravane and navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh addressed the IAF’s top brass on jointness and integrated warfighting.Addressing the IAF’s commanders’ conference on its opening day, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday asked the air force to stay prepared for any eventuality, with Bhadauria asserting that IAF was poised to counter any aggressive action by the adversary.Singh said the swift deployment of the air force’s assets at forward locations in response to the current situation in eastern Ladakh “sent a strong message” to the adversary. Bhadauria also stressed on the need to focus on “the ability to handle situations at a short notice” to ensure a robust response.The defence minister last week said the progress in negotiations with China should help resolve the border dispute but he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved,” underlining that complex nature of the disengagement process along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-stresses-on-need-to-build-capacity-swiftly/story-vwpG78D3r3wMl0YuHYmmEL.html
24-07-2020||India||Restriction on domestic flights to remain in effect till November 24||The civil aviation ministry on Thursday extended the restrictions on domestic flights till November 24 in the view of the coronavirus pandemic. A notification by the ministry issued in the evening also said that the domestic airfare cap, too, will remain in place till November 24 or until further orders.Domestic flights were suspended on March 25 as the government announced a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the disease. Union aviation minister Hardeep Puri had earlier this month said that he hoped that the number of domestic flights will reach 55 – 60 percent of the pre-coronavirus levels by Diwali this year.He had also noted a continuous improvement in the domestic air traffic while stating that it had more than doubled by early July from the 30,000 fliers, who boarded flights on May 25, when phased reopening of the sector began after two months of suspension.Also Read: No flight operations at Kolkata airport on July 25, 29In an effort to boost the domestic sector, the ministry had last month cleared an increase in capacity of flight operations to 45% from 33% allowed previously. The Centre had capped domestic flights to a third of their approved summer schedule in an order passed on May 21.The government has maintained that it aims to further open up domestic routes in a calibrated fashion.According to ministry data, a total of 1,613 domestic flights operated on July 22 carrying 1,23,475 passengers.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe domestic aviation industry is facing financial losses as they are operating at limited capacity with fares capped for different sectors. The poor load factor has also impacted the industry’s capacity to exploit their allowed quota of flights.Country’s prominent private carrier IndiGo has decided to lay off 10% of its employees and a global aviation consultancy, CAPA, has predicted that a couple of Indian airlines may go out of business due to the current financial pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restriction-on-domestic-flights-to-remain-in-effect-till-november-24-ministry/story-5AoOHsxsNP44e2M5iUZnWL.html
24-07-2020||India||At border talks with China, India puts focus on ‘complete’ disengagement at LAC||India and China discussed early and complete disengagement of the troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and de-escalation from India-China border areas in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols, according to an official statement by external affairs ministry. India stressed that full restoration of peace and tranquillity was essential for smooth overall development of bilateral relationsThe reaffirmation of the need for complete disengagement, de-escalation and full restoration of peace was made in the 17th meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs held on Friday.India was represented by a team led by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and the Chinese team was led by Hong Liang, director general of the boundary and oceanic affairs department of China’s foreign ministry.The talks between the two sides came amid a deadlock on the ground despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels. The disengagement process at some points of the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) including Pangong Tso and Depsang had virtually halted. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, too, had said that it was not possible to “guarantee” the outcome of talks with China.On the eve of the talks, external affairs ministry had said that it expected Chinese side will “sincerely” work with India for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas at the earliest as agreed to by the Special Representatives.The Friday statement underscored the point.“The two sides noted that this was in accordance with the agreement reached between the two Special Representatives (SRs) during their telephonic conversation on 5 July 2020. They agreed in this regard that it was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between Senior Commanders in their meetings till date,” the statement said.A statement from the Chinese foreign ministry has described the talks held on Friday as “candid and in-depth” and claimed that both sides acknowledged positive progress made in disengagement of troops at the frontline.“The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on the recent Sino-Indian border situation and fully affirmed the positive progress made by the front-line border defence forces of the two countries to disengage from contact and ease the situation on the ground,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement released Friday evening.The Indian government’s statement, however, did not reflect the progress that Beijing alluded to. It said another round of meeting of the senior commanders could be held soon to complete the process of disengagement and de-escalation. Military commanders have already held four rounds of detailed discussions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-agrees-for-complete-disengagement-from-lac-during-latest-round-of-talks-government/story-vB1bvk5jDmN8CQMO3mFZ7K.html
24-07-2020||India||No relaxation on 4G internet curbs in Jammu and Kashmir for now: Centre tells SC||A special committee constituted as per the Supreme Court’s May 11 order to review internet restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has decided against affording any relaxation to such restrictions for the time being, the Central government told the Supreme Court on July 21.In the affidavit filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), it was stated that the special committee held a meeting on June 10, where it comprehensively considered all aspects of the matter including terrorist related incidents in J&K before deciding to continue with the restrictions on 4G mobile internet.“A thorough and comprehensive consideration of all facets of the matter including recent occurrence of terrorism related incidents in the region was carried out (by the committee). Ultimately, based on wide-ranging assessment of the prevailing situation in this sensitive region, the committee arrived at a decision that no further relaxation on restrictions on internet services, including 4G services, could be carried out at present. It was also decided that the next review of the committee would be carried out in two months,” the affidavit filed by the MHA said.The response came on a plea by NGO, Foundation of Media Professionals praying for initiation of contempt of court proceedings against the Central government and the Union Territory of J&K on the ground that no action was taken to comply with the top court’s judgment of May 11 to review restrictions on internet.The May 11 order was passed by the top court on a plea filed by the NGO in April challenging the order issued by the J&K administration on March 26 restricting internet speed in mobile data to 2G and praying that 4G internet services be restored in Jammu and Kashmir. The petitioner had claimed that patients, doctors, and general public of J&K were unable to access latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions about Covid-19 because of restrictions on mobile internet speed to 2G.“Various public health practitioners, medical professionals, and doctors have repeatedly expressed their concern about wasting precious time trying to download the latest studies, protocols, manuals and advisories on treatment and management of Covid-19. In some cases, doctors are not able to access these resources at all, due to the internet speed being too slow to download heavy files,” it was stated.Further, it was also pointed out that slow internet speed also renders telemedicine (diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunication) or online video consultation impossible.The Supreme Court, in its May 11 judgment, refrained from passing directions to restore 4G mobile internet services in J&K instead constituting the special committee comprising high level government officers to take a call on the same and examine the necessity to allow faster internet in certain geographical areas of the newly formed union territory. The committee was to comprise the secretary of Ministry of Home Affairs, secretary of Ministry of Communications and the chief secretary of J&K.The NGO then approached the court in June filing the present contempt petition submitting that there is no information available in the public domain about whether the constitution of the special committee has been notified and whether it has conducted any meetings or passed any orders.The MHA, however, told the court that the committee stood constituted by the May 11 order of the Supreme Court itself and no separate notification was required in this regard from the central government.The special committee met on May 15 to review the restrictions and decided to obtain further inputs before taking any decision. It subsequently met on June 10 and decided not to relax the restrictions, the centre said.“In view of the above, the contempt petition is misconceived and without any merit and is liable to be rejected”, the affidavit added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-relaxation-on-4g-internet-curbs-in-jammu-and-kashmir-for-now-centre-tells-sc/story-zFU8G37Nh4p5KhR42siX8O.html
24-07-2020||India||Unrelenting floods without respite add to Assam’s plight this monsoon||Floods are an annual feature of Assam’s calendar and 4-5 waves of deluge usually strike the state between April and August each year.But this year heavy rains, almost without any long break, has led to more suffering for the state’s residents who are already witnessing the third wave of floods this monsoon.“Usually we have a gap period between successive waves of floods in Assam, which allows water level in rivers to come down and flood waters to dry. But this year rainfall has been almost continuous for weeks and it has aggravated the situation. This is unusual,” said eminent water expert Dulal Goswami.“Though excess rainfall could be a factor, we have to consider that global climate change could also be responsible. According to a government study done in 2018, Assam was found to be the most vulnerable to changing climate among 12 states in the Indian Himalayan Region,” he added.According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) since the beginning of June, the state has recorded 20% more rainfall—894.4 mm till July 22 against the normal of around 743.9 mm.“We are witnessing a pattern in past few years where unlike in the past when rainfall used to get spread over a few months but now it seems most of the rainfall is taking place in one go,” said Mirza Zulfiqur Rahman, visiting research associate, Institute of Chinese Studies, Delhi.“Climate change is definitely a factor for this and such erratic events will continue. We need to see if we are prepared for this when 2-3 waves of floods happen almost at once. It is important to talk of floods as a livelihood issue and not discuss this only when the disaster strikes,” he added. Both experts said instead of piecemeal and sporadic efforts, a holistic approach needs to be taken to address the annual floods keeping into consideration people’s livelihoods and that Brahmaputra and other major rivers in the state have their own characteristics. As per Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) data, over 27 lakh people in 26 of the state’s 33 districts were still affected by floods on Friday. This season 96 persons have died due to drowning and another 26 in landslides caused by heavy rains.Over 50,000 displaced persons were taking shelter in 301 relief camps. Flood waters have also inundated over 1.22 hectares of crop area across the state.“We are witnessing the third wave of floods at present. Rainfall and flooding has been taking place since May end. While rainfall has taken place as per IMD prediction, climate change could be a reason for lack of gap between waves of floods,” said Pankaj Chakraborty, state project coordinator, ASDMA.Kaziranga still inundated by flood waters; Britain’s Prince William shockedFloods continue to affect Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) with 85% of the park spread over 430 sq km inundated. This season 125 animals of the park including 13 rhinos (9 due to drowning and 4 due to natural causes) have died in and around the park.The situation at the park evoked reactions from Britain’s Prince William, the second in the line of succession to the British throne, who wrote to KNPTR director P. Sivakumar on July 21 expressing his and his wife Catherine’s feelings.“Catherine and I were heartbroken to hear about the appalling devastation to Kaziranga National Park and its precious wildlife caused by the very heavy monsoon flooding,” said the letter.“We have the happiest memories of our visit to Kaziranga in April 2016 and are shocked by what has happened. The deaths of so many animals including one-horned rhino, is deeply upsetting,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unrelenting-floods-without-respite-add-to-assam-s-plight-this-monsoon/story-XQVNjX4fUwKRv3m2WE6UFJ.html
24-07-2020||India||Jamshedpur Bandh on Saturday against Rs 1 lakh fine, 2-year jail order for not wearing mask||A day long shutdown has been announced in Jharkhand’s industrial city of Jamshedpur on Saturday to protest state government’s ordinance mandating Rs 1 lakh fine and 2-year jail term for violation of Covid-19 safety protocols like wearing masks and social distancing etc. Announcing this, business and trade organizations here on Friday said that all the markets would henceforth shut down voluntarily by 6 pm from Saturday onwards.The trade body said they have been in support of Covid-19 safety measures and also backed its strict enforcement but the provision for Rs 1 lakh fine and 2 year jail term is impractical.“But this new order by the state government-- Rs 1 lakh fine and 2-year jail term-- is too much and impractical. It will lead to blackmailing and corruption. Hence, we have called for a Jamshedpur bandh on Saturday in opposition to this order and decided to close down all shops and markets by 6 pm from tomorrow onwards,” Ashok Bhalotia, Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) president, said here today.Also Read: Jharkhand reports 403 new Covid-19 cases; recovery rate at 45.40%Bhalotia has also written to chief minister (CM) Hemant Soren to reconsider the order he described as ‘arbitrary and anti-common people’. The Soren cabinet had passed the Jharkhand State Epidemic Diseases Ordinance-2020 (JSEDO-2020) on Wednesday, mandating Rs 1 lakh fine and 2-year jail term for not wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and violation of other such Covid-19 protocols.It was also decided that the business, industry and trading community would wear black badges in protest. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mahanagar president Gunjan Yadav also announced party’s moral support to the Jamshedpur bandh tomorrow.For Coronavirus Live Updates“This is a black law, a Tuglaqui farman. BJP is extending full support to the Jamshedpur bandh tomorrow by business and industry organizations against this order. The government was sleeping when women in quarantine got pregnant despite being in custody. The government should distribute masks, sanitizers to the residents, provide Covid-19 beds, increase tests, expedite test reports and treatment facilities. Instead, it is burdening already poor, unemployed and distressed people with Rs 1 lakh fine and jail threat,” said Gunjan.Former CM Babaulal Marandi has also written to the Soren requesting him to reconsider this order while party state spokesperson Kunal Sarangi wondered if the government would levy similar fine and jail-term on its own ministers who he claimed were flouting lockdown rules and Covid-19 safety protocols with impunity.“Where was the government when its own minister and coalition leaders attended Lalu Parasad’s meeting in RIMS while the latter was in judicial custody! This order will facilitate extortion, bribe culture at lower administrative and police levels. Government should focus on augmenting health infrastructure, providing citizens with proper medical care, hospitals, bed, ambulances and speedy tests and results,” said Sarangi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jamshedpur-bandh-on-saturday-against-rs-1-lakh-fine-2-year-jail-order-for-not-wearing-mask/story-5gilUu38Fd8xtovu05SbwN.html
24-07-2020||India||India has one of world’s lowest Covid-19 infection, death rate: Harsh Vardhan||At 864 cases and less than 21 deaths per million population, India has one of the world’s lowest Covid-19 infection and death rate, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday said underlining that the recovery rate among coronavirus-infected patients in the country is 63.45 per cent and the mortality is 2.3 per cent.These remarks were made by Vardhan at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Health Ministers’ Digital Meet held digitally, the health ministry said.According to the ministry’s statement, Vardhan emphasised on how the Indian traditional system of medicine has also contributed substantially in boosting the immunity of general population during Covid-19.“There is currently no institutional mechanism within SCO to discuss cooperation in traditional medicine that has the potential to fulfil the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 and also reinforce the effective implementation of the joint statement on cooperation in combating epidemics signed at the Qingdao Summit in 2018,” the statement quoted him as saying.“This is in spite of such complementary medicine systems being widely practised in all member states of our SCO,” he said and proposed the setting up of a new sub-group on traditional medicine under the existing institutional meetings of the SCO health ministers.Expressing his condolences at the loss of lives across the world due to Covid-19, Vardhan described the India’s political commitment to contain the pandemic and spoke on how Prime Minister Narendra Modi has “personally monitored the situation and ensured a pre-emptive, pro-active and graded response to prevent the deadly virus from spreading”.He explained that a series of actions were initiated in a graded way that included issuing of travel advisories, point-of-entry surveillance, community-based surveillance, enhancement of laboratory and hospital surge capacities, wide dissemination of technical guidelines on managing different aspects of disease outbreak and communicating risk to the public. “The consecutive lockdowns provided India with much required time and opportunity to build up on technical knowhow, laboratory capacities, hospital infrastructure and also to build up its pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions,” Vardhan said.Speaking on the result of the lockdown he said, “India has so far reported 1.25 million cases and more than 30,000 deaths due to Covid. At 864 cases per million and less than 21 deaths per million of our population, India has one of the world’s lowest infection and death rate. “Our recovery rate stands at 63.45% whereas our mortality at 2.3 per cent.” The Union Health Minister also spoke on the increase in testing capacity and health infrastructure during the lockdown and after, the statement said.On logistics, Vardhan said, “India didn’t have a single manufacturer of personal protective equipment (PPE) and now the country has developed indigenous capacity in the past few months to the extent that the country can export quality PPEs. “Similar scaling up was also done for achieving other indigenous capacity and reducing the demand & supply gap for ventilators and medical oxygen.” He also elaborated on the innovative use of information technology in virtually every aspect of Covid management.“Aarogya Setu app and ITIHAS, a cellular-based tracking technology, are used for surveillance and identification of potential clusters of disease, RT-PCR app for testing, facility app for managing information on admitted patients and hospital bed capacities, all integrated with a single Covid portal.” According to the statement, Vardhan called upon all member nations to rise in this time of crisis and mitigate the effect of Covid on health and economy. He also congratulated all the frontline staff dealing with the pandemics and called them “no less than God for humanity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-one-of-world-s-lowest-covid-19-infection-death-rate-harsh-vardhan/story-dfDV9dS2dt8MCLDWMfYq6H.html
24-07-2020||India||‘No bouncers are guarding us, nor are we ill or crying’: MLA in Pilot camp||A group of dissident Congress MLAs supporting Sachin Pilot in the fight against Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot released short videos debunking the charge that they were held hostage by the BJP. Underscoring that that his government has a complete majority of the Congress and its allies in the 200-member state assembly, Gehlot said, “Everyone is aware that a small section of our MLAs have been held captive in a hotel outside the state under the watch of bouncers and police of other states.”Suresh Modi, an MLAs in the Sachin Pilot camp, said the statements made the CM do not fit his stature. The legislator found fault with the CM’s working style and accused him of not doing any work in his constituency. “I want to make it clear, na hume bandhak bana ke rakha hai, na bouncer baithe hai, na bimaar hai, na aasu baha rahe hain, na wahan aane ke liye tadap rahe hain (We are not held hostage, nor are there bouncers, nor are we crying or ill, and nor are we dying to go back there),” said Suresh Modi in Hindi in a video message, stressing that he was staying away of his own free will.  #WATCH: "Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot said we are held hostage by BJP, I want to clarify that it is not so... We are here at our own will as despite our efforts he didn't listen to any of our demands related to work in our constituencies," says MLA Suresh Modi from Sachin Pilot camp pic.twitter.com/Y1ZU2elw5UThe CM, however, maintains that he has learnt that the MLAs want to “break free of their captivity” and go along with the government. “This will become evident in some time,” Gehlot said, when asked whether the Rajasthan Congress is in touch with MLAs in the Pilot camp.Murali Meena, another MLA in the Pilot camp, reiterated that he and other rebels are still Congress members. He alleged that the CM’s working style forced him and others to take this step. “Galat aarop (wrong allegations)” are being levelled against us, said the legislator, adding “dukh hua (felt pain)”. “We are staying in Delhi. CM Ashok Gehlot said we are held hostage by BJP, it’s untrue as we were never in touch with them. On the contrary, our families are scared due to use of SOG by the CM,” said Murali Meena.The Rajasthan speaker had issued disqualification notices against the 19 dissident MLAs, who challenged it in the high court. On Friday, the court ordered status quo and said there will be no action for now on the disqualification notices against the dissident MLAs.“Few people sitting in Jaipur are claiming that we are being held hostage. We came here on our own will. Infact, I got a pass made through the DM to reach here,” said Vedprakash Solanki, another MLAs in team Pilot. Team Pilot has said that issuance of disqualification notice by the speaker is a violation of their freedom of speech right and merely disagreeing with the leader does not amount to defection. The chief minister also reiterated his allegation that top BJP leaders were involved in the conspiracy to dislodge his government. Asked about the BJP’s claim that current developments in Rajasthan are a reflection of internal Congress factionalism, he said, “Can anyone say that the BJP does not have a hand in current developments in the state... Audio tapes in the public domain, raids on my close aides, hospitality offered to Congress MLAs by BJP-led Haryana government, prove BJP’s hand in this matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-bouncers-are-guarding-us-nor-are-we-ill-or-crying-mla-in-pilot-camp/story-ByTUDV9CARwG12p9dZREIJ.html

The United States, Russia, France and Israel are among the countries that India plans to import the weaponry from.India is looking at sourcing from Israel the Firefly loitering ammunition, Spike anti-tank guided missiles, Spice guidance kits that can mounted on standard bombs to convert them into smart weapons and an operational surface-to-air missile system as a 2017 order worth $2 billion for such advanced systems to take down hostile aircraft and missiles hasn’t translated into deliveries yet, the officials said.Israel has been a reliable military partner and has stood by India, said Air Marshal KK Nohwar (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “Israel has always given us niche technologies in areas of electronic warfare systems and weapons systems that were not readily forthcoming from other countries,” Nohwar said.The government has authorised the armed forces to process cases for buying urgently-needed weapons and equipment worth up to Rs 300 crore to meet their critical operational requirements. The decision was taken at a special meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council --- India’ apex procurement body --- on July 15 to fast-track key purchases.Singh sought greater participation of Israeli defence companies in the defence manufacturing sector under the new liberalised foreign direct investment (FDI) regime, the statement said.From raising FDI in defence manufacturing to creating a separate budget for buying locally-made military hardware and notifying a list of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported, the government in May announced a raft of measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector.In early July, the defence ministry approved the purchase of weapons and ammunition worth Rs 38,900 crore. The cost of military hardware cleared for purchase from the domestic industry is pegged at Rs 31,130 crore and the orders are expected to give a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-Reliant India Movement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-israel-to-deepen-military-cooperation-amid-border-row/story-TevqNLchqH4MNPHkkQAJkM.html

The entire process and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) of the drug has been transferred to Cipla to manufacture and market the drug at scale,” the statement says.Favipiravir is an off patent, oral antiviral drug, originally discovered by Fuji Pharma in Japan, and has shown promise in clinical trials for treatment of Covid-19 patients, especially in mild and moderate cases.Director of CSIR-IICR S Chandrashekhar was quoted by news agency PTI as saying that the technology transferred to Cipla is very efficient and affordable, allowing the company to make large quantities of the product within a short span of time.Also Read: Coronavirus protein redesigned in lab, may enable fast, stable vaccine productionCSIR director general Shekhar C Mande said Ciplenza was another example of the institute’s commitment to work with the industry to develop quick solutions and products for mitigation of Covid-19.Earlier in June, drug manufacturing firm Glenmark Pharmaceuticals was given approval from the Indian drug regulator to launch oral antiviral drug favipiravir for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 patients in the country.Another Indian pharmaceutical company Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (Dr Reddy’s) had recently announced signing a tripartite agreement with two international firms based in Japan and the UAE for the development, manufacturing and sales of favipiravir innovator brand Avigan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cipla-launching-covid-treatment-drug-ciplenza-in-august-rs-68-per-tablet/story-pEGUAYKbUz319Bzhrpgc9L.html

He also does not have any co-morbid conditions.“The first dose of 0.5 ml intramuscular injection was given to him around 1.30 pm. No immediate side-effects have been observed so far. He was under observation for two hours and will be monitored for the next seven days,” Rai said. Few more participants would be given the vaccine on Saturday after their screening reports come.AIIMS-Delhi is among the 12 sites selected by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting phase I and II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of Covaxin. In phase I, the vaccine would be tested on 375 volunteers and the maximum of 100 of them would be from AIIMS. The second phase would include around 750 volunteers from all 12 sites together, Rai said. Phase I of the vaccine trial will be done on healthy people aged 18-55 years having no co-morbid conditions. Women with no pregnancy will also be selected to be a part of the trial in the first phase. In the second phase, 750 people will be recruited between 12-65 years, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria had said.Already, around 1,800 volunteers have registered themselves for the trial at AIIMS, he had said.“In the first phase we see the safety of the vaccine which is of primary importance and the dose range is also calculated,” he said.There are three formulations of the vaccine, and each subject will be given any one of the formulation in two doses two weeks apart.The first 50 will get the lowest strength dose of the vaccine. If it is found to be safe in them, then it will be given to another 50 patients in high doses, acording to Rai.Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin, developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), had recently got the nod for human clinical trials from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-dose-of-covid-19-candidate-covaxin-administered-to-30-yr-old-at-aiims-delhi/story-jttBRw99uJnETubSivMZ0I.html

The park has been hit by three waves of flood so far this year with 92 per cent of its area submerged in waters and 123 animals, including 12 rhinos, dead. In a letter to the park’s Director P Sivakumar, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said they were heartbroken to hear about the appalling devastation to the Kaziranga National Park and its wildlife caused by very heavy monsoon flooding. “We have the happiest memories of our visit to Kaziranga in April 2016 and are shocked by what has happened,” Prince William wrote in the letter, which was made available to the press by park authorities on Friday. The deaths of so many animals, including the one- horned rhino, is deeply upsetting, he said. “We know from our visit how dedicated all the staff in Kaziranga are in caring for the park’s wildlife, and can only begin to imagine what a difficult time this must be,” he said. Expressing their appreciation for the park’s rangers, the Duke said, “Catherine and I greatly admire all the work that you and the rangers at Kaziranga are doing to risk your own safety, rescue animals and contain the damage.” The loss of life and livelihoods in Assam as a result of the flooding, coming on top of the Covid-19 pandemic, is deeply distressing, he said. “We offer our deepest condolences to all those affected,” the Duke said. The park director said that they are deeply moved by the letter, which is full of compassion and concern for the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve. “In difficult times like this, a message from the Duke is surely a morale booster for all,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shocked-by-what-has-happened-prince-william-kate-middleton-on-flood-devastation-in-kaziranga/story-JDGnBkY7FwZBmzsK4gP3dJ.html
24-07-2020||India||Rehana says kids painted her body for sex education, court rejects argument, bail plea||The Kerala High Court on Friday rejected the bail petition of activist Rehana Fathima who is facing a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) and other charges for posting a video of her minor children painting on her partially-naked body.The court rejected her contention that she allowed her children to paint her to impart sex education. The court observed that while she was free to do this privately in her house to educate children, the intention behind her publicizing the video of the act cannot be good and it attracted charges related to obscene representation of children. Her video with her two children--a 14-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl-- had triggered much outrage after it was circulated last month, prompting police to book her under Pocso, Juvenile Justice Act and other sections. A lower court turned down her bail plea following which she moved the high court. Also Read: Neuberg Diagnostics gets ICMR approval for COVID testing in KeralaHer plea states her acts were intended to enable her children to view body and body parts “as a different medium altogether rather than seeing it as a sexual look alone.” She also stated that if children grew up seeing natural bodies, “their minds will be liberated of hyper-sexualization of women.” “In a sexually frustrated society, women simply do not feel safe in clothes. It is high time to open up and tell children what the female body is all about and what sex and sexuality really mean,” she said in her plea. The court had earlier watched the video and rejected her contention and asked her to stand trial. “If the painting on the body of the petitioner happened inside four walls of her house, there cannot be any offence. After watching the picture, the court appreciates the talents of children. But not in the way the petitioner encouraged them by uploading the video. We cannot accept her view it was part of sex education,” the single bench headed by Justice P V Kunhikrishnan observed. After the HC decision, Fathima said she will move the Supreme Court soon.Initially, Fathima had posted the video clip on Facebook but later she uploaded it on YouTube. She rationalized her act by saying her kids did the painting while she was resting and called it a beautiful artwork. “Just as beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, so is porn in the eyes of the beholder,” she wrote in the post. There was a big outcry after her post surfaced. Fathima was dismissed as a junior technician with the BSNL in Ernakulam in May this year after many cases came up against her. Last year she was arrested on a complaint filed by a right wing activist claiming she hurt the religious feelings of the Hindu community by posting an objectionable picture on social media. She was in jail for two months.After her unsuccessful attempt to trek to Sabarimala temple in 2018 along with a Hyderabad-based digital journalist Kavitha Jakkala, she was excommunicated by the Muslim Jamaath Council. Her house was later vandalised by protestors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rehana-says-kids-painted-her-body-for-sex-education-court-rejects-argument-bail-plea/story-hs6RzqApPLH7qePHXrWJxH.html

Through his bold leadership, our country was able to overcome many challenges successfully. The Union Budget of July 24, 1991, paved the way for the economic transformation of our country,” it added.Sonia also mentioned that Rao’s tenure was marked by a number of political, social, and foreign policy achievements and highlighted that he was a dedicated Congressman.“I congratulate the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee for having organised these year-long celebrations. PV Narasimha Rao was a very respected national and international figure. The Congress party takes pride in his many accomplishments and contributions,” she added. అనేక సవాళ్లు, అనిశ్చితి. ఈ పరిస్థితుల్లో ముందుండి సమస్యలపై పోరు సలిపి, అంతర్గతంగా, అంతర్జాతీయంగా, ఆర్థికంగా, సామాజికంగా దేశానికి కొత్త దిశను చూపిన మహానేత, కాంగ్రెస్ శిఖరంమన పీవీ నరసింహ రావుగారు. అయన శతజయంతి ఉత్సాహం కాంగ్రెస్ కే కాదు, దేశానికే ఏడాదిపాటు పండగ.#PVNarasimhaRao pic.twitter.com/4iZQARSoozRahul too congratulated the Telangana unit for organising the year-long celebrations to commemorate Rao’s many achievements.“On this occasion, we celebrate the legacy of a man whose contribution continues to shape modern India. From joining the Congress party in his teenage years to becoming the Prime Minister of the largest democracy, his remarkable political journey reflected his grit and determination,” Rahul said in a statement.“July 24 marks the twenty-ninth anniversary of the 1991 budget. On this day, India embarked on a bold new path of economic transformation. Rao and Dr Manmohan Singh played a pivotal role in ushering in the era of liberalisation,” he added.The Congress has earlier been accused of distancing itself from the former prime minister. When Rao died in 2004, unlike other prime ministers and party chiefs, his mortal remains were kept outside the AICC office. Rao’s grandson, NV Subhash, even went on record to say that he had been ‘sidelined’ by the party. Subash told a news agency that Sonia and Rahul should apologise for the ‘injustice’ done to him. Rao, who started his career as a young party worker, served as a legislator in erstwhile undivided Andhra Pradesh from 1957 to 1977. As a cabinet minister (1962 to 1970), he handled various portfolios, after which he served as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh in 1971.In 1972, Rao became a member of parliament and finally took over as prime minister in 1991. Rao is considered one the architects of the LPG (liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation) policies in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-rahul-gandhi-praise-bold-pv-narasimha-rao-neglected-for-years/story-BMYuOfBrrGVaHn49xWcPCK.html

24-07-2020||India||Narasimha Rao can truly be called father of economic reforms in India: Manmohan Singh||Former prime minister P V Narasimha Rao was a “great son of the soil” and he can truly be called the father of economic reforms in India as he had both the vision and the courage to push them forward, Manmohan Singh, who was finance minister in his cabinet, said on Friday.Singh, while addressing the inaugural function of the year-long birth centenary celebrations of the late prime minister organised by the Congress’s Telangana unit, said he is particularly happy that the programme coincides with the presentation of the first budget of Rao’s government by him in 1991.The 1991 budget is hailed by many as one that laid the foundations of a modern India and the roadmap for pushing economic reforms in the country.Recalling that he as finance minister in the Narasimha Rao cabinet had dedicated his first budget to the memory of Rajiv Gandhi, Singh said the 1991 budget changed India in many ways as it ushered in economic reforms and liberalisation.“It was a hard choice and a bold decision and it was possible because prime minister Narasimha Rao gave me the freedom to roll out things, after he fully understood what was ailing India’s economy at that time,” Singh, a former prime minister, said online.“On this day, while inaugurating his birth centenary celebrations, I pay my humble respects to the man who had the vision and the courage to push these reforms,” the Congress leader said, adding that Rao, like former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, had great concern for the country’s poor. Singh also said that Rao was a “friend, philosopher and guide” to him in many ways. Real tough decisions had to be urgently taken in 1991 as India was faced with a foreign exchange crisis, and with foreign exchange reserves down to about two weeks’ imports, it brought the nation to the edge of a precipice, he said. “But then, politically, it was a big question if one could take hard decisions to meet the challenging situation. It was a precariously placed minority government, which was dependent on outside support for stability. Yet Narasimha Rao ji was able to carry everyone along, convincing them with his conviction. Enjoying his confidence, I went about my job to carry forward his vision,” Singh said.Quoting French poet and novelist Victor Hugo, Singh said he had once said that “no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come”. India’s emergence as a major economic power was one such idea, he said. “There was an arduous journey ahead but it was time to let the whole world know loud and clear that India was wide awake. The rest is history. Looking back, Narasimha Rao can truly be called the father of economic reforms in India,” the former prime minister said.Singh also recalled the political journey of Rao that started from the days of the freedom struggle.Rao as a Union cabinet minister had held important portfolios of human resource development and external affairs, and was an important member of the Congress, who had worked very closely with late Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, he said. Singh said Rao was chosen to become the Congress president after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and became the automatic choice to become prime minister on June 21, 1991. “It was on this day that he made me his finance minister,” he said.While economic reforms and liberalisation were indeed his biggest contribution, his contributions to the country in different fields cannot be underestimated, Singh said On the foreign affairs front, he said Rao made efforts to improve the “relationship with our neighbours including China and India signed the South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement along with the SAARC countries”. “Then the ‘Look East Policy’ was also his brainchild to link India with East and South-East Asian countries,” the Congress leader said.It was also under his leadership that the Indian space programme got an impetus with the successful testing of the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) and the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Singh recalled.He noted that India also successfully tested the Prithvi missile to strengthen and enhance external security capability then.Rao had also asked late Dr APJ Abdul Kalam in 1996 to get ready for nuclear tests to take India to join a new league, which were later conducted by under the prime minister Vajpayee-led NDA Government in 1998, Singh said.“That was a difficult era in politics. Endowed with a cool temperament and deep political prowess Narasimha Rao ji was always open to debates and discussion. He always tried to take the opposition into confidence,” he said, adding that deputing Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the leader of the Indian delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission was one such example.Former prime minister Rao left behind an unmatched legacy of being a linguist, well versed in 10 Indian and four foreign languages and a scholar, Singh said. He was one of the first converts to new technology by not only becoming adept with using a computer but also became proficient with programming. This was possible because he was always willing to learn new things, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narasimha-rao-can-truly-be-called-father-of-economic-reforms-in-india-manmohan-singh/story-bXkxbjotr1lsrmj1ISYWCN.html

On Thursday night, the wild elephant got electrocuted, when it came in contact with the farm’s electric wires,” Pandey said.In June, six elephants were killed in the state’s four districts, including carcasses of two tuskers were recovered from the Pratappur forest range in Surajpur district and another was found dead in the neighbouring Balrampur district.Later, two elephants were electrocuted at Dharamjaigarh in Raigarh district and a calf died after getting stuck at a marshland in Dhamtari district.The state forest department took cognisance of a spate of elephant deaths and launched an awareness campaign in June in the northern plains to encourage farmers to use bio-insecticides and bio-fertilisers.The authorities have also issued an order to divisional forest officer (DFO) of Dharamjaigarh in Raigarh district, which has reported the maximum number of elephant deaths by electrocution in the last 10 years and directed him to take necessary steps to prevent such incidents. The order stated that the forest department should ensure that 11 kilo-volts (KV) of power transmission lines, which have caused deaths of pachyderms should be installed 7.5 metres above the ground-level and insulated electric wires should be used in these areas that fall within the elephant corridor.Forest officials have been directed to coordinate with Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company Limited (CSPGCL) in a bid to detect illegal connections and live wires in areas that fall in the elephant corridor.The state forest department data showed that the population of wild elephants in Chhattisgarh has risen from 225 to 290 in the past 10 years.Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has issued guidelines for the monitoring of wild animals and also improving measures for their conservation.North Chhattisgarh is home to around 240 wild elephants, which have claimed several human lives and loss of properties in the region over the past few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-wild-elephant-killed-in-jashpur-district-seventh-death-in-last-two-months/story-D0iE5970ej0wBEAPm1RILP.html

Acting on the input, Vaze’s team on July 18 visited a jetty at the New Ferry Wharf located at Bhaucha Dhakka, Mazgaon and found a tugboat ‘Barsaatu’ there.The boat is owned by Hind Offshore Private Limited, having its office at Ballard Estate. Barsaatu is at the New Ferry Wharf Jetty since May 29, 2020 and there were nine crew members on board.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOn examining the tug boat in presence of panchas (witnesses) the police found 43,104 litres of diesel worth nearly Rs 35 lakh on the boat. When crime branch officials asked boat’s chief engineer Debashish Vishwas, 48, and master Ismail Mujawar, 59, about the diesel they could not give satisfactory answers or produce any relevant documents. They were asked to produce relevant documents justifying the presence of huge quantities of diesel by July 21, however, they failed.Preliminary probe revealed that the boat in question wasn’t in operations by the company since the last three years, despite that it was being used for some other purposes, as per an official.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Investigators suspect that the accused used the boat to either steal the diesel or illegally procure it from other foreign vessels at sea to further illegally sell it in the black market,” said a crime branch official requesting anonymity.On July 23, the police arrested superintendent of the boat Rajesh Kute, chief engineer Vishwas and master Mujawar under sections 3, 7, 8 and 9 of Essential Commodities Act and 379 and 120B of Indian Penal Code. They were produced in a court on Friday and remanded in police custody up to July 27.The police are looking for the directors of the company for questioning.However, the lawyer of the arrested accused, Ravi Hirani said, “My clients have legally purchased the said diesel and have relevant documents to prove the same. The said diesel has not been procured by stealing, if that was the case then why is there not even a single complaint from any one till date. It is a totally false case against my clients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-arrested-in-mumbai-over-43-000-litres-of-smuggled-diesel-found-in-a-boat/story-bzbPDwEIVKbQDeAlKLBkcP.html
24-07-2020||India||Rajasthan HC defers order in Pilot vs Gehlot case: Issue and implications||The Rajasthan high court (HC) on Friday deferred its final verdict on the plea filed by 19 rebel Congress lawmakers, including sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot challenging the assembly Speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notice.It admitted the case and framed 12 legal questions that it will examine. Since the matter has been admitted, it is unlikely to come up for hearing for long.HC ordered the Speaker to maintain status quo effectively barring him from acting on the notice of disqualification.What are the implications of the HC order?1. Speaker Joshi cannot decide disqualification plea against Pilot and other members of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs) for the time being.2. When can the Speaker act?If the Supreme Court (SC) stays the HC order, then the Speaker can act. The SC is slated to take up the matter for hearing on Monday on the larger legal question of HC’s jurisdiction to interfere with a Speaker’s proceedings. If the SC on Monday stays the HC order, then he can proceed with the disqualification proceedings.But such relief is unlikely because the SC had declined stay, when the matter was heard on Thursday.If the SC does not stay the HC order, then the Speaker cannot act until the HC pronounces its verdict one way or the other.This will take a while since the HC has admitted the matter for a hearing, which means the case will draft on for long.3. What are the issues that the SC is examining?The SC is deciding the limited legal question of whether an HC can interfere with the disqualification proceedings initiated by the Speaker before he gives his decision on the disqualification plea.The SC in its 1992 judgment in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillu had held that that judicial review should not cover any stage prior to the making of a decision by the Speaker/Chairman. No interference would be permissible at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings, the court had said.The court is proposing to re-examine this legal principle. If the three-judge SC bench, which is currently hearing the case, thinks that the five-judge bench judgment needs re-consideration, then it might have to send the matter to a larger bench of seven judges.In that scenario, the SC verdict will also take long.4. What are the issues HC is hearing?HC will examine the Constitutional validity of clause 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule. The 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India contains provisions relating to disqualification of lawmakers for defection. Clause 2(1)(a) lays down that voluntarily giving up membership of the political party on whose ticket the lawmaker was elected.The Pilot camp has contended that voicing opinion against party leadership does not amount to “voluntarily giving up membership” and clause 2(1)(a) to the extent it prohibits the expression of opinion violates the basic structure of the constitution and freedom of speech under Article 19 of the Constitution.Besides, HC will also decide the validity of the Speaker’s notice issued on July 14.HC will frame 12 issues which it will consider.5. Has HC said it will wait for SC order?HC has not expressly mentioned in its Friday order that it would wait for the SC order before it hears the case again.But since the case has been admitted by HC, it is not likely to come up for hearing for long.The SC has clarified that the HC judgement would be subject to the outcome of the proceedings before it. As a result, HC might not take up the matter again until the SC settles the legal question.6. What other legal option does the Speaker has now?The options are limited. Speaker Joshi can challenge the Friday’s order before the SC by way of a fresh appeal. But since Joshi had already challenged the July 21 order of HC, which had also postponed his action, the subject matter of both the appeals will be the same. In such a scenario, the new appeal is also likely to be tagged along with the pending appeal and heard together and might not yield any desired result.The matter in all likelihood would be rendered infructuous as far as Joshi is concerned.7. What are the key takeaways?Advantage Pilot as far as the legal battle is concerned. The HC order of status quo on Speaker will mean that Joshi cannot disqualify the rebel MLAs for the time being. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot has to ensure that his 101 MLAs remain with him.The full strength of the 200-member Rajasthan assembly will vote in the event of a no-confidence motion. At present, Gehlot has a wafer-thin majority if all the members in the assembly votes, a change in the stance of one or two MLAs can bring down the government. But if either, the HC or the SC had allowed the Speaker to act on the disqualification plea, Joshi might have proceeded with the disqualification of 19 MLAs. This would have brought down the strength of the assembly to 181 making it easier for Gehlot to secure a victory in the event of a floor test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-the-rajasthan-high-court-order-entails/story-VvBf3yoASOQdZGKzb4iTHI.html
24-07-2020||India||Team Ashok Gehlot claims 109 MLAs on its side, asks Guv to call assembly ASAP||Chief minister Ashok Gehlot rode a bus with Congress lawmakers to Raj Bhavan on Friday afternoon to persuade Governor Kalraj Mishra to convene the Rajasthan assembly by Monday to let him face a trust vote. Gehlot’s meeting with the governor came moments after he accused Raj Bhavan of holding back orders to convene the assembly by Monday to let him prove his majority in the 200-member assembly.Gehlot, who has been fighting off a rebellion led by his former deputy Sachin Pilot for weeks, wants to clear the floor test before Pilot’s camp or the rival Bharatiya Janata Party is able to deplete the ruling party’s numbers. He told reporters before leaving for Raj Bhavan that he had requested Kalraj Mishra to convene the assembly session at their 20-minute meeting on Thursday, and followed up with a phone conversation.But the governor was under pressure from the top, he said, a reference to the BJP-led central government.As four buses - Gehlot was sitting in one of them - drove into Raj Bhavan, Transport Minister Pratap Singh told reporters what Gehlot would tell Kalraj Mishra.“We have the majority… the government has the support of 109 MLAs,” Pratap Singh said.This is the first time that the Ashok Gehlot’s team has put a number on the lawmakers that it expects to support the ruling government in the assembly.Gehlot’s meeting with the governor - lawmakers in tow - was designed to message that he was running out of patience, and time and would keep the spotlight on Raj Bhavan.As Gehlot emerged from his meeting with the governor - his second in 24 hours - scores of lawmakers who had been waiting in Raj Bhavan’s lawns raised slogans, pledging to fight for justice. For now, that translates into an early assembly session.It is not clear if the Congress’ count of 109 MLAs includes some of the 18 MLAs of Pilot’s camp who have been camping in Gurugram hotels. Gehlot did yesterday claim that some of them wanted to back him but weren’t allowed to leave by bouncers at the hotel.An independent assessment of the breakup of the 200-member Rajasthan assembly had earlier indicated that the Gehlot camp has 101 legislators and the Pilot camp, 22 including 19 Congress rebels and three independents.The Opposition has 75 MLAs, including 72 of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and three of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party.Before the Ashok Gehlot vs Sachin Pilot feud blew up earlier this month, the Congress government had the support of 125 lawmakers in the assembly. The immediate trigger for the revolt was a communication from the police that asked Sachin Pilot, then deputy chief minister, to give his statement on attempts to influence lawmakers in last month’s Rajya Sabha elections.Gehlot has insisted that it had been building up for months, even revealing that he had Pilot hadn’t been on talking terms for 18 months. For the last six months, Gehlot alleged, Pilot’s camp had been trying to lure Congress MLAs in a conspiracy that had originated in the Bharatiya Janata Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/team-ashok-gehlot-claims-109-mlas-on-its-side-asks-guv-to-call-assembly-asap/story-z8KolewlWRZWbNnSvv4wjM.html

The CBI office cum quarters at Athikulam here, where the investigation was held and four officers from Delhi were staying, has been sealed and disinfected. While two officers tested positive for the virus on Wednesday, the others on Friday, officials said. The police personnel arrested in connection with the case and lodged in the central prison here has been placed under quarantine, they added. The father-son duo, Jeyaraj and his son Bennicks died in a hospital in Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district, after they were allegedly thrashed by the personnel at Sathankulam police station. The state government has transferred the case to CBI following public outrage over the incident. The CBI has swung into action as soon as it received a reference from the Centre to proceed with its investigation and had dispatched a team from its special crime unit. The team reached the location on July 10 and collected crucial forensic evidence and met a large number of people during the field work, possibly exposing the members to the contagious pathogen. The father and son were arrested by Sathankulam police for alleged violation of prohibitory orders in force due to Covid-19 lockdown by keeping their mobile phone shop open in Tuticorin district beyond the allowed time. They were taken to jail in the early hours of June 20. While Bennicks died on June 22, his father Jeyaraj succumbed to injuries within hours on June 23. The ghastly manner in which the two were allegedly beaten by police personnel had evoked a sharp response from civil society, movie industry and political parties, resulting in the recommendation of the CBI probe by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-more-cbi-officers-probing-tuticorin-custodial-killings-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-pyAWbcPkS56uEx2VM9H0LL.html
24-07-2020||India||Bihar assembly’s monsoon session to be held at convention centre to follow social distancing norms||For the first time, the full session of the Bihar Legislature will be held outside the assembly premises to conform to the norms of social distancing in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has badly affected Patna. The brief four-day monsoon session, the last session of the 16th Assembly, is scheduled from August 3. Sources said that it could also be further truncated, but the decision would only be taken at the customary all-party meeting before the start of the session or the business advisory committee meeting comprising members from various political parties, which happens on the first day of the session itself. Since Governor Phagu Chouhan has already summoned the Legislative Assembly on the recommendation of the Cabinet, the Bihar government, acting on the request of the Bihar Legislative Assembly, has recommended that he should issue a modified letter. Bihar assembly speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the secretariat had written to the Bihar government that it would not be possible to hold the assembly session in the Central Hall, which does not have space to accommodate 243 members with the proper seating arrangement. “The government was requested to look for some other place where social distancing norms could be properly followed, as that is a prerequisite in the prevailing situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The government has selected Gyan Bhawan at the Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre for it, as it has enough space and open entry and exit points,” said Choudhary. The state-of-the-art Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre to the north of Gandhi Maidan was inaugurated in 2017 and is one of the iconic structures of the Nitish Kumar government. Choudhary said that the session of the Bihar Legislative Assembly would be held in the conference hall on the second floor, which has a seating capacity of 800, while the session of the Bihar Legislative Council would be held in the meeting hall on the first floor. Bihar is one of the five states which have bicameral legislature with two Houses. Bihar Vidhan Sabha has 243 members, with no vacancy, at present. Earlier this month, there was a plan to hold the assembly session in the Central Hall, built on the lines of Parliament’s Central Hall. However, with the infection spreading to new areas and the number of positive cases crossing the 1000-mark consistently over the last fortnight, it was found inadequate. “Despite trying various combinations, we could not ensure more than one-and-half feet distance between two members in the central hall. Ultimately, the Speaker said that the government should be asked to explore other options. For the Bihar Legislative Council, however, there is no space issue, as the 75-member House has 21 vacancies. But both Houses need to run close by. The ministers often have to shift from one House to another,” said a senior Vidhan Sabha official. The Budget session of the Bihar Legislature had come to a premature end on March 16, 15 days before schedule, in view of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic following a unanimous decision at the business advisory committee. It was scheduled to end on March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-assembly-s-monsoon-session-to-be-held-at-convention-centre-to-follow-social-distancing-norms/story-7HzS5jHDErhOcApoLmfwXP.html

It’s tough and hazardous to go on sets but I know God will take care of me. I have full gratitude towards almighty for getting a role in the period when here is hardly any work happening.” The actor is playing the role of Parvati. “Getting the role of a goddess that too in the holy month of Shravan is a blessing. I am taking it as a very positive message. I come from the land of Baba Vishwanath and feel very thankful towards him.”Sharing what all precautions she is taking while on work for her show, ‘Kahat Hanuman Jai Shree Ram’, she said, “From my end, I am taking all safety measures that I can because I stay with my parents so I have to be extra cautious. Since I have started to shoot I am maintaining adequate distance from them. I am doing my own make-up by myself as it takes one hour to get ready for my role so I manage maximum things on my own,” said the young actor.After playing Sita, this is her second mythological show. “I feel really positive and happy while I am playing such iconic roles. But, for an actor, there are also limitations while playing goddess — I need to maintain poise, calm, composure and dignity. At times I find it tough too as while essaying such roles we have to be very focused and controlled.”Vidita had done her schooling from Azamgarh and her graduation from Agrasen College in Varanasi followed by an online MBA degree, “I lived in Kabir Chaura locality and started doing theatre from very early days. I even won Miss Varanasi title. Director Ajay Mehra came to the city for audition and he was looking for new a face for DD1 show ‘Caudaha Phere’ based on Shivani’s novel. I auditioned and was selected for the role. That was my debut.”Her father also shifted to Mumbai. “Thankfully, I had great family support and being a small-town girl, he chose to come with me. During early days I used to work and travel to Varanasi by train to appear for my examinations. I started modelling and also did about 11 movies down South.”She barely knew the South industry when she started to take up work. “I was totally unaware of the industry and took up work as they were giving good money. Later, I came to know that it’s such a big industry and I have done films in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam.”Then she decided to do TV. “People knew me in South but in the Hindi belt people didn’t know me. So I knew to become a known face so for that TV was the best medium. So I opted for TV and luckily, I got a good break in ‘Yeh Hai Mohabbatein’ for which I got nomination for best debutant. Then I played Sita in ‘Shrimad Bhadwad’ and antagonist in ‘Meri Gudiya’,” she concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucky-to-get-work-in-such-a-tough-phase-vidisha-srivastava/story-h4mlu1rJsIbDr0qPJ1zPYK.html

The petitioner also questioned the assembly speaker’s alleged inaction following his complaint seeking disqualification of these six legislators under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution in March this year.The bench of Justice Mahendra Kumar Goyal will hear the petition on Monday.According to the petition, speaker CP Joshi declared six BSP MLAs – Sandeep Yadav, (Tijara), Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kisangarh Bas), Lakhan Meena (Karauli) and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati) – as having merged with the Congress on September 18, 2019.Dilawar, MLA from Ramganj Mandi constituency in Kota district, has challenged the validity, legality and correctness of the speaker’s order.Earlier, he moved a petition before the speaker on March 16 under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India to pray for disqualification of these six MLAs. That remains still undecided.The petitioner questions the delay in deciding his petition citing the recent instance of the speaker issuing notices to 19 Congress MLAs led by Sachin Pilot on the same day of receiving a petition for their disqualification from party chief whip Mahesh Joshi.The petitioner has prayed to the HC to stay the speaker’s merger order during the pendency of the writ petition in the interest of justice and law.The Congress has 107 MLAs in the 200-member assembly, including these six BSP MLAs; 19 Congress MLAs have turned rebel against chief minister Ashok Gehlot and are housed in a resort in Manesar. A decision on the BSP legislators’ status may impact the strength of Gehlot camp in the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-challenges-6-bsp-mlas-merger-with-congress-as-gehlot-eyes-floor-test/story-xgKuRv78AwDrxrxDjFHIgK.html

He has accused the governor of stalling on the question of convening an assembly session. The development came after the Rajasthan high court ordered status quo to be maintained in the disqualification case against rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs.The CM, who had been expecting the orders to convene the House session last night, had warned that if they are not issued today, he will be meeting governor Mishra at the Raj Bhawan, requesting him to make the decision. He wants the session to be called on Monday.The Congress MLAs, who the CM claims are over 100 in number, flashed the victory sign for the posse of cameramen as the buses drove through the gates to the governor’s house.Upon reaching, CM Gehlot headed straight to meet governor Kalraj Mishra, while the lawmakers were seen sitting under the sun in the Raj Bhawan garden. The MLAs resorted to sloganeering. “Inquilab Zindabad, Ashok Gehlot Zindabad” slogans rend the air on a crisp cool summer afternoon on the expansive lawns of the governor’s house. Soon after the governor, accompanied by CM Gehlot, came to the lawns to meet the MLAs. An independent assessment of the breakup of the 200-member Rajasthan assembly had earlier indicated that the Gehlot camp has 101 legislators and the Pilot camp, 22 including 19 Congress rebels and three independents.The Opposition has 75 MLAs, including 72 of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and three of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-with-mlas-in-tow-lands-at-governor-s-house/story-XZxsDnBPWcvYk1B6Ktno3M.html

24-07-2020||India||India builds trade barriers with China amid border row||India slapped new trade curbs on some of its neighbors, in a move primarily seen aimed at keeping Chinese businesses out after a border conflict and worsening economic ties between the two nations.Companies from nations that share a land border with India are barred from bidding for government contracts for goods and services until they register with the industry department, according to an official statement. Previously, New Delhi had made it mandatory for suppliers to mention the country of origin on the government’s e-Marketplace while bidding for tenders.The measure is the latest in a series of steps taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to wean India away from reliance on China -- New Delhi’s biggest source of imports. Earlier, the administration banned the use of 59 Chinese apps, while goods purchased from China were delayed at Indian ports after a deadly conflict between the neighbors along a disputed Himalayan border left several soldiers dead on both sides.India’s move to firewall key sectors from Chinese presence signals that the south Asian nation is willing to bear costs in the short run in order to reduce exposure of critical sectors, said Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London. “Such moves are a calculated response to shape Chinese calculus on the border issue which is getting serious by the day in the absence of any commitment by the Chinese to resolve it amicably.”The development comes at a time when both the nations are engaged in talks to defuse a border stand off. India on Thursday said it expects the Chinese side to be sincere in completing the disengagement of troops along the Line of Actual Control.A spokesman of the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a text message whether recent curbs are aimed at China while a spokesperson of the prime minister’s office was not immediately reachable over phone during office hours.Other key points from the latest move:The step of further tightening of rules for bidding process was taken as border disengagement and de-escalation are not moving in a positive direction, said Pant. “Tensions with China are already high with growing consensus in India that the Chinese Communist Party seems in no mood to diplomatically resolve the border crisis.”India imported goods worth over $70 billion from China in 2019 while the bilateral trade deficit stood at about $50 billion, much higher than with any other trading parter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-builds-trade-barriers-with-china-amid-border-row/story-n3R5loDz5zioRtkRzy5s3M.html

The petitioner sought a direction to restrain “Bhoomi Pujan” for laying down the foundation stone of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya during the period of pandemic as it is in violation of protocol prescribed by the central government. According to petitioner, about three hundred people have been invited at a single place on August 5 and that may cause violation of the protocol prescribed by the government of India and government of Uttar Pradesh for the purpose of maintaining ‘social and physical distancing’ to combat Covid-19 pandemic.According to the petitioner, such an event, which may attract public gathering at the site, must not be allowed by the state government. The Bench, however refused to interfere in the matter while observing, “The entire petition for writ is based on assumptions and there is no foundation for apprehending violation of the prescribed protocol.”It further added: “At present, we expect the organisers and the government of Uttar Pradesh to ensure all the protocols applicable for social and physical distancing. In view of whatever stated above, we do not find any just reason to interfere in the matter. The writ petition hence is dismissed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-againt-ayodhya-temple-event-to-be-attended-by-pm-modi-court-declines/story-jhmE0S0wKUBfvsTtkJS0AM.html
24-07-2020||India||27-yr-old lab technician from UP’s Kanpur killed within a week of kidnapping: Police||Police on Friday said a lab technician who was kidnapped last month was killed within a week of being held captive.While the man’s family claimed that Rs 30 lakh ransom was paid for his release in the presence of police, Circle Officer Vikas Pandey said the allegation was not true.Senior Superintendent of Police (Kanpur) Dinesh Kumar Prabhu said that several suspects were detained and grilled intensively, and two of them confessed to the crime.He said the accused initially tried to mislead the police, but later they disclosed that they kidnapped 27-year-old S Yadav, and killed him either on June 26 or June 27. They further confessed that they disposed of Yadav’s body in Pandu river, the SSP said, adding that the accused had worked together with Yadav in another pathology lab.The family had earlier appeared before the media and claimed that they had thrown a bag containing Rs 30 lakh from a flyover to railway tracks in the presence of police and also did whatever the kidnappers demanded, but the accused did not free the victim.Circle Officer Vikas Pandey said that no ransom money was paid for his release in the presence of police and the allegation was not true. He confirmed that five people, including a woman, were arrested in connection with the case.The Uttar Pradesh government has, however, asked ADG (Police Headquarters) V P Jogdand to immediately reach Kanpur to probe whether ransom was paid to the kidnappers or not.According to an official spokesman in Lucknow, the government has suspended SP (South) Aprana Gupta and then circle officer Manoj Gupta in public interest. Besides the SSP has suspended former SHO (Barra) Ranjit Rai and chowki incharge Rajesh Kumar for laxity in investigation, the spokesman said. The SSP said several police teams, including crime branch and surveillance, have been directed to find the victim’s body and arrest all those involved in the crime, the SSP said.Efforts are also being made to trace the victim’s motorcycle and mobile phone which have been missing since he was kidnapped, the SSP said.“Kuldeep, who had worked with Yadav at another pathology lab, invited him for a liquor party at his rented accommodation in Ratanlal Nagar,” CO Vikas Pandey said, adding that the victim was injected with sedatives and kept hostage for about five days.He was sedated whenever he regained consciousness during captivity, CO said, adding, Kuldeep with the help of others murdered him either on June 26 or 27 and he kept the body in his car and dumped it into the Pandu river.The SSP said that on June 22, Yadav, a resident of Barra area, was kidnapped and his family filed a missing complaint with Barra police station the next day.Just three days later, the charges were changed into kidnapping charges.The victim’s family alleged that the kidnappers had called on the mobile phone of his father, Chaman Singh Yadav, and demanded Rs 30 lakh for his release.The SSP took cognisance of a media report that claimed a ransom of Rs 30 lakh was given to the kidnappers.“I am talking to the aggrieved family. If anyone is wrong, they will be punished,” he said.The SSP had also assured the family about the safe return of the victim and said that if any ransom was paid it would be recovered.Opposition parties, including Congress and BSP condemned the killing of the lab technician and alleged that there was “jungle raj” in the state.BSP president Mayawati in a tweet said, “In another incident during the jungle raj in UP, the body of Sanjit Yadav was thrown into the river by his kidnappers in Kanpur. This is very sad and condemnable. The state government needs to immediately come into action specially in the matters of crime control and law and order.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said the law and order in Uttar Pradesh has completely collapsed.After taking the life of a common man, now public proclamations are being made about it, she said, adding that be it home, road, office, no one feels safe anywhere. “After Vikram Joshi, now abducted Sanjeet Yadav in Kanpur has been killed. The police got the money paid to the kidnappers and he was killed as well. A new ‘gundaraj’ has come into being,” Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.“In this jungle raj, law and order has surrendered before the goons,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/27-yr-old-lab-technician-from-up-s-kanpur-killed-within-a-week-of-kidnapping-police/story-FrN8DuArnMCKHE3VAgcxwL.html

Siddi serves as the state secretary of the Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram, a tribal welfare initiative of the RSS. He hails from North Kannada district and is also the first graduate from the community.Siddi believes his community’s roots go back to Africa, somewhere in Mozambique and Kenya.

Boundary question falls within bilateral scope [between] #China & #India. We have wisdom & capability to properly handle differences. No need for third party interference,” he tweeted shortly before 1 am.Sun said in a second tweet: “Real challenges in #SouthChinaSea come from powers outside the region stirring up territorial & maritime disputes & undermining regional peace & stability. On #HongKong affairs, #China’s HK allows no foreign interference.”Also read| Chinese actions are a challenge for the world community: British envoyAlso Watch | ‘Closing more Chinese consulates in US always possible’: Donald Trump Barton had made the remarks in his first news briefing after presenting his credentials. However, the British envoy had also made it clear that the India-China border standoff was a bilateral matter that the UK had no desire to be a part of.“From the UK perspective, obviously we’re not part of that nor do we want to be,” Barton had said while responding to a specific question on the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), where India and China have arrayed tens of thousands of troops since May. Barton had also been critical of China’s actions in the former British colony of Hong Kong and the South China Sea.“There are challenges around the world on all sorts of Chinese actions, for us Hong Kong particularly is a focus, clearly for India the LAC is a particular focus,” he said.“These are concerning things and our hope would be that there can be de-escalation, and tensions do seem to have eased over the last week or two after the tragic loss of lives,” he said, referring to the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a clash with Chinese forces along the LAC on June 15.The envoy welcomed progress by India and China in managing tensions and the commitment by the two Special Representatives on the border issue to disengage and de-escalate. “I hope we’re not about to see a change in that,” he said.Britain had its own concerns about a range of Chinese actions and had also decided to remove Chinese technology giant Huawei’s equipment from all its telecommunications networks by 2027 because of security concerns, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-reacts-to-uk-envoy-s-remarks-on-india-china-stand-off-says-no-need-for-any-interference/story-tzdLFghXcH72d5OqhsweVM.html

This papad will be helpful in our fight against the viral outbreak,” the minister can be heard saying in the video clip.A minister putting out hearsay information on social media evoked both strong and bemused reactions from the public and also his political rivals.“Fight against Covid-19 update: US govt: We are developing a vaccine. UK govt: We are in stage-III of clinical trials. Indian govt: Ye lo Bhabhiji papad. It will help fight corona,” one person tweeted.Another person tweeted that it seemed the government has found an alternative to the Covid-19 vaccine. “Why spend millions of dollars on vaccine development, when you can sit at home and eat papad to protect yourself from Covid-19? Post-script: The joke is on us 1.3 billion Indians.”Political opponents and the critics of the Narendra Modi-led government, too, seized on the opportunity and took a dig at the minister’s bizarre claims.Lawyer Prashant Bhushan tweeted: “Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has launched a papad brand amid the Covid-19 pandemic claiming it contains some ingredients that will help develop antibodies against the novel coronavirus disease. Ministers, (Baba) Ramdev all trying to profit from Covid-19 by peddling bogus cures.”The West Bengal unit of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) also hit out at the minister.“Breaking News: Corona vaccine invented.

In a thinly veiled warning, he said his government would not be responsible if people gherao the Raj Bhavan tomorrow.The CM’s announcement came shortly after the Rajasthan high court ordered status quo to be maintained in the disqualification case against rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs.“We cannot understand the pressure under which the governor is not calling the session... If tomorrow, people of the state come to gherao the Raj Bhawan, we won’t be responsible,” said the CM.Gehlot said he wanted the assembly session to be convened in order to discuss issues - including coronavirus and the political situation. Expecting the orders to be issued last night itself, the CM said it hasn’t happened till now. If the orders aren’t issued, Gehlot said, then all MLAs will be meeting governor Mishra at the Raj Bhawan, requesting him to make the decision. “We want the assembly session from Monday, and there things will be clear,” he added. Reacting to the development, Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia said: “Why is Gehlot so desperate for a session? His comment that people of Rajasthan will picket Raj Bhawan is sad. He should have patience and maintain the dignity of language. Looks like Gehlot is looking for a way to send out his opponents out of the party and Assembly.”Reiterating his charge that “our colleagues (rebel MLAs) are held hostage” under BJP-ruled government in Haryana, the CM said they have been calling asking to be rescued.“This entire game is of BJP and its leaders’ conspiracy. Like they did in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, they want to do the same in Rajasthan but all MLAs and public are with us,” said Gehlot.The number of lawmakers present at the two Congress legislature party meetings indicated that the Gehlot government would be able to stay in power even if with a wafer-thin majority. At the third meeting held this week, Gehlot urged the legislators to stand firm like a rock as the country is watching them.The Rajasthan CM hasn’t put a number of lawmakers on his side yet. “You’ll get to know the exact number when we win the floor test by a thumping majority. This time, every MLA will hear the voice of his conscience and vote,” Gehlot told HT on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-understand-why-governor-is-not-calling-the-assembly-session-says-rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot/story-NeiKX7EkSoQ1IJaXXmRZqN.html

The state disaster management department had already rushed four teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Those rescued have been shifted to the safer place, said SDM Mishra.At the time of filing this report, district magistrate Shrisat Kapil Ashok, SP Navin Chand Jha had reached the area to take stock of the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-flood-embankment-breached-in-champaran-several-villages-inundated-2000-rescued/story-NmfJlegDDeFpxI0DvoQVvM.html

Gandhi said, as a result, “disaster followed”. He said he keeps warning the government concerning the situation with China as well.“I kept warning them on Covid19 and the economy. They rubbished it. Disaster followed. I keep warning them on China. They’re rubbishing it,” Gandhi said in a tweet on Friday. On Thursday, Gandhi released a video message wherein he said that the situation with China can be resolved only when India creates a global vision to take on the crisis.  “If you deal with them (China) with a position of strength, you can deal with them. It requires a vision, an international vision,” he said.I kept warning them on Covid19 and the economy. They rubbished it. Disaster followed. I keep warning them on China. They’re rubbishing it.“We’re fighting among ourselves, look at the politics. An Indian is fighting an Indian. This shows there is no clear cut vision going forward,” he added.This comes as Gandhi’s latest jibe at the Centre in his series attacks this week. Earlier this week, Gandhi took to Twitter and posted that the prime minister has fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power which has now become India’s biggest weakness as he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’.The Congress leader posted a video message on Twiter and wrote, “PM fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power.

It is now India’s biggest weakness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disaster-followed-rahul-gandhi-says-he-kept-warning-centre-on-covid-19-economy/story-PRtdoxFqiBWnuyBuxUSWzL.html

The veteran leader recorded the case before the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Lucknow through video-conferencing.On Thursday, the court recorded the statement of another BJP veteran Murli Manohar Joshi in the case. Joshi had told the special CBI court that he was innocent and implicated in the case by the then Congress government at the Centre.The 86-year-old leader had also called the prosecution witnesses in the case as “liars”.“The entire investigation was conducted under the political influence and he was charged on the basis of false and fabricated evidence,” Joshi told the court.The court recorded Joshi’s statement in the presence of his counsel Vimal Kumar Srivastava, K K Mishra and Abhishek Ranjan.The counsel for prosecution agency CBI, Lalit Singh, R K Yadav and P Chakravarti too were present in the court during its proceeding.The court is recording the statements of as many as 32 accused in the case after examination of the prosecution witnesses.It is conducting a day-to-day hearing in the case to complete its trial by August 31 as directed by the Supreme Court. BJP leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Uma Bharti had appeared in person earlier this month before the court to make her deposition in the case. In her testimony, she too had accused the then Congress government at the Centre of implicating her in the case due to political vendetta.The Babri mosque in Ayodhya was brought down on December 6, 1992 by kar sevaks who believed the structure was built on the birth place of Hindu God Ram.The decades-old dispute over the site was settled last year when the Supreme Court ordered that the site be given to a trust to build a temple, and that alternative land be provided in Ayodhya for a mosque. Advani, Joshi, and others have been accused of being involved in the conspiracy to demolish the mosque.The foundation-stone laying ceremony of the temple is expected to be held in the first week of August with the Prime Minister in attendance. Advani, too, is expected to attend the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babri-demolition-case-lk-advani-deposes-before-cbi-court/story-xYlEBAocYeskOiBnBsnaNO.html

The order came after the high court agreed to Pilot’s request to make Centre a party to the case. The application was moved by Pilot on the ground that Tenth Schedule’s constitutional validity was under challenge and therefore, the Union of India was a necessary party.Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs had challenged a disqualification notice given by the Speaker in the high court. The notice was given on the request of Congress’ chief whip who said Pilot and his supporters did not attend the party’s CLP meetings.The Pilot camp, however, argued that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.In the last hearing, the high court had asked the Speaker to wait for its verdict on Friday before taking any action against Team Pilot.The Speaker had sent notices to Pilot and 18 MLAs under the anti-defection law after the chief whip’s application for their disqualification. The MLAs were earlier asked to present before the Speaker on July 17, but the same was deferred in view of the hearing before the high court.The development had come even as Rajasthan Congress is in turmoil after simmering differences between Pilot and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot came out in the open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-high-court-puts-off-verdict-in-pilot-vs-gehlot-tells-speaker-cp-joshi-to-maintain-status-quo/story-tXPte6SsiANzkaSpeJn3dJ.html

A bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta allowed the application that was moved by the petitioners on Thursday. The court then adjourned for 20 minutes.The application for impleadment was moved on the grounds that the constitutional amendment is under challenge and, therefore, the Union of India is a necessary party now.The dissident Congress MLAs led by Pilot have challenged their disqualification notices through the writ petition which was taken up by the bench on Friday last week and arguments were held.The hearing continued on Monday and the arguments concluded on Tuesday. The court on Tuesday said it will give appropriate order on the writ petition on Friday.  The notices to MLAs were served after the party complained to the Speaker that the legislators had defied a whip to attend two Congress Legislature Party meetings, on Monday and Tuesday last week.The Pilot camp, however, argued that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.In its complaint to the Legislative Assembly Speaker, the Congress had sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2 (1) (a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution.The provision disqualifies MLAs if they ‘voluntarily’ give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.Pilot was sacked as deputy chief minister and the president of the state unit of the party after he rebelled against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.

The case has been filed by Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident Congress MLAs against the disqualification notice served to them by Rajasthan Speaker CP Joshi.The Supreme Court had refused to stay the proceedings of the high court on Thursday. Hearing a petition filed by Rajasthan assembly Speaker CP Joshi, the apex court said that “voice of dissent” in a democracy cannot be shut down.Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs have challenged a disqualification notice given by the Speaker in the high court. In the last hearing, the Rajasthan high court had asked the Speaker to wait for its verdict on Friday before taking any action against Team Pilot.But Joshi had moved the apex court to challenge the “direction” given to his office by the court. He had contended in his petiton that the court cannot interfere in legislative matter, and that the action against the dissident MLAs should be decided by his office.The notice was given on the request of Congress’ chief whip who said Pilot and his supporters did not attend the party’s CLP meetings. The Pilot camp, however, argued that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.The apex court, which heard the matter through video-conferencing, said that issue raised in the plea filed by the Speaker required “prolonged hearing” as it involved “larger question” related to the democracy and how it will survive.“As the high court has already heard the matter after prolonged arguments and reserved the order, we are not staying the passing of the order, however, whatever order is passed, shall be ultimately subject to the outcome of this petition,” the bench comprising justices Arun Mishra, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari, said and fixed the matter for hearing on July 27.The high court, meanwhile, accepted another application filed by Pilot to include the Union government in the list of respondents. Pilot had contended that Tenth Schedule’s constitutional validity was under challenge and therefore, the Union of India was a necessary party now.On Friday, the dissident Congress MLAs led by Pilot had challenged their disqualification notices through a writ petition which was taken up by a bench of Rajasthan High Court, comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta, and arguments were held.The hearing continued on Monday and the arguments concluded on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-high-court-s-crucial-order-on-team-pilot-s-petition-today/story-FceIeTgOc0DyGvoYYs5itN.html

After the exchange of fire ended, the SOG and DVF spotted two bodies - a male and a female. Both were in Naxal uniform. We also seized one INSAS rifle, one carbine, and two country-made firearms,” Abhay said. The DGP appealed the Maoists to surrender and get the benefits of Odisha Government’s Naxal rehabilitation policy.The identity of the two deceased Maoists is yet to be ascertained.Between July 5 and 7, five Maoists including two women were killed in two separate encounters with the police in Kandhamal district in Sirla forest of Tumudibandh block. One of those killed was Kosa Sodi alias Sukru, a member of Odisha State Committee of the CPI (Maoist) with a bounty of Rs 20 lakh on his head. The other two were identified as Itesh and Reena, both area committee members with reward of Rs 4 lakh each on their heads.The Union home secretary, in a letter to Odisha chief secretary and DGP, had appreciated Odisha Police for its successful operation in Kandhamal district on July 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-maoists-killed-in-encounter-with-police-in-odisha-woman-among-them/story-nj3LQ10qC7ohSuMfqySCII.html

He was immediately admitted to the Community Health Centre of G Udaygiri. However, he passed away while being taken to the district headquarters hospital in Phulbani town.“As his body was brought back to his village in Mallikpadi, the locals did not allow it to be buried there fearing that the doctor had succumbed to Covid-19. The doctor’s body was finally buried in an isolated patch of land around two kilometres away,” said Kailash Dandapat, an NGO worker in Kandhamal district.Also read: Odisha raises minimum wages of labourersThe doctor’s burial was opposed by people of another village till the district administration intervened. The body was buried 12 hours after death.Dandapat said he has never seen such a situation in nearly four decades of his stay in Kandhamal. “Whenever any death happens, there would be a big gathering of near and dear ones and the villagers to pay their last respect to the departed soul. But Corona has turned the situation completely different. I do not think this is the only case of G Udayagiri, this is also going to happen in other parts of the district and the state,” said Dandapat.In a similar incident, in Covid-19 hotspot of Ganjam district, the villagers did not touch the body of a retired school headmaster and stopped the body from entering suspecting it to be a case of Covid-19 death. A retired school headmaster in Seragada village of Ganjam was suffering from cough and fever for the last fortnight and died on Wednesday.While the deceased’s two sons could not return to the state due to coronavirus-induced lockdown, villagers refused to help fearing infection of Covid-19.As no one came forward, four local journalists went to the deceased headmaster’s home wearing PPE kits and brought his body in an ambulance to the cremation ground. Journalists Meghnad Das, Shankar Pradhan, Balaji Pradhan and Ajit Panda lent helping hands as they carried the body for cremation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fear-and-panic-over-covid-19-delays-last-rites-of-odisha-doctor-retired-school-headmaster/story-VuGfCpN8HpmXMNQPxfaqaM.html

For skilled labourers, the wages have been raised from Rs 370 to Rs 393.40 while for highly skilled labourers it went up from Rs 430 to Rs 453.40.The minimum rates of wages are all-inclusive rates including the basic rates, the cost of living allowances and the variable dearness allowance at Rs 0.90 paisa per point rise in All India Consumer Price Index number (base 2001-100). It will be effective in retrospective from April 1, 2020.Currently, Delhi pays the highest minimum daily wage to labourers of all kinds in the country. Since last year, the Arvind Kejriwal government has made it mandatory for all industries in Delhi to pay the minimum wage of Rs 14,842 per month to unskilled workers, three times more than the national minimum wage of Rs 4,628 per month. In Delhi, the semi-skilled workers get a minimum of Rs 16,341 per month while skilled workers get Rs 17,991 per month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-raises-minimum-wages-of-labourers/story-rLfhzzOkq02NZp4QoM82XP.html

24-07-2020||India||PM Modi gives Ladakh its first central university; will have a Centre on Buddhist Studies||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has greenlighted the plan for the first central university in Ladakh with a Centre on Buddhist Studies, a move that comes just about a fortnight before the first anniversary of the parliamentary enactment that led to the creation of Ladakh as a union territory.The proposed central university will offer degrees in all courses such as liberal arts and basic sciences except engineering and medical education.PM Modi’s in-principle approval came at a meeting convened on Monday to review the steps taken by the government over the last one year in the union territories of Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir and outline the priorities for the Centre over the next few months to improve the lives of people. Union home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and all top officials attended this meeting.Also read: DRDO sets up Covid testing facility in LehOn 5 August last year, the Centre had moved Parliament to strip the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir of its special status in the Constitution and create the two union territories. The Centre had then promised that the Union Territory status would lead to an improvement in the security situation in the centrally-administered territories and put the focus back on development.The education ministry is expected to move a formal proposal to set up the central university soon. It will require enactment of a central legislation that will, after clearance from the Union cabinet, go to parliament for its approval.PM Modi indicated his approval to set up a central university at the July 20 meeting since more than 10,000 Ladakhi students were forced to travel hundreds of kilometres away from home for higher education, people familiar with the development said.Ladakh got its first university - University of Ladakh - only recently after the state assembly enacted a legislation in December 2018. This was a cluster university created by pooling all the resources of existing colleges of Ladakh.According to a proposal of the human resource development ministry, the Ladakh Central University is also aimed at students from Lahaul and Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh once the Rohtang La tunnel opens this year and ensures round the year access to Leh via Jispa-Sarchu-Upshi route. The university will have a Centre for Buddhist Studies to cater to the largely Gelug (to which the 14th Dalai Lama belongs) and Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhist population of Ladakh.It is learnt that the PM was totally focused on development of the two UTs and wanted specific improvements highlighted in the coming days. He did not want the development debate to be digressed into the achievements of the state police and security forces on counter-terrorism front.Even though the government is clear that vested interests within and across the border will try and vitiate the atmosphere close to August 5, there was consensus in the meeting that the development agenda in both the UTs should not be derailed at any cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-preps-for-ladakh-s-anniversary-gift-greenlights-its-1st-central-university/story-ZZTaNsvEQhydzDRPmWvb6N.html
24-07-2020||India||Rahul takes swipe at Modi, BJP hits back||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that he was busy building his own image, and noted that one man’s vision cannot be a substitute for a national vision.Gandhi’s attack on the PM came as part of a series launched by him on Twitter, where he seeks to explain the India-China conflict at the border.The Congress leader said there is no clear-cut vision for the country going forward. BJP president J P Nadda had accused Gandhi of attempting to politicise defence and foreign policy matters, saying it shows one dynasty’s desperation to wash their past sins of 1962 and weaken India.The Congress leader said one has to deal with the Chinese psychologically from a position of strength and if they sense weakness, “then you had it”. “PM is 100% focused on building his own image. India’s captured institutions are all busy doing this task. One man’s image is not a substitute for a national vision,” he said on Twitter, along with a two-minute video on the Chinese aggression at the LAC.Gandhi said he is agitated because he can see a huge opportunity being lost by India. He had earlier accused the Prime Minister of only being bothered about his image, which the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had described as “mudslinging”.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nalin Kohli reacted, saying, “Before asking question and beyond the daily tweets, Mr Gandhi would do well to provide the nation a list of his personal, non-inherited achievements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-takes-swipe-at-modi-bjp-hits-back/story-tJymIWAs6OngBZDoXzXIwO.html

The applications — Helo Lite, ShareIt Lite, Bigo Lite and VFY Lite — have been removed from the Google playstore and Apple app store, the officials said. The government had, in a similar move last month, banned 59 applications, including popular video app TikTok, in the backdrop of a India-China standoff in Galwan Valley, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.Banning the apps, the government had said that they were ‘prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country’.“The apps were found to be operating despite the ban via these versions,” a MEITY official said. “They have been taken down from application stores.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-to-ban-more-apps-over-links-with-china/story-vZdlB6D9ilUsemmDPpQuAL.html
24-07-2020||India||India’s poor risk falling through the gaps as schools go digital||The coronavirus has pushed schools all over the world to go online as new waves of infections keep emerging. In India, a country where the gaps in access to education and the Internet were already vast, poor families are struggling to stay the course.Shirin Riyaz Shah, 15, attends a small private school in Mumbai. There’s one smart-phone between her and her four siblings over which they sit through Zoom lessons and submit homework via WhatsApp. Their schedules don’t blend neatly and there’s a constant tussle over the phone.Data is especially precious because money, always tight, is now in even shorter supply as the pandemic stretches her family’s single income. Her father is a tailor and for now, movement restrictions mean he’s mostly home. When that changes so will the children’s access to his phone.And digital classrooms make the process of learning harder.“In class we can raise our hands over and over again and it isn’t a problem,” said Shah by phone. “We can ask teachers to pause in a class and then ask them to repeat. But in a video call if two or three students do this then time will run out.”The pandemic has led to the “biggest global education emergency of our lifetime,” according to a report by the Save The Children Fund. Globally, lockdowns enforced to stop the virus’s spread have put 91% of learners out of school. Out of these, the poorest and most marginalized children are at highest risk of never returning to the classroom.In India, where the government spends about 3% of the nation’s gross domestic product on education and only half the population has access to the Internet, 320 million students have already been affected, according to Save The Children Fund.The spokesperson for India’s Ministry for Human Resource Development and the secretary of the School Education and Literacy department did not respond to an email and or phone calls asking for comment.UNFAMILIAR TECHNOLOGY“You have one side of the population that’s so used to tech, it’s like a second language to them,” said Shreya Tobias, a volunteer with Teach for India, a non-governmental organization, who educates fourth grade children. Many of her students have never used phones before, and their parents themselves don’t know enough to help. “These kids don’t have that. Tech is confusing for them.”The majority of her students have seen their parents lose jobs as a result of the economic distress caused by India’s protracted lockdown. She lost contact with some when they were forced to return to their villages.Instead of innovating, governments and schools have gone for the easiest option available, said Shantha Sinha, founder of the research institute Mamidipudi Venkatarangaiya Foundation and the former head of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. “It’s showing a lack of sensitivity.”Governments must allocate funds to local village councils and encourage solutions from the bottom up, Sinha said. “They should allow people to come together, they should say, ‘Come up with an innovation, we will support you.’”SCALING UPSeveral rights groups and NGOs have taken this approach -- from reading rooms to distributing books directly to homes -- attempting to fill the gaps left by online education. A village in Jharkhand has seen widespread fame for its use of loudspeakers perched on trees through which children can listen to classes. But these initiatives need to be scaled up quickly, experts say.Despite the challenges, many teachers and students hold on to hope.Tobias believes her students will return to classes once lockdowns are fully lifted. “After having worked in this system for a while, I’ve realized that it takes a lot of effort to get your child into a school, to begin with,” she says. “The parents are quite invested.”And 15-year-old Shah is worried but determined.“This is my aim, and this is my responsibility,” she said. “I will not let my future goals be disrupted by anything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-poor-risk-falling-through-the-gaps-as-schools-go-digital/story-Dfq5YriX1MT7QZZTsXWFVI.html
24-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India’s Covid-19 positivity rate – the proportion of people testing positive to those tested – is increasing. The weekly average is around 11.7% now. The number has steadily increased. It was around 8.1% a month ago. In early May, it was as low as 3%. Contrary to what this trend may immediately suggest, and concerns being expressed by some experts, a rising positivity rate in India, under the current context, is actually good news.India has thus far carried out around 11,310 tests per million of the population. This number too has been increasing steadily; over the past week for instance, India carried out 333,697 tests a day on average. It should be doing a million a day, but the current number is still higher than the 143,565 tests a day it was conducting in mid-June. This increase is responsible for the country’s rising positivity rate.As regular readers of this column know, the positivity rate increases with testing till a point, then plateaus, and then eventually starts declining as a country, state, or city starts testing adequately. At the current level of testing, India has tested around 1.1% of its population. That’s way too low. There are countries that have done 10-12%, but given India’s size and population, the country should be aiming for testing at least 5% of the population.It is important to understand how to read the positivity rate. A low rate is desirable, but only when accompanied by adequate testing. There are states that show a low positivity, but this isn’t because they have few cases, but because they aren’t testing enough. Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Bihar, for instance, have low positivity rates, but are clearly not testing enough, and so while absolute numbers may suggest that they are better off than other states in managing Covid-19, they actually aren’t. In fact, the reverse is probably true. Telangana and Gujarat have higher positivity rates, but they too are clearly not testing adequately (which is actually even more worrying).In contrast, Delhi has a high positivity rate (cumulatively), but the number is way off its peak (when the trend in daily positivity rates is seen; for instance, it was only 5.7% on Thursday), an indication that things have gotten better in the Capital (which is also reflected in the falling number of daily cases). And it is testing a lot (around 4.4% of its population has been tested at last count). Tamil Nadu presents another narrative. It is testing adequately (it has tested 2.8% of its population at last count, a significant number for a state with a population of around 80 million), and is just about maintaining its positivity rate (which means the daily cases are still high) – an indication that the state is on the long plateau that comes before the dip. The state’s positivity rate is way off the peaks it once scaled, perhaps an indication of just how badly inadequate testing can skew this metric in either direction.It’s easy to understand – given this behaviour – why most experts maintain that a positivity rate between 7% and 12% (some are a lot more specific and put the number at 10%) is a reflection of adequate testing. Given the Tamil Nadu example, this proportion seems to correspond with the ideal positivity rate in the plateau-phase of the curve.So, how high can India’s positivity rate go? That’s a tough question to answer, but if the country were to sharply increase testing – say, reach the million-test-a-day mark that I’ve been suggesting – it will reach this peak very soon. Still better, it won’t stay there very long if it keeps up the intensity of testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-x4mYWVRm55A2N7TIxfQS7N.html

24-07-2020||India||Delhi’s old drainage system unable to cope with heavy concretisation||The Capital’s decades-old drainage system is unable to keep pace with unplanned construction, and much of its stormwater management features are either blocked or have disappeared, leading to a few hours of heavy rain triggering widespread chaos, according to several urban experts.On Wednesday, Delhi Traffic Police updates showed there were at least five cave-ins on key roads, and long traffic jams due to heavy waterlogging was reported from at least 13 major localities or stretches.The mayhem, which exposed the fragile civic infrastructure in the Capital, was the consequence of around four hours of heavy rain in the morning.AK Gosain, professor of civil engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, said the problem lies in three distinct issues: increase in paved area means less volume is absorbed by the ground and rains lead to heavier water run-off; stormwater drains are being used for sewage; and most of these stormwater drains do not let water flow freely.Gosain presented a master plan to the government in 2018 identifying the issues that made the problem most acute and suggested a road map of how the drainage network — which still follows the 1976 master plan — can be revamped.Waste water from rains are meant to follow a system separate from the one that carries sewage from homes and industries. This includes a network of streams, natural and seasonal water bodies, and urban stormwater channels that are meant to further drain into the Barapullah canal, the Najafgarh canal, or the Yamuna. The report by Gosain’s team found many of these were either encroached upon, blocked with waste, or were disappearing. Around 19 out of the 201 natural drains mentioned in the 1976 Master Plan could not be traced. “Last drainage Master Plan for Delhi was prepared in the year 1976, when the population of Delhi was 60 lakh. Population of Delhi as per Census 2011 stands at 167 lakh (1.67 crore) and the projected population as per projection in Master Plan Delhi 2021 is 250 lakh (2.5 crore),” said a release from the chief minister’s office on August 1, 2018, when the Gosain panel’s report was submitted.According to the release, the main recommendations were to ensure there are no encroachments on such drains, sewage is routed through separate sewage channels, dumping of construction and demolition debris is stopped, effective de-silting is carried out and that new stormwater drains are designed and built in such a way that existing run-off estimates and architecture are taken into account.“The document is circulated among various departments who pass their judgment and drainage work is given in bits and pieces by the government to contractors. The drainage plan is ahead of its time and cannot be comprehended by contractors,” said Gosain in an interview to HT. Representatives of the Delhi government did not respond to requests sent on Thursday for comments on the status of the plan.Two other experts supported Gosain’s assessment of the situation. “Delhi’s groundwater recharging area has reduced drastically because of concretisation in the form of roads, paved pedestrian paths, buildings. Where will rain water from a very large surface area go? It will come on to the highways where underpasses don’t have proper drainage. Where they have drainage, it’s not cleaned, it’s choked with plastic,” said CR Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems at Delhi University. “Tree cover along highways can help. They can slow the way rain water falls on the ground and open ground can then be recharged with it,” he added. Manu Bhatnagar, principle director, Natural Heritage Division, INTACH, said: “Unusual flooding is because of very poor engineering and too much paved hard surface. The converse of waterlogging is water harvesting. Even on top of the Barapullah elevated road, water was standing after rain. This shows poor planning and maintenance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/old-drainage-system-unable-to-cope-with-heavy-concretisation/story-xnWNak8AZozgVjBrlsfhJN.html
24-07-2020||India||SC refuses to interfere in HC order on speaker||The Supreme Court on Thursday — in a setback to chief minister Ashok Gehlot and a possible reprieve to his former deputy Sachin Pilot — refused to stay the proceedings of the Rajasthan high court, which is scheduled to pronounce a verdict on disqualification notices sent by the speaker of the state assembly to 19 rebel Congress MLAs, including Pilot.The top court, which was looking at the limited but crucial question of whether the high court can interfere in proceedings initiated by the speaker even before a decision on disqualification has been taken, said that the issue would require greater judicial examination. It agreed to hear the plea filed by Rajasthan speaker CP Joshi from Monday onwards, and ruled that high court’s Friday decision would be subject to the outcome of the top court’s final verdict.“As the high court has already heard the matter after prolonged arguments and reserved the order, we are not staying the passing of the order [by high court]. However, whatever order is passed shall be ultimately subject to the outcome of this petition,” said a three-judge bench led by justice Arun Mishra, and also including justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari.Though the court did not go into the question of the correctness of the speaker’s decision to issue notice and if the actions of the Pilot camp amounted to giving up the membership of the Congress party, justice Mishra observed during the hearing that “voice of dissent cannot be suppressed… then democracy will shut”.“After all they have been elected by the people. Can they not express their dissent? Can voice of dissent be shut down like this in a democracy?” he told senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who was representing the speaker.Proceedings in the high court will resume at 10.30am on Friday. It is expected to pronounce its verdict later in the day.Thursday’s order could be a major boost to the Pilot camp — if the high court on Friday bars the speaker from disqualifying the 19 MLAs, they will remain protected from such proceedings until the top court has reached its verdict. It may, meanwhile, hamper the Gehlot government from calling an assembly session — fearing a no-confidence motion from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — because the numbers in the House are still tenuous for the chief minister.Speaking to reporters on Thursday evening, however, Gehlot said an assembly session would be called “soon”.As things stand, Gehlot appears to have the support of 101 members —the majority mark in the 200-member state assembly (though this does not include speaker CP Joshi). Pilot has 18 other Congress MLAs and three independents in his camp, taking his tally to 22. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. One Congress MLA, Bhanwarlal Meghwal, is indisposed, though he is said to be close to Pilot. If Pilot’s tally is added to that of the opposition alliance, it takes their number up to 97. This means a three-member swing from the Gehlot camp to the Pilot camp or to the BJP could lead to the government falling in the event of a no-confidence motion.Conversely, if the high court allows the speaker to go ahead with the proceedings and disqualify the MLAs — Gehlot will then be more confident in calling an assembly session and proving his majority through a trust vote — the rebels led by Pilot will have legal recourse to challenge the order through a petition in the Supreme Court. The speaker has so far been asked by the high court not to take any decision until after its verdict on Friday.Sibal sought for a stay on the proceedings and the July 21 order of the high court reserved the judgment till Friday. When the court appeared disinclined to grant the prayer, Sibal alternatively sought for the matter before the high court to be transferred to the Supreme Court. This, too, was rejected by the court.But the larger legal question argued in the court emanating from the Rajasthan developments was whether the high court overstepped its jurisdiction by “directing” the speaker to not proceed on the disqualification proceedings.Sibal submitted that the “court cannot direct speaker to extend time (to decide the disqualification proceedings). Court cannot interfere till the speaker gives a decision”. “It is settled by the judgment of this court in Kihoto Hollohan of 1992,” he said.In Kihoto Hollohan’s case, a five-judge Constitution bench held that judicial review should not cover any stage prior to the making of a decision by the speaker/chairman. No interference would be permissible at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings, the court had said.Justice Mishra asked whether the speaker can muzzle dissent within party by using his powers of disqualification.“We are trying to find out whether the procedure adopted (by speaker) is correct or not. Can voice of dissent be shut down like this in a democracy?” he asked.Sibal, however, replied that courts cannot go into the merits of the speaker’s actions before the speaker gives a decision.Senior counsels Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, representing the Pilot camp, questioned the speaker’s decision to approach the Supreme Court after participating in the hearings before the high court for three days.Experts said the Tenth Schedule and the anti-defection law needed examination.“The role of the speaker has to be reconsidered. As it stands today, if the Kihoto Hollohan judgment is applied literally, the speaker’s actions, even if they are completely without authority or jurisdiction, cannot be touched by courts till the speaker actually gives a decision.This could lead to the speaker overstepping his jurisdiction and issuing notices time and again,” said Alok Prasanna Kumar, senior resident fellow at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy. Senior counsel Sanjay Hegde said: “The crucial thing the Supreme Court has done by keeping matter pending, is in a sense to immobilise the speaker till Monday. Even if Rajasthan high court dismisses the petition, its final judgment is not to be implemented till SC hears petition on Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-interfere-in-hc-order-on-speaker/story-lqWoxVlVq3oHaaaoDL6PyI.html

It asked ICMR to clarify its stand on the matter.Utsav Sindhu has filed the plea citing the need for professionals to produce Covid-19 negative reports to travel to several states for work. The plea cited ICMR’s July 1 order asking states to ensure that laboratories are free to conduct tests without the prior requirement of a doctor’s prescription. It added the order was not being complied with.The Delhi government on Monday told the court that ICMR’s Specific Referral Form of Covid-19 makes a doctor’s prescription mandatory for testing. On Tuesday, Sindhu’s lawyer, advocate Manish Tiwari, told the court that Himachal Pradesh’s travel advisory requires a person travelling to the state for tourism to produce a Covid-19 negative report issued by ICMR authorized/certified lab report before undertaking such travel.The lawyer added the requirement of the prescription for the Covid-19 test has been done away with for travel to Chandigarh and Mumbai presumably based on ICMR’s advisory issued on July 1. He contended states were following different criteria that leads to confusion and restricts the people’s inter-state movement.Following this, the court said, “The respondent no 2 [ICMR] is directed to file an affidavit stating its stands on the requirement of a prescription for testing of Covid-19 especially in light of the submissions of the petitioner…. Such affidavit be filed within one week.”The matter would be now heard next on July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-icmr-reply-on-testing/story-B5B0EeuzkvYXxlk0iftQxL.html
24-07-2020||India||NIT, CFTI admissions to be based on JEE||New DelhiCandidates seeking entry to National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and other Centrally Funded Technical Institutes (CFTIs) will be ranked solely on their performance in the upcoming JEE (Main) exam, the human resource development ministry announced on Thursday, doing away with the admission criterion of minimum 75% marks in Class 12 school-leaving exams.“Due to prevailing circumstances, Central Seat Allocation Board (CSAB) has decided to relax the eligibility criterion for admissions to NITs and other centrally funded technical institutions,” HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ tweeted, referring to the Covid-19 outbreak.The coronavirus disease pandemic has affected the academic schedule. Schools and colleges have been closed since the end of March. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and several state boards could not hold all exams for Class 12 and granted marks based on performance in tests that were already conducted. CSAB’s decision to relax the 75% marks rule came against this backdrop and amid a demand for the same by a large section of students.“JEE [Joint Entrance Examination] Main 2020 qualified candidates will now only need to obtain a passing certificate in class XII examination irrespective of the marks obtained,” the HRD minister posted on Twitter.Previously, for admissions to CFTIs, the eligibility was to secure a minimum of 75% marks or rank among the top 20 percentile in the Class 12 board exams, apart from qualifying the JEE-Main.There are over 80 CFITs in India, including including Indian Institutes of Information and Technology (IIITs) and Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs).Last week, the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) did away with the rule making it mandatory for a student to secure 75 % marks in Class 12 board exams for admissions to these premier institutes.The JEE-Main exam, which has been postponed twice, will now be held from September 1-6.While admissions to NITs are decided on the basis of the JEE (Main) exam, candidates seeking entry to IITs have to take another round of test called the JEE (Advanced). The JEE (Main) result is the basis for qualification to appear in JEE (Advanced).“Students have to prepare for both board exams and JEE. However, this year there have been a lot of disruptions. I personally think it is a good move,” said Jashan, a student.“This is a step taken in student interest. Especially, for the mental health of the students who have to prepare for competitive exams in the time of a pandemic. We welcome this move,” said Lalit Kumar Awasthi, director, NIT Jalandhar. “Students who are preparing for competitive exams like JEE have to focus on the application of theorems etc which they learn in the CBSE syllabus. However, this year there has been a lot of upheaval. It is a good step and will allow children to focus on the competitive exam without worrying about other factors,” said eminent educationist Dr Inder Mohan Kapahy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nit-cfti-admissions-to-be-based-on-jee/story-lqJ0BXMxaEn9T0LyzimsFM.html
24-07-2020||India||‘Treat SARI patients as potential Covid-19 cases’: Experts||Patients with symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) symptoms should not be moved to non-Covid spaces in hospitals even if their initial test results for the coronavirus disease are negative, experts treating Covid-19 patients said in their first meeting to present and discuss specific cases and the learnings from them. “We have to give a lot of importance to the clinico-radiological findings of the patient, in spite of the test returning negative. The tests have also to be interpreted in the light of other findings. When index of suspicion is high, the patient should not be transferred to an area where there is risk of spread of disease to other patients. We must have an area in hospitals where such patients can be put till such time there Covid-19 status is confirmed,” said Dr S Rajeshwari, department of anesthesiology, AIIMS. The comments came during the first session of national Clinical Grands Rounds (CGR) on Covid-19 diagnosis. CGR is a globally accepted practice where doctors discuss specific cases. The first session focused on patients who test negative despite showing symptoms of Covid-19 and who, sometimes, test positive in later tests. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, in collaboration with Niti Aayog and Union ministry of health and family welfare, launched the CGR on Covid-19. The first session that took place on Wednesday was on disease diagnosis. Experts who presented cases agreed that apart from test results that can return negative in some rare cases, reports of a chest CT scan or an X-ray should be considered to watch for classic Covid-19 signs that affect the lungs, especially the lower lobe.“There will be separate discussion topics in coming weeks that will deal with issues such as neurological or gastrointestinal manifestations, and Covid in pregnant women,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS. Each case discussion will be followed by a short presentation on clinically relevant topics in managing Covid-19. “Our ultimate aim is to devise a strategy that brings down the number of deaths due to Covid-19 to less than 1% (of cases) as ultimately it is the number of deaths that’s going to matter and not the number of cases,” said Dr Guleria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treat-sari-patients-as-potential-covid-19-cases-experts/story-fs5JjTwPQJ4fJdAcnoAN6L.html
24-07-2020||India||60 AI pilots involved in Vande Bharat mission test positive for Covid-19||At least 60 pilots involved in the Vande Bharat Mission to fly back Indians stranded abroad because of the Covid-19 pandemic have tested positive for the disease, Air India’s Executive Pilots Committee said in a letter on Thursday to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri. The letter, which requested Puri to rescind the national carrier’s decision to revise wages last week, added at least one pilot has lost a family member to Covid-19 and many others have also been infected.The Centre this month said 5,03,990 Indians stranded in 137 countries have been brought back to the country as part of the repatriation mission since it began in May following the suspension of regular international flights due to the pandemic .The letter cited salary cuts and compulsory leave without pay and added it could have a potentially disastrous psychological impact and lead to “desperate and extreme acts”.The Air India’s Board last week approved leave without pay scheme for its permanent employees for six months to two years, which is extendable to up to five years. The national carrier defended its decision saying it is in a very challenging financial situation and taking recourse to several initiatives to ensure the continuance of its operations. It has also decided to cut salaries of its cockpit and cabin crew with effect from April 1.“Our Association is also extremely concerned about the potentially disastrous psychological impact that the massive forced pay cuts and Compulsory Leave Without Pay scheme may create on some employees. We shudder to think of the kind of desperate and extreme acts that could be triggered off because of the prevailing situation– as has been repeatedly proven many times in the past,” the letter said, a copy of which HT has seen. The letter also cautioned against litigation from employees. “As executives, we shall always support all acts and decisions that are financially prudent and serve the company’s best interests. Therefore, we believe that a rising stack of litigations and financial liabilities (contingent and current), arising out of pending financial dues owed to employees could potentially destroy our organization’s future health, and more so, would be unfairly transferred to any prospective buyer of Air India, in case the impending strategic disinvestment.”Air India’s Executive Pilots Committee is one of the pilot’s union of the national carrier.The Indian Commercial Pilot Association on Monday also wrote to the national carrier’s management, saying changes in the wage settlement would be illegal and such a situation has the “potential to flair to unprecedented magnitude.”Air India chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal last week said the national carrier was working on four fronts to reduce costs by reducing the debt, cutting on lease rentals, trimming staffing costs, and reducing operating costs.The cost-cutting drive dovetails with a government plan to sell its entire stake in Air India amid increasing debt and mounting losses. The Centre, in January, started the process by releasing an information document for investors and offering access to financial and other data of Air India and its subsidiaries.The government’s entire stake in Air India, its 100% stake in low-cost subsidiary Air India Express Ltd, and 50% stake in ground handling unit Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited are on offer.An attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw any bids. The airline’s accumulated debt is estimated to be more than Rs 69,000 crore. It posted a loss of Rs 8,556 crore in the financial year 2018-19, as against a net loss of Rs 5,348 crore in the previous financial year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-ai-pilots-involved-in-vande-bharat-mission-test-covid-ve/story-BXM2m8Z1TcOd2h1SeXr7OL.html
24-07-2020||India||Low occupancy in Covid coaches ‘good sign’: Railways||Indian railway’s Covid care coaches have seen less extremely low occupancy rates in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh till date, but the railway ministry sees this as a “good sign”, pointing out that their facilities were only “the last resort” for the state governments.Data collected from the states by the Centre shows that in Delhi, railways deployed 503 coaches with 8048 beds. For every three beds, oxygen cylinders were also provided. “But cumulative admission till yesterday was 208 and number of patients in these beds on Wednesday was 130”, said a top-ranking official of the Modi government, citing reports sent by states to the Centre’s Covid management team.Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh, as against 3784 beds, cumulative admission was 256 and as on Wednesday, not a single bed was occupied, added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Centre built its first prototype of a Covid coach in April ; by May it was ready to deploy 5,231 railway coaches across 215 stations in 15 states considering the possibility of an increase in cases of Covid-19.But with little demand from the states for these coaches, on May 21, the Railway Board wrote to its zones to reconvert 60% of the Covid-19 coaches into normal ones to be utilised on Shramik Special trains launched to ferry stranded migrant workers back to their homes in the Indian hinterland. With the number of cases rising, it was only in June that some states started using these coaches. “At first, it was one of the best innovative and disruptive ideas, but it did not find many takers. Similarly, attaching hospitals to hotels was a good idea but a report from the states show that hotels didn’t get as many patients as was expected,” said a second official who asked not to be named. His reference is to the move to use some hotels to house and treat milder cases of the infection. A third official in the Covid management team said that coaches were largely unused as they didn’t have air-conditioning, were difficult to access, and that states were not keen to use them, a railway spokesperson maintained that lack of occupancy was not due to “any issue” with the Covid care coaches.Railway board chairman VK Yadav underlined, “The most important aspect of the Covid care coaches was that the health ministry said they are to be used only where states have exhausted their facilities and needs to augment capacities for isolation of both suspect and confirmed Covid cases.”“These coaches are provided on the demand of the state governments. We pray to God that these Covid care coaches are used as little as possible and that spread of Covid is controlled. The advantage of these coaches is they can be moved from one place to another. The second advantage is that they can be used to transport the patients. I believe it’s a good sign that they are being used less as cases are reducing and states are able to control,” he said.The rail ministry spokesperson added that the Covid care coaches were meant for very mild cases and aimed to be used as care centres where the states have exhausted the facilities and needs to augment capacities for isolation of both suspect and confirmed Covid cases.According to health ministry’s guidelines, the isolation coaches were meant to be under the complete care of the chief medical officer of the concerned state. The state administration were to provide doctors and paramedics while the railways would deploy two liaison officers in each location of coaches to assist state government officials.The spokesperson also maintained that both Delhi and UP government have appreciated Indian Railways efforts. He also claimed that “with the onset of monsoon, the problem of heat is also solved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/low-occupancy-in-covid-coaches-good-sign-railways/story-BZVQHlUGFYTABgiZQEv3JI.html
24-07-2020||India||Govt approves first central varsity for UT of Ladakh||Nearly a year after the reorganization of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state into two union territories (UTs) including Ladakh, the Narendra Modi government has cleared the decks for the first Central University in the latter, which will also host a Centre on Buddhist Studies, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The move is aimed at addressing the huge vacuum in higher education in the new UT, with many students having to venture out to other states. While the formal decision will be taken after the proposal is moved by the HRD Ministry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in favour of a separate Ladakh university, the people said, as at least 10,000 Ladakhi students have been forced to enrol in educational institutions outside the UT. Barring engineering and medical education, the proposed university will offer degrees in all courses including liberal arts and basic sciences.In 2018, the then government of Jammu and Kashmir state set up a Ladakh University, but this was a so-called cluster university created by pooling all the resources of existing colleges of Ladakh.The creation of Ladakh university was discussed in a meeting on July 20 to review the progress made a year after J&K was reorganized on August 5 last year. Chaired by the Prime Minister, the meeting was attended by Home Minister Amit Shah, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and other top officials.According to the HRD ministry’s proposal, the Ladakh Central University will also cater to students from Lahaul and Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh once the Rohtang La tunnel opens this year and ensures round the year access to Leh via the Jispa-Sarchu-Upshi route. The university will have a Centre for Buddhist Studies to cater to the largely Gelug (to which the 14th Dalai Lama belongs) and Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhist population of Ladakh.While a decision on not allowing students from the Kashmir Valley enrol in higher education institutions in Pakistan -- the country even has a quota for students from Kashmir -- is still awaited, PM Modi reviewed the development in the two UTs over the past year. The people cited in the first instance said the Prme Minister wanted specific improvements in the UTs highlighted in the coming days. He did not want the development debate to digress into the achievements of the state police and security forces on the counter-terrorism front.Indian parliament passed laws and resolutions on August 5 and 6 last year to scrap Article 370 of the constituton, which gave the erstwhile state of J&K special status, and split it into two UTs. The move, the government believed, would help it focus on development in the state, and also address the issue of terror. Even though the government is clear that vested interests within and across the border will try and vitiate the atmosphere close to August 5, there was consensus in the meeting that the development agenda in both the UTs should not be derailed at any cost, the people added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-approves-first-central-varsity-for-ut-of-ladakh/story-LHj4P9fa9UIM50uCQNGhMK.html
24-07-2020||India||In Karnataka, 70% quota for locals in projects||Karnataka on Thursday approved a new five-year industrial policy that reserved 70% jobs in all new industrial projects for local residents, becoming the latest in a clutch of state governments to move towards policies guaranteeing employment for local population.State industries minister Jagadish Shettar said the policy aimed to attract investments worth Rs 5 lakh crore and create employment opportunities for two million people. “With the new policy, the state is aiming at an industrial growth rate of 10 percent per annum, even as we are looking at promoting industrial activity in tier 2 and tier 3 cities outside of Bangalore. The new policy will ensure a well balanced, sustainable and inclusive industrial development in the state.”In recent years, states such as Andhra Pradesh, Harayana, and Goa have announced similar policies that reserved employment opportunities for local residents. “All new industrial projects shall create maximum possible direct employment opportunities with a minimum employment of 70 per cent to Kannadigas on an overall basis and 100 per cent in case of Group D employees,” the 2020-2025 industrial policy read.Policy also aimed to ensure that Karnataka reached the third position among states in merchandise exports over the next five years, Shettar said. It also provides for an amendment to the Factories Act 1948 to allow women to work during night shifts as well as allow overtime to be extended to 125 hours per quarter. For medium, large and mega enterprises, the investment promotion subsidy based on turnover would range from 1.75% to 25% for a period of 5-10 years. It also allows the development of private industrial parks. “Our aim is to emerge as a global leader in advanced manufacturing, research and development, Innovation, and to create an ecosystem for an inclusive, balanced, and sustainable development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-karnataka-70-quota-for-locals-in-projects/story-dOKAzoPuSwXI80CkwGMm1O.html
24-07-2020||India||More swarms expected; tech keeps locusts at bay||More crop-devastating locust swarms are expected to reach India from Somalia in the next few weeks, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has said in a fresh alert, after officials managed to tackle infestations in 3,83,631 hectare of farmland in 10 states in the first wave of attacks, keeping pest population below an economically devastating threshold thus far. Locust numbers are said to cross the economic threshold level when their numbers cross 10,000 adults per hectare (one hectare equals 2.4 acre). Beyond this limit, the pest become economically ruinous and needs aggressive control.“Using our indigenously developed technologies mounted on air force helicopters and continuous surveillance, we have been able to prevent hoppers (wingless baby locust nymphs) from reaching the immature stage of their life-cycle, which is when they are most devastating,” said KL Gurjar, deputy director of the Locust Warning Organisation, the federal agency under agriculture ministry which is responsible for anti-pest operations.Gurjar said operations to kill nymphs so that they did not reach the crop-eating stage has proven successful in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Bihar. Uttarakhand and Bihar are latest states where locusts have appeared.Adult locusts pose considerably less threat than immature ones, which need a lot of food, Gurjar said.Desert locusts can fly hundreds of kilometres a day and one square-km swarm can eat as much crop food as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day, according to the FAO Desert Locust Information Service manual. If unchecked, locust infestations can cause a considerable drop in food output. Two MI-17 helicopters of the air force are conducting operations at short notice after being re-purposed to fight the pest with an indigenously developed technology. Air force pilots are using an in-house technology to spray atomised pesticides from the air, which has been able to track and kill large armies of locusts, Gurjar said.In one of the largest containment exercises, in the intervening night of July 22-23, operations were carried out at 31 places in 9 districts, including Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Churu, Sikar, Nagaur, Pali and Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan and Kutch in Gujarat.“The choppers were needed because they have better manoeuvrability and can target large trails of pests with a special form of the pesticide malathion, which has been indigenously developed,” a second official, requesting anonymity, said. A privately owned Bell helicopter has been deployed by Rajasthan government, apart from 15 drones. The agriculture ministry signed a contract with the UK’s Micron Group to modify two Mi-17 helicopters for spraying atomized pesticides. But the UK-based firm’s supply has now been delayed until September, a second official said.This prompted the air force to task its “no. 3 base repair depot” in Chandigarh to indigenously design an airborne locust control system for Mi-17 helicopters. “Atomized airborne spraying has been successfully achieved in air through a configuration of nozzles mounted on both sides on external trusses of Mi-17 helicopters,” the second official said.The focus of the operation have been largely Rajasthan, a hotspot state where swarms of immature pink locusts and adult yellow locusts are active in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Churu, Sikar, Nagaur, Jaipur, Pali, Hanumangarh, Sriganganagar and Dausa.Dozens of countries, from Kenya to Pakistan, are battling the worst locust outbreak in generations. The migratory insects are setting off from the Horn of Africa, where they are breeding in “insurmountable” numbers due to frequent cyclones, according to the FAO.These cyclones are possibly linked to climate change, according to the FAO. The organisation has already warned the invasions pose a “serious” risk to India’s agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-swarms-expected-tech-keeps-locusts-at-bay/story-BPo0vF5p3detEqTPUtkq0K.html

Over 28 lakh people in 26 of the state’s 33 districts continue to be affected. Over 47,000 displaced people are taking shelter at 456 relief camps. Rescue personnel evacuated 1,102 persons stranded by floods on Thursday.  In Bihar’s Bettiah, three bodies were recovered from different parts of East Champaran as villages in Raxaul, Sikarahana, Bettiah, Bagaha and Pakaridayal sub-divisions continued to be flooded.In Chakiya sub-division, body of a 35-year-old man was recovered from Dhanauti river. Parsuram Paswan was visiting his field when he drowned, said police. In Gokhala village, the body of an 11-year-old boy was recovered from a pond. In Chirraiya, a four-year-old girl drowned in a roadside ditch at Balapur village, said police.“As the water has entered several houses, we are running community kitchens at three places in Nautan, Bairiya and Chanpatiya blocks,” said Bettiah sub-divisional magistrate Vidhyanath Paswan. At least twelve villages in Banjariya blocks were inundated after an embankment on Tilawe river breached on Wednesday, said an official. An estimated 2.4 million children have been affected by the floods in India, the UNICEF said on Thursday, calling for immediate support to address the challenges. In a statement, UNICEF said, “In India, over 6 million people across Bihar, Assam, Odisha, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have been affected by the floods, including an estimated 2.4 million children,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floods-claim-91-lives-in-assam-3-deaths-reported-from-bihar/story-Vcn2dujg3dglFmgWPMamPO.html
24-07-2020||India||Bridging ties to be in focus as diplomats meet on LAC||A day ahead of a crucial meeting of diplomats to review the India-China border standoff, people familiar with developments said on Thursday the focus will be on bridging differences that have led to the stalling of the disengagement and de-escalation process.The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, which held its last virtual meeting on July 10, is expected to reconvene on Friday to review the disengagement process. This will be the mechanism’s fourth meeting since the border standoff emerged in the open and India and China mobilised troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Also Read: Air Force ready to counter aggressive action: IAF chief“Both sides will look at the progress that was to have taken place in the disengagement and de-escalation process as agreed on by the leadership of both countries,” said one of the people cited above. “No one said this process will be simple. It will be complex and long-drawn.”India and China have failed to make a breakthrough in reducing tensions in the sensitive Ladakh sector despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels, and the disengagement process at some points of the LAC has virtually halted.No meeting between Indian and Chinese military commanders is scheduled for now and the possibility of a fifth meeting between them will be considered on the basis of the outcome of the WMCC meeting on Friday, the people said.Also Read: 8 Indian,US warships conduct maritime drills in Indian OceanThe scheduling of a meeting between the corps commanders will also depend on the People’s Liberation Army honouring the understanding on disengagement reached during the previous talks between the generals on July 14-15, the people added.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing on Thursday that the Chinese side would have to cooperate for the “complete disengagement” on the disputed frontier that was agreed on by the Special Representatives for the border issue, India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and China’s foreign minister Wang Yi.Also Read: Stage set for Australia to be part of next Malabar exercise with India, US, Japan“As we have stated earlier, the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is the basis of our bilateral relationship. Therefore, it is our expectation that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation ... as agreed to by Special Representatives,” he said.Srivastava pointed out that “respecting and strictly abiding by the LAC is the basis of peace and tranquillity in the border areas” and this was reflected by several agreements signed by India and China since 1993. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow at Gateway House, said there was a growing impression that de-escalation was a work in progress and would take considerable time. “India will need patience, perseverance, persistence and a dose of firmness....there have been contextual developments that are a good sign, such as the India-US naval exercise in Indian Ocean and the clear message emerging from the air force commanders’ conference,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-extradition-time-frame-in-vijay-mallya-case-uk/story-bChlujfj7tRJNSfu5kgVrL.html
24-07-2020||India||Congress deliberating on timing of floor test amid uncertainty||The Congress on Thursday said it was not disappointed with the Supreme Court’s order related to disqualification notices issued to its 19 rebel lawmakers in Rajasthan as it was not expecting a favourable verdict and has prepared a political plan to deal with the crisis while it is confident of proving its majority. ” The legal battle is just a part of the entire political battle. Knowing and understanding fully well that the courts may not give a decision in our favour, we have prepared our political plan,” said Congress leader Ajay Maken.The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to prevent the Rajasthan high court from pronouncing its decision on Friday on the petition of the rebels, including Sachin Pilot, challenging disqualification notices issued to them by the speaker. The Congress said there are two views in the party on holding a floor test in Rajasthan. “No doubt, floor test is the only solution and we can go for it any opportune time. We are confident of our numbers and will prove majority on the floor of the House. There are two views in our party. One section feels that we should wait for the proceedings in courts to be over and the other suggests that we should immediately go for the floor test,” Maken said.“But as far as the floor test is concerned, we are very confident and will easily cross the majority mark with at least a margin of 15-20 legislators in the final count,” he added, without elaborating. The Congress has the support of 101 legislators in the 200-member assembly; Pilot has the support of 22; the BJP and its allies have 75 members in the assembly; of the other two seats, one s the speaker and the other is an indisposed Congres legislator believed to be close to Pilot. Chief minister Gehlot has claimed the support of 115 legislators. Maken said a ruling party’s legislators seeking a floor test themselves is unheard of and also sought to establish a link between the dissidents and the BJP. “ Why are Harish Salve and Mukul Rohtagi appearing for the rebel legislators? Will they ever appear for the Congress? Who is Gajendra Shekhawat? Why is [Union home minister] Amit Shah’s police protecting them (the legislators)? Why is ED [Enforcement Directorate] raiding relatives of the chief minister? Isn’t this the BJP’s open support to rebel legislators?”The Congress has accused Union minister Shekhawat of being involved in the conspiracy to topple its government. It has alleged his voice can be heard in audiotapes of purported recorded conversations detailing a plot to bring down the government. Shekhawat has denied the charge and said he is ready for a probe.BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli said the Congress’s response to the Supreme Court’s ruling shows a lack of confidence in the strength of its arguments. “It is unfortunate that while invoking the honourable Supreme Court, which gave the Congress a patient hearing and is yet to adjudicate the matter, such a statement is being made. It confirms the Congress party’s lack of confidence in the strength of its own arguments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-deliberating-on-timing-of-floor-test-amid-uncertainty/story-VPfYwSqE0df115KcR46MFL.html
24-07-2020||India||Not just tax officials, 4 intel, investigating agencies get access to your I-T records||The Cabinet Secretariat, the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have been formally authorised to access income-tax returns (ITRs) and other tax-related information of individuals or firms, a move that will help these agencies in their efforts to curb terrorism and check drug trafficking, two government official said.A notification to this effect was issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Tuesday, the officials said requesting anonymity. Section 138 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 empowers CBDT to furnish information received or obtained by income tax authorities to any other enforcement authority, they added.Himanshu Parekh, partner and head - corporate and international tax at consultancy firm KPMG in India said, “The intention behind allowing such a free flow of information would be to empower the other agencies to take requisite action against the alleged offenders of law under different statutes.”Also Read: Covid-19 may further skew India’s tax profileThis provision enables “automatic” exchange of information relating to income-tax assesses with any tax authority, the Reserve Bank of India, and any other authority notified by the government, Naveen Wadhwa, a deputy general manager at Taxmann said. “The recent notification allows the tax department to share information of a taxpayer which might be relevant for the notified enforcement agencies,” he added.The officials cited above said seamless sharing of information with enforcement authorities such as NIA and NCB aims at greater national security. “While an honest taxpayer should not worry, incongruous information provided by unscrupulous elements to different authorities will now be caught,” one of the officials said.“The move has also made information exchange between the tax authority and other agencies formal and legally tenable in a court of law,” the second official added.

While CBDT is responsible for income-tax related matters, CBIC is the apex body for customs, central excise and GST.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-secy-ib-nia-can-access-itrs-tax-info/story-r3uO6bYvTnharzXGyjh8aM.html
24-07-2020||India||Birth, death registration rates at all-time high in ’18||Birth and death registration rates in India were at an all-time high in 2018 with nearly nine in every ten births and deaths being registered, according to the latest civil registration system report published this week.More than 23.2 million births were registered in India in 2018 against an estimated 26 million live births which took place in the country – a registration rate of 89.3%. This is 4.4 percentage points more than the level of registration in the previous year.The birth registration rate increased between 2017 and 2018 after falling for three consecutive years. It was just 57.7% in 2003, increased every year reaching 88.8% in 2014 before showing a declining trend.Nearly seven million deaths were also registered in 2018 against more than eight million deaths estimated to have occurred in the country that year, a death registration rate of 86%. This is 6.4 percentage points more than the previous year. It also marks the eighth consecutive year for which the death registration rate in India has been increasing.It is compulsory to report births and deaths to the Registrar of Births and Deaths in India. Registration of birth is a right of every child and the first step towards establishing the child’s legal identity. Even as the birth registration rate of 89.3% looks promising, it also means that births of more than 10% or nearly 2.8 million children were not registered in 2018.Between 2017 and 2018, the birth registration rate increased in nine states while it decreased in 17 other states and union territories. Four states saw the highest percentage point growth in birth registrations between 2017 and 2018 – 18.6 percentage points in Uttar Pradesh, 12.2 in Uttarakhand, 8.3 in West Bengal and 6.6 in Bihar. At the same time, birth registration rate dropped by more than six percentage points in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in this period.The birth registration rate was 100% in 2018 in 13 states. Ten of these states had 100% registration rate in 2017 as well while the remaining three have also reached the 100% mark at least once in past few years.A bigger number of states have fared better in terms of improvement in death registration rates between 2017 and 2018. The rate increased in 16 states and dropped in only six others. It remained unchanged at 100% in 14 other states. In 2018, a total of 16 states recorded 100% registration of deaths. Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh marked the best improvement in terms of death registration rates as well, increasing it by 23.8 and 22.5 percentage points between 2017 and 2018 respectively.On the other hand, Telangana, Nagaland and Bihar saw the highest percentage point drop in death registration rates, 15, 11.4 and 8.1 percentage points respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/birth-death-registration-rates-at-all-time-high-in-18/story-17pgjXlOLPxarzWkW2KE3H.html
24-07-2020||India||MM Joshi denies charges in Babri demolition case||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Murli Manohar Joshi on Thursday denied all charges against him in the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition case, and dubbed them as fabricated and politically motivated. Joshi, 86, appeared before the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court to record his statements through video conferencing from his residence in New Delhi. Lawyer KK Mishra represented Joshi in the CBI court in Lucknow. “During the court proceedings, Joshi answered around 300 questions,” Mishra said. Judge Surendra Kumar Yadav of the CBI court ordered that a PDF file of Joshi’s statements be sent to the central agency’s Delhi office via email. The court also ordered CBI to get Joshi’s statement signed by him and sent back to the CBI court. On Friday, senior BJP leader LK Advani, 92, will appear before the CBI court via video link from his residence in New Delhi to record his statements. With Advani’s statement, the CBI court will complete recording statements of all 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, barring Shiv Sena leader Satish Pradhan, who has tested positive for Covid-19 and is under quarantine in Mumbai. The court has fixed July 28 for Pradhan to record his statements. Another accused, Om Prakash Pandey of Uttarakhand, is absconding for the last 16 years and the CBI court has issued orders to seize his property. The Babri mosque in Ayodhya was brought down on December 6, 1992 by kar sevaks who believed the structure was built on the birthplace of Hindu God Ram. The decades-old dispute over the site was settled last year when the Supreme Court ordered that the site be given to a trust to build a temple, and that alternative land be provided in Ayodhya for a mosque. Advani, Joshi, and others have been accused of being involved in the conspiracy to demolish the mosque.The foundation-stone laying ceremony of the temple is expected to be held in the first week of August with the Prime Minister in attendance. Advani, too, is expected to attend the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mm-joshi-denies-charges-in-babri-demolition-case/story-9RsPSoYcG2SePF0z2PzaKL.html
24-07-2020||India||Pilot, rebels move Rajasthan HC to add Centre as party||Sacked deputy chief minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs, who challenged notices for disqualification issued by the assembly speaker in the Rajasthan high court, moved an application before the high court on Thursday asking the court to include the Union government as a party to the case as validity of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution has been challenged.In the application through counsels S Hariharan and Divyesh Maheshwari, the legislators prayed that the Union of India through the secretary of Ministry of Law and Justice (Department of Legal Affairs) be made a party respondent to the present writ petition in the interest of justice and law.The application said that the union government should be included as a party because the validity of constitutional provisions (10th schedule) are under challenge. The 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India contains provisions relating to disqualification of lawmakers for defection.An identical application was also filed in the Supreme Court where the Rajasthan assembly speaker filed a special leave petition (SLP).The application was filed on the day the Supreme Court took up a plea by assembly speaker CP Joshi asking the top court to stay Rajasthan high court order of July 21 which directed speaker to defer action on the speaker’s notice till July 24. The Supreme Court eventually declined Joshi’s prayer to stay the proceedings before the high court and deferred the matter for further hearing on July 27.On July 15, the dissident Congress MLAs led by Pilot challenged their disqualification notices through a writ petition which was taken up on July 17 by a bench of Rajasthan High Court, comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta, and arguments were held.The hearing continued on Monday and the arguments concluded on Tuesday. The court will give its order in the writ petition on Friday.The notices to MLAs were served on July 17 after the chief whip of the party complained to the speaker that the legislators had defied a direction to attend two Congress Legislature Party meetings on Monday and Tuesday last week.The Pilot camp, however, argued that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.In its complaint to the Legislative Assembly Speaker, the Congress had sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2 (1) (a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution.The provision disqualifies MLAs if they ‘voluntarily’ give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.Pilot was sacked as deputy chief minister and the president of the state unit of the party after he rebelled against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.Legal expert Pana Chand said the application seemed to be an attempt to delay the proceedings in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-rebels-move-hc-to-add-centre-as-party/story-phZjwWWvYFSPzIQS4xpyaN.html
24-07-2020||India||EC defers bypolls to eight assembly constituencies||By-elections to eight assembly constituencies due in June-July have been deferred till September 7, the Election Commission said on Thursday.The polls deferred are those in Rangapara in Assam, Kuttanad in Kerala, Joura in Madhya Pradesh, Southern Angami in Nagaland, Pungro Kiphire in Nagaland, Bangermau in Uttar Pradesh, Suar in Uttar Pradesh and Dumka in Jharkhand.“It is hereby clarified that the aforesaid communication is only in respect of eight constituencies regarding which a reference to Ministry of Law & Justice was made vide letter No. 99/bye-election/2020/EPS dated 03.7.2020 due to some extraordinary circumstances peculiar to these constituencies,” EC statement said.“However, the total number of bye-elections due is 56 Assembly Constituencies (including the eight referred to earlier) besides one Parliamentary Constituency. Out of these total number of 57 bye-elections, it is hereby clarified that the Commission has already taken a decision to hold all bye-election as per provisions of Section 151A of the R.P. Act. In any case the deferring of aforementioned eight bye-elections is only up to 7th September, 2020,” the statement added.Under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the commission is supposed to hold a by-election within six months of any seat getting vacated either due to the death of a legislator or his/her resignation. The six-month period has not lapsed for the other 48 other assembly seats and one parliamentary seat.The issue of when the by-elections will be conducted is likely to be discussed on Friday at a meeting of the commission.According to EC officials who did not wish to be named, elections to the eight seats could not be conducted due to the “Covid-19 pandemic and other prevailing conditions in some of the states”.A new date will now be issued after EC’s consultations with the Centre. “The by-elections are likely to be conducted in September,” an EC official said on the condition of anonymity.The Congress’s Uttar Pradesh committee chief, Ajay Lallu, said the government decided to defer the polls because it was on the back foot over countering the pandemic, law and order and the situations of farmers.“On one hand, the pandemic is spreading rapidly in state,” Lallu said. “But to keep an assembly seat vacant for over six months is also not constitutional. EC will have to conduct polls soon.”However, state BJP spokesperson Chandramohan said the EC’s decision is independent of any politics. “The commission is an autonomous body,” said Chandramohan. “They must have taken into account the situation caused to the Covid-19 pandemic and then taken a call.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-defers-bypolls-to-eight-assembly-constituencies/story-dhIFQlVqoMhXgzlHNxQeHL.html
24-07-2020||India||Permanent commission for women in army approved||Five months after the Supreme Court ruled that women officers, who have joined the Indian Army through Short Service Commission (SSC), are entitled to a permanent commission, the defence ministry on Thursday issued a formal sanction letter in this regard. The order will pave the way for “empowering women officers to shoulder larger roles in the organisation”, an army spokesperson said.“In anticipation, the Army Headquarters had set in motion a series of preparatory actions for conduct of the Permanent Commission Selection Board for affected women officers,” the army said in statement. The board will be scheduled as soon as the SSC women officers exercise their option and complete the requisite documentation. The statement said the army is committed to providing equal opportunities to all personnel including women officers to serve the country.The Supreme Court in February ruled that women should be considered for command roles and that all women officers are entitled to permanent commission. It asked the army to give them permanent commission within three months in a major boost to gender parity. The Centre got a one-month extension on July 7 to implement the Supreme Court’s verdict after it moved an application before the apex court seeking the extension of the deadline by another six months citing the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to check its spread from March 25.The army, in May, made the Battle Physical Efficiency Test (BPET) mandatory for all women officers including those commissioned before 2009 and over the age of 35 (these officers were previously exempt). In March, it made a junior command course at Army War College, Mhow mandatory for women officers. There are around 600 women officers eligible for permanent commission, and a third of them are over the age of 40. Both moves have come in for criticism for women officers who have pointed to their timing -- after the SC’s verdict. The Supreme Court’s judgment was hailed for creating a new equality paradigm in the armed forces. It upheld a 2010 Delhi high court verdict. The Supreme Court ruled that women officers, who joined the Indian Army through SSC, are entitled to permanent commission even if they have more than 14 years of service. It also held that there cannot be an “absolute bar” on women officers being considered for command appointments, paving the way for their elevation to such roles. The case before the Supreme Court was only about permanent commission and command roles in the army’s non-combat streams.The defence ministry’s sanction specifies grant of permanent commission to SSC women officers in 10 streams--Army Air Defence, Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, Army Service Corps, Army Ordnance Corps, and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General and Army Educational Corps.Advocate Aishwarya Bhati, who represented women officers in the Supreme Court, said it was wonderful to finally see the defence ministry’s sanction. “I am elated,” said Bhati.Wing Commander Anupama Joshi (retd), who is from the first batch of women officers commissioned into the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the 1990s, said the government should be lauded over the defence ministry’s move. “As they say ‘a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.’ The government needs to be lauded for this leap. The equity has been achieved. However, equality still remains a goal to strive for,” said Joshi. She said the army should allow women in combat roles too.The Supreme Court in February ruled the army’s SSC women officers are entitled to permanent commission and they have to be considered for it irrespective of their service length. It held the Centre’s policy of restricting the permanent commission to SSC women officers with less than 14-year service as violative of the right to equality. The judgement was delivered on defence ministry’s petition challenging the 2010 Delhi high court verdict that ruled that SSC women officers in the army and IAF should be granted permanent commission on par with male SSC officers.The Centre issued a notification in February 2019 granting permanent commission to SSC officers of the army. However, as per its proposal, only SSC women officers with up to 14 years of service were to be considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/permanent-commission-for-women-in-army-approved/story-hj6ScKvb48UYDJgHsyyh3L.html
24-07-2020||India||Notice to youth climate group under UAPA ‘clerical error’: Delhi Police||The Delhi Police on Thursday said a July 8 notice sent to youth climate group Fridays For Future under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) was a clerical error, saying they had withdrawn it and sent a fresh one under milder sections on July 12.On July 8, police had issued a notice to Fridays For Future under Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which invokes Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, saying their website depicted contents “which are dangerous for the peace, tranquillity and sovereignty of India.” The notice was issued following a complaint by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar over getting multiple emails on his email with the subject ‘EIA2020’ (draft environment impact assessment notification 2020). Delhi Police on Thursday however said the July 8 notice issued under UAPA was a “clerical error”, which was withdrawn, and a fresh notice was sent to the group under Section 66 of the IT Act on July 12. Delhi Police’s additional commissioner MS Randhawa said late on Thursday that the police on July 16 wrote to Endurance Domains Technology, clarifying that they had also withdrawn the July 12 notice under Section 66 of the IT Act because the “unlawful activity had ceased”. “The notice under 66 IT Act (dated July 12) was also withdrawn on July 16 because such unlawful activities had ceased. The first notice (dated July 8) under the incorrect sections was a clerical error, so there was a fresh notice under 66 IT (on July 12) sent to the website. But this was also withdrawn on July 16 and the matter was settled,” Randhawa said.The Internet Freedom Foundation, which is providing legal help to Fridays For Future (the India arm of a global climate movement started by Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg in 2018), however, said they haven’t received any updated notice. Section 79 (3)(b) of the IT Act refers to being notified by government or government agency of any data or communication link being used to commit an unlawful act. Section 66 of the IT Act pertains to criminalising sending of offensive messages through a computer or other communication devices. Deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell), Anyesh Roy also said the July 8 notice under sections of UAPA was a clerical error. The officer said police learnt of the error on July 12, withdrew the notice and sent a fresh notice under Section 66 of IT Act the following day. “The notice was supposed to be sent under section 66 IT Act. It got mixed up with the other notice that was to be sent that day. We immediately withdrew the first notice and sent a fresh once under the correct section,” Roy said. According to the Internet Freedom Foundation, Fridays For Future’s website had been disabled by its domain service provider on July 10. Upon enquiry, the service provider had informed them that the website had been blocked in accordance with a notice received from the Delhi Police under Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which also invokes the UAPA. Fridays For Future shared a copy of the notice with the media, which read that after investigation on Javadekar’s complaints it was found that the website was sending emails to him. “Their unlawful activities on this website may disturb peace, sovereignty of India,” it said. “The website depicts objectionable contents and unlawful activities or terrorist acts, which are dangerous for the peace, tranquillity and sovereignty of the India. The publication and transmission of such objectionable contents is a cognizable and punishable criminal offence under Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,” the notice added. Punishment for conspiracy under the act is punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine. “The Draft EIA Notification 2020 is in public domain. Any suggestion and public comment can be sent to the official mail provided for the purpose i.e. eia2020-moefcc@gov.in till August 10, 2020 as mentioned in the notification. How is spamming the hon’ble minister’s personal mail with a lakh mails justified?” asked MOEFCC official spokesperson Gaurav Khare. Javadekar did not respond to requests for a comment. Fridays for Future, in a statement on Thursday, said their website fridaysforfuture.in was taken down on July 10 without any notice during the peak of their awareness campaign that intended to draw attention to the draft EIA Notification 2020 and make it easier for people to raise their concerns by writing an email to the MOEFCC and the environment minister. On Wednesday, Fridays For Future also sent a representation to the Delhi Police seeking the restoration of its website. The representation clarified that the website merely provided a template to make it easier for citizens to participate in the public consultation on the Draft EIA notification and it did not send the emails received by Javadekar which were actually sent by concerned citizens from their personal email IDs. “We are youth in India, inspired by the global Fridays for Future movement, who came together in 2019, after connecting digitally, to do good for the environment, our community and our country. We support our government’s on the commitments made to mitigate the effects of climate change…we raise awareness and engage in knowledge sharing online on related environmental issues, along with beach clean-ups, garbage drives, tree planting campaigns, community outreach, and sustainable lifestyle sessions, all without any financial support. Our website was a platform for those interested, to join us, and participate actively to protect the environment,” the group’s Thursday statement added. HT had reported on July 16 that the websites of three environmental, youth and student movements have been blocked since June 29. These include fridaysforfuture.in; letindiabreathe.in and thereisnoearthb.com--Indian movements focused on various environmental issues including air pollution. It couldn’t be confirmed if the two others were also blocked following Delhi police notice. “I think digital activism in today’s world for all issues specially climate justice is a very important avenue. Covid-19 has made it difficult for climate justice campaigners to do climate strikes and hence they provided a digital platform for people to reach out to public officials. It’s their constitutional duty to protect and work for the environment. Shocking that public officials are threatening them with charges of illegalities,” said Apar Gupta, lawyer representing Fridays For Future. The draft EIA 2020 has been in the eye of a storm because it is expected to overhaul the process of environmental regulation of infrastructure projects and has contentious clauses on regularising projects that violate environmental norms and shortening the time period for public hearings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/notice-to-youth-climate-group-under-uapa-clerical-error-delhi-police/story-Z3KES7Ksy0aD1qYweBdXxM.html
24-07-2020||India||Rajasthan police to probe role of Shekhawat in co-op case||A Jaipur court has ordered the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police to probe the alleged role of Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, his wife, and three others, in the Rs 884 crore Sanjivani Credit Cooperative Society fraud case.Additional district judge Pawan Kumar issued the order on July 21 -- it was made public on Thursday -- on a revision petition seeking, among other things, an investigation into the role of the Union Jal Shakti minister and his wife Naunad Kanwar in the fraud case registered by SOG in September 2019. The petition was filed by Ladu Singh and Guman Singh, residents of Barmer, who, along with some 50,000 other people, invested in the scheme that offered interest between 10% and 12%. Ladu Singh claimed to invest Rs 54 lakh and and Guman Singh Rs 14 lakh with Sanjivani Cooperative Society.They alleged that they got no return for their investments, and the money trail led to companies linked with Shekhawat and his wife. The head of Sanjivani Cooperative Society, Vikram Singh, was arrested last September and is in jail since then on charges of cheating, forgery and fraud.Shekhawat’s office said the Union minister will study the order before commenting on it. “We will read the order before putting out our reaction,” said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Rajendra Rathore, who is the deputy leader of Opposition in the state assembly.Shekhawat has been in the news in recent days after the Congress alleged his voice can be heard in audio tapes of purported conversations detailing a plot to topple the Ashok Gehlot government. Shekhawat has denied the charge and said he is ready for a probe. He was also named by chief minister Gehlot in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about an alleged attempt by the BJP to bring down the Rajasthan government.The SOG earlier this week issued a notice to Shekhawat to record his statement in connection with the taped conversations. Shekhawat had denied any role in state’s political crisis, and said that none of the voices in the tapes are his.The counsel for the complainants, Ajay Kumar Jain, said a magistrate’s court in Jaipur rejected the petition on July 13. But the additional district judge Kumar accepted a revision petition, filed on June 20. “I direct the investigative agency to conduct a probe into the complaint,” Kumar said in his order dated July 21.The cooperative society, which began operations in 2008 from Barmer, had allegedly cheated 50,000 investors of Rs 884 crore, the SOG said in a charge sheet filed in a Jaipur court on December 13, 2019.“The SOG found that documents between the year 2008 and 2015 were destroyed by the office-bearers of the society. Till June 30 this year (2019), 214,472 investors had invested Rs 883.38 crore but none of them were paid maturity dues,” the charge sheet added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-police-to-probe-role-of-shekhawat-in-co-op-case/story-7zoeS3q3UHJqNyhLKNValI.html
24-07-2020||India||Assembly session soon, will prove majority: Rajasthan CM||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said he will call an assembly session soon to prove his majority and later met governor Kalraj Mishra, hours after the Supreme Court dealt a blow to his camp by refusing to stay proceedings in the Rajasthan high court on the disqualification of 19 rebel legislators, including former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.Gehlot did not elaborate on when the session would be called but added that all issues -- from Covid to politics - will be discussed. “The assembly session will be called soon and we will prove the mandate in the house,” he told reporters. Later in the evening, he met Mishra for about 20 minutes and officials termed it a courtesy call. Congress leaders said on condition of anonymity that the meeting was to apprise the governor of political developments and discuss the possibility of holding a session. In his press conference, Gehlot expressed hope that rebel MLAs will come back and vote for the party in the assembly session.“Some of them (dissident MLAs) are calling and saying that we aren’t able to come out… bouncers are deployed. Even without them, we have the full majority and will come to the house with those numbers, and prove the mandate,” he said.His comments came hours after the top court refused to suspend proceedings of the Rajasthan high court, which is scheduled to pronounce a verdict on disqualification notices sent by speaker CP Joshi to 19 rebel Congress MLAs, including Pilot. The court is expected to pronounce its verdict on Friday. In the 200 member Rajasthan assembly, Gehlot camp has 101 legislators and Pilot camp has 22 -- including 19 Congress rebels and three independents. The Opposition has 75 MLAs, including 72 of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and three of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party.One legislator Bhanwarlal Meghwal -- believed to be close to Pilot -- is indisposed and the speaker casts his vote only to break a tie. This effectively means that Gehlot enjoys a narrow majority at the moment. Despite the ongoing turmoil in the state, the opposition BJP has not openly sought a trust vote so far . According to the rules, the governor notifies an assembly session 21 days prior to the first sitting but in an emergency situation, a session can be called within 24 hours for a specific agenda. The business of the house is decided by the Business Advisory Committee, which is headed by speaker CP Joshi.A senior government official said the legislative agenda might include approving an ordinance to amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, which the state government used in May to hike penalties for lockdown violations. “The calling of the assembly session would be more for disqualification of the rebel MLAs and negate any adverse ruling by the Rajasthan high court,” said a Congress leader, who was not willing to be named. The leader said a whip could be issued on voting on Ordinance and those failing to attend could be served disqualification notices for failing to attend the vote.In his press conference, Gehlot backed speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notice to 19 rebel legislators and said only “misguided” MLAs went to the court.“There are many judgments of the Supreme Court, where when the intentions are known that the MLA wants to leave the party voluntarily, the Speaker can issue notice and after holding hearings and discussions can take a decision on disqualification,” Gehlot said.The notices were issued on the petition filed by Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi with the speaker claiming that not attending the legislative party meeting translated to the rebel MLAs voluntarily giving up their party membership. The rebel MLAs moved the high court, claimed that the grounds of the notice was violation of constitutional guidelines and anti-defection laws.Gehlot also challenged Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to get his voice sample tested in connection with a controversy over a set of audio tapes. The Congress claims the tapes prove that Shekhawat was involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the state government while the central minister has denied all charges and said his voice is not heard in the tapes. “We can send it (audio tapes) for forensic lab testing to America, if they (BJP) have no trust in the government of Rajasthan,” Gehlot said. He added that the Congress was not afraid of raids by central agencies, referring to a number of raids in the past two weeks on firms and individuals with ties to the chief minister. BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the recent events exposed the CM, who did not have the legislators to prove his majority. “The CM’s statement has neither truth nor evidence,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assembly-session-soon-will-prove-majority-cm/story-7W33w69yt5VWU3i5hClsBM.html
24-07-2020||India||India builds a huge wall to stop Chinese firms from getting govt contracts||The Union finance ministry, in a late night development on Thursday, made an important amendment in its public finance rule that barred all government agencies from procuring goods and services from bordering countries such as China and Pakistan on the grounds of national security, two officials said requesting anonymity. “The Government of India today amended the General Financial Rules (GFR) 2017 to enable imposition of restrictions on bidders from countries which share a land border with India on grounds of defence of India, or matters directly or indirectly related thereto including national security,” the finance ministry said in a statement. The GFR laws regulate all matters related to public finance.The order takes into its ambit all public sector companies, autonomous bodies and public-private partnership (PPP) projects receiving financial support from the government, it said.

24-07-2020||India||Prashant Kishor’s year-long Bengal survey behind CM Mamata’s big TMC shake up||Trinamool’s Lok Sabha member Mahua Moitra and former Indian cricketer and party legislator Laxmi Ratan Shukla have been made in charge of important district units in Bengal as chief minister Mamata Banerjee decided to overhaul the face of the party leadership by putting young faces at the centre of its campaign for the 2021 assembly polls.Veterans and those facing charges were either shunted out or given higher posts that TMC insiders described as “non-functional” in election-related matters.Banerjee replaced some key functionaries in north Bengal, where the BJP won all seven Lok Sabha seats in 2019, as well as those in the western districts of Purulia, and Bankura where the BJP’s deep inroads into the region’s sizeable tribal population ensured victory in the four Lok Sabha seats.Of the total votes polled in 2019, the BJP got 40.64%, winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats; while the TMC got 43.69%, winning 22 seats.In a simultaneous move, the TMC’s youth wing headed by the chief minister’s nephew Abhisek Banerjee was also overhauled and presidents of several district units were replaced in an apparent bid to end infighting between leaders of the party’s general and youth wings in several pockets.The TMC did away with poll observers and formed a seven-member steering committee for the 2021 assembly polls and a 21-member coordination committee. Significantly, Abhisek Banerjee was inducted in both committees. The massive changes, TMC leaders said, were made on the basis of a year-long survey made by political strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by the chief minister after the debacle in 2019.The poll results indicated that a sizeable chunk of young voters supported the BJP. For the ruling party, this is a cause for concern before the crucial assembly polls where alleged nepotism in distribution of cyclone relief funds and mismanagement in the health sector can be raging issues. “The allegations, though mostly blown out of proportion by the BJP’s campaign machinery, made it necessary for the party to bring in fresh faces, especially those who have a clean image,” a cabinet minister told HT on condition of anonymity. Significantly, Chhatradhar Mahato - the tribal leader from Jhargram district who headed the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCAPA), an alleged Maoists-backed outfit during the last years of Left rule and released from jail after 10 years - was inducted into the TMC state committee. His life term was commuted by the high court and the state released him in February.The BJP was not sitting idle. On Thursday, state president Dilip Ghosh and national secretary Rahul Sinha started a series of crucial meetings in Delhi with BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and Arvind Menon, who is in charge of West Bengal, to assess the party’s organisational strength in each of the state’s 294 assembly seats. BJP national executive member Mukul Roy, who switched over from the TMC in 2017 and masterminded several defections, is also in Delhi and he met Vijayvargiya on Wednesday. More leaders from Bengal will take part in these meetings.The Bengal BJP leaders will stay in Delhi till Saturday for more meetings, including one with party president JP Nadda. They are also scheduled to meet home minister Amit Shah.“Around 40 assembly seats were reviewed till Thursday afternoon. The central leadership wants our outreach programme to intensify in every polling booth area, especially in north and western Bengal where the TMC will now try to make a comeback. Also, our focus is on SCs, STs and erstwhile Hindu refugees from Bangladesh, a sizeable section of whom are Dalits,” a senior BJP leader told HT on condition of anonymity. To counter the BJP, Mamata Banerjee sent out a clear message to party workers and voters that she will not tolerate those who violate discipline, indulge in nepotism or keep personal interest above that of the party, said a TMC minister who did not want to be quoted. Citing examples, the minister said that cooperation department minister Arup Roy, who was president of the Howrah district unit and was recently accused of shielding corrupt leaders by forest minister Rajib Banerjee, a young face of the TMC, has been replaced.In another example, Swaroop Biswas, president of the TMC youth wing in south Kolkata and younger brother of PWD minister Aroop Biswas was replaced. The minister too did not find a place in the core committee despite being younger to most members of the cabinet.“I am happy. Now I have to tour all the 17 assembly segments,” said Lok Sabha member Mahua Moitra, who has been made president of the TMC’s Nadia district unit. “We have to keep working for the people. I will try to fulfill my responsibility,” said former cricketer Shukla, who has been made president of the Howrah district unit.State BJP leaders called the changes in TMC an eyewash and said it will not help Banerjee remain in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-kishor-s-year-long-west-bengal-survey-behind-cm-mamata-banerje-s-big-tmc-shake-up/story-Fqg72zL8dls0t7KNl8B5IO.html
