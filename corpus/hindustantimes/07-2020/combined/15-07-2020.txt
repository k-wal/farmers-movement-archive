15-07-2020||News||Why water and sanitation must remain top priorities | Opinion||Could the coronavirus pandemic be the catalyst needed to aggressively pursue the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for water and sanitation? Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services are critical in protecting us during infectious disease outbreaks. Washing hands was one of the key messages when the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) goals were set five years ago. The SDGs constitute 17 main goals, most of them interconnected. But the fate of SDG-6, to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” is critical now. This contributes significantly to economic development, poverty reduction, education, and, most important, at this point in time, health.While rural India was declared open-defecation-free (ODF) on October 2, 2019, we now need to sustain the gains made under SBM to ensure that the health and hygiene benefits continue to be realised. It is critical that ODF behaviour is sustained, and every village/ward has access to solid and liquid waste management. Aligned to that, SBM Phase II both in rural and urban, brings challenges which are likely to be tougher. SDG Target 6.1 requires achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030. While this is a difficult target, the current pandemic may have encouraged governments to prioritise the supply of clean water. The government had demonstrated the willingness and vision to address water woes months ahead of the pandemic. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi flagged the growing water crisis even as the country neared the target of achieving ODF status, and declared that around ~3.5 trillion would be spent under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), aimed at providing potable water to all households by 2024.The plan was to make JJM merit-based. A contest between state governments for central funds was proposed, which meant that states would be rewarded with funds based on commitments and outcomes. Besides, the central government also announced that it would be co-opting non-governmental organisations to help village councils and their sub-committees to manage the planning and running of the local water supply system.There are challenges both because of the scale of operation of the programme as also finances, and both are turning out to be more difficult in this current crisis. Historically, only 35 million Indian rural households have access to functional tap water. We have a total of 185 million households, which means we will have to cover four times more households in the next five years. After supplying water, we need to plan for the reuse of the grey water, or discharged water. Both these would have to be taken care of through the convergence of different government schemes. A study on financial requirements and gaps for achieving the SDGs in India, conducted in 2015, at the behest of United Nations Development Programme and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change assessed that to achieve the SDG Target 6.1 would take ~4 lakh crore (2015-22) and Target 6.2 (related to sanitation and hygiene) would need ~1.56 lakh crore (2015-19). The expenditure on rural sanitation had increased at an annual growth rate of more than 20% over the last 10 years. This public financing, coupled with support from the World Bank ($1.5 billion loan for the rural mission), helped India to ensure that everyone in rural areas has access to improved sanitation, leading to the success of reduction of open defecation by 2019.Providing adequate access to sanitation facilities did not end when onsite technologies were built (twin pits and septic tanks) under the mission. SDG Target 6.2 was upgraded to include the safe disposal or offsite treatment of excreta. This meant additional resources and a new time frame. SBM Phase II addresses this in the rural context, getting positioned as a unique convergent and co-financing model wherein, apart from budgetary allocations from the Centre and states, funds will come from the 15th Finance Commission, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and private sector participation. The government had declared that phase II of SBM Rural, to be implemented from 2020-21 to 2024-25, will see investment to the tune of ~1,40,000 crore.However, when things were right on track, Covid-19 struck and government budgets have gone haywire as resources have been reallocated to contain the spread of the virus and help those affected by it. So, water and sanitation have taken a back seat in the list of priorities. Based on a three-fold categorisation of ministries/departments, expenditure in several of these have been restricted to within 15-20% of that budgeted for FY21 in the April-June quarter — both SBM (Rural) and SBM (Urban) ministries fell within the 15% bracket.There is evidence that similar viruses (but no evidence yet to suggest that SARS-CoV-2) can remain infectious for days to weeks in untreated wastewater (faecal matter included). Conventional wastewater treatment processes could reduce the risk, posed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus through untreated wastewater. While there have been no reported cases of Covid-19 due to contact with faeces of an infected individual, human waste is hazardous, contains numerous pathogens and so should be safely managed in all settings during and post the pandemic.SDG Targets 6.1 and 6.2 remain relevant during this pandemic with their focus on hygiene, sanitation and provision of water, all of which impact the health of communities. Both central and state governments must direct spends to these areas — even in these difficult times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-water-and-sanitation-must-remain-top-priorities/story-cd1AXNdjJh82S8gu1FrjPK.html
15-07-2020||News||Covid-19: From the US, lessons on what not to do | Opinion||The United States (US), which has the most expensive health care infrastructure in the world, remains, by far, the country most affected by the coronavirus pandemic with more than 3.5 million cases and around 140,000 fatalities as of July 15. Sadly, more than six months after the onset of the pandemic, the US appears to be far from flattening the infections curve.These problematic conditions were created by a seriously flawed response to Covid-19 from its initial identification until today. There were 10 major deficiencies, all of which provide lessons on what not to do. One, decisions were made politically, rather than scientifically. This failure began at the top with President Donald Trump. He was initially dismissive of the coronavirus comparing it to the seasonal flu. He appointed Vice-President (V-P) Mike Pence to head a task force to advise on what to do but gave it no real authority.Two, no national plan, backed by law, was devised to address the pandemic. The V-P’s task force developed guidelines for states and localities for testing, tracking and treatment of the virus; sheltering in place; and, the use of masks and social distancing to prevent its spread. These were only guidelines, not mandatory rules or law. Three, the pandemic was treated as a state and local issue. There was no standardised federal intervention on the pandemic. The governors and local officials were made responsible for handling it. As a result, the approaches and results varied considerably from state to state.Four, there was limited national access to testing, medical equipment and supplies. The federal government furnished a nominal amount of these, but the supplies and supply chain were woefully insufficient. The states were left to source these, and fought among themselves, to acquire these materials from overseas and private sources.Five, there were mixed messages related to the pandemic. The task force held regular briefings until the country began to reopen and Trump essentially silenced it. He commandeered those briefings and used them to grandstand, argue with the press, contradict the medical experts, and even promote unproven drugs. Six, there was a push towards a rapid reopening. Trump was always opposed to sheltering in place. He started suggesting considering reopening the country shortly after people started staying at home. He also tweeted to his millions of followers to liberate states such as Virginia and Michigan where he felt the governors might resist or be too slow in reopening. Trump appeared to be driven solely by his re-election possibilities, at the cost of public health.Seven, reopening one part, based on relative success in another, ignored the nature of the disease. The original hotspots for the pandemic were primarily states and urban cities in the Northeast and Midwest and in California. By mid-May to early June, the spread was weakening in those locations and appeared to have peaked around the country. So states such as Georgia, Florida, Texas and Arizona moved ahead with relatively rapid re-opening. As a consequence, they became and are the new hot spots.Eight, the US had no uniform enforcement mechanisms. The extent to which states enforced sheltering at home, wearing of masks and social distancing varied sharply. In some states such as Georgia and Texas with Republican governors and large cities with Democratic mayors, the governors only recommended these actions to battle Covid-19, while the mayors required them by law.Nine, a misplaced prioritisation of economic concerns over health concerns. The reopenings were done almost solely to stimulate the economy which had cratered due to the pandemic. This had huge costs. Ten, and perhaps most important, there has been the consistent rejection and discounting of expert advice. From the outset, Trump minimised the advice of experts such as internationally-renowned infectious disease and task force member Dr Anthony Fauci, and constructed his own alternative version of reality.Overall and with a few exceptions in hard-hit states where individual governors demonstrated leadership, the US has managed Covid-19 reactively rather than proactively. A large part of this failure must be attributed to Trump who, after months of not wearing a mask, has only recently been seen in public wearing one, and who continues to insist that, at some point, the pandemic will just disappear.Trump is a role model of what not to do personally, politically and professionally in response to a pandemic. His coronavirus playbook is a template for current and future national leaders on how not to fight a pandemic.These are the primary lessons that India and other countries can learn from the US’ disastrous handling of this situation. India must pay heed, as cases are continuing to rise, indicating that possibly the toughest lockdown in the world did not yield the outcomes that had been anticipated. Sometime shortly, India will pass the grim milestone of one million cases to become the third nation to do so, after the US and Brazil.That is bad news for India. There is a silver lining in the cloud though. That is because of its much lower fatality rate. Moreover, according to Indian government officials, 80% of active cases are from 49 of the country’s 720 districts, which mean a vast majority of the cases are restricted to less than seven per cent of the districts. By taking a targeted approach to testing, tracking and treatment to flatten the curve in these hot spots and ensuring no spread beyond these areas, the impact of the pandemic can be minimised going forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-from-the-us-lessons-on-what-not-to-do/story-V7mtUsyNHqPoWEkDVlsO6K.html
15-07-2020||News||Neither East, Nor West, Only China | Opinion||“Neither East, nor West” was Ayatollah Khomeini’s slogan for the reconstruction of a post-revolution Iran. This no longer seems to hold in Tehran, if fresh reports of a wide-ranging strategic pact between Iran and China are any indication. Though neither side has officially confirmed details, the Iranian cabinet has signed off on an agreement that has been in the works since President Xi Jinping’s visit to Tehran in January 2016.Even if the leaked details are not yet agreed upon, they reveal a direction and scope that should cause major concern to India. Under a 25-year pact, China will invest $400 billion in Iran’s petroleum sector as well as its core infrastructure — banking, telecom, ports, airports, high-speed railways, metro and free-trade zones. Iran will become a crucial pivot of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), linking China to Europe. A military dimension envisages joint military exercises, joint training, joint research and development of weapons. China will get assured supplies of Iranian oil, gas and petroleum products at highly discounted prices.Iran moving closer to China should not come as a surprise. United States (US) President Donald Trump, on a collision course with Iran, walked out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) signed in 2015 between Iran and P5+1 (Germany) and the European Union. The plan had the potential of gradually closing Iran’s nuclear weapons window and reviving its economy through lifting sanctions and de-freezing its assets. Instead, Trump again imposed crippling sanctions and the European signatories — Germany, France and the United Kingdom (UK) — though unhappy with the US withdrawal, showed timid resolve. Iran’s economy, based on petroleum exports, has contracted severely; investments have dried up for fear of sanctions; and the pandemic has taken a heavy toll. Iran clearly needs an economic lifeline as well as international support to counter the US-Israel axis. China is willing to provide both, and in a larger strategic landscape, the two can align interests with Russia. As proof of its intent, and perhaps an indication of the coming pact, China recently opposed US efforts in the United Nations Security Council to extend an arms embargo on Iran and, on July 14, reiterated its support for JCPOA.However, this proposed long-term alignment with China has its opponents. Former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has led the criticism, and, oddly, found support from Prince Reza Pahlavi, the late Shah’s son; an example of a revolutionary mindset combining with a deep sense of Persian superiority. There are fears that Iran’s valuable natural resources will be mortgaged to an untrustworthy partner. Religious hardliners point to China’s repression of the Uighur Muslims. The Majlis — the Iranian parliament — is now dominated by conservatives; most reformist candidates were disqualified by the regime as it circled the wagons in the face of rising public discontent. These conservative members are likely to react strongly to any suggestion of ceding sovereignty to China for economic gains when the pact is put to them. The Supreme Leader, however, supports the proposed deal. This, combined with the attraction of economic prosperity, makes it difficult to say where this needle will stop. All of this, however, is only cold comfort to India. China’s increased political and economic influence on Tehran can squeeze us on several fronts. First, Tehran has watched our growing proximity to the US and Israel with a resentful sullenness. The cutting of oil imports and delays in project implementation have further shown the limits of the bilateral relationship; “civilisational links” can only take us only so far and no more. Iran’s pact with China will strengthen the perception that we are in “the other camp”. Given our energy dependence and large diaspora, great power rivalry would not be our preferred game in West Asia.Second, China’s influence will facilitate better relations between Iran and Pakistan, already evident in the conciliatory attitude shown by Pakistan to militant attacks from across the border in Balochistan. The two could also narrow their differences on Afghanistan, with a direct impact on India’s interests. Third, Chinese investment in ports and railways can hamper India’s plans to get access to Central Asia and beyond through Iran. The report that India will no longer be part of the Chabahar-Zahidan railway project foreshadows this scenario. Iran’s ambassador in Islamabad has spoken of a “golden ring” of China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey and of a western arm to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)+ that would link Gwadar and Chabahar to China by rail through Pakistan. Further, our own economic limitations and the shadow of US sanctions will make it difficult for Indian companies to compete in Iran, particularly if the hundred proposed projects are aligned to a Chinese economic paradigm. Fourth, even if the Chinese do not get a major slice of Chabahar, they are keen to participate in the development of Bandar-e-Jask, the port outside the Straits of Hormuz. Iran envisages Jask as its main oil-loading point in the near future; it can then close the Straits without harming its own exports. In a worst-case scenario, Jask could become another Chinese dual-use port and with Gwadar and Djibouti threaten India’s energy and maritime security in the Arabian Sea. All of this may not happen, but we cannot afford to wait for the Majlis to kill this deal, or for Joe Biden to become US president and wean Iran away from China. Our interests are immediate: A strong outreach to Iran with expedited work on Chabahar and its integration into the North-South Transport Corridor as well as a vigorous follow-up on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s successful 2015 Central Asian visit would be timely initiatives to consider.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/neither-east-nor-west-only-china/story-1R51QEx2HRos1s2RKNIPbM.html
15-07-2020||News||Home isolation has instilled confidence in people to face the infection | Analysis||The steep increase in the number of Covid-19 patients at the end of May led the Delhi government to tweak its strategy. It started focusing more on home isolation of the positive cases. The basic premise was that, with limited health resources and a rising number of infections, mild cases would block services for critical patients. This strategy worked well. The Delhi government identified more Covid-19 patients for home isolation, while simultaneously augmenting hospital care for serious patients. As a result, around 80% of patients opted for home isolation over quarantine facilities.The Arvind Kejriwal-led government released easy-to-understand guidelines and videos for spreading awareness. These guidelines have instructions for patients, caregivers, and community, with tips on nutrition, monitoring of health parameters, and are easily implementable at home. The details are available on its website at https://delhifightscorona.in/home-isolation/On June 19, the lieutenant governor scrapped home isolation due to the fear of people under home quarantine not following proper guidelines, and, thus, increasing the chances of turning into spreaders. It/He made institutional quarantine mandatory for the first five days. The Delhi government, along with its citizens (such as Resident Welfare Associations or RWAs), raised objections to the change, forcing the Delhi Disaster Management Authority to revert to the old arrangement. This was a great relief for Delhi.But why home isolation? With a stressed health system, it is a win-win situation, both for citizens and the government. As expected, unlock 1.0 saw a spurt in cases, but it was brought under control. The government devoted energy to make people aware of ways to learn to live with the virus. Such awareness campaigns helped reduce the stigma around the pandemic. The normalisation of Covid-19, with increasing confidence among people that patients could recover in the comfort of their homes, made it possible for the Delhi government to pursue an aggressive testing strategy.The government allows positive cases to opt for home isolation if their home has a separate airy room with a toilet. The medical team guides the family and patient on proper protocols, and monitors the health status of the patient(s) on a daily basis. Being in close proximity to the family keeps the patients psychologically upbeat, provides the necessary emotional environment for quick recovery, and allows them the choice of food of their taste and requirement. It also brings dedicated family support to fight the emotional or physical distress.The patients are advised to be careful if they feel breathlessness; have co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, kidney or liver issues; are pregnant; or are above 65 years of age and may require immediate in-person medical attention. The community plays an important role, too. RWAs support families in sanitisation, garbage collection, mitigating stigmatisation, helping during emergencies, and arranging food and medicines.Sometimes there are procedural delays in reaching out to the home isolated patients by designated health care providers. To address this, the Delhi government has empaneled non-governmental organisations and deputed doctors who volunteered to support the home isolated cases. If health care providers fail to reach patients, they can call Delhi government’s telemedicine helpline: 011-61193786.The Delhi government is reviewing its Covid-19 strategy on a regular basis. To address the most critical factor, of breathlessness, which is the major cause of mortality among Covid-19 patients, it has decided to provide pulse oxymeters to home isolated patients, on a returnable basis. This will, depending upon the patients’ condition, help the government to provide them oxygen cylinders and concentrators, or shift them to the hospital.The quarantine period has been reduced from 17 days to 10. This has further eased the conditions for home isolation, encouraging more people with mild symptoms to come forward for testing. Home isolation has instilled confidence in people to face the infection, as they are now more aware about the virus and ways to face it.Delhi is learning to live with the new norms and, a mature response from the state government has helped reduce the initial panic to a large extent.Seema Upadhyay is a programme manager at the Population Foundation of India.

15-07-2020||News||Don’t blame dense cities. They have been resilient||The Covid-19 pandemic has upended the world as we know it. In the subsequent blame game, dense cities occupy pole position. Prima facie, this looks like a fair accusation given the extent of the outbreak in Mumbai, Delhi, New York and London. However, a more granular look at the data suggests that this is not accurate. High densities and agglomeration effects, the secret sauce of successful big cities, are precisely what make them vulnerable to threats such as pandemics. Social interactions are higher in cities, and an infected person is likely to come in contact with a larger number of people, say while commuting on a train, thus hastening the spread of the disease in cities such as Mumbai and New York. But what are we to make of similarly dense cities that were able to control and contain the outbreak? Seoul, with a population density of 16,000 persons per square kilometre, had far fewer cases than New York. Taipei, whose density is comparable to New York, did not suffer from a serious outbreak. Other Asian megacities such as Hanoi, Hong Kong and Bangkok have done well too. In New York itself, Manhattan, the densest of the five boroughs has the lowest number of infections. Data suggests that in terms of share of population with Covid-19, rural counties such as Trousdale in Tennessee, with one in eight people, outstripped New York with one in 44. A World Bank study of the outbreak in China shows that population densities in cities are not correlated to the spread of the virus. Very dense cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin have remained relatively unscathed. Clearly, density is not the sole culprit, if at all. As the urbanist Richard Florida has pointed out, we must not conflate density with overcrowding. To paraphrase Robert McDonald of Nature Conservancy, there is a difference between a 500 sq ft apartment in Mumbai occupied by two people, versus the same space occupied by 10 people in a slum — the latter sets the stage for the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Needless to say, a dense urban population does not imply low per-capita square footage. The latter occurs due to bad urban policies. What else might explain the conundrum? A recent study on metropolitan counties in the United States (US) suggests that socio-economic factors and levels of education were better at explaining outcomes related to mortality and spread of infection. It also suggests that dense urban areas may, in fact, have benefited from better public awareness and consequent behavioural adaptation, such as wearing masks, due to the immediacy of the threat. Obviously, big cities, even in India, have much better health care facilities, including large public and multi-speciality hospitals, and health professionals, compared to other places because these require economies of scale to be viable.Studying policies for tackling Covid-19 adopted by different countries, regions, and cities gives us further insight into why some were extremely successful. The biggest explanatory variable, besides socio-economic factors and State capacity, appears to be previous experience (including by osmosis) with infectious disease, be it in Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, or Kerala. These places simply took the disease more seriously. The suite of measures they undertook includes aggressive testing, tracing, isolation, clear communications, hand hygiene and extensive mask-wearing. Once these measures were in place, even super-dense slum clusters such as Dharavi in Mumbai, where over 800,000 people live in an area of 2.4 square kilometres, have turned the corner. At the time of writing, there are visible signs of the curve being flattened. Every crisis is an opportunity to rebuild better. Instead of calls for de-urbanisation, building resilient cities is the need of the hour. The more immediate policy responses that will earn large dividends in India include: One, addressing crowding by increasing per-capita consumption of floor area by drastically reducing regulatory barriers to construction. Two, administratively, the crisis has taught us that a pandemic response cannot be federally-mandated and requires a decentralised, proximal, and accountable response. To enable this, city leaders need to be empowered. Three, social protection systems need to be redesigned to protect the poor and vulnerable in urban areas, in addition to the current focus on rural settlements. Four, countries such as India with large out-of-pocket expenditures on private health care must restore the balance between health care and robust public health that focuses on improving health outcomes for all — only a capable State can deliver the latter. Covid-19 is neither the first nor the last public health crisis to hit cities. Everything from the Black Death to the bubonic plague to the Spanish flu, not to mention world wars and terror attacks, have ravaged cities in the past. Each time, people worried that it was the end of big cities, only to watch them re-emerge stronger and more vibrant. This time will be no different. The demise of dense cities is greatly exaggerated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/don-t-blame-dense-cities-they-have-been-resilient/story-4HJrLnUyT0N3UdzI6y4mWI.html

Police suspect that someone known to the woman could be behind her murder.According to the police, the woman, currently posted at Tihar jail as a daily diary entry operator, was found dead in the afternoon, when the wife of her landlord saw the door latched from outside and opened it to check on the woman.“The woman, a 2018 batch constable, was posted with the 3rd battalion of Delhi Armed Police and was deployed at Tihar jail from 1 pm to 7 pm shift. When her landlady saw the door of her house latched from outside she tried to open it to check on the constable. When she opened the door, she found her lying in the bed unconscious. She alerted her husband and they called the police. She was taken to a hospital where the doctors pronounced her dead,” said a police officer who wished not to be named. Her body was sent for an autopsy. “During the initial probe, it was found that the woman belongs to Rewari, Haryana. She had rented the house in Palam a week ago. The landlord told police that she was accompanied by a man. During the investigation, we checked CCTV footage and spotted a man leaving her house early morning on Wednesday. He could be prime suspect and efforts to identify him are underway,” the officer said.Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Devender Arya said preliminary medical examination suggests the woman was strangled to death. “There were no external fatal injuries. She was also properly clothed. Autopsy results are awaited and a case of murder has been registered,” Arya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-constable-found-dead-in-palam-vihar/story-HkaHI1obrXXjt3y2yCvxrM.html

15-07-2020||Dehradun||In eastern and western Himalayas, conflict between leopards, humans to increase as habitats overlap: Research||With man-leopard conflict on the rise, a recent study by Dehradun based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in eastern and the western Himalayas shows that leopard conflict will only increase in the future as leopard and human habitats are increasingly overlapping.The research paper titled “Landscape predictors of human–leopard conflicts within multi-use areas of the Himalayan region” was published by scientists from WII. In the paper, the researchers tried to identify the landscape features which increased the probability of man-leopard conflict in the context of the attack on cattle (livestock depredation) by leopards near human habitations. The results from the study were used to map potential human–leopard conflict hotspots across parts of the Indian Himalayan region.The study states, that with rapid loss of forest cover and anthropogenic (due to humans) impacts on their habitats, large carnivores are forced to occupy multiuse landscapes outside protected areas.As part of the project, the researchers studied 857 attacks on livestock in eastern Himalaya (parts of North Bengal) and 375 attacks in western Himalaya (Pauri Garhwal district in Uttarakhand) by leopards between 2015 and 2018.The experts found that the risk of a leopard killing livestock increased within a heterogeneous landscape matrix comprising of both closed and open habitats (very dense forests, moderate dense forests, open forests, scrubland and non-forests).S Sathyakumar, senior scientist at WII said that landscape is very important when trying to understand the human-leopard conflict in the Himalayas.“If you have a good forest, but several small patches of degraded forests, along with villages, then the matrix of the neighbouring forests do not have wild prey which a leopard can hunt and kill. Our studies have shown that forests outside protected areas whether big or small, do not support large densities of wild prey which can support leopards in turn inside the forests. Hence, leopards are surviving outside protected areas and in human habitations as there are many supervised cattle, then dogs, or small animals like chicken, rodent, deer which the animal can eat,” said Sathyakumar.He added that unlike tigers, which need very good forest cover without any human disturbance, “leopards are not like that and can survive anywhere even with small patches of degraded forest cover, as long as there is enough cover to hide.”“In the western Himalayas, be it Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh, farmlands which have been abandoned due to migration have become secondary scrubs or secondary forests, and act as a refuge for leopards. We piloted fox lights as part of the study, where we demonstrated that these kinds of new technologies can be used to reduce problem due to leopard in the areas of North Bengal and Pauri Garhwal, which are hotspots of human-leopard conflict in the Indian Himalayan region,” added Sathyakumar.He said that these two areas were chosen as they have reported the maximum number of conflict cases, be it injury, attack, death as well as livestock killing in the past decade.Speaking on findings of the research, Dipanjan Naha, the primary researcher in this project and first author of the paper, said that the common perception is that leopards attack livestock during night hours, but there is a pattern in the attacks.“Bigger carnivores like lions or tigers mostly attack livestock near protected sites, but for leopards, it has been learnt that it can attack in any place where there is sufficient cover for the animal to hide, be it in tea gardens of North Bengal or abandoned land in Pauri Garhwal due to migration. The animal is not coming out of its habitat, but rather the habitat of humans and leopards are overlapping. Leopards have successfully adapted to human habitations also which can lead to more attacks in the future,” said Naha.The research paper mentions that results suggest that awareness about high-risk areas, supervised grazing and removing vegetation cover around human settlements should be initiated to reduce predation by leopards.What has led to the fragmentation of forests?According to WII experts, the increasing human population, declines in wild prey and changes in land-use patterns have resulted in fragmented, heterogeneous resource-limited landscapes for carnivores. Such anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems have forced carnivores to frequent areas near human settlements, kill livestock. This, in turn, provokes local communities to retaliate through poisoning, shooting, snaring and electrocution. Livestock depredation has been identified as the stimuli for human-carnivore conflicts. Retaliation also affects the overall functioning of the ecosystem by removal of non-target species like avian predators, scavengers and larger predators within the shared landscapes, who feed on the poisoned carcasses.Importance of conservation within shared landscapesThe research stressed that conservation within shared landscapes is challenging considering the socio-cultural, political problems where it is crucial to ensure the safety of human lives, property, livelihoods and well-being. In India, human-leopard interactions are especially intense within such shared landscapes where the size of protected areas is small, fragmented and comprise only 5% of the geographic extent of the country. Livestock and free-ranging domestic dogs comprise the primary prey for leopards outside of protected areas where crop fields, tea plantations provide cover.Livestock are a direct representation for the agriculture-based society of rural India and loss to large carnivores represents a substantial threat to human welfare and livelihoods. Hence it is crucial to identify areas where leopards are more likely to attack livestock to plan management interventions and implement mitigation measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/in-eastern-and-western-himalayas-conflict-between-leopards-humans-to-increase-as-habitats-overlap-research/story-VFfrSYp5vNld3CBfrXHZmM.html

Till that time, the police had not been informed about Kumar’s disappearance either by his family members or neighbours, many of who had allegedly witnessed the assault on July 8, senior police officers associated with the case said.On Tuesday, the police arrested Kumar’s wife Vimla Devi, son Yogesh Kumar, and son-in-law Lalit for allegedly killing him and destroying the evidence of the crime by throwing the body in the canal. The body, however, has yet not been recovered from the canal.“Our teams have been searching the body in the canal with the help of divers. Kumar’s wife, son and son-in-law have been arrested and booked for murder, destruction of evidence and common intention under Sections 302, 201 and 34 of Indian Penal Code. They have confessed to their crime,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Gaurav Sharma.DCP Sharma said that Kumar’s brother, Shankar Das, in his complaint on July 11, had alleged that his brother’s family members used to ill-treat him and did not give him food because he had been refusing transfer of the house’s ownership to his son Yogesh. Kumar used to work as a barber at a local salon, owned by one Ranvir.“...I used to talk to my brother on Ranvir’s phone and he used to tell me about the torture he faced from his family members. He often feared his family members would kill him someday...,” Das said in his complaint, which was converted into the first information report (FIR).In the complaint, Das said Kumar’s neighbour informed his son (Das’) Prashant that his uncle was assaulted outside the house by his family members until he became unconscious on July 8 afternoon. They dragged him inside in unconscious state and thereafter he was not seen by anyone. Das tried to speak with Yogesh and Lalit but they did not answer his calls. He then filed the missing complaint.Senior police officers said that they checked the CCTV footage of Kumar’s neighbourhood and found that his family members were dragging a jutebag outside the house on the night of July 8. In another camera, two persons were seen carrying the sack on a motorcycle while a third person on another bike was following them, they said.“We interrogated the three suspects and confronted with the video footage. They broke down and confessed to the crime,” DCP Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-murdered-by-wife-son-son-in-law-over-property-transfer/story-bYjF25xZhcFAus2YES5iZO.html
15-07-2020||Delhi||Weddings amid Covid-19 pandemic a risky affair?||Almost every other day there’s some wedding happening, and quite often there are news reports of guests having turned corona positive after being part of a marriage party. Recent news reports include the one where a boy, who was the groom, died after his wedding that left around 100 guests Covid-19 positive in Bihar. In Rajasthan’s Bhilwara, 250 guests attended a wedding and the groom’s grandfather died due to the virus. The reasons to have a wedding in corona times are aplenty, but the question that such incidents raise is: Is it safe to get married during the pandemic? The issue is pertinent and debatable, and photographers and guests who have attended weddings amid the ongoing pandemic reveal that though there’s a cap of 50 guests on weddings, by the government, not all are following the guidelines. Anand Kumar, a Bengaluru-based wedding photographer says, “I’ve been getting a lot of queries about how much will I charge for a wedding, how many team members will attend the wedding and many others. But the thing that disappoints me is the casualness about the gathering that’s invited to attend a wedding. There are a few who have had intimate weddings, but otherwise most have at least 100-150 guests, even after all the government guidelines. Some of these weddings that I covered as a photographer, no one was wearing a mask or following social distancing! People become casual once they get into party mode, and there’s no one to keep a check on them. In fact, I said no to a lot of my clients because they had huge guest lists... I even tried my best to explain them about the repercussions of their actions, but you know how touchy the subject of wedding is in our country.”Some photographers say they are given a non accurate count of guests at the time of booking, so that they can’t back out later or complaint against flouting of rules, which are set to battle the pandemic. “I was told that around 50 people would be at this wedding that was to happen in Delhi. But, it turned out that more than 120 guests were there and some had specially travelled from Mumbai to attend,” says a photographer on condition of anonymity. He adds that he had no idea about what was in store until he reached the wedding venue. The lensman adds, “When I got to know the actual situation, I felt so scared... No one was wearing a mask and everyone seemed to have forgotten about social distancing; it was all about enjoying food and dance. I feel there should be a body constituted to keep a check on the number of guests at weddings happening now.” “It’s important at times to attend the wedding... achcha nahi lagta agar card aane ke baad na jao, sab baatein banate hain phir,” says Mamta Goel, a Gurugram resident who recently attended her close friend’s wedding among a hundred odd guests from different parts of the country. Goel adds, “In these times if you get invited, it feels special. So I went happily, and followed all precautions. Even the wedding venue was well sanitised. But jab ready hoke gaye aur wapas aye, to padosiyon ko mithai dene to jana hi pada... the moment my neighbours got to know that we have attended a wedding, they stopped talking to us. And they informed everyone in my residential society about it, and then no one came to my house, not even the milkman. I had no option left but to isolate myself for a few days so that I could prove that I didn’t get corona from the wedding!” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/weddings-amid-covid-19-pandemic-a-risky-affair/story-5hshSCD3m2iwdpZJPjkUHK.html

They are owned by Era Infra Engineering Limited,” the agency said in a statement.ED had initiated a probe under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against the company and its Chairman and Managing Director Hem Singh Bharana, unknown bank officials, some private persons and others on the basis of a CBI case of April, 2018.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case against Era Infra pertains to criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and use of forged documents and criminal misconduct by Bharana and other accused persons in sanction, disbursement and utilisation of two term loans amounting to Rs 650 crores.“Investigations conducted by ED have revealed that the funds were disbursed and utilised in a manner defying the sanctioned purpose. Out of Rs 450 crore disbursed by UCO Bank, amount of Rs 211 crores and Rs 25 crore (respectively) were utilised for purposes beyond the purview of the sanctioned terms,” ED said in its statement.“Amount diverted by EIEL comes to Rs 236 crore out of the term loan of Rs 450 crore. Further an amount of Rs 14.70 crore was diverted from the other sanctioned amount of Rs 200 crore and thus the total amount diverted by EIEL in this manner comes to Rs 250.70 crore which qualifies as ‘Proceeds of Crime’ under PMLA,” ED added.The agency added that out of total proceeds of crime of Rs 250.70 crore, assets valued at Rs 5.72 crore were provisionally attached earlier.After Wednesday’s attachment of Rs 33.71 crore of two machines, total attachment of assets is worth Rs 39.43 crores, it said.“Further investigations to trace and identify the proceeds of crime and assets are under progress” ED said.Calls made to Era Infra office remained unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ed-attaches-two-tunnel-boring-machines-in-money-laundering-cases-against-infra-firm/story-nQcLddowOsVOlYV5X9lJwK.html

15-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Residents join hands to protect green cover near Mattewara forest||The campaign to protect surroundings of the Mattewara forest is gaining momentum. City-based industrialist and social activist Ranjodh Singh has demanded intervention of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to stop setting up of industrial park at Mattewara.Singh, who is also chairing the Ramgarhia Educational Council, said Mattewara forest reserves are near the banks of Sutlej and are home to a variety of flora and fauna.“Being close to river, it is a natural habitat for these animals, and the green cover provides plenty of oxygen to the otherwise polluted side of Ludhiana, which has many hosiery and dyeing units,” said Ranjogh.“Now, the Punjab government has decided to set up an industrial park nearby, which will ruin the ecological balance of the area. And pollution levels will increase in Sutlej. Many trees will be uprooted and land grabbers will destroy the nature,” he added.He has requested the NGT to depute a team to reverse the government decision and take steps to preserve nature.Besides, an environmentalist Ravneet Singh, one of the founders of an NGO Eco-Sikh, which is working to protest the green cover, visited the area.While sharing a video of the forest and the land that is supposed to be taken over for setting up an industrial park, Ravneet said that it will destroy the flora and fauna of the area.Juzar Singh, president of student organisation Sath, said the decision to convert Mattewara forest into an industrial park is misleading. “The land on which government is going to build the industrial park is an agricultural land adjacent to the Mattewara forest which is instrumental in maintaining natural environment of the forest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-residents-join-hands-to-protect-green-cover-near-mattewara-forest/story-s3q0WLMQWK35fjkqAQVJNN.html
15-07-2020||Delhi||Beaten projections but can’t be complacent: Delhi CM on Covid-19 situation||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said Delhi now is in a “much better” Covid-19 situation than what was projected in June, but cautioned that there is no room for complacency.“Based on the formula given by the Central government, in early June we had projected that by July 15, which is today, the total Covid-19 cases in Delhi would touch 225,000. But, today we actually have only half of the projected cases. There are 115,000 cases. It was expected that there would be 134,000 active cases by July 15, but till date, there are only 18,600 active cases in the city. Accordingly, it was projected that 34,000 beds would be needed by now, but currently, only around 4,000 beds are occupied,” Kejriwal said addressing a digital press conference.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Kejriwal said the “Delhi model”, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked other states to follow, has helped reduce both cases and deaths. The chief minister added that the favourable results in Covid-19 management in the Capital would not have been possible without the help of the Centre, the hotels, NGOs, religious institutions and other stakeholders.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 1,647 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the tally in the city to 116,993, while the death toll from the disease mounted to 3,487.Kejriwal reiterated that Delhi now has sufficient beds. There are more than 15,000 beds in Covid-19 care facilities. “On June 1, we had only 300 ICU beds, but today, we have 2,100 ICU beds out of which 1,000 have so far been occupied. We are in a better situation today, as compared to June, but it does not mean we have won the war (against Covid-19). We have yet to go a long way. There may be a spike again in Covid-19 cases. We don’t have to be complacent. We will not sit idle. We will have to be fully prepared,” he said.The chief minister said the Delhi government worked on three principles after realising that the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic cannot be won alone.Explaining the Delhi model, he said the biggest strength in the city’s efforts against Covdi-19 has been “collectivity” or “teamwork”.“If the Delhi government had thought it would win the fight against coronavirus alone, we would have failed. Our first principle was that this fight cannot be won alone.“Our second principle was that we did not criticise our critics for their views about our work. We improved things after somebody flagged it. The third principle was that we did not accept defeat. Had we accepted defeat, there would have been a surge in the numbers of deaths,” he said.Also read: 99 doctors have died fighting Covid 19, IMA sounds ‘Red Alert’According to Kejriwal, the government scaled up testing for Covid-19 aggressively and daily 20,000 to 23,000 tests are being conducted in Delhi. “The Covid-19 situation is under control, but we will continue our preparations against the virus,” he said.Lauding his government’s home-isolation policy, he said people are coming forward in large numbers to undergo tests because they are no longer scared that they will have to go a Covid centre.“Ambulances were also increased. Now no call for an ambulance is being declined. Earlier a patient had to wait for 2-3 hours in the ambulance to finish the formalities in the hospital. To solve this, we created a holding area in every hospital where the patient can be given oxygen, while the formalities of hospital admission are completed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/situation-in-delhi-better-but-war-on-covid-far-from-over-kejriwal/story-PAYACkzZjenXlYWKaxqcIL.html
15-07-2020||City||CBSE Class 10 result: 5 students score above 98% in Ambala district||Five students in the district have scored more than 98% marks in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 results announced on Wednesday. These include four girls and one boy. Muskan of Tulsi Public Senior Secondary School, Ambala City, scored 98.8% (best of five including IT); Kripi Singla of Police DAV Public School, Ambala City, got 98.6%; while three students — Sanchit of PKR Vatika Public School, Ambala City; Rakhee Kumari of Army Public School, Ambala Cantonment, and Anushka of S D Vidya Public School, Ambala Cantonment — secured 98.2%.However, there was some confusion about the district topper as the student added a vocational/skill-based subject (IT), instead of main subject (Science) in best of five.With an aim to become a doctor, Muskan (16) has opted for the medical stream in secondary education. “I studied for five to six hours and made to sure to take time out to play badminton and listening to music. I never let my self-study consistency break. I didn’t take coaching,” she said while discussing her preparation strategy.Her school principle Kirti said Muskan is a state-level of badminton player and explained why the school added IT as a main subject. “She has been an all-rounder in studies and extracurricular activities. She was in the non-vocational stream under which the skill-based subject (IT) was added in her best of five,” she said.Kripi Singla from Police DAV Public School, whose parents live in Noida and she stays with her grandparents in Ambala, aspires to become an engineer. “I love to read books and facts about the human mind. My grandmother, who is also a retired schoolteacher, helped me a lot in achieving this endeavour,” she said.Her principle Dr Vikas Kohli said Kripi has performed outstandingly and teachers have done a great job.About the vocational subject confusion, a senior education officer requesting anonymity said, “I believe vocational IT cannot be added as a main subject, but this is up to the CBSE to decide. Some private schools do so just to make tall claims and fetch more admissions.”Last year, Divjot Kaur Jaggi (16) of Convent of Jesus and Marry school in Ambala Cantonment emerged as the All India National topper securing 499 marks out of 500 in May last year. A total of 13 students had scored 499 marks in the results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cbse-class-10-result-5-students-score-above-98-in-ambala-district/story-LW6pZOeoKmALjDtvAXPbWP.html

The cases may or may not be epidemiologically linked. For operational purposes, an LOR is deemed to be present when there are 15 or more cases, while a containment zone is an area where at least five Covid-19 cases are reported.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “More than 14 testing camps will be organised in LOR areas where samples will be collected for antigen tests and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests.

Covid-19 cases have gradually emerged in the area. By Wednesday, there were a total of 7,208 Covid-19 cases in the city, of which 1,021 were active cases, with 110 deaths so far. In the past 24 hours, there were 82 fresh Covid cases and one death in the district, as per the government’s bulletin.The police, meanwhile, said it will further boost personnel deployment and ensure strict enforcement of measures in LORs.“The new strategy can help prevent transmission of the coronavirus disease to other parts of the city,” said police commissioner KK Rao. Around 400 home guards and special police officers (SPOs) have been deployed in these areas along with 35 police personnel at each area, the police said.The police have barricaded the entry and exit in these areas, ensuring restrictions on the movement of vehicles and allowing only emergency vehicles, ambulances and those carrying essential goods. “As per norms, we are only allowing people to pass through if they have a medical emergency or need to purchase essential supplies. Essentials, too, are available in the area itself, and no one is required to move out of the area to buy essentials. There are exceptions for health workers and waste collection staff. We have also strictly prohibited trespassing,” said Rao.“Our prime focus is on the movement of people without inconveniencing them and promoting voluntary enforcement by locals rather than penal action. The police teams have been directed to create awareness among the public about wearing masks and ensuring social distancing. People have to act as responsible citizens and ensure safety of self and others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-nine-new-large-covid-19-outbreak-areas-identified-put-under-13-day-lockdown/story-BzlGLBaRrQSNQxGbRFcg3N.html

While no city-wise topper was declared by the board owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, students in multiple Gurugram schools scored above 90%, with many obtaining a perfect score in multiple subjects.In Haryana, a total of 1,31,741 students appeared for the examination — 78,927 boys and 52,814 girls. Out of these, 1,23,850 students cleared the examination. The number included 72,877 boys and 50,973 girls. The pass percentage for the state stood at 94.01%, with girls outperforming boys.

The civic body has shared email ids of officials including additional commissioners, zonal commissioner and secretaries where residents can address complaints, memorandums and applications. They can also submit applications at suvidha kendras where staff has been deputed to maintain social distancing. A complaint box has been kept outside MC’s zonal offices and entry is allowed only in case of emergency after thermal screening.The civic body has also shared landline numbers (0161-4085013 and 0161-4085038) in case residents can’t file online complaint. The complaints can also be submitted through the MC’s official website, mcludhiana.gov.in, and CRAMAT application.

15-07-2020||City||By streamlining systems, Ghaziabad brings down fatality rate||From an all time high of about 3.4% last month, Ghaziabad has managed to pull down the fatality rate in the district to 1.79% by July 14. Experts said that although the decline is commendable, at least a month’s data is needed before any conclusion could be drawn. According to the latest state health bulletin released on July 15, Ghaziabad had 3,600 cases and 62 deaths. The bulletin adds that there were 1407 active cases in the district.District officials said that entry of private hospitals roped in for paid Covid-19 treatment and streamlining of systems have helped bringing down the fatality rate.Till May 31, the district had only four deaths from the disease and 305 cases (a fatality rate of 1.31%). By the end of the next month, however, this was up to 3.4% with 55 deaths and 1,615 cases.In July, cases increased sharply, averaging at a rate of about 131 cases per day, but saw fewer deaths -- 11.“There have been several procedural changes which have reduced the fatality rate even though our fresh cases per day are on all time high. We have now about eight private hospitals which have overall 544 beds available for paid treatment in the district. Now, with these hospitals having better specialists and infrastructure have aided recovery process of patients requiring L-2 and L-3 category care,” said Dr. NK Gupta, district chief medical officer.Under the UP government’s three-tier Covid treatment facilities, L-1 category hospitals are meant for asymptomatic positive patients, L-2 are meant for patients having moderate complications and L-3 are for critical care.The district has acquired 13 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in private hospitals and reserved them for patients lodged in government facilities.“These beds were reserved for immediate referral of serious patients who were lodged in government hospitals. We have sent eight patients from our hospitals to these ICU beds for better treatment in last 10 days and all of them have recovered. Overall, 304 patients are presently admitted to various private hospitals while 711 are admitted to government or government acquired hospitals. Other patients from Ghaziabad are taking up treatment in outside districts,” Dr. Gupta added.He said that the police helped them identify about 30 patients who were at home isolation without informing the authorities. Unlike in Delhi, home isolation of asymptomatic positive patients is not allowed in Uttar Pradesh. They have been admitted to hospitals, said Dr. Gupta.But, 28 others had gone to other districts.“Their information has been sent to the districts where they are staying,” Dr Gupta added.The health team that referred patients to their respective hospitals too have been given an updated checklist to help them determine which type of hospital suited best for the patient. Earlier, this team, which was mandated to contact positive patients and refer them to the hospital, would at times send patients off to hospitals that probably was not suited for them -- such as referring a critical care patient to a hospital that served moderate cases. That process generally took anything between 24-48 precious hours.“With the earlier system, gauging requirement of appropriate hospital was a bit tricky. With the checklist in place, identification and referral to an appropriate hospital has become lot easier. We now also immediately convey the information to ambulance system and the local police who physically visit patient’s address. So, this helps in early picking up of patient and also confirms his physical location. In case the patient goes missing or address found incorrect, help of police surveillance system is taken to trace the patient,” Dr Gupta added.The district has now formulated three pronged strategy for tracing contacts of the patient.The district now has local police (from the respective police station) who goes physically for contact tracing, a control room headed by additional district magistrate and another team from health department’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) laboratory who takes up contact tracing over the phone.“Since we attended different meetings taken up by UP government nodal officers, there has been improvement in systems with focus on early detection and faster referral to appropriate hospitals. But for ascertaining that fatality rate is on decline, we need at least one month assessment before we can say that it has stabilized or reduced,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/by-streamlining-systems-ghaziabad-brings-down-fatality-rate/story-w7tTHYclZ9uKzJOIv1cu4H.html
15-07-2020||Lucknow||Monsoon session of UP legislature: Presenting supplementary budget may be a challenge||Any state government move to present the first supplementary budget for 2020-2021 in the forthcoming session of the state legislature may pose a major challenge to authorities, amid paucity of funds following decline in tax revenue in the fight against Covid-19.Under any other circumstances, the state government might have considered presenting a large supplementary budget, making large and token allocations to fund development projects and some populist announcements, as the state is likely to go for assembly elections early in 2022.“We will be able to come out with a supplementary budget only if the state government is in a position to do so. The state government is yet to take a call on the issue. A decision to present supplementary budget, if needed, will be taken only once a notification about convening the monsoon session is issued,” said a senior state government officer on condition of anonymity.A formal notification for convening the session is yet to be issued but the state cabinet appears to have decided to convene the monsoon session from August 20. Though a need to present the first supplementary demands of grant for 2020-2021 may be felt, the paucity of funds may not allow the state government the luxury of presenting the first supplementary budget as it has been doing over the years.“So far we have no indications about presenting first supplementary demands of grant for 2020-2021. If necessary, the size of supplementary budget will be much lower than the previous years,” said another senior officer.Minister for finance Suresh Khanna was not available for comments. Others in the state government agreed the presentation of first supplementary budget, if necessary, may pose a big challenge to the state government that is already facing fund crunch following decline in collections due to fight against Covid-19. The state government may have to make necessary allocations to fund the chief minister’s announcements and important administrative decisions, like his move to set up a judicial commission to probe issues about killing of eight policemen in Kanpur by Vikas Dubey and subsequent killing of the dreaded criminal by the police in an encounter later.It may be mentioned that the state government’s major revenue earning departments have failed to meet tax collection targets in the first quarter of 2020-2021. A close scrutiny of the state government’s tax receipts in the first three months indicates that the major departments collected only 37.77 per cent of targeted tax revenue from April 1 to June 30. The state government’s total tax revenue collection in first quarter (April 1 to June 30, 2020) was Rs 15716.48 against targeted tax revenue of Rs 41,602.68 crore. On non-tax revenue front too, the collections were only 37.49 per cent of targets. The state government hopes of improvement in the situation as the collections showed an improvement in June 2020 and earning were about 61 per cent of targets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/monsoon-session-of-up-legislature-presenting-supplementary-budget-may-be-a-challenge/story-XQSUDiRTPI1jnWFoTVbKEI.html

HSVP officials said they managed to sell five commercial properties located in sectors 39 and 46 over and above the base price fixed by the authority as the auctions elicited a strong response from bidders.The authority had put on sale 13 commercial properties that included five four-story shops in Sector 46 and eight booths in Sector 39. The maximum response received from the bidders was for the large double-story shops and HSVP received six bids for booths and 45 bids for large shops, said officials.Vivek Kalia, estate officer II, HSVP, Gurugram said the authority managed to auction three double-story shops and two booth sites for an amount of ₹14 crore. “The response of the buyers was very positive and this gives us hope that in future too our properties will continue to command a premium among buyers,” said Kalia, adding that the properties that were sold are in prime locations and the markets have very good business prospects.Officials said that it was due to this reason that shops in Sector 46 were sold at double the minimum price listed by the authority, at ₹2.04 crore. The booths in Sector 39 were also sold at a premium of around ₹8 lakh, they added.Officials added that the commercial units, which went under the hammer in Sector 46, were sold almost after 15 years, which also was the reason for the enthusiasm shown by buyers. They further said that the premium location of the properties was the reason that slowdown did not impact price or demand.The last auction conducted by the HSVP of commercial properties was in December 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-despite-slowdown-hsvp-manages-to-sell-properties-at-a-premium/story-DeW03Z2XbH07iD48fMfnjP.html

15-07-2020||City||IB introduces new process to review results||Gurugram: The International Baccalaureate (IB) has introduced a new process to review extraordinary cases of students seeking revaluation of their final scores. It has identified three priority areas— candidate-level discrepancy, subject-level discrepancy and whole cohort discrepancy — for the review.The decision comes in the wake of students and parents across the world expressing displeasure at the IB final diploma results declared on July 6. A diploma examination is the international equivalent to an Indian Class 12 board examination, although the scores of IB are widely accepted across all major universities in the world.IB had called off the diploma examinations scheduled between April 30 and May 22 in view of the coronavirus pandemic. In the absence of exams, the final grades were based on the student’s coursework throughout the two-year programmes, teacher-delivered predicted grades provided by schools, and historic school assessment data, the IB said. Many students had said there was a significant gap between their predicted and final scores. With a drop in scores, the admission prospects of students who do not have an unconditional offer from universities abroad will be likely impacted.In a statement shared with HT on Wednesday, IB has said that it will prioritise cases that are linked to progression to university admissions and asked students to work directly with their school coordinators to address their concerns on the decided parameters.“The IB has introduced a new process to review extraordinary cases. We will prioritise cases that are linked to progression to support with university admissions and dates of admissions. The IB is committed to a rigorous review of all these cases but cannot guarantee higher grades as a result of the review; results that are deemed reasonable will not go down as a result of this process,” the statement mentioned.Sudha Goyal, principal of Scottish High International School, said the school was opting for the Enquiry Upon Results (EUR) service. “EUR is essentially a review of the results. Since the option is available, we are going for it. The IB sets a uniform fee for EUR service and students can opt for the option convenient for them,” Goyal said. She said while EUR is available every year, the process was modified this year since many students wanted to opt for it.Mihir Sardana, an IB student from the city who plans to study abroad, said while he was thinking about opting for a revaluation, the process was expensive. Sardana said it would cost roughly Rs11,000 if he opted for a review.“We are discussing the review process with the school but it is very expensive. We already paid for the examination and going for the review would mean an additional payment all over again,” Sardana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ib-introduces-new-process-to-review-results/story-1JjgOYctAXq9nnGI4FGiOM.html

The deployment of PCRs and riders have been planned and the rosters have been prepared for all the duties,” said Rao.Rao said the police will use 30 PCR vehicles, 30 individual riders, 30 towing vehicles and 10 earth-moving machines during the monsoon. “We have looked at the each of the spots individually to determine exactly what is needed to deal with the traffic situation. In some areas, higher number of personnel are needed to be deployed due to the presence of a high volume of traffic. We will monitor the situation and based on the severity of waterlogging force will be deployed,” he said.Police said this year the volume of traffic will be less as compared to other years as the offices are yet not open and those who are operational are not working with full strength but with 50%.The police have prepared a monsoon deployment chart with the names of all police personnel deputed at each area, their timings, and the distribution of machinery.

The work to start the sewer line was started in February but it got delayed due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and the subsequent lockdown to curb its spread. Officials said the pandemic situation also affected work on the underpass structure.“The work of shifting the sewer line is in its last leg. We will finish this job in a week’s time to expedite work on the underpass project. We aim to finish the underpass by March 2021,” said Mukesh Vaish, project engineer of the Noida authority. After the sewer line is laid, in a week’s time, traffic disruption will ease to some extent in the area, he said.The underpass is being built on the Master Plan-III road stretch. The authority has shifted this major sewer line a little towards Sector 51 (Hoshiyarpur) and Sector 52. Officials said work has been expedited so as to keep it ready to handle the traffic problems caused by rains.Once the underpass is ready, commuters travelling from Noida’s City Centre to Greater Noida west can enjoy a seamless ride by taking the underpass. Commuters travelling from Sector 62 towards Dadri Road will pass a signal-free stretch above the underpass.The 750 meter-long, six-lane underpass will benefit the newly built group housing societies in sectors 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79 as well as Greater Noida West, popularly known as Noida Extension.The project’s earlier deadline was December, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-sewer-line-shifted-to-construct-sector-71-underpass/story-fStoE5jnFVBKTV7lOg7wIM.html
15-07-2020||Delhi||SDMC to form committee to inspect if drains have been cleaned||To ensure that there is no waterlogging during the monsoon and to check if drains are properly cleaned, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will form a committee to conduct site inspections and hold officials accountable for delayed works and irregularities.SDMC officials said the committee members will visit areas where engineers claim 100% desilting of drains has been done and check the veracity of the claim. The officials said these inspections are likely to start from Thursday or Friday. Anamika Mithilesh, mayor, SDMC, said a meeting in connection with the setting up of the committee to inspect drains and also to coordinate with other agencies was held on Wednesday. She said the committee will have at least 12 members from various departments. “The committee will also have representatives from other road owning agencies such as the public works department (PWD) and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), irrigation and flood control and also from the other two municipalities to ensure better interdepartmental coordination. It will help in effectively tackling waterlogging this monsoon. The committee members will also conduct inspections to check if drains are desilted properly and to see if silt removed from drains is left on the roadside. Officials who have been lax in their duties will be held accountable,” Mithilesh said.The SDMC has claimed that it has completed over 95% of the desilting work by the end of June. However, some large drains such as the Kushak drain and Andrews Ganj drain in south Delhi are yet to be desilted completely. Another senior SDMC official, on condition of anonymity, said there were instances wherein officials concerned had claimed that drains in their area were 100% cleaned even when they weren’t. “Other than the committee, the mayor and the commissioner will also conduct surprise inspections. These moves will bring about transparency,” the official said.The civic body has also identified 45 sensitive areas that are prone to waterlogging. Mithilesh said some of these sensitive locations are ITO crossing and the surrounding area, area beneath Chirag Dilli flyover, Okhla underpass, RTR Marg, Aurbindo Marg, and Mehrauli-Badarpur road. “Waterlogging prone areas belong to different agencies such as PWD, SDMC, DDA, New Delhi Municipal Council and others. We will install boards near these points with the name of the agency concerned and the contact details of officials for quick redressal of waterlogging related issues,” Mithilesh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sdmc-to-form-committee-to-inspect-if-drains-have-been-cleaned/story-BTdyxWS6Hota45gNhMRfSI.html
15-07-2020||Delhi||Tattoo artist, 3 others held for shooting brother-in-law to frighten ex-wife into giving up child||A 32-year-old tattoo artist and his three associates have been arrested for hatching a conspiracy and attempting to kill his brother-in-law with intent to intimidate his former wife and retain the custody of their child, the police said on Wednesday.The tattoo artist, Vishal Sharma, allegedly hired the other three arrested persons – Ramdev,25, Akshay Chauhan,25, and Guddu Kumar,23 – to kill his former wife Saloni, as she wanted the custody of their daughter who had been with him since their divorce in September 2019. But when Sharma failed to ascertain his wife’s whereabouts and was not getting the opportunity to kill her, he allegedly asked the hitmen to shoot and injure his brother-in-law, so as to terrify his wife, said deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia.DCP Bhatia said Sharma came in Ramdev’s contact through a jailed criminal, Chhenu, and convinced him to kill his wife. Ramdev included Akshay and Guddu in the conspiracy. “Sharma used to contact the hired killers on WhatsApp using an international SIM card, which we have recovered from his possession. He had paid them money to buy a KTM bike to be used in the crime and arrange the arms and ammunition needed,” Bhatia said.On July 10, Saloni’s brother, Lakshya Nagpal,40, was on his way home to East Patel Nagar when two men on a KTM bike came from behind and shot him in his right thigh. A case of attempt to murder was registered and the injured man suspected the involvement of his sister’s former husband, who had recently threatened to kill him.“Our prime suspect, Sharma, was on the run and was using his mother’s ATM card, which showed frequent transactions in Delhi and Haryana before and after the shooting. It was also learnt that Sharma was with Ramdev and Akshay at a guest house in Paharganj on July 2,” the DCP said.The guest house’s CCTV footage was checked and the shoes Ramdev was wearing matched with those worn by the pillion rider who had shot and injured Nagpal.

He said that the name of the witness is not disclosed because he has to be protected.The judge, after reading the statement, said, “The court has seen the statement of the witness and it does point to the active role and conspiracy of the accused in causing the riots.”The court said that even though nothing has been mentioned about both the accused in the charge sheet filed by the police in the case so far, the investigating agency has mentioned that investigation is pending. Advocate Adit S Pujari, counsel for the accused, argued that investigation was complete.Kalita and Narwal, lodged in Tihar jail under judicial custody, were arrested by Delhi Police in connection with a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in northeast Delhi’s Jafrabad area in February. They have been separately arrested in other cases related to the riots.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and more than 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-narwal-kalita/story-rc38CS8bNWzPXVFR7lfgnN.html

We can produce good quality items for the people of our state”, he said adding, the production may be increased by involving more sugarmills if it gets good response.Officials associated with the project said the decision was being taken following a dip in the demand for sugar, following which the prices of sugar had dropped to Rs 35 per kg.JAGGERY PRICES HAVE INCREASEDOn the other hand, jaggery prices have increased to around Rs 50 to Rs 70, depending on quality.Moreover, officials said the production cost of jaggery is less than that of sugar.“There are around 300 jaggery units in Yamunanagar and Ambala districts but still Haryana depends upon Uttar Pradesh for good quality produce,” said a senior officer of Haryana Sugarfed. Officials of the Kaithal Cooperative Sugarmill conducted a survey and told the government that there was a demand for 5,000 quintals of jaggery in mill area.Kaithal Cooperative Sugarmill managing sugar director Jagdeep Singh said, “We have prepared a blue print for starting jaggery production and submitted it to the government for consideration. As per the survey there is a huge demand for gur, shakkar, khandsari and raab (a byproduct of jaggery) in southern and western parts of the state.”Singh said, “There is no need to make big changes in the sugarmill for jaggery production as most of the initial processes are the same.”As per the state government’s figures, sugarcane is grown over 1.10 lakh hectares in Hrayana. The 11 government-run sugar mills in the state crush around 455 lakh quintals of sugarcane per year and produce 50 lakh quintals of sugar. The three private sugarmills also crush around 270 lakh quintals of sugarcane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jaggery-raw-sugar-may-improve-fiscal-health-of-haryana-s-cooperative-sugar-mills/story-qWWwNztXn00ItkuamEg7WK.html

15-07-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand govt to set up cell for better coordination for facilitating employment for returnees||Fifty-eight per cent of over 2.15 lakh people who returned to their homes in Uttarakhand during the Covid-19 epidemic are skilled and will be encouraged to seek employment under the state government’s Mukhyamantri Swarojgar Yojana (MSY), said chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. The announcement was made after a report, prepared by the Uttarakhand migration commission, was released in Dehradun earlier in the day, regarding the people who returned to the Himalayan state during the Covid crisis. Rawat is the chairman of the commission.In May this year, as a strategy to retain the migrants who returned to the state during the lockdown, CM Rawat had inaugurated MSY, aimed at providing self-employment opportunities to youth and ensuring reverse migration, especially in the case of those who have returned to Uttarakhand in recent months. The fresh report listed the details about people who returned to the 13 districts of the Uttarakhand till June 21. The report also has details regarding the employment status and skill-sets of these people.According to SS Negi, vice chairman Uttarakhand rural development and migration commission, of 2.15 lakh people, the maximum number of people have returned to Pauri and Almora districts.“Those who have returned comprise 80.66 % from other states, 0.29 % from other countries and 18.11 % from different districts within the state to their home districts”, he said.“We also conducted skill mapping of these people and found that over 58 per cent of them are employed in private jobs, hospitality and allied sectors”, he said.Speaking after releasing the report, CM Rawat said more and more people should be encouraged to seek employment within the state under Mukhyamantri Swarojgar Yojana. He said many ongoing schemes and projects have been linked with MSY.“For better coordination between various departments and projects, a state-level cell will be established by the state government in this regard”, he said.Over 15000 people who have returned from other states have already registered themselves with the Uttarakhand government’s online portal hope.uk.gov.in (Helping Out People Everywhere) for seeking employment within the state.Over the last few weeks, the state government has been linking all various schemes under different departments under the umbrella of Mukhymantri Swarojgar Yojna to retain people, returned to the state, by facilitating their employment in the state and thus check hill migration. For effective implementation of MSY, the state government in May launched an online portal hope.uk.gov.in (Helping Out People Everywhere) through which skilled people of Uttarakhand can upload details regarding their expertise based on which authorities and employers here can take a decision on where and how they can be employed in the state.Migration of people from Uttarakhand to other areas of the country is one of the major issues faced by the Himalayan state, with roots in economic disparities, declining agriculture, low rural incomes and a stressed rural economy.Over 700 villages in the state have been deserted and over 3.83 lakh people have left their villages in the 10 years prior to 2018 with half of them going out in search of livelihood, revealed the report of the migration commission released in May last year. Of nearly 16,500 villages in the state, 734 villages, mostly in the hilly areas, have been depopulated.Migration, especially from rural areas in Uttarakhand, is a serious problem with a comparison between 2001 and 2011 census data showing a very slow decadal growth of population in most of the mountain districts of the state, according to the Commission. The data analyzed by the Commission points towards a positive rate of decadal increase in the population of districts like Dehradun, US Nagar, Nainital and Haridwar while negative in Pauri, Almora, Tehri, Bageshwar, Chamoli, Rudraprayag and Pithoragarh districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-govt-to-set-up-cell-for-better-coordination-for-facilitating-employment-for-returnees/story-JbPUo97RH6leA9wAELQ1QI.html

15-07-2020||Kolkata||Covid-19 death toll in West Bengal touches 1,000-mark||The death toll in West Bengal touched the 1,000-mark on Wednesday with 20 more people dying after being tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 24 hours.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee urged housing societies in the city to keep pluse oximeters in their offices so that home quarantined Covid-19 patients could be checked for their oxygen levels in the blood.Current guidelines say that Covid-19 patients have to be admitted to hospitals if their oxygen saturation drops to 90% or below (normal is 95 to 100%).“Housing societies should keep at least two to three oximeters in their offices. Not everyone needs to be hospitalized. Only those who oxygen level in the blood has depleted below a certain level should be hospitalized,” Banerjee said.The state has registered 34,427 Covid-19 cases till date with 1589 cases being reported since Tuesday. Out of this 12,747 are active cases.At least 415 frontline Covid-9 workers, including policemen, have tested positive for Covid-19 in Bengal till date. and twelve have died.The chief announced that the government will provide jobs to one family member to each of the frontline workers who have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/covid-19-death-toll-in-west-bengal-touches-1-000-mark/story-jcZWlzneffRyjGl0Du5twO.html
15-07-2020||Lifestyle||Unfunny task of female comedians: Yet to crack up||The recent controversy over an old video of Mumbai-based stand-up comedienne Agrima Joshua has exposed the ‘unfunny’ reality of female comic artists, who are still unable to break the glass ceiling and continue to get targeted. Joshua’s year-old joke — on the proposed statue of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Maharashtra — resurfaced on the internet and caused a massive uproar on social media, accusing her of hurting religious sentiments. The comic took down the video and issued an apology, but the row didn’t stop there and prompted rape threats, including one that had an abusive video message from a 26-year-old Vadodara resident named Shubham Mishra, who was later arrested by the Police for his demeaning act.  मेरी क्षमायाचना स्वीकार करे,Please accept my humble apology,@cmoMaharashtra @authackrey@anildeshmukhncp@nitinraut@RajThackrey pic.twitter.com/uHBZMBPOfBMany celebs have spoken in support of Joshua, and against Mishra’s video. These include comedians Kunal Kamra, Mallika Dua and Bollywood actor Swara Bhasker. But, the question that now arises is whether the stand-up scene is still not a conducive space for females, as any jovial statement gone wrong can invite harassment, both on stage and online. Comedienne Neeti Palta agrees that the trolling faced by Joshua is the reality of most comedians in the country. “As of now, we are all being trolled. But, if you are a comedian and an outspoken woman, you will eventually hit the sexist brickwall,” opines Palta, who is aghast at the way trolls behaved after Joshua’s old video resurfaced. She adds, “You are well within your rights to take offence, but violence is not the answer! People are now taking out our old tweets and misconstruing them... they are also making the case for their actions by arguing that comedians are always targeting religion. Well, these arguments are baseless.” “It’s tougher for a woman to make her mark because as soon as a woman enters the stage, she is judged; people often don’t hear her out but simply look at her. They go as far as to judge her family,” says stand-up comedian Amit Tandon. Conceding to the thought that comediennes are made scapegoats, and acknowledging the fact that insults for women are of a more personal nature, comedienne Anuradha Menon says that many a times female artists in the stand-up realm have to reconsider their jokes due to intolerant attitudes. “Most people come in with a bias that women lack a funny bone. The trolling starts with comments on our physicality; we often hear things like ‘You are ugly, fat and are not funny’. We are the easiest targets because anything we say has the potential to offend someone at some point. Within the world of comedy, there is so much space to disagree. What I may find funny, you may not and vice versa. But why is there no space for disagreement in the society? As comics, we are asked to punch up, but how do we do that when there is so much pushback from society,” says Menon. “Many female comedians have left the profession because of this constant badgering,” says popular stand-up comedian Vasu Primlani, without mincing her words. She feels that comedy still is a serious business when it comes to her male counterparts, but things remain to be harder for women in most aspects. “For example, one OTT platform did not have women in their specials segment. There is a general bias in many firms... But in India [it’s a given that] people won’t notice all our jibes; like the ones on civic issues. People, we don’t just make jokes on religion!”Once a comic , male or female, takes a dig at something, and it goes viral, it becomes difficult to then explain one’s stance and render an apology. Tandon says when a joke goes wrong “You can’t give clarification on social media because 95% people have already made their minds. You can’t expect a sane conversation wherein you can explain to people that they misconstrued your statements. ‘Sorry’ isn’t seen or heard on Twitter or any social media platform. And if anyone takes a legal action, then you issue clarifications because solutions lie in the real world; you cannot win a battle on social media where people can edit out parts of your statement and mislead others.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallika Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/unfunny-task-of-female-comedians-yet-to-crack-up/story-fYynvnvyaY2cMTohWvFtgO.html

15-07-2020||City||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, common flu adds to worries of health authorities in Ludhiana||Common flu has added to the woes of residents and health authorities who are already fighting the coronavirus pandemic.To top it all, residents suffering from flu are reluctant to visit the hospitals due to the fear that if found positive for covid they will be kept under quarantine for three weeks, which will result in financial loss.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga urged people to not be afraid of the government protocols and get the tests done. “Government is offering free test facility and people should not be reluctant to undergo the test,” said Dr Bagga.Dr Sandeep Puri, principal of Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, said that currently they are considering all flu under the Covid-19 category.“Both seasonal flu and covid are viral fever and have similar symptoms. Covid-19 has some added symptoms. In certain cases, patient suffers from loose motion, and no sense of taste and smell. Patients should get the tests done if suffering from shortness of breath, cough and fever. It is important to isolate yourself from other members of the family, especial the elderly and children, in case one feels these symptoms,” said Dr Puri.“Even otherwise, people should take care in the rainy season. Covid-19 is much more harmful as compared to any common flu. So patients should not be complacent about it, avoid gatherings and maintain social distancing,” Dr Puri added.Dr Amarjeet Kaur, senior medical officer (SMO) civil hospital Ludhiana, said, “Cases of common flu and Covid-19 are on the rise and thus, we are recommending patients with symptoms to get tested.”Dr Rampal Jain, a local physician, said that many patient are coming in with flu-like symptoms these days. “It could either be common flu or covid, depending on the severity. People should take precautions and not venture out in public as it is difficult to differentiate between common flu and covid because both have similar symptoms,” Dr Jain said.HOUSE PARTIES ANOTHER PROBLEMDr Bagga urged residents to not hold social gatherings at their houses and outside. “One cannot escape the virus by hosting a party at home. FIR will be registered against anyone found to be violating the norms,” said Dr Bagga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-covid-19-pandemic-common-flu-adds-to-worries-of-health-authorities/story-2K9qGnp1LTvsFSsUP6KGHN.html

15-07-2020||Dehradun||How Uttarakhand govt is focusing on increasing green cover through traditional green festival Harela||With the aim of increasing green cover in urban spaces, the Uttarakhand government will be celebrating Harela festival this year. The Dehradun district administration is planning to plant 2.75 lakh plants in an hour’s time on July 16.Harela, which means ‘Day of Green’, is a green festival celebrated in Uttarakhand and some regions of Himachal Pradesh. The Shravan Harela is celebrated on the first day of Shravan month of Hindu calendar (late July). People in the Himalayan state consider it highly auspicious for starting the sowing cycle in their fields.Ashish Srivastava, district magistrate of Dehradun on Tuesday reviewed the preparations by the block development officer and deputy district magistrates for the comprehensive tree plantation campaign.“Plantation drive should be carried out as per the plan and in areas, it will be easy for people to participate in the plantation drive. The target of planting 2.75 lakhs in the district should be achieved, rather we should try to plant more trees,” said Srivastava.He further directed officials that the focus should not only be on fulfilling the target of the plantation drive but special care should be given to the safety and survival of the saplings after the plantation drive.As per the last two surveys conducted by the Forest Survey of India, over a period of four years from 2015 to 2019, Uttarakhand has not managed to report even an increase of 1% forest cover in the state.Uttarakhand reported an increase of a mere 8.04 sq km of forests as per the India State of Forest Report 2019, released by the Forest Survey of India in December last year. The India State of Forest Report 2017, released by the union ministry of environment and forests in February 2018, showed that only a marginal increase of 23 sq km forest cover was reported in Uttarakhand since 2015.The report of 2017 showed a meagre increase of 165 sq km in very dense forest and 636 sq km in other forest categories, while the moderate dense forest diminished with a difference of 778 sq km, leaving the total cover in state to 24,295 sq km.As per the 2019 report the districts of Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar reported a negative result of -2.75sq km, -6.44 sq km and -4.21sq km decrease in forest areas with respect to the assessment done by Forest Survey of India in 2017.The district of Uttarkashi had reported the highest increase in forest cover in the state with an increase of 8 sq km of forest area. In Dehradun, forest cover increased by 3.69 sq km.Many factors including forest fires and development work have contributed to a loss of green cover in Uttarakhand. Since the formation of the state in 2000, over 44,554 hectares of the forest area has been damaged according to an RTI reply.Ajay Singh Rawat, a state-based environmentalist feels that the green cover has been reducing in the state due to massive construction activities including making of new roads which have resulted in massive tree felling. “Thousands of trees have been felled for the Chardham All Weather Road that is being built in the state. Apart from this rampant construction work is being undertaken in the state which is being done through elephant corridors, affecting not just forest cover but wildlife movement also,” said Rawat.Meanwhile, in June, Uttarakhand forest department issued on order directing forest officials to involve members of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) in plantation drives across the state, especially on Van Mohatsav and Harela.RBS Rawat, RSS’ provincial head and convenor of environment and water conservation in Uttarakhand, said that the organisation has been carrying out green activities like protection of the environment and water resources across the state and will continue to do so.“This time we joined hands with the forest department so that we can do so effectively on a much larger scale across the state. We wrote to the state forest department that we have 2500 ‘paryavaran praharis’ (environment guardians) across the state who can contribute immensely in these drives. I am happy that the state forest department has readily agreed to this. This is a good initiative meant to increase the green cover in the state,” said Rawat, who after his retirement as PCCF Uttarakhand, joined RSS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/how-uttarakhand-govt-is-focusing-on-increasing-green-cover-through-traditional-green-festival-harela/story-BHbsL7NglcWSheZt8ONTDO.html

The truck was headed to Sangli from Mumbai in the morning hours when the incident occurred.The cleaner has been identified as Rahul Yadav, who was taken to Pavana Hospital where he was treated for minor injuries and released.“The tar was molten and hot, so we could not go near it. We put mud in its path and directed the flow outside the expressway carriageway. The amount which was spilled on the road has to now cool down and solidify before we call a JCB and scrape it off. It has covered one (out of three) lanes, but the traffic is less,” said Shantaram Garade, worker of Highway Control of IRB who is working on the site.“Of the four lanes, two are free for vehicular movement.

The last month witnessed a spike in cases and deaths in the UT, especially in Kashmir. A senior doctor posted at the Bone and Joint Hospital, requesting anonymity, said, “We were to operate on two patients. However, when their tests came out to be positive we could not find beds for them at Covid-19 hospitals.” “All beds were exhausted and we have had to move patients from one room to the next till a bed could be arranged. A bed was only arranged after two patients were discharged in the morning.’’ SITUATION IS GRIM, SAYS SENIOR DOCTOR“Now, the places where the patients were moved are being fumigated. The situation is grim and the beds are exhausted,’’ he said. A senior doctor at Government Medical College, who did not wish to be named, said Covid-19 cases have gone up and most people are admitted to the hospital with cases like bilateral pneumonia.“We can’t shift them to designated Covid-19 wards as testing gets delayed. We have no other option but to ask them to take medicines at home till their test results are out,’’ he said. ASYMPTOMATIC CONTACTS SENT HOME A nodal officer in Srinagar, on condition of anonymity, admitted that many Covid-19 patients were being treated in their homes. “Most asymptomatic contacts of positive patients are told to stay at home. Doctors have already asked the government to allow home quarantine for Covid-19 patients but the government is yet to take a final call,’’ the officer said. The two medical colleges in Baramulla and Anantnag have limited beds with high flow oxygen. “Covid-19 patients who are in a bad state are referred to designated hospitals in Srinagar as they require high-flow oxygen, which is not available in our hospital,’’ a doctor at Baramulla Medical College said, adding that many patients were ask to return as they haven’t been tested for Covid-19. “We don’t know what to do with such patients. The government should increase beds with high-flow oxygen in rural areas with the number of cases increasing,’’ the doctor said. Fresh restrictions and red zones were declared in different areas of the Valley after a surge in Covid-19 cases. Srinagar has reported the highest number cases (1,933) and 46 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-covid-beds-exhausted-in-kashmir-doctors-ask-people-to-return-home/story-mcaslcLcIA8n3OoynOqM2K.html

While class 12 students have already given their regular exams, appearing for the CET exam in the current Covid background would not be right. Around 60 per cent of students in all state universities come from rural areas and their parents are now fearing to send their children back to cities for any kind of exams. So our request is to cancel this year’s CET and on the basis of the class 12 marks admission for various professional courses should be given to the students,” said Ramdas Zol, president of the association.The ICSE and CBSE boards have declared their class 12 results, however, the Maharashtra state board results for class 12 are awaited. “Some states have taken the decision to give admission to students without taking CET exams. Earlier, the state government had given admission to students without holding the CET, and looking at the current situation of Covid-19 in the state the CET exams should be cancelled. This is our demand to the state government.” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/unaided-institutes-association-in-pune-rural-demand-cancellation-of-cet/story-FhpjUO39yIiP18yhSUQaeI.html

15-07-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 situation better in Delhi than June, but war against virus not won yet, says Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the current Covid-19 situation in the national capital is better than what it was in June, but the war against the disease has not been won yet. He said had the Delhi government fought the virus alone, it would have “failed” and therefore his dispensation sought cooperation from the BJP-led Centre, NGOs, and other organisations. “Our first principle was that this fight cannot be won alone,” Kejriwal said. The chief minister said the AAP government will continue its preparations to deal with any spike in Covid-19 cases.Addressing an online media briefing, the chief minister said according to the Centre’s formula, Delhi was expected to have 2.25 lakh cases by July 15, but at present, there are only 1.15 lakh cases.As the Covid-19 cases had started rising in the first week of June, it was expected that there would be 1.34 lakh active cases by July 15,  but till date, there are only 18,600 active cases in the city.“We are in better situation today, as compared to June, but it does not mean we have won the war (against Covid-19). We have yet to go a long way.“There may be a spike again in Covid-19 cases. We don’t have to be complacent. We will not sit idle. We will have to be fully prepared,” Kejriwal said.The ‘Delhi Model’, which was recently praised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is based on collective efforts by the AAP government, the Centre, other organisations and all political parties, he said and thanked the BJP the and Congress for their cooperation.The chief minister said the Delhi government worked on three principles after realising that the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic cannot be won alone.“If the Delhi government had thought it would win the fight against coronavirus alone, we would have failed. Our first principle was that this fight cannot be won alone.“Our second principle was that we did not criticise our critics for their views about our work. We improved things after somebody flagged it. The third principle was that we did not accept defeat. Had we accepted defeat, there would have been a surge in the numbers of deaths,” he also said.According to Kejriwal, the government scaled up testing for Covid-19 aggressively and daily 20,000 to 23,000 tests are being conducted in Delhi.“The Covid-19 situation is under control, but we will continue our preparations against the virus,” he said.Lauding his government’s home-isolation policy, he said due to it, people are coming forward in large numbers to undergo tests.“There are 15,500 beds in Covid-19 care facilities. On June 1, we had only 300 ICU beds, but today, we have 2,100 ICU beds out of which 1,000 have so far been occupied,” he said.On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 1,606 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the tally in the city to over 1.15 lakh, while the death toll from the disease mounted to 3,446.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-situation-better-in-delhi-than-june-but-war-against-virus-not-won-yet-says-kejriwal/story-DeoxRvhrSdxOreW0jIB8FP.html
15-07-2020||Chandigarh||Amid raging pandemic, apple season begins on a subdued note in Himachal||Amid a raging Covid-19 pandemic, the apple season in Himachal Pradesh began on a subdued note with growers flagging transportation issues and acute labour shortage.Apple varieties that ripen early have already made their way to the markets in Rohru, Narkanda, Dhalli and Parala. The apple harvesting season in the primary apple-growing belts in Shimla, Rohru, Kullu, Kotgarh and Kotkhai begins mid-July and ends in August. Growers are still scouting for labourers as most of them are the dependent on the sturdy Nepalese migrants who arrive in the orchards in April. The 4500-crore apple economy largely depends on the labourers from neighbouring Nepal. The labourers help with digging pits, planting saplings, spraying chemicals, plucking, packing and transportation. The nationwide lockdown has impacted the migration of labourers. With the government expressing an inability to arrange labourers, fruit growers are making frantic efforts to arrange labourers.Labourers jack up wagesIn areas adjoining Uttarakhand, apple growers have arranged labour from the neighbouring state but they are demanding higher wages. The daily wages during the apple season vary between Rs 450 and Rs 600. But in wake of the labour shortage, villagers from Uttarakhand are demanding Rs 800 per day. An apple grower, Nikam Singh Thakur of Kotsari village in Chirgaon tehsil of Rohru said, “The labourers I managed to arrange from Uttarakhand are demanding Rs 900 per day. After negotiations they settled on Rs 800 per day.”Local fruit packer and fruit merchant Hardyal Tegta said he had arranged labourers from Uttar Pradesh. “I hired a bus to fetch labourers from Azamgarh as Nepalese labourers were not available,” says Tegta, who runs an apple-packaging unit. SOPs for quarantining labourers The government has set standard operating procedures that make it mandatory for orchard owners to quarantine labourers arriving from outside the state. The fruit growers must inform the local anganwari worker, ASHA worker, panchayat pradhan and patwari about labourers being quarantined.Apple growers also complained that at times there was delay in procuring permission for labourers’ travel. Kuldeep Tanta an orchardist from Jubbal said the biggest challenge was the shortage of labourers. “I had to spend Rs 22,000 to bring five Nepalese labourers who were in UP here by arranging two taxis for them. The state government maybe claiming that they are making arrangements to bring in labourers but nothing has been done,” he said. “However, the apple season has just started and we are getting good rates for early varieties. I sold the Tideman variety for Rs 2,000 but we are not sure what the future holds,” he added. Himachal Fruit, Vegetables And Flower Growers’ Association Harish Chauhan said there was an immense shortage of labour in Shimla district as around 1.5 lakh labourers are required for the apple season but right now only 40,000 to 50,000 laborers are available. “There is a shortage of at least 70% labourers. We request state government to arrange Nepalese labourers as soon as possible,” Chauhan said. MARKETING WOESAlthough the apple season is in its early stages orchardists are worried about marketing apples as they are struggling to send their produce to other states. Another challenge is the re-emergence of a fungal disease, scab, that is sure to cause losses to farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-raging-pandemic-apple-season-begins-on-a-subdued-note-in-himachal/story-4PfKWTAhWyF7ukIrlrj3RL.html

Kumar was shot at his shop with a revolver by two men whose faces were reportedly covered.The victim was rushed to the district hospital but succumbed to his wounds before he could be operated on.Sukha Gill of Ludhiana’s Lamma village in his post claimed that the Kumar was killed because he contacted the police instead of setting an ongoing dispute with him. The gangster said he had repeatedly warned Kumar to not go to the police over the last two days.“Sat Sri Akaal to everyone, what happened to the ‘Super Shine’ owner was done by me. A matter was going on with him for the last two days. I had informed him if he wanted to settle the matter do it or be ready to face the consequences. Instead of settling the matter, he approached the police, which was his biggest mistake and the result is in front of you,” the post read.He requested the police not to bother his family and friends as they were not aware of the matter.He admitted that the he and his friend Harwinder Singh Sandhu committed the murder. He also displayed the last five digits of two mobile numbers saying that the numbers belonged to his friends Prabh and Gurinder.“My messages will be conveyed through these numbers and a video will be sent as a proof. You have witnessed the result of contacting the police. We will meet Mann as soon as possible,” the post ends. It is not clear who Mann is.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Barjinder Singh Bhullar said five bullets had been fired by the unidentified assailants. “The trader sustained four bullet injuries and succumbed on the way to the hospital.“A special investigation team has been formed to probe the case. We are investigating all angles including the claims made by the gangster. Gill is involved in a number of unlawful activities and has cases registered against him in Ludhiana and Moga. The claims could also be an attempt to misguide the police. But as has not denied the claims on any other platform, he is the prime suspect,” the DSP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gangster-sukha-gill-lamme-claims-responsibility-for-killing-moga-trader-in-facebook-post/story-IhI8aHugFgFJ1efw6wEruI.html

His son is in Class 8 of the boarding school located in Solan district.“Sending a child to boarding is a big decision, which is always taken by parents for the betterment of the child’s future so that he could become physically and mentally strong,” the petitioner said.He said the school demanded a total fee of Rs 6,36,200 in January as it was payable in two instalments. The first instalment was of Rs 4,01,700 and was paid before February 15.The second instalment of Rs 2,34,500 was to be paid on or before July 15.He said the school opened on February 15 and the child was taken home on March 17 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The petitioner said that on May 27, the state higher education department directed private schools not to charge any fee, except tuition fee, and the tuition fee could not be collected on a quarterly basis.Nearly 140 parents sent a digitally signed representation requesting the school for waiving the school fee.Ignoring the parents’ request, the school on July 3 demanded Rs 1,70,800, instead of Rs 2,34,500 from the parents, reducing the fee merely by 11% (Rs 63,700).The school started online classes on April 6, comprising four sections of 120 students at one go compared to regular classes of 20 to 30 students.Moreover, the petition says, there are no extracurricular activities along with no board and lodging facilities extended to the students amid the lockdown.The residential Lawrence School also boasts of alumni lsuch as former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and former Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-high-court-bars-lawrence-school-sanawar-from-charging-additional-fee-for-online-classes/story-RD1i2hcFVv0I8Deu5dv7vM.html

15-07-2020||Lucknow||State of quarantine facility gives a jolt to elderly couple||An elderly couple who tested positive for corona virus felt reassured when the health department Covid-19 call centre told them, “You are elderly and we have to ensure you stay in a medical facility for good care.”But they got a rude shock when they reached the facility.“A big hall with multiple beds, common toilets and just one fan made it look that we would really fall sicker,” said the 67-year-old woman who had reached the facility made at the Integral University with her 76-year-old husband.Prof SW Akhtar, the vice chancellor of the Integral University, said arrangements for Covid -19 patients had been made as per the guidelines of the health department.“We had to wait outside as there was confusion about bed availability and then inside the compound too, before we could climb up to the third floor. All this might have been forgotten had we got at least a comfortable quarantine place. But the atmosphere forced us to look for an option,” the elderly woman said.Since there was no one to ask about an option on the same campus, the elderly couple then made efforts to come out of there. “We stayed some three hours and in that time we could just imagine how life would have been had we stayed there for long. There were people sitting and playing cards in groups without any medical monitoring and just a fan at a distance from our bed. All this was horrible for us,” said the elderly woman.“There was no medical staff inside to guide us to the bed. In fact, they just showed us the door on the third floor and we had to enter that to reach the hall,” said the woman.They reached this place at 6.20 pm on Sunday and their agony abated a little at around 10 pm when an ambulance came to shift them. “They have now put us in a semi-finished hospital where we have two separate beds in a room with attached bathroom and an air conditioner running,” she said.“In fact it was better for us to remain in home quarantine instead of moving out as we could have recovered faster at our own house, following all the rules and protocol,” she said. “I had asked the health officials to allow us to stay at home since we had no other health problem but they insisted we go with them. We expected some facilities as senior citizens and former central government employees but we got nothing,” said the woman.Prof SW Akhtar said, “The entire facility has been developed under guidance of the health department. It may be possible that people look for facilities they have at home. But we have made everything as per the protocol by the health department and all facilities directed by the health department are available.”He said that at present, there were 100 Covid -19 patients and they were being taken care of. “We have medical teams deployed at the facility and they keep monitoring the patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/state-of-quarantine-facility-gives-a-jolt-to-elderly-couple/story-akNqFkoSMP0WVS1fLOAk8L.html
15-07-2020||Jaipur||Fighting for self-respect, not posts, say Pilot supporters||Before the Congress removed Sachin Pilot as the Rajasthan deputy chief minister and president of the state party unit on Tuesday, three senior Congress leaders, who are with Pilot in Delhi, have said they are fighting to protect their dignity.In a message circulated by the Pilot camp on WhatsApp, they said, “We have for years worked with dedication, devotion and service towards the party. And we are taking a stand to protect our dignity and self-respect at a time when our leader is threatened with notices from the SOG under the charges of sedition and criminal conspiracy.”The statement was issued through Pilot’s official WhatsApp group and signed by Congress leaders Vishvender Singh, Ramesh Meena and Deepender Shekhawat.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot removed Pilot, Singh and Meena from the cabinet, Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala announced after the second meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP).Singh and Meena were cabinet ministers and Shekhawat is a former speaker. Singh was the tourism minister and Meena held the food and civil supplies portfolio.Pilot skipped the second CLP meeting again. A resolution was passed in the CLP meeting to take action against Pilot and other rebel legislators who did not attend the meeting.“This is unprecedented in Indian democracy and the Congress party, for which we have toiled with sweat and blood. Under the leadership of Sachin Pilot we have made every effort in the past 6 years to strengthen the party and bring it to power in Rajasthan at a time when it had been reduced to an insignificant number in the state assembly,” Pilot’s supports said.“Public humiliation of our leader Pilot is something that is totally unacceptable to us, and those responsible for meeting out this treatment need to be made accountable,” the statement said. “We are seeking to restore our self-respect and are not clamouring for any posts and positions contrary to false reports in the media. We have been senior members of the party for many years and have held many positions within the party and government and are not lured by inducements.”The face-off between Pilot and Gehlot came to the fore after Rajasthan Police’s Special Operations Group (SOG) sent notices to the former and other leaders in connection with alleged attempts to topple Congress government in the state. The notices stated that the SOG had urged the leaders to provide a suitable date and time for recording their respective statements.Pilot then left the state along with his 16 MLAs. He has claimed that the Gehlot government is in minority as 30 lawmakers are with him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/fighting-for-self-respect-not-posts-say-pilot-supporters/story-8JzkZp4EaBH31wmSXLz9eJ.html

15-07-2020||Mumbai||Debarred for low attendance, Mithibai college students to move Apex court for clarity on their graduation||Even as the state stands firm on its decision to not hold final-year exams, around 550 students of Vile Parle’s Mithibai College who were debarred for lack of attendance plan to move the Supreme Court (SC) for clarity on their fate. The students are currently working out the modalities with their lawyer.The Maharashtra Universities Act mandates that students must have 75% or above attendance in each subject during every semester, failing which the institute can disallow them from appearing for exams. On the basis of the rule, Mithibai College debarred around 550 students from arts, science, commerce and other self-finance courses.In March, around 100 students who were debarred filed a petition in the Bombay high court seeking relief. The court, however, upheld the college’s decision. On May 31, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that all students, including pursuing final-year courses, will be promoted based on their performance in the previous semester. While the debarred students pointed out the state government’s decision, they are yet to hear from the college management.“The situation is different at present as the state government highlighted that all students should be promoted despite their academic status or attendance. If students from other colleges benefit from the decision, then why are we being punished,” said a student, who did not wish to be named.Despite attempts, college principal Rajpal Hande and management’s chief executive officer Asoke Basak did not answer HT’s calls or messages.“Most of us are worried about our futures given the Covid-19 situation. To make matters worse, the college has left us in the lurch by not clarifying our status. We have no option but to go back to the judiciary and seek help,” said another student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/debarred-for-low-attendance-mithibai-college-students-to-move-apex-court-for-clarity-on-their-graduation/story-b0N7EeFjePBffGVTvDnqnM.html
15-07-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses to interfere in PILs on inflated power bills||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday refused to interfere in two public interest litigations (PILs) seeking relief against the inflated electricity bills for June, which consumers across the city received. The court held that as the petitioners have an alternate remedy in the form of the grievance redressal forum of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), it was not inclined to pass orders. The court further directed the forum to act and decide on the complaints expeditiously and disposed of the PILs.A division bench of justice PB Varale and justice Milind Jadhav, while hearing the PILs filed by citizens Ravindra Desai and Mahibub Shaikh through advocates Vishal Saxena and Ranjit Shinde, was informed by the state that the petitions were not maintainable as an alternate remedy was available to the them.Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan, while arguing against the PIL by Desai, said that as he already lodged a complaint with MERC’s grievance redressal forum, he should await its response.She further submitted that if he was not satisfied with the forum’s response, he could appeal against it and only if he was not satisfied with the appellate authority’s response, could he approach the HC.Responding to Shaikh’s PIL, government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade, along with advocate Nisha Mehra, said that the PIL was premature, as the petitioner claimed to be representing the common man but as different power companies have their respective redressal mechanism in place, without knowing if the petitioner has availed of the same, it would not be appropriate for the court to interfere.Shaikh also prayed that the court should issue directions to electricity companies asking them not to resort to coercive steps to recover their dues from consumers. Responding to this plea, advocate Deepa Chavan on behalf of MERC submitted that a proper code in this regard was mentioned in the Electricity Act and hence if the petitioner was aggrieved, he could take the legal recourse as per the procedure laid down in the Act.After hearing all the sides, the bench observed that as the petitioners did not fully exhaust the alternate remedies available to them, it was not inclined to interfere. The court also directed MERC to decide on the complaint already filed by Desai in eight weeks and asked MERC to ensure that Shaikh’s grievance, if he made one, was addressed in the manner prescribed in the Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-interfere-in-pils-on-inflated-power-bills/story-720Ss8GyG5ai7iKK3mFX3O.html

During this period, the BJP demolished the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh, and is now looking to demolish the Ashok Gehlot’s government in Rajasthan. However, it is not possible,” the editorial said.Gehlot’s government is witnessing turbulent times after former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot launched an open rebellion against the CM. Pilot claimed that 30 legislators are supporting him and thus the Rajasthan government is in a minority now. The editorial said that pro-Pilot legislators were present in the meeting with Gehlot on Monday, and that actual strength of the claims made by the rebel leader will only be known after a head count on the floor of the House. It said that the BJP will not make a move openly until the numbers are counted, though it continues to work from behind the curtains. Launching an attack on its former ally, the Sena said such acts will turn the “parliamentary democracy into a desert”. It questioned what the BJP will achieve by conducting “the misadventure in the desert state. “The BJP is ruling the entire country. It should leave some houses [states] for their opponents [to rule]. That will be the pride of democracy,” the editorial read.The Sena also criticised the two Congress leaders.“Pilot’s arrogance and malice are destabilising a state like Rajasthan, but this is not possible without the support of central power, which is working on a formula to destabilise the Opposition government. Pilot has an aspiration to become the Rajasthan CM. He is young and has a chance in the future, but due to Gehlot’s malice, he wants to win the CM’s post now. This step, however, may not prove beneficial to him. It is true that Pilot has worked hard for the party’s victory in the state. But when the party is in trouble, he should not run away like a mouse from a boat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shiv-sena-targets-bjp-over-rajasthan-political-crisis/story-R7d6BwPvbGLXX51pu1K2YO.html
15-07-2020||Mumbai||ISC results: Cut-off for the top 20 percentile up to 90.2% from last year’s 89.4%||The number of top scorers in the Indian School Certificate (ISC) remained high this year, with 20% of the students who took the exam scoring 90.2% or above.As per the data shared by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCSE) the cut-off for the top 20 percentile rose from 89.4% in 2019 to 90.2% this year. The board announced the percentile cut offs on Tuesday morning for students who qualified for the joint entrance exam (JEE) advanced exams scheduled to be held in September. Students who wish to appear for JEE need to score 75% in their board exams or fall in the top 20% percentile of their respective boards to qualify for a seat at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).While the cut-off for students from the general category is set at 90.2% for the entrance exam, it is 88% for students from the Other Backward Class (OBC) category. Students from the Scheduled Caste (SC) and the Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories will qualify for the exam if they have secured 86.4% and 79%, respectively.Around 86,000 students appeared for the ISC exams this year of which nearly 17,000 students scored above 90%.“This year, the results have been really good, especially owing to the fact that students were marked on the basis of their internal marks for the papers that were cancelled due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The number of top scorers was bound to go up,” said the principal of a suburban school.Meanwhile, the board decided to reduce the syllabus for Class 6-8 by 20% for English and Hindi, and by 40% for Sciences, Mathematics, Computer Science and Social Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/isc-results-cut-off-for-the-top-20-percentile-up-to-90-2-from-last-year-s-89-4/story-xtWw47hCMAq54UzP6MgzXO.html
15-07-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad: Family fears authorities might claim Varavara Rao’s health to be normal before Bombay HC hearing||A day after Telugu poet and activist P Varavara Rao, arrested in the Elghar Parishad case, was moved out of Taloja jail to Sir JJ Hospital for a medical evaluation, his family fears that authorities might show a report claiming his health to be normal just before his bail plea is scheduled for hearing before the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday.The family on Tuesday morning released a statement pleading for 81-year-old Rao to be kept in hospital till he completely recovers and not to discharge him in a hurry. The family in their statement said, “Rao was shifted to JJ Hospital from Taloja jail on Monday afternoon. Till midnight he was undergoing various tests in different medical departments. Even at that time, hospital officials reportedly said he was brought in for evaluation only and did not confirm whether he was going to be admitted. Since the results of the reports might take a couple of days, he may be retained in hospital, according to the available information after midnight.”The family has alleged that authorities have not provided any information officially to them on Rao’s health and even when he was taken to hospital. “Though it was mandatory to inform family about these developments, either government or jail, police, hospital authorities did not provide any official information to the family,” read their statement.On May 28, Rao was taken to hospital after he fell unconscious and was discharged on June 1. The family alleged that Rao’s discharge was not proper, so as to obstruct his bail plea. “He was not normal at the time of discharge. While the sodium normal range is 134-145, he attained only 133 and when the potassium normal range is 3.5 to 5.0, he attained only 3.55, according to the hospital’s own discharge summary. But, later on June 2, it was proved that all this — admission in hospital, getting a normal report, getting him discharged — was part of a conspiracy by the police. June 2 was the date of hearing of his bail application on health grounds in the [National Investigation Agency] NIA special sessions court and police argued against his bail, showing this hospital’s “normal” report. The judge accepted that and refused bail on June 26,” read the family’s statement, expressing fear that the authorities might repeat the same this time.Rao, on Monday, had moved the HC against the order of the special NIA court, which had rejected his interim bail application on June 26. Rao had sought interim bail on the grounds of his failing health condition due to his advanced age and susceptibility to contracting Covid-19. Rao’s family members raised an alarm about his health condition after speaking with him over the phone on Saturday. They found him to be incoherent and suffering from hallucinations.Rao, who has been behind bars for almost two years, and nine other activists have been arrested in the Elgar Parishad case, which was initially probed by the Pune Police and later transferred to the NIA in January this year. The case is related to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Bhima-Koregaon war memorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-family-fears-authorities-might-claim-varavara-rao-s-health-to-be-normal-before-bombay-hc-hearing/story-MlVqYsm2QUac4BpxPvQRiN.html
15-07-2020||Mumbai||Yoga to help aviation staff tide over anxiety amid the pandemic||A group of six aviation professionals have started online sessions designed to help colleagues deal with anxiety through yoga and meditation. The first four-day course began on July 11 and has received a good response. More sessions are being planned for the future. Two pilots who are currently flying with Indian Airlines, two cabin crew and two back-end officials (some of whom are retired) organised a four-day online course Art of living’s Aviation Special Online Meditation and Breath workshop. Starting July 11, sessions were conducted thrice a day to ensure participants could attend despite various work shifts.Monali Shriyan, a former Air India cabin crew and a facilitator, said, “Looking at the tense situation due to Covid-19 that is not only forcing employees to go on mandatory leave without pay but also leading to job loss, we decided to conduct these sessions for all aviation employees so that they can deal with stress in better way.”The response has been positive. An air traffic controller, requesting anonymity, said the techniques learnt in the workshop were helpful. “I have already started experiencing the benefits and it has energised me for working better,” they said. Another attendee, also requesting anonymity, said, “Being unemployed, this pandemic gave me a lot of trouble and stress. The breathing practices have not only reduced my ever-wandering thoughts but have also shown a way to accept daily life challenges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yoga-to-help-aviation-staff-tide-over-anxiety-amid-the-pandemic/story-fguP53iCkOOaOSds8wgqaJ.html
15-07-2020||City||Navi Mumbai gets new civic commissioner||Former Nagpur civic chief Abhijit Bangar took charge as the commissioner of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) on Tuesday. Bangar, a 2008-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer replaced Annasaheb Misal, who was transferred almost a month after the state government issued a stay on his transfer order. Bangar, who was the municipal commissioner of Nagpur for 14 months, also held the charge of additional commissioner of Nagpur division before being transferred to Navi Mumbai.“The priority is of course to bring the Covid-19 outbreak in Navi Mumbai under control and we will take the necessary measures to achieve it. I am sure that with everybody’s cooperation, we will accomplish the goal in the interest of the people of the city.”Within three week after Misal’s transfer order was stayed by the state, Navi Mumbai’s Covid-19 situation got worse, and the city added around 5,000 new cases during the period, with the total cases now approaching the 10,000-mark.Misal had taken charge of NMMC a year ago, replacing Ramaswamy N. On June 23, Misal was transferred, along with several other municipal commissioners of neighbouring cities. However, the order was later cancelled. Sources privy to the development claimed that the transfer order was stayed owing to political pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-gets-new-civic-commissioner/story-fi7tnkWIy3et55GLhr02aL.html
15-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government orders inquiry into Covid stamp on degree certificates||The state agriculture department has announced that it will remove the stamp ‘Promoted Covid-19’ from the mark sheets issued to the third-year degree students who have been promoted based on their aggregate marks. Amid widespread criticism from students and organisations, the department also announced strict action against the officials responsible for this marking.The Covid stamp was used on mark sheets issued by Shri Shivaji Agriculture College in Amravati, governed by Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Agriculture University. Several students and student organisations expressed their discontent over the issue and also announced plans to challenge it in court. Former education minister and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashish Shelar also criticised the state government, calling the move unjust.Taking cognizance, state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray spoke to agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse and asked him to rectify the mistake. Bhuse later directed the agriculture university to withdraw the mark sheets and issue fresh ones.“I have asked the university to rectify the mistake and issue mark sheets and certificates without any such marking. The action was taken immediately after we learnt about the mark sheets issued with the stamp. The university has also been directed to conduct an inquiry and take action against the official responsible,” Bhuse said. The minister has written a letter to the director-general of Maharashtra Council of Agriculture Education and Research, and vice-chancellors of the agriculture universities.The state government had already announced that it would not conduct final-year exams in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Students are being promoted on aggregate marks with 50% valuation of marks from the first two years, and a 50% average of the internal assessment of the third year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-orders-inquiry-into-covid-stamp-on-degree-certificates/story-L8hN8fVXz5tqFMoPjmz9FJ.html
15-07-2020||City||Mumbai crosses 4 lakh Covid-19 tests: Civic body data||Even as the city inches towards the 1-lakh-cases mark, the number of tests in the city crossed 4 lakh on Tuesday, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Until July 13, 401,741 samples have been tested, of which 93,894 samples (23.37%) have tested positive. The average testing figure has gone up to over 5,200 tests daily in the first 13 days of July.On Tuesday, Mumbai recorded 954 fresh cases and 70 deaths, taking the city’s case count to 95,100 and toll to 5,405. The number of discharged patients is 66,633, with a recovery rate of 70%. The number of active cases is 22,773 as of Tuesday; the fatality rate was 5.68% as of Sunday. The city’s doubling rate is 52 days.In May, the average of daily tests was 3,800, which went up to 4,300 in June, and 5,000 till a week ago. The daily average now stands at 5,200 tests. The figure includes both, testing using RT-PCR and rapid antigen kits. BMC said it was also using one lakh rapid antigen kits that give results in 30 minutes to increase the testing. BMC also claimed its liberalised testing policy has made it easy for anyone to get tested.BMC in a circular issued on July 7 had said any person who thinks he was in close contact with a patient who tested positive and is a high-risk contact can get tested without a prescription, irrespective of the age. The civic body had also asked ward officers in the western suburbs to use antigen kits to conduct at least 250 tests daily. BMC had anticipated a spike owing to this, but expected a clear picture by the end of the month.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had on Monday said, “Our doubling rate is 50 days now, highest in India. Our recovery rate is 70%. After our open testing policy (without prescriptions, the only city in India to do so), our testing has gone up and our total daily positives have come down.”However, Mumbai’s testing figure is lower than Delhi which has conducted over 7.89 lakh tests. As of July 12, Tamil Nadu has conducted 16.09 lakh tests, Maharashtra 13.45 lakh, Rajasthan 10.54 lakh, Kerala 3.47 lakh and Bengaluru 1.75 lakh.A senior doctor from Maharashtra’s Covid-19 taskforce not wishing to be named said, “There was a narrative that we are not having cases because we are not allowing testing. However, for one week now, we have allowed anyone to get tested without a prescription. With this, the number of tests will definitely go up, but we will have to wait till month-end to know its effect in terms of figures.”Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant, said, “As the testing is open to all now, we can’t blame the authorities for insufficient testing. The daily testing number will take time to rise as many may not be in the frame of mind to get a test done. BMC should also publicise the liberalised testing policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-crosses-4-lakh-covid-19-tests-civic-body-data/story-tz2eaewwVEsXpEpvFEfk9H.html
15-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The song of the road, now silenced||His life was not much different from that of Ulysses, in Homer’s Odysseus. As you know well, Homer’s classic is about the hero’s long and epic journey to home. Regarding Sunil Kumar Singh — he was making that journey everyday. Two hours in the morning, two hours in the evening. But now this commute appears like the dewy memory of another era. Stuff that fairy tales are made of.Mr Singh is a Gurugramwale by day, and a Delhiwale by night. For 13 years, he has been shuttling daily between his home in north-east Delhi’s Karawal Nagar and his office in Gurugram’s DLF Phase V. “It was tiring but I had gotten used to it,” says Mr Singh, a manager in the audit wing of a multinational company. Chatting on WhatsApp video, he is sitting by the desk in his bedroom. Like many of us these days, he is working from home. In his self-imposed isolation triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Singh, 35, misses his days in the Millennium City—the daily banters with the colleagues, the office gossip “that can never be duplicated on zoom,” and he feels the loss of commuting.“I would leave home at eight in the morning, and reach work by 10.”Just the one-way trip alone would entail a series of boardings and deboardings. First, Mr Singh would get an auto from home to Kashmere Gate Metro station. Then he would hurry onwards to squeeze into the crowded coaches of the Yellow Line Metro and get off 21 stations later, in Sikandarpur, where he would rush to the other side of the station to board the far sleeker Rapid Metro, which would drop him at Gurugram’s Sector 53-54 Metro stop. “From there I would walk to the office... about five minutes.”He would almost never get to sit in the long journey. And yet, Mr Singh insists he misses the commute. It is not that he is developing an affection for it in retrospect. None of us yearn to be stranded among the shoving-pushing masses, and treated to dhakka- mukki from sweaty shoulders and fists. No. Mr Singh was fond of the commute in spite of all this. And, because it was the texture of his daily life, he had taken it for granted. Thinking it would last. Until his retirement from professional life.“The long trip gave me time to be with myself.” This was also the only opportunity during the hectic day for him to watch movies and web-based shows on the mobile.Perhaps, the most relaxing aspect of the commute was the company of friends Dharmender and Jaggu. They weren’t colleagues but “we did the same route daily, so we planned our return trips jointly to be able to travel together in the evening... morning co-ordination was tough, however.”A cosy comradeship had formed among the three. “It’s not that we would be chattering throughout the journey,” recalls Mr Singh wistfully. “Sometimes we would be silent, glued to our mobiles, and then suddenly we would start talking of something, and then again we’d go silent. Ours was a spontaneous friendship, very comfortable and easy-going.”Since the lockdown began, Mr Singh hasn’t met those Gurugram-to-Delhi friends. They did chat briefly on phone twice “but it’s not the same thing as hanging out in person... that randomness of real life conversations is gone.”Certainly, in the past, it has often been suggested to Mr Singh to cut his super-long commute by moving residence to Gurugram. He has always resisted the idea “because I live in a joint family, and Rekha (wife) and I are very much settled in this house.” Indeed, right now his daughter, Yashwi, is lying sprawled on the sofa beside him. Mr Singh has two kids—son, Yug, was born early this fateful year “during the Delhi riots.”Speaking of his daily rush-hour routine, the day-jobber looks back at it with nostalgia. “To see so many people in the Metro, each with their own stresses and satisfactions... I would experience Delhi and Gurgaon to their full intensity.”And the best part of the day was always the return journey, of course, “when the work was done, when there was no tension anymore about office things... we three commuting friends would joke and gossip, and on reaching the last Metro station, we would sit beside some food stall, treat ourselves to golgappa or juice, chat a bit more and only then we would head to our respective houses.” But for now, the commute has ended. Who would have thought it was such a precious thing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/the-song-of-the-road-now-silenced/story-5HF6chWmiICjKjs062MrgL.html
15-07-2020||City||Maharashtra government launches videos for Covid-19 awareness||The state health department launched a special awareness campaign to encourage social distancing and other measures for curbing the spread of Covid-19. The department released four video clips on social media featuring health minister Rajesh Tope and Marathi actors Jui Gadkari and Siddharth Jadhav, in which they share messages over maintaining social distancing, the importance of using masks and sanitisers. In the video clips, they also paid their gratitude to the frontline workers for their efforts. The clips received a good response after they were released some days ago.“We are running short of the budget as the pandemic prolonged beyond our imagination. We received an allocation of Rs 3 crore after the outbreak in March, but it is now exhausted. The spots created by us featuring the health minister or the Marathi actors have been shot at the minister’s official bungalow and the Sahyadri guest house at a less budget,” said an official from the health department.After the lockdown restrictions were eased, the cases began to surge and the department feels that at such a time awareness over the protocol that needs to be followed in social life will play a vital role. “We are planning a special campaign drive over the use of masks, hand washing and maintaining social distancing in everyday life. Unicef [United Nations International Children’s Fund ] too issued us guidelines for the campaign. We are demanding an additional budget of about Rs 3 crore for the same,”another official said.“The video clips released recently are getting an overwhelming response and we have observed that their impact is huge,” said Kailash Baviskar, deputy director, information education communication bureau, health department.The state government has also released funds for every district to create awareness on the Covid-19 outbreak. The IEC bureau helps the district administrations in finalising the literature used for the awareness by ensuring that it is accurate and as per the protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-launches-video-clips-for-covid-19-awareness/story-7MNRKj1gBqdyKfh3dNIE8K.html
15-07-2020||Mumbai||Shahapur villagers find livelihood amid Covid-19 crisis: Tribal women’s poultry project keeps village afloat||Indutai Wagh, mother of three and a subsistence tribal farmer from Khanduchiwadi, a remote village in Shahapur taluka, 72km from Mumbai, crossed a personal milestone last month.Wagh earned her first income of ₹1,250 after she sold 250 home-grown organic eggs. The earnings, she says are enough to fend for her family of four, for over a month.Like Wagh, 17 other tribal women from the hamlet of Ma Thakur tribe, a marginalised community, are finding their feet amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing unemployment, thanks to a free range poultry project that was started here as a pilot by Population First, a non-government organisation that focusses on communication and advocacy for health and population issues from gender and social development perspective.The initiative is now not only ensuring steady earnings to these women in this village but also helping the government run its supplementary nutrition scheme for tribal children, despite broken supply chains during the Covid-19 outbreak. While all daily wage labourer jobs that the men in the village normally opt for having dried up, it’s the women’s poultry business that is keeping their families secure in Khanduchiwadi. Wagh and the other women who are a part of the project are selling the eggs produced in the backyards of their homes to the anganwadi workers at Khanduchiwadi and five other neighbouring hamlets to help them run the scheme under the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Amrut Ahar Yojana. The supplementary nutrition scheme of the government is aimed at combating malnutrition and improving the nutrition of tribal children as well as pregnant and lactating mothers. Under the scheme, the government has mandated eggs, among other food items, to be provided to tribal children (up to six years) for four days a week. “I need 200 eggs a week for the scheme, and from April onwards, buying eggs from outside became difficult owing to the lock down. Our local poultry project came in very handy and I now buy eggs from the women in our village for the scheme,’’ said Anita Wagh, an anganwadi sevika for the hamlet. Anita is compensated by the state government’s women and child development department that implements this scheme. The women, who are a part of the initiative, were trained in January in poultry farming, following which Population First provided them with 180 chicks of a breed known for maximum egg production.“We first tried training this group of women last year, but the project didn’t take off. We then renewed our efforts in January. Their training consists of various aspects, including taking care of chicks, their feed, vet visits, hatching etc and close follow ups over three months. It’s not easy to train the tribal women because of huge gaps in education and language [the tribe speaks Thakari Marathi dialect]. But they did have traditional poultry-rearing skills, which were useful,’’ said Fazal Pathan, project director, Shahapur, with Population First for its field initiative, Amchi (Action for Mobilisation Community Health Initiatives).Pathan said that the while some chicks did not survive, majority of them did and the eggs successfully hatched. The women were also successful with rearing their first batch of 35 new chicks.“It was heartening to see the women even rear the batch of chicks with traditional hatching techniques and without the assistance of hatcheries etc. The project will now be expanded to three more tribal villages, as it seems to be a feasible livelihood option for the community,’’ said Dr Sharada AL, director of Population First.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shahapur-villagers-find-livelihood-amid-covid-19-crisis-tribal-women-s-poultry-project-keeps-village-afloat/story-9NFXPzKB67EjMlmwOPamjI.html

15-07-2020||Mumbai||Real situation is 22K active cases: BMC chief IS Chahal||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner IS Chahal elaborates on the Covid-19 situation in Mumbai. Excerpts from an interview:Is the Covid-19 outbreak under control in Mumbai? Today [Tuesday] morning, Mumbai recorded 950 new cases. The last time Mumbai had 900 cases, the number of tests for that day was 3,700. As of today morning, we have done 6,000 tests in the past 24 hours, but we still have 950 cases. I was expecting the number to increase as our testing increases. Although testing has gone up by 2,000 to 3,000 every day, cases are coming down. This is a good sign. Of the 950 cases too, less than 150 are symptomatic. On Monday, of the 1,158 cases, only 190 patients were symptomatic. The past week’s trend shows the actual bed requirement per day is not more than 200. Whereas every night, we have 7,000 beds vacant. The sign to watch out for to decide whether we are in control is not the cases becoming zero. Nobody can do that until we get a vaccine.If we ensure that every person who is infected has a bed and a doctor waiting for him, and if there is 0% waiting queue for a bed, the battle is won. Mumbai has 94,000 cases, but our discharge rate is 70%. We have 22,000 active Covid-19 patients. It is important to highlight that Mumbai has 22,000 active cases to remove the fear from the minds of the citizens. The real situation is not 94,000 cases. We have 22,000 positive cases, of which 7,500 people are on hospital beds and the remaining are in home quarantine. They are asymptomatic and leading a normal life.According to you, what will Covid numbers in Mumbai look like for the rest of July and August? On June 7, Mumbai had 48,000 cumulative cases and 30,000 active cases. Today, Mumbai has double the number of cases at 95,000, but active cases have come down to 22,000. By general progression, 30,000 active cases should have become 60,000 active cases. But 30,000 active cases have become 22,000 now. If this rate continues, I am very hopeful of even better results in July and August. In another 15 days, I am expecting the ICUs of KEM, Sion and Nair hospitals to be empty. I have already passed an order that 612 ICUs in our jumbo facilities will be outsourced to private doctors. When will local trains, malls and gymnasiums open?It depends on the situation in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). When the situation in MMR becomes similar to the situation in Mumbai today, I would immediately recommend opening of malls and gyms. How long will the lockdown last?Mumbai does not have a lockdown in the real sense anymore. Every two-wheeler and four-wheeler is virtually allowed to come on the road, because there is no way to distinguish who is allowed and who is not. Mumbai has allowed 100% shops to remain open in a 48-hour cycle [shops on alternate side of the road can remain open on alternate days]. Every shopkeeper can get his vehicle out. If you leave aside malls, every shop in Mumbai is opening. On an average, we have one crore people on the road every day, so it cannot be called a lockdown. BMC is saying until we have a no-pandemic situation, elderly, children and people who are co-morbid should not come out. These are preventive measures. It is more of an advisory. If a senior citizen is spotted walking on the road, no one can arrest him. This is for the benefit of people. They should co-operate. Mission Save Lives – to reduce fatalities – started 15 days ago, but the fatality rate in Mumbai is still around 5.6%-5.7%. How effective is the mission?The overall fatality rate is 5.7%, for over 100 days, but in the past one week, the average fatality has been around 4%. Take for example yesterday (Monday). Mumbai had 1,158 cases and 47 deaths. Mumbai has come to the 4% fatality range now, but as the base is higher, it will take time for the overall fatality rate to come down. We are the only city in the country, which has ventured out with permission from the chief minister, to discover unreported, home deaths. In March and April, Mumbai’s testing capacity was limited and thousands of people had come from abroad – almost 1.7 lakh people had arrived in flights and many were testing positive. At this time, many people passed away at their residences without treatment, without BMC’s knowledge, without approaching us. There were cases where swab sample results were taking 10 days, 12 days or 15 days. In one case on April 4, the results came on April 22, this is on record. In the meantime, the person passed away at home. BMC went ward-wise and discovered such deaths. The chief minister courageously said, “Let us be transparent.” On a single day, a press note announced 862 deaths were added to the city’s total deaths. That is how our fatality rate jumped from 2.9% to 6% in a day. I say either the rest of the country should say there have been no home deaths, or they should comply [with the rules]. Mumbai has exercised its choice by stepping up, in the process spoiling our record, but we have been transparent. Has BMC completed reconciling previous death figures? The backlog of reporting old deaths that have occurred in hospitals is clear. From July 3, all deaths that BMC announces at the end of the day in its press note have occurred in the past 48 hours only. I started imposing this discipline from June 8, and it has taken me 24-25 days to put it in check. But we are now examining the reason for deaths of patients outside the hospital, also these unreported home deaths. We are still trying to locate their papers. This will be a continuous process. It is very easy to decide the reason of death for a patient who passed away in a hospital, because all case papers are available. But what about patients who passed away in their homes? There is this one case that was brought to my notice. One expatriat woman came from Europe, and one day she was found dead in her house. Later, her maid and driver also died in their homes in slums. These deaths may not have been accounted for yet. Are there instances where a cured and discharged patient has died at home after recovery?Yes there are, but not more than five to seven people. There are only two such cases known to me. One was a policeman who was discharged on Day 14, and he passed away on Day 22. He was co-morbid. Maybe, he got a heart attack. The behaviour of the virus is not known to anyone in the world. In some cases, an asymptomatic unidentified Covid-19 positive case has infected others and those persons have died. There was a case in Nariman Point in a family of nine, including four doctors. They called a person home for massage on a Sunday. One member got the massage done from an asymptomatic positive. He transferred the virus to all nine people, and four died. The world is still not aware of the complexity of the virus. That is why these cases are happening. Mission Zero started in June. Has it been successful?Yesterday [Monday], there were 18 containment zones in northern wards, and 14 containment zones had zero cases in the past 14 days. So this is a good sign.You took charge over two months ago. What has been your priority? Has it changed?When I took charge, I was aware that the battle against Covid-19 can go on for one more year from today, if the vaccine doesn’t come. No one can claim that I can make cases zero, without a vaccine. The Covid war is going to be fought long term, over six or eight months, or a year. Unless systems are built and everything is on autopilot, it will not work. Everyday one cannot manually coordinate bed and ambulance availability. It has to happen naturally. It came to my mind on day one that there needs to be a standard operating procedure on autopilot as this is a long-term battle. There are four pillars to this fight – testing labs, ambulances, hospital beds and doctors. If these four things are tied up, the problem will be solved. We are concentrating on field weapons such as testing, tracing, tracking, quarantining and treatment. In case of testing labs in Mumbai, a report that used to take days to come now comes in 24 hours. In the past one month, not a single report has come after 24 hours. It came from Metropolis, and I suspended them for three weeks. Now they have fallen in line.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/real-situation-is-22k-active-cases-bmc-chief-is-chahal/story-76MdSDy1Acw2YFvVA0ziqJ.html

15-07-2020||City||More space being freed up for critically ill Covid patients in Mohali||To keep tertiary care facilities vacant and ready for treatment of level 3 (L3) or critically ill Covid -19 patients, private hospitals with good medical infrastructure have been asked by the local administration to extend home care to asymptomatic patients, Mohali deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan said on Tuesday. Dayalan said it had been observed that L3 facilities in most cases were occupied by patients who could afford treatment at the facilities instead of those who needed urgent medical care. To ensure optimum utilisation of infrastructure, tertiary care or L3 hospitals would extend medical services at home to Covid-19 patients requiring medical surveillance but not oxygen or ventilator.Patients who were not critically ill and sought admission to an L3 hospital to isolate from family members exposed to the virus could stay at hotels where rooms had been made available and avail of home care, he added.Similarly, reverse referrals had been worked out for recoveries not requiring L3 infrastructure, who could then be referred back to L2 (patients requiring oxygen) and L1 (those not in need of urgent medical attention) facilities or home isolation to reduce the burden on L3 units. As of now, Fortis and Max Hospital in the city are extending home care services. Hotels which have rooms available for self-isolation are JD Residency, Mohali; Wood Crest, Rockland, Black Diamond and Royal Park, all in Zirakpur and Arista in Kharar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/more-space-being-freed-up-for-critically-ill-covid-patients-in-mohali/story-0BdK19RkilANtO7OqnDxjI.html

Meanwhile, the suburbs and south Mumbai both recorded heavy showers with a few intense spells from Tuesday afternoon onwards. Between 8.30am and 8.30 pm, Santacruz recorded 86.6 mm rain while 50.4 mm was recorded in Colaba. For the period June 1 to July 14, Mumbai suburbs and south Mumbai have recorded 28% and 26% excess rainfall than the normal for this period.An orange alert for ‘heavy to very heavy rain at a few places’ has been issued for Wednesday. A yellow alert (heavy rain at isolated places) has been issued for Thursday while no alert for Friday.“Widespread rain activity was witnessed on Tuesday and is likely to get further enhanced on Wednesday owing to active monsoon conditions under the influence of strong lower level westerly wind convergence coupled with an upper air cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD). “Dense cloud cover witnessed on Tuesday is expected on Wednesday as well, will lead to a few intense spells of rain for the Konkan coast, including Mumbai, and parts of central Maharashtra.” Since the launch of the integrated flood warning system for Mumbai (iFLOWS-Mumbai) on June 12, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for the first time on Tuesday made public its iFLOWS forecast predicting ‘very high’ (over 3-foot depth) flooding possibility across 29 of 656 locations across 24 wards including isolated areas in A ward (Colaba, Cuffe Parade), E ward (Byculla, Mahalaxmi), central Mumbai (Dadar, Parel, Hindmata), M-East (Chembur, Govandi), many areas in K-West ward (Andheri, Versova), S ward (Kanjurmarg, Vikhroli), R south (Kandivli, Borivli), and R north (Dahisar). A total of 61 of 656 spots could witness ‘high’ flooding probability (2-3 foot depth), another 139 spots may experience ‘moderate’ flooding (1-2 foot depth) while 383 areas could witness ‘low’ probability (less than 1 foot depth). According to IMD’s impact-based forecast for Wednesday’s orange alert indicated water-logging in many parts of low lying areas and river banks, localised and short term disruption to municipal services such as water, electricity etc., major disruption of traffic flow with roads and local trains affected, and possibility of collapse of tree fall incidents. The weather bureau suggested action in the form of proper regulation of traffic and restricted movement of citizens in affected areas, especially low-lying zones.Independent meteorologists said maximum rain could occur between Wednesday evening and Friday morning with highest rain accumulation expected over north Mumbai suburbs, Thane and Palghar districts. “Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected, which has a potential to cause water logging and disruptions. Necessary alerts need to be issued for Wednesday to Friday,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.Waterlogging was reported in Parel, Matunga, King Circle, Sion, Andheri, Bandra, Chembur, Govandi, Wadala, Kurla and Dadar for a couple of hours on Tuesday. While some of the routes of Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses were diverted, suburban railways remained uninterrupted.BMC received eight complaints of tree or branch falling from various parts of the city, four complaints of short circuits and two wall collapse complaints. No one was injured in either of the incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-gets-over-98-of-july-rain-in-14-days/story-SM5jwUrfPnfeZv74ZTRv1I.html

15-07-2020||City||With over 100 cases traced to cloth market, Ambala SDM orders closure on alternate days||With over 100 of the total 658 Covid-19 cases in Ambala City being traced to the cloth market, sub-divisional magistrate Gauri Midha on Tuesday ordered the closure of the market on alternate days. The market, which has nearly 1,000 shops spreading across the old cloth market, Maharaja Agrasen Chowk and Kalka Chowk, is said to be one of the biggest in Asia, having an annual turnover of around Rs 2,000 crore. It provides employment to over 11,000 people, many of who frequently travel to different states, including Delhi, for business. The first case from this market was detected on June 29, when a merchant tested positive. Subsequently, over 100 cases were traced to this chain. On Tuesday alone, at least 16 of the 46 fresh cases in Ambala City were those having a link to the cloth market.The administration started segregating patients connected to the cloth market on July 11 and found at least 76 cases from here.“The chain started with a 60-year-old merchant. We can’t tell the exact number of patients from this chain but we are sure that the number is more than 100,” said deputy civil surgeon Sanjiv Singla.Hinting at the merchants, civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh said, “We have come to know that several people are hiding their travel or contact history. By doing so, they are only putting their lives and that of their families at risk.”On reports that many merchants refused to give their samples, Vishal Batra of the Ambala cloth market welfare association said, “Many were of the view that if they give samples that turn out to be positive, their shops will be sealed for 28 days. But the SDM clarified and told us that the particular shop will be closed for 2-3 days only for sanitisation purpose or till the test reports arrive. We’ve informed all the members and will now expect compliance to the guidelines of health department.”BREAKING THE CHAINAs per the order issued on Tuesday, Shukal Kund Road, General Merchant Market shall remain closed on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays while Pooja Wholesale Complex shall remain closed on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays until further notice.

The decision was announced by Maharasthra Congress chief Balasahebeb Thorat in a press statement. The move came after Sanjay Jha put out a series of tweets in support of Pilot. “For five years, Sachin Pilot gave his blood, tears, toil and sweat for the Congress party between 2013-18. The Congress came back from a wretched 21 seats to 100. We just gave him a performance bonus. We are so meritocratic. We are so transparent.”“There is a simple solution to the Rajasthan conundrum: Sachin Pilot should be made CM, Mr Ashok Gehlot (already 3 time CM) must be given a senior organisational role to revive weak states. A new leader appointed as head of RPCC. Where there’s a will there is a way,” Jha tweeted.Jha was recently sacked as party spokesperson after he criticised the party leadership in an article.According to Congress leaders in Maharashtra, Jha was suspended by the state unit on directions from the disciplinary committee of the All India Congress Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-suspends-sanjay-jha-for-backing-pilot/story-rM7sbCn1J7w6se3fgYhGOO.html

Testing has gone up by 2,000 to 3,000 samples every day, and cases are coming down…,” said Chahal, who was appointed civic chief in May, when the pandemic was peaking in Mumbai. On opening up local trains and malls for Mumbaiites, Chahal said the decision would be taken based on cases in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). “If the situation in MMR is akin to what the situation is in Mumbai today, I would immediately recommend opening up of malls and gyms,” said the BMC chief, adding that Mumbai “does not have a lockdown in the real sense anymore”.“Every two-wheeler and four-wheeler is allowed to come on the road… Mumbai has allowed 100% shops to remain open in a 48-hour cycle… On an average, we have a crore people on the roads every day, so it cannot be called a lockdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tests-increasing-cases-dipping-a-good-sign-for-mumbai-bmc-chief/story-D2qoV865jNmO95Yc7fa3DL.html

However, the prosecution objected to their contentions, stating that the value of the properties, which were submitted as security, was far less than shown. The court rejected the bail plea after considering arguments from both sides.Meanwhile, lawyers of Rakesh Wadhawan, who recently tested positive for Covid-19, had pleaded to the court to consider his health before issuing an order. They had also moved an application to transfer him to a private hospital from GT Hospital, a government facility, where he is currently admitted.Police officials informed the court that Rakesh was first taken to JJ Hospital, but as it did not have a Covid-19 ward, he was transferred to GT Hospital.His lawyer, Subodh Desai, on Tuesday argued that Rakesh has been suffering from several serious ailments, including gastrointestinal bleeding. The lawyer requested the court for a report from GT Hospital, clarifying if they have all the facilities to treat his illnesses. The court asked for a report from GT Hospital and has scheduled the next hearing for Wednesday.Rakesh and Sarang were booked by the economic offence wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police after they defaulted on repayment of a loan taken from PMC Bank. The two allegedly conspired with senior bank officials to secure the loan without proper security. After the EOW case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED), too, initiated a probe into money laundering allegations against the duo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-fraud-pmla-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-rakesh-and-sarang-wadhawan/story-lx3qg0n3BBRSF5B9odtmaI.html

15-07-2020||City||Waldhuni turns red again due to industrial effluents: Residents||The residents of Yogidham Complex in Kalyan (West), on Tuesday complained of Waldhuni river water turning red due to untreated industrial effluents. The residents of the society, near the banks of Waldhuni river took to social media and posted pictures of the polluted river water.Vinod Shirwadkar, 45, member of Waldhuni Swachhta Samiti, said, “Some industries in the area are discharging untreated effluents. The pollution control board should inspect take action. Earlier in March, we had decided to stage a protest against such industries, but due to lockdown, we called it off. If this continues to happen, we will be forced to protest in the coming days.”This is the second time the river water colour has changed during the lockdown period. Earlier on May 13, the river had turned red, followed by which Ulhasnagar Citizens Forum, a residents’ body complained to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).In May, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) had issued notice to the Badlapur Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) directing them to respond within 48 hours about the source of the pollution, and that the CETP had failed in curtailing effluents.Pushpa Ratnaparkhi, president of the Waldhuni Swachhta Samiti said, “We have been fighting against the pollution of Waldhuni river since the past seven years. Although the authorities took action after the complaint, there has not been any remarkable change. The pollution control board should figure out what is causing the red colour of the water.”The activists have claimed that the Waldhuni river meets the Ulhas river, which provides drinking water to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). However, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) have refuted the claims.“The Waldhuni river is a tributary of Ulhas river and it meets the river at Ambivli, Kalyan. The river has been a victim to pollution for almost 20 years. Industries across Kalyan, Ambernath and Badlapur have been discharging untreated effluents into the river, and the authority has failed to take major steps to control it,” said Shashikant Dayma, founder of Waldhuni Biradari, an NGO that has been fighting against the pollution in Waldhuni river, since the past four years.MPCB, regional officer, Shankar Waghmare, said, “We have received a complaint about the Waldhuni river water turning red. Our team will check on this and take necessary action. Earlier, we had warned a CETP and had sent a notice. We will find out the cause of the change in colour. However, the Waldhuni river does not meet the drinking water zone of Ulhas river at all, so there is no chance of pollution in the drinking water. It meets the Ulhas creek directly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/waldhuni-turns-red-again-due-to-industrial-effluents-residents/story-YJcCsbEnW4MkVALwo10GdJ.html

15-07-2020||Mumbai||Scrap political reservations, says Prakash Ambedkar||Bahujan Samaj Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar has demanded ending of political reservations for the members of Scheduled Classes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections.His said, the said reservations have outlived their utility and those getting elected on these reserved seats have become slaves of political parties. He, however, said that reservations in jobs and education should continue as it is a fundamental right.The said reservation was introduced to ensure representation for the members of SC and ST in the parliament and state assemblies. Here some seats are kept reserved where only members of the SC and ST are allowed to contest.“The political reservation should be scrapped as it serves no purpose. Those getting elected on these reserved seats have become slaves of various political parties and instead of serving the people, they spend their time in serving their political masters,” said Prakash. “It is being seen that even other caste voters tend to vote for SC and ST candidates in the general seats and in such a scenario, scrapping is best,” he added. However, he said neither BJP nor the Congress will support this as it allows them to exploit the situation.He said in 1954 his own grandfather, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar who is referred as the architect of Indian constitution had himself called for scrapping this provision. However, other political parties have opposed this view. “If we scrap this reservation, members of SC and ST will never be able get elected to the parliament or assemblies. The other castes still don’t vote for us,” said Avinash Mhatekar, former state minister and Republican Party of India (A) leader. He said instead parties like VBA and RPI should become formidable force to get their members elected to these seats.Senior Dalit leader Jogendra Kawade, who heads the Peoples Republican Party, agrees that many of the representatives have become slaves but opposes scrapping. “At least now, these communities are getting some representation due to the reservation which will become negligible if it is done way away with,” said Kawade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/scrap-political-reservations-says-prakash-ambedkar/story-d7qyLFDwL3hoCbAYnBDTTN.html
15-07-2020||Gurugram||Private labs in city seek permission to start Covid-19 antigen, antibody tests||archana.mishra@hindustantimes.com After Delhi, where private labs have been allowed to conduct antigen tests in addition to RT-PCR tests, the Gurugram health department is considering to adopt a similar approach to further ramp up Covid-19 testing capacity in the city. Four private labs have sought permission to carry out serology testing for Covid-19, including both antibody and antigen tests. Each of these labs have also shared their proposed rates for conducting the tests, ranging from ₹600 to ₹1,450 for each sample.“A letter has been sent to the state health department regarding the proposed rates for Covid-19 antigen and antibody tests. It is important to put a price cap if private labs and hospitals are allowed to carry such tests. Like Delhi, hospitals in the city that are coordinating with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved laboratories too can start with testing once the state health department approves the proposed price packages,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO). According to officials of the district health department, the proposed rates for antibody tests range between ₹600 and ₹1,450 per sample. The same for antigen test range between ₹500 and ₹950 per sample. Only one of the four labs has proposed ₹4,500 for the tests — the highest so far. In their letter to the state health department, the district health officials has suggested a price cap of ₹1,000 for an IgG antibody Elisa test and ₹800 for an antigen test. Currently, both the tests are being conducted by the officials of the district health department. While antigen tests are being conducted in large outbreak areas of the city, antibodies tests are being conducted as a part of an ongoing serological survey. The first round of serological survey started in June 24. A plan for the second round is currently being worked out by the district health department. The city, on an average, is conducting around 2,000 tests per day. The antigen tests look for a specific protein associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus — the pathogen that causes Covid-19. The tests are highly specific, which means that a positive test result would be considered as true positive, while a negative test would require an RT-PCR test. In the antibody test, on the other hand, blood samples are collected to check for antibodies which appear after a person has been infected with coronavirus and stays in the body for months. This test is typically conducted to find out unreported cases of Covid-19. A senior health department official, privy to the matter, confirmed that the department has received requests from four private labs in the city to carry out the tests.“But we first need to develop a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure that the ICMR guidelines are followed by private labs,” said the official, on condition of anonymity. Although the private labs refused to comment on the matter, saying that they are awaiting approval from the state government, a representative from one of the four labs said a few decisions have to be taken by the government before it can approve the labs to carry out the tests. The ICMR has advised states to use antigen kits for detection of the virus in hot spots and containment zones. As per the guidelines, symptomatic people with influenza-like illness, asymptomatic patients who are high-risk contacts of confirmed cases, people with co-morbidities, and high-risk patients who are either hospitalised or seeking hospitalisation are to be given importance for testing. The SOP to be prepared the health department will have to take into account the ICMR guidelines before an approval can be granted. In Delhi, hospitals are currently allowed to conduct antigen tests on the similar lines as the RT-PCR tests. A prescription from the registered doctor is mandatory along with an ICMR-form that needs to be filled in by the doctor. A government identity proof is mandatory for testing. In the national Capital, most hospitals are accepting walk-ins for tests, provided there is a valid prescription. In case if a person does not have a prescription, he or she can visit the flu clinic set up by the hospital. A doctor will carry out the necessary investigation before prescribing a test. Delhi government has fixed the antigen test cost around ₹1,000 per test, lower than the RT-PCR which costs around ₹2,400.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/private-labs-in-city-seek-permission-to-start-covid-19-antigen-antibody-tests/story-tv822hTVJIuISbSplX0NSP.html

15-07-2020||Mumbai||6,741 fresh cases up state tally to 267,665||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case count on Tuesday reached 267,665 after 6,741 new infections were recorded on Tuesday —a slight increase after two days of fewer new cases. The state has 107,665 active cases, according to the state health department. The death toll of the state touched 10,695 after 213 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours, health officials said.Health experts said that fluctuation in daily new cases is normal unless the drop stays for over 10 days. “In a pandemic, fluctuation in number of cases keeps happening. It is significant only if cases continue to drop for over 10 days. In that scenario, the change can be interpreted,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading the communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state.The number of fresh cases in Mumbai dropped below the 1,000 mark on Tuesday — second-lowest in 63 days — at 954. The city’s count now stands at 95,100. Of them, active cases are 22,773. Mumbai’s toll stands at 5,405 after 70 more deaths were reported.Meanwhile, state health minister Rajesh Tope said they are expecting a flattening of the curve soon. “We are working in mission mode to control the pandemic. Many cities have again imposed lockdown. Going by the pattern in New York and European countries, flattening of the curve in the state should start soon. However, no one can say by when cases will start declining,” Tope said.The number of recovered patients across the state also increased close to 1.5 lakh after 4,500 recovered and were discharged from various hospitals in the past 24 hours. Their tally is 149,007. The recovery rate of the state has improved to 55.67%, against the national recovery rate of 63.02%.The spike in the viral outbreak has forced several civic bodies to reimpose lockdown restrictions in a bid to flatten the curve. Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, and Navi Mumbai, which are a part of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), have extended re-imposed lockdown restrictions until July 19, while Ulhasnagar and Panvel have extended the lockdown till July 22 and July 24 respectively. Nine cities of MMR has got 1,64,320 cases, which contributes to 61.39% in the total cases. Apart from Mumbai, the other cities in MMR are Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Mira-Bhayander, Ulhasnagar, Panvel, Vasai-Virar and Bhiwandi-Nizampur. Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur and Aurangabad municipal corporations have also reimposed lockdown restrictions. Latur city, too, has declared to impose 15-day strict lockdown that will come in force from July 15 midnight. In the urban areas of Nashik, night curfew has been imposed from 7 pm to 5am from July 2.On Tuesday, Pune found 1,139 new cases, more than Mumbai’s. It also has highest number of cases —30,751 — after Mumbai, while Pimpri Chinchwad, Solapur, Aurangabad and Latur city has reported 541, 103, 175 and 21 new cases respectively.Districts such as Raigad have also announced lockdown restrictions starting from Wednesday (July 15). Besides, Nanded, Osmanabad and Jalna are currently in lockdown. Nanded is in eight-day lockdown, starting from July 12, Osmanabad is in seven-day lockdown starting from July 13 and Jalna is in 10-day lockdown, which started from July 5 midnight. Satara district administration has also decided to impose a six-day lockdown ,starting July 17.Raigad, Nanded, Osmanabad and Jalna districts have 4,616, 411, 410 and 1,084 Covid-19 cases. Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Beed districts had also re-imposed lockdown restrictions for about eight to 10 days in early July. Currently, they have 916, 262 and 241 infections respectively. Along with spike in cases, the state is also facing a large number of deaths on a daily basis. In the past 14 days (since July 1), it has recorded 2,689 Covid casualties.With 10,482 deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded at 4.02% on Monday. It is second-highest in the country after Gujarat, where CFR is 4.81% with 2,055 deaths (42,722 cases) till Monday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Maharashtra still has highest number of deaths across states in the country. “To bring down Covid deaths, we have started conducting antigen tests in containment zones and that too in large numbers. Antigen tests provided reports in just half an hour. If tests come negative and the patients has Covid symptoms, then we also conduct RT-PCR tests to confirm whether the patients is negative or not. This is helping in providing early treatment to the patients,” the health minister said.He said that they have also increased number of laboratories to 110 and have directed all of them to utilise fullest capacity. On the shortage of health infrastructure to deal with rise in cases, he said that this needs to be augmented only in cities of MMR. “We have built field hospitals in Mumbai and building more in MMR cities. For rest of the state, we have no shortage of beds. We are concerned only about ICU beds as we may face their shortage in future if cases rise further. We are working to augment them, but as of now there is no such shortage,” the health minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/6-741-fresh-cases-up-state-tally-to-267-665/story-aM9wj9aiIFDgGUPL7YL7EN.html
15-07-2020||City||Haryana may impose curbs in districts bordering Delhi, says health minister||Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Tuesday said the state government was planning to impose curbs in the districts bordering Delhi. “Majority of the Haryana cases are concentrated in Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Jhajjar. So, we are discussing imposing restrictions to contain the spread of the virus. We will go ahead after considering all aspects,” he added.Talking to reporters in Ambala, Vij said Haryana’s recovery rate is over 75 per cent, which is quite good. He added that adequate arrangements — including isolation facilities, doctors, medicines had been made to deal with the infection, which was growing at a rapid rate.“Our priority is to treat these patients with the best of resources at our disposal. Still, the cases which are increasing, these are going up in districts adjoining Delhi. “Eighty per cent of our total cases come from these districts (Gurgaon, Faridabad, Sonipat, Jhajjar). If need arises, in the interest of Haryana, if we have to impose stricter curbs to contain spread of infection we will not hesitate to do so,” said Vij.When asked if the state government could impose lockdown and other stricter measures in the worst-affected areas, Vij replied, “in Haryana’s interest, whatever is required to be done, I will do that.” Gurugram till Tuesday had reported 160 new cases of Covid-19 cases, taking the total tally of infections to 7,126. Of the total number of cases, 1,085 cases are currently active — slightly up from Monday’s tally of 1,051 cases. While 20 of them are currently hospitalised, 732 patients are recovering under home isolation. A total of 214 patients are under observation at various district Covid centres and dedicated Covid healthcare centres.As per the data, until Tuesday evening, more than 70% (15,923) of Haryana’s cumulative number of positive cases (22,628) were from Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Rohtak districts.Similarly, at least 57% (2,996) of the total active cases (5,226) are also in these four NCR districts. The district on Tuesday also recorded 124 new recoveries — down from 80 the previous day. This takes the district’s cumulative recovery rate to 83%. Gurugram also recorded two new deaths on Tuesday, taking the toll to 109.The mortality rate in the district is nearly 1.5%.Gurugram on Tuesday also collected 2,502 new samples for testing, up from 2,300 samples collected on Monday. Of these, 521 samples were taken by private labs for RT-PCR tests, while the rest of the samples were taken for the antigen tests being conducted by the health department. The district’s test-positivity rate (TPR) on Tuesday stood at 7%. The TPR has been hovering between 7% and 9% for the past two weeks now, said district health department officials.“However, at around 11%, we are seeing a much higher TPR in Sohna, more than the urban areas of Gurugram,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram(CMO). He added that antigen testing in Sohna would be scaled up in the next two days, with the intention of isolating as many positive cases as possible. “Things are coming under control in other parts of the district, but large outbreak regions (LORs) will need to be kept under close watch for another couple of weeks at least,” he said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-may-impose-curbs-in-districts-bordering-delhi-says-health-minister/story-11dALfSxzi9wNISauDAzWN.html

The proposed highway is expected to be completed by December 2022 at a cost of ₹1,524 crore. The highway, on National Highway 352 (NH-352), will be part of a 132-km road that will connect Gurugram with the state border with Rajasthan beyond Narnaul.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which will construct the highway, is slated to spend close to ₹4500 crore on the entire project, of which ₹2300 crore is expected to be spent on acquisition of largely agricultural lands.“Farmers will get this amount of money. In this time of the coronavirus outbreak, availability of funds will boost economic activities in the regions around the area. The upcoming logistics hub coming up in Mahendragarh will also get the benefit of this highway, as access will become much easier,” said NHAI chairperson Sukhbir Singh Sandhu.The Union minister of state for statistics and programme implementation and Gurugram MP, Rao Inderjit Singh, put forth certain requests before Gadkari via video conferencing on Tuesday, namely the urgent requirement to construct flyovers on this stretch at Bilaspur, Kapadivas and Bawal, as well as at IMT Manesar, areas which form part of the arterial Delhi-Jaipur Highway. Gadkari responded saying that the matters, particularly that of building an elevated road at IMT Manesar, would be “taken up soon”.On Tuesday, Gadkari also inaugurated three road projects in Haryana, including a four-lane road from Rohana and Hasangarh to Jhajjar, a four lane road form the Haryana-Punjab border to Jind, and a two-lane road from Jind to Karnal. Apart from this, he also laid the foundation stone for seven other road projects including a six-lane access control road from Ismailabad to Narnaul, a four-lane road from Rewari to Atteli Mandi, a six-lane road from Atelli Mandi to Narnaul. a four-lane road from Jind to Gohana and another from Sonipat to Gohana, and yet another four-lane road from the Haryana-Uttar Pradesh border to Rohana. The cost of all these projects is estimated at ₹2027 crores, as per a Tuesday press release issued by the district administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/foundation-stone-of-1-500-crore-highway-between-gurugram-rewari-laid/story-bOAac94vOewFip9ojNSVXP.html
15-07-2020||Chandigarh||Doctor booked for sexually harassing nurse on Covid duty in P’kula hospital||A doctor believed to be under the influence of alcohol was booked by police for allegedly sexually harassing a nurse on Covid-19 duty at the Civil Hospital in Sector 6, Panchkula on Saturday. There was high drama at the hospital on Tuesday as the nurse’s colleagues roughed him up while an inquiry was being conducted against him.Dr Manoj Kumar, a psychiatrist, appeared to be under the influence of alcohol when he assaulted the 26-year-old nurse. He was sent on “deputation” for 60 days by authorities.However, as the hospital dragged its feet in acting against the doctor, the Haryana State Commission For Women said it was not satisfied with the hospital’s probe.Kamaljeet Kaur, president, Panchkula Nurses Association said Kumar came to the Covid-19 isolation ward on Saturday night, at around 12 midnight. She alleged he was drunk. As a staff nurse checked machines he sat there for 10 minutes and then called her to a nursing room asking for her help to see how the machines worked.“As she went inside the room, he tried to bolt it. When she resisted, he assaulted her, tried to remove her mask and forced himself on her. She pushed him away and ran to the intensive care unit, where she informed others and called the chief medical officer (CMO), principal medical officer (PMO) and nursing in-charge,” Kaur said.However, when the officials reached the spot they let Dr Kumar leave without testing him for alcohol consumption and did not inform the police, Kaur alleged. “We waited for two days for the authorities to take action. As most of the senior authorities of the hospital are women, we were hopeful that they would take immediate action, but were left disappointed.”The victim’s aunt too asked for action against Dr Kumar, saying, “On Monday we held a meeting with the CMO, PMO and others. They were very polite, but did not take any action. As we protested the doctor was doing his duty in the OPD.”Dr Manoj didn’t revert to calls or texts. No case registered at hospital’s police post When the victim went to the hospital’s police post to register a case on Monday afternoon, “personnel over there refused to do so and asked us to go to the women’s police station, where an FIR was registered at night,” her aunt said.She added that the victim had been sent by the hospital on three-day leave and had mentioned in the FIR that she feared a threat to her life. They then filed a complaint with the women’s commission. “An FIR was registered against the doctor (at the women’s police station) under section 354 A of the Indian Penal Code on Monday night. Today, the statement of the victim was recorded in front of the magistrate and we are investigating the case,” said assistant commissioner of police, Noopur Bishnoi.The doctor has not been taken into custody and his statement is yet to be recorded.Commenting on the matter, Dr Jasjeet Kaur, CMO, Panchkula, said: “A report of the internal committee (ICC) has been submitted to the director general, health services (DGHS) and the doctor has been sent out of the district on deputation. Police are also conducting a parallel inquiry.”She said the report had also been sent to the women’s commission, which had summoned the health authorities.When asked why the police was not informed on Saturday, the night of the assault, the CMO said, “Matters of harassment are first enquired into by the ICC.Second probe marked against nurses who attacked the doctorThe DGHS, Dr SB Kamboj, said in the meanwhile that even as the harassment case was being probed, a “second enquiry would be conducted against those who took law in their hands” and beat up the doctor.When asked to comment, Preeti Bhardwaj, vice chairman of the women’s commission said the panel was not satisfied with the report submitted by the hospital authorities on the case.“The incident happened on Saturday night and no action was taken for two days. There was a very casual approach by the CMO and PMO of the health department,” she said.“They submitted the report today, whose subject was ‘misbehaviour’ with staff nurse. In the report they ‘prima facie found the doctor guilty’ of the allegations. The report as such was a little vague and even I could not decipher it,” Bhardwaj said.“The situation is worrisome and I am not satisfied with the report. Clarifications will be required,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/doctor-booked-for-sexually-harassing-nurse-on-covid-duty-in-p-kula-hospital/story-aS4SkQC6pCYyp5qTx2IsVI.html

15-07-2020||Delhi||86% of India’s Covid-19 cases confined to 10 states, says govt assessment||The number of Covid-19 cases may be going up, but 86% of the total cases are confined to 10 states, officials on the Union health ministry said on Tuesday, citing government statistics. Of these, just two states -- Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu -- account for about 50% of the cases. Other high disease burden states include Karnataka, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal and Gujarat.Rajesh Bhushan, officer on special duty, health ministry, also spoke on the need to increase Covid-19 testing, which he said was being done across the country. “Scaling up testing, along with focus on strict implementation of containment measures and improved clinical management of the disease, is the key to check the spread of Covid-19,” Bhushan said.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayIndia has performed 10.2 million Covid-19 tests so far since January 22, with 1,206 laboratories approved for Covid-19 testing across the country.“The more you test, the more number of people you will be able to track and treat. It is the only way to check the spread of Covid-19. Ramping up testing is important and we have come a long way since the start of the outbreak,” Dr Lalit Kant, former head, epidemiology, ICMR, said.The health ministry official also spoke on the pending results of Delhi’s sero surveillance -- a blood test done to check the presence of antibodies that determine a past infection due to Sars Cov-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “Sero surveys are fairly complex exercises and, therefore, they by definition take time. In the case of Delhi, originally, it was decided that for the sero surveillance we would collect 20,000 samples between June 27 and July 5, but eventually, the sero surveillance ended up collecting 22,823 samples. These are blood samples which are then subjected to ELISA (is a plate-based assay technique) tests. Now that the testing has finished, we are doing the stratification -- gender wise, district wise and age wise, among others -- of the data and analysis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/86-of-india-s-cases-confined-to-10-states-says-govt-assessment/story-nwOqUhcbpJH737x9Sh8Z6L.html
15-07-2020||Delhi||Beds empty in private hospitals as Delhi builds Covid capacity||Nearly three of every four hospital beds earmarked for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are lying unused in the city, according to the government’s Delhi Corona app, which stakeholders say is adding to the financial burden of private hospitals.As on Tuesday, Delhi had 15,330 beds earmarked for Covid-19, including 125 operation beds at the field hospital set up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, of which 11,236 are vacant, according to the app.“Almost all big hospitals in the city have dedicated Covid-19 beds. With the number of cases going down and the government strengthening its own facilities—such as setting up a new 1,000-bed hospital in Dhaula Kuan—maybe it is time to start rolling back these Covid-19 beds in smaller hospitals. These hospitals can then start focussing on non-Covid treatment. Once that happens, the bigger hospitals with more critical care Covid-19 beds will receive more patients, helping them financially as well,” Dr Harsh Mahajan, co-chair, FICCI health services committee and the founder of Mahajan Imaging, said.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayAt the same time, Dr Mahajan cautioned, “We cannot roll back everything at once, there need to be buffer beds to ensure patients can receive treatment in case there is a surge in cases again. Most hospitals now have isolation facilities that can be quickly earmarked for Covid-19 again, in case the need arises.”Hospitals say a price cap by the Delhi government on 60% of beds in the third week of June is adding to the problem. The Delhi government had capped Covid-19 treatment rates at Rs8,000 (non-NABH-accredited hospitals) and Rs10,000 (NABH-accredited hospitals, including entry-level facilities) per day for an isolation bed, and Rs13,000-15,000 per day for a bed at an intensive care unit (ICU), and Rs15,000-18,000 per day for an ICU bed with a ventilator.“For private sector hospitals, patient load reduced to about 20% of their usual numbers during the lockdown, which ate away into their revenues. Treating Covid-19 patients was a fresh revenue channel for them. In fact, some hospitals managed to generate a positive EBITDA (Earnings Before Interests, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation is a measure of a company’s current profitability). Then, the government capped the prices. This will again impact the revenue that hospitals can generate. For patients in need of minimal monitoring, the rates are okay, but for ICU patients, the cap price should have been at least Rs25,000 because hospitals have to bear a cost of two or three times more than the number of usual staff (as quarantine norms have to be followed), not to mention the additional cost of PPE kits, etc.,” said Girdhar Gyani, director-general of Association of Healthcare Providers (India) or AHPI, which has at least 10,000 hospitals as its member across 33 states and Union Territories.Treating the insured“Insurance associations have also started arm-twisting smaller hospitals into accepting the same capped prices that the government negotiated for cash-paying patients. This should not be done as their rates are pre-negotiated. We have reached out to the government regarding the same because it defeats the whole purpose of cross-subsidy and will further strain the private hospitals,” Gyani said. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The Delhi government spokesperson refused to comment despite repeated calls and messages.A doctor from the private sector, who did not want to be named, said, “The central government committee had suggested capping the prices for 60% of Covid-19 beds. However, the Delhi government order caps the prices for 60% of the total beds in a hospital. This means the lower prices apply to almost all patients—this includes those paying cash as well as those insured. Insurance companies have pre-negotiated rates with hospitals, and with the government capping in place, even the companies have declared they want to follow the same prices. The hospitals will have to then stop honouring the insurance and promise of cashless treatment.”“The insurance companies are anyway making profits, with very few people going to hospitals at the moment, but hospitals are actually cash-strapped. Treating a Covid-19 patient is costing hospitals more than they are making,” the doctor said.Also read: 86% of India’s Covid-19 cases confined to 10 states, says govt assessmentSubhash Khuntia, Chairperson, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, countered, “When a government gives an order that a certain rate has to be followed across the state, it is applicable to all patients whether they are paying by cash or through insurance. However, we suggested that the insurance companies negotiate prices with the hospital for Covid-19 management as a group. Initially, doctors and hospitals were unaware about how to manage Covid-19 patients, leading to difficulties in fixing rates. Now, I think everyone is in a better position to do so. I think, the hospitals should agree to a fair price so that they remain sustainable and but do not overcharge either.”Bigger hospitals such as Sir Ganga Ram are better off. “The number of patients dipped significantly during the lockdown; now it is slowly increasing with people becoming less scared of the infection. With interstate travel resuming, I think the numbers will go up further. The hospital needs an occupancy of about 70% to break even; we are currently at 60% probably. But even with prices capped, Covid-19 patients are bringing in some revenue. And, it is our national duty to serve. Hopefully, the situation will get better in the next few months,” Dr DS Rana, chairman, board of management, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said.Beds neededAnother committee set up by the Delhi government in early June had estimated that there would be about 100,000 cases by the end of June, of which about 60,000 would be active (people living with the infection). Assuming the rate of hospitalisation would be 25%, the committee had estimated Delhi would need 15,000 hospitals beds—most equipped with oxygen and ventilators—by the end of June.But the number of hospitalisations in Delhi has remained between 20% and 25% of the active cases in Delhi.“It is a very good thing that we did not need as many hospital beds as were anticipated by the committee based on the trends of early June. Delhi is currently in a comfortable position. However, unused beds are definitely a financial burden for private hospitals. At the time when these beds were being converted to isolation facilities, the government had anticipated that all of them would be used and the private sector would earn from them too. But the lack of patients is a problem for them,” Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council and one of the members of the committee that had estimated the infrastructure need for managing Covid-19 patients at the beginning of June, said.“Having said that, we cannot start going back on the preparations that have been made immediately, as there is a possibility the cases might go up again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/beds-empty-in-private-hospitals-as-delhi-builds-covid-capacity/story-NnIiSHkNPCUe8y0KtqABGI.html
15-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s second plasma bank inaugurated at Lok Nayak hospital||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday inaugurated the city’s second convalescent plasma bank at Delhi’s biggest treatment facility for patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19)—the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital.The Delhi government had opened the country’s first plasma bank at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj on July 2. Another plasma bank which is yet to start operating is at the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, the biggest hospital in the trans-Yamuna region. It has been converted into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“Today, Lok Nayak hospital started plasma collection. Till the time a vaccine is developed, plasma will help save lives. I am not saying that it can save 100% of the people, but it can save some lives. And, it had a role in reducing Delhi’s death rate as well. One of the benefits of having the bank in Lok Nayak hospital is that it is located at the centre of the city and it will be easier for people to come here and donate,” Kejriwal said while visiting the plasma bank on Tuesday morning.Convalescent plasma therapy uses the blood component plasma — rich in virus-fighting antibodies from patients who have recovered from the infection — to aid the immune system of Covid-19 patients. It is still an experimental therapy that has been approved by the health ministry for use in patients whose need for oxygen increases despite providing oxygen support and steroids.Also read: Beds empty in private hospitals as Delhi builds Covid capacityUnlike the centre at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, plasma received at Lok Nayak hospital will be used for its own patients to ensure that more people receive the therapy at the hospital.“The plasma will be used for treating patients at the hospital. We have many sick patients and we need to serve the poor. So far, we were providing the therapy only under a clinical trial. Now, with the apheresis machine and bank in place, we will be able to provide the therapy to more patients, even outside the trial. Having an in-house bank will also mean that we will not have to wait to get the plasma from ILBS and can administer it to patients as and when needed” Dr Suresh Kumar, the medical director of Lok Nayak hospital, said.Also read: 86% of India’s Covid-19 cases confined to 10 states, says govt assessmentThe hospital has so far provided the therapy only to 60 patients, including the 29 patients who were administered the therapy under the COPLA I trial whose results prompted the government to set up the bank. The initial trial had shown an improved respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and organ failure score in patients who received the convalescent plasma. Their duration of stay in the intensive care unit, as well as the hospital, also went down.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The hospital has one apheresis machine—a device to separate the blood components—that can collect plasma from eight to ten donors in a day. “We are planning to run it round the clock later to ensure about 15 to 20 donations a day. Plus, one unit of plasma donated by a recovered patient can be used for two sick patients,” Dr Kumar said.The hospital has already discharged over 3,600 Covid-19 patients, many of whom are eligible to donate plasma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-second-plasma-bank-inaugurated-at-lok-nayak-hospital/story-Rb75TPj5CEgA2LEGAMJKeL.html

Earlier, in 100 tests, 35 used to test positive, whereas now only 7 or 8 people out of 100 are found to be positive. The number of fatalities due to Covid-19 has decreased. In mid-June, there were about 101 deaths per day but there are about 40 deaths now. All of us together have to reduce it further,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday at the inauguration of a plasma bank at Lok Nayak hospital.A clinical review committee should be set up to review and standardise care and clinical outcomes on a periodical basis, the advisory says.Real-time monitoring of oxygen saturation of all patients has to happen and steps need to be taken immediately if it drops, the guidelines say. Hospitals have been asked to standardise investigation protocol for all patients so that sampling does not remain incomplete as well as use tele-consultation services provided by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences for treating physicians.Also read: Beds empty in private hospitals as Delhi builds Covid capacityChecklists and charts should be maintained to ensure proper infection control.At the time of admission, patients’ oxygenation has to be monitored, they have to be triaged effectively with high priority being given to high-risk individuals such as the old, pregnant women, those who are immunosuppressed, cancer and transplant patients, and patients with comorbidities, the document says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-health-care-worker-for-monitoring-each-critical-covid-19-patient-says-govt-s-clinical-guidelines/story-FbUa0EmsGwloYmPHPo6EwL.html

15-07-2020||Noida||Crime graph dives as Noida police commissionerate completes 6 months||Noida police commissionerate — established on January 13 this year — completes six months in July with the department claiming to have brought about a significant reduction in crime, when compared to last year. The UP government had passed an order for the establishment of the commissionerate system in Gautam Budh Nagar and Lucknow in January this year. The Noida police had then divided the Gautam Budh Nagar district into three zones — Noida, Central Noida and Greater Noida — each headed by a deputy commissioner rank officer.“To handle crimes against women and children, a DCP (women’s safety) was appointed and to handle the traffic and crime situation, a DCP each, along with two joint commissioners, were appointed,” said Noida commissioner of police, Alok Singh.Police officials said that at the onset of the formation of the new system, there were 7,458 ongoing investigations. This number went up to 14,386 in the next six months. Of these, 9,405 cases (almost 65 %) have been concluded.The new system has also taken severe action against organised crime and known criminals in the district. Under section 14 of the gangster act, all movable and immovable assets of criminals obtained through fraudulent means can be attached. This power belonged to the district administration in the earlier system, but was transferred to the police commissioner after the formation of the new system.In the past two weeks, the police department has attached assets worth more than Rs 15 crore of known criminals, including properties and luxury vehicles. Notices have also been sent to 75 people under the Goonda act.According to data provided by the department, there has been a reduction of 172% in the number of cases of vehicle theft from 1,381 in 2019 to 507 this year, a reduction of 157% in rape cases from 54 (2019) to 21(this year), 109 % in loot cases from 94 (2019) to 45 (this year) and 100% reduction in dacoity and ransom based kidnappings.“There have been 59 encounters in the past six months, following which 115 criminals have been arrested, of whom 72 were injured. Four police personnel were also injured during these encounters,” said Singh.The department said it had also taken special steps for women safety. For this, mahila chaupals, in residential areas were organised earlier this year to address specific issues at local levels. A special call line was also set up under the ‘Dial 112’ programme, which is aimed at curbing domestic abuse cases. Police officials said that 804 such cases came to them of which 774 were sorted through first intervention, while 32 were provided additional help. A family dispute resolution centre was also established in Knowledge Park where counselling is also provided to victims. The special operations group (crime branch) and cyber cell division also boast of having cracked some major cases in the last six months.The new system also claims to have introduced upgrades in the Surajpur police lines, especially during the times of the Covid-19 pandemic. Six biometric dustbins have been installed at Surajpur, while official vehicles have been fitted with cameras and GPS systems to track movements to and from jails and courts. A special patrolling unit was formed for which 30 motorcycles were provided. Apart from this, the Bisrakh police station was also given 50 additional bikes to implement the beat policing system. A commando unit of 21 constables was also formed at the police lines to tackle emergency situations. The traffic department also underwent major improvements under the new system with the personnel getting 30 new motorbikes, fitted with loudspeakers, hooters, for traffic control. They also received six new cranes, two new SUVs, an ambulance and one hydraulic crane at the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. U-turns were also made at several points in the city to better regulate traffic such as at Hoshiyarpur T-junction, sector 50-51-72 crossing, DSC crossing, Hazipur underpass, labour chowk, DND toll etc. An additional inspector, three sub-inspectors and 100 traffic constables were added to the traffic force . The department has collected more than Rs 60 crore as fines for traffic related offences in the last six monthsCovid-19 outbreakThe new commissionerate has had its hands full in the last three months during the lockdown, especially owing to migrant movement. Teams from the commissionerate have helped people stuck in various parts of the district, sometimes even transporting medicines and other essentials to those in need.“We received nearly 1,500 calls per day in the starting phases of the lockdown from people looking for ration. With the help of 40 NGOs and civil society members, we managed to reach out to nearly 3 lakh people. Apart from this, the force also facilitated the return of more than two lakh migrants to their native places,” said Noida commissioner Alok Singh.The department later was roped in to help with contact tracing of patients and suspect cases. More than 1100 police personnel were deployed at various checkpoints constantly, with 30% of the force put on duty in containment zones. Even at the time of conception, senior officials had stressed on smart policing with the use new CCTV cameras, sensors, body cameras. Going with the concept, the force has started a virtual grievance redressal system for complainants to minimise human contact‘Beneficial system’Experts feel that with increasing population of Noida, the new commissionerate system will be extremely beneficial.“Noida is a growing city. All major cities around the world have the commissionerate system. There are specific officers to deal with specific problems of crime, traffic or intelligence. Whereas in the earlier system there was only one SSP. This is better because there is specialisation,” said Ajai Raj Sharma, former Delhi police commissioner.He also said that going forward more powers should be given to the commissioner so that they are better able to help the public.. “The commissionerate had been a demand of the residents for a while and it has been very benefecial to Noida. There is more police presence now. Six months is a very short time for them to be completely effective. But crime rate has already gone down and hopefully in the future also it keeps reducing,” said KK Jain, secretary general, Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/crime-graph-dives-as-noida-police-commissionerate-completes-six-months/story-RrnZIo0DwXK65wPZDPSPLL.html
15-07-2020||Delhi||Kushak drain yet to be desilted, could lead to waterlogging in south Delhi, say residents||Residents of south Delhi neighbourhoods such as South Extension and Defence Colony have alleged that the desilting of Kushak drain is yet to be completed even though the monsoon has already kicked in.They added that the drain is yet to be cleaned—they can see garbage floating in the nullah. They said that if the drain remains clogged, it will lead to a backflow of water into other drains that merge with it near Defence Colony, in case of heavy rainfall.Kushak drain is an approximately 6.5km-long stormwater drain near South Extension, which carries stormwater and sewage from several south Delhi localities, such as Mehrauli-Badarpur Road, Chirag Dilli, INA, Defence Colony and Pushp Vihar. It meets the Barapullah drain near Nizamuddin West and then flows into the Yamuna river.Manjeet Singh Chugh, a representative of the South Extension-1 Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA), said that the monsoon had arrived but the authorities had not yet desilted one of the major drains in south Delhi. “Garbage is floating in the drain and blocking the flow of water. Monsoon has arrived but the drain is yet to be cleaned. It is just a matter of time—with just one good spell of rain, there will be waterlogging in localities such as South Extension, Defence Colony, Pushp Vihar and others,” Chugh said. He added that till last year the drain was under the aegis of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), but earlier this year it was transferred to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). “Initially both authorities kept passing the buck over the desilting of Kushak drain, but now it’s clear that the SDMC has to perform the task. But hardly anything has been done,” Chugh said.Ranjeet Singh, the president of the Defence Colony RWA, said that he had written to SDMC several times to clean this drain but to no avail.“This drain was properly cleaned two years ago with the help of big machines; this year, the drain is yet to be cleaned. Last week, a few super sucker machines were deployed only for one day but the process was stopped and the drain remains clogged. The entire colony gets flooded with just two spells of rain because the drain is not clean. Desilting of drains is the primary job of the civic bodies and they fail to even do that,” Singh said.Abhishek Dutt, the councillor of SDMC from Andrews Ganj, said that he has been raising the issue of selective desilting for a long time but to no avail. “Many small and big drains, such as the Andrews Ganj and GK-1 drains, meet the Kushak drain near Defence Colony. If Kushak drain is not desilted properly then it may lead to heavy waterlogging in many south Delhi areas such as GK-1, Chirag Dilli, Gautam Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, Andrews Ganj, etc. because the water will flow back to tributary drains after heavy rainfall and lead to flooding,” Dutt said.A senior official of SDMC, however, said that the civic body has begun the desilting process, which would be completed soon. He said that the delay occurred due to the handing over of the drain from DDA to SDMC and also because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The completion of formalities took time plus the DDA had handed over the drain to us without desilting it. Above this, the pandemic has only made things worse. A significant portion of the drain has been cleaned and we hope that the process will be completed soon,” the official, who wished not to be named, said.Anamika Mithilesh, the mayor of SDMC, said, “Discouraging waterlogging in localities is the primary focus of the civic body. We have issued instructions to officials to clean the drain at the earliest to avoid any problem of flooding during rain in south Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kushak-drain-yet-to-be-desilted-could-lead-to-water-logging-in-south-delhi-say-residents/story-rIXzXWVduryDfYBQbyj1fP.html

I had to push hard to study for the two exams held in March first week,” he said.Ganpath Raj, principal of Mujeeb’s school in Jafrabad,, said, “Our students were taking exams when the communal riots broke out just outside our school. We escorted them out from the back gate. We had to convince parents to send their children for exams when CBSE resumed exams. We are so proud of our students. They performed so well in all the exams.”Meanwhile, some schools said that communal riots affected the performance of their students. Om Prakash, manager at MRL senior secondary school in Karawal Nagar, said, “Last year the highest score in our school was 97%. It has dropped to 96% this year even though we were expecting better results. Communal violence has definitely affected the performance of students.” At least 53 persons died while around 400 were injured in the riots that broke out in parts of North East Delhi. Delhi Police has filed at least 111 charge sheets so far in connection with the riots, in which they have named 650 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-from-riot-hit-north-east-delhi-shine-in-cbse-class-12-exams/story-zegXt4D7tM8FIkg9POkF7N.html

However, of 236 vehicle seizures, 190 were seized from Zone 1 of Pune police. “There is a lot of process involved this time because it is not a complete lockdown. It took up a lot of time to check the letters and permissions required. Each person at the nakabandi point has now been given list as to what is allowed and what needs to be checked. The violations were by people who came out of their houses even though they were aware that they were not supposed to. The reasons given by them were not justified in the order,” said Pornima Gaikwad, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-3 of Pune police.Swapna Gore, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-1 remained unavailable for comment.

15-07-2020||Pune||Pune comes to a standstill, again, with a hope to stop Covid-19 spread||Despite opposition, first day of the 10-day lockdown on Tuesday witnessed residents staying indoors and adhering to the administration’s restrictions in place to stop the spread of Covid-19. Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar announced a complete lockdown for the city so as to curb the increasing number of cases. Police vans and policemen were on the streets appealing to citizens to stay at home.The bustling Satara road, Pune-Mumbai old highway, Solapur road, Karve road, Ahmednagar road, Laxmi road, Deccan, Swargate, Shivajinagar, Kothrud, Sahakarnagar, Hadapsar, Kalyaninagar, Koregaon Park, Aundh and Baner wore a deserted look on Tuesday. Between 9am and 10am, traffic was witnessed on some roads, like Sancheti chowk near Shivajingar, as employees were making their to their offices.Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said, “Citizens cooperated with the administration on the first day of the lockdown in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. I appeal to citizens to come forward for testing, if having Covid-19 symptoms and to adhere to lockdown norms.”Police barricaded the entry points of the city to restrict outstation vehicles from entering the city. Only medical shops were open across the city. Santosh Konde, a resident of Khed Shivapur and Sagar Bhosale, a resident of Uruli, said, “It is very rare to see Pune come to a complete standstill again. On the Pune-Bengaluru and Solapur highway, only trucks were plying.”MIDC employees continue work in PCMCMaharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Bhosari, employee did not face any issues while commuting to their workplace on Tuesday.“Most of the industries have given their employees self-certified passes on their letterhead. Employees can travel in any area on a self-certified pass. Administration is supporting us completely,” said Sandeep Belsare, president of Pimpri-Chinchwad small-scale industries association.The traffic police were patrolling all roads and checking e-passes of all motorists.“In the morning, we caught some people who did not have a pass or letter from their office, so we penalised them. However, the number is very less as most of the people were carrying required documents,” said Satish Nandurkar, police Inspector at Bhosari.A few employees faced trouble while filling up fuel for their vehicles as fuel station owners were not accepting self-certified pass. “Some employees could not get their fuel tanks filled because of the self-certified pass, so we have spoken to the administration and it will be sorted out soon,” added Belsare.Most of the companies continued their work schedule, while a few were shut as they had not issued passes to their employees.“We started working on May 18 and although we are facing problems (five operative level personnel have gone to their hometowns), work has not stopped. The workers, who are available, will continue to come even during the lockdown,” said Pranav Belhekar, owner of PB Plastics, manufacturers and suppliers of plastic moulded components and assemblies.Belsare’s only concern was that the police had not been allowing movement of goods transport trucks and he has requested the administration for its permission.“We have requested movement of transport goods vehicles. We have also requested the administration to allow opening up of raw material supply shops in MIDC as it is very important for continuation of work,” added Balsare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-comes-to-a-standstill-again-with-a-hope-to-stop-covid-19-spread/story-91TctS7hreVUqAkYkquzRI.html
15-07-2020||Pune||39% of Pune’s total Covid-19 positives cases reported in last two weeks||According to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data, the city has reported 11,262 Covid-19 positive cases in two weeks (between June 28 and July 11), which amounts to about 39% of the total 28,375 cases (till July 13) recorded since March 9 when the infection was first reported. The rise in numbers has led to the administration reimposing a strict lockdown in the city, starting Tuesday. The civic body has also started using rapid antigen detection kits since the beginning of the month which has led to increased testing capacity for the civic body. Additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal tweeted, “As the number of cases in the past two weeks are rising, the civic body will now be focusing on identification of suspected patients, increase contact tracing and testing and increasing dedicated Covid-19 beds.” As per PMC data, the highest surge in the number of cases has been recorded in Warje, Karvenagar, Kothurd and Bavdhan, followed by Hadapsar, Mundhwa, Dhankawadi, Sahakarnagar and Kondhwa. Agarwal said, “The positivity ratio has remained the same. As the number of tests rises, proportionately the number of cases will also rise, but eventually as we start to isolate more people, the chain will break and then, the number of cases will fall drastically. The lockdown period will help us only if we test more and we are doing that. We are also increasing the contact tracing of every positive from 10 to 15 people.”Sanjay Dabhade, member of Jan Aarogya Manch, said, “The civic body must explain the rationality behind imposing the lockdown. If the PMC is in fact going to increase testing, then, they must also parallelly take care of the increase in the requirement of beds. I get calls daily about patients who need critical care, but are being shifted to casualty ward with oxygen treatment.”Meanwhile, in a letter to the state government, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has called upon the government to make it mandatory for discharged and cured patients to donate blood for plasma. The letter states, “The Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra state suggests the government of Maharashtra to make it mandatory for all the patients who got cured from the deadly disease, to donate blood for the plasma therapy. To facilitate this procedure, a mandatory undertaking can be taken from all the patients to report on the 15th day after the discharge or recovery. Thereafter, they will be tested for fitness for blood donation. A separate plasma bank may be formed for the procedure at every place with the help of the blood banks in the public as well as the private sector.”The letter states, “The government may make this procedure of blood donation for the plasma collection compulsory as per the provisions of the ‘Epidemic Act 1897 or a new Ordinance. We at IMA, Maharashtra state, strongly feel that the increased availability of plasma will not only improve the recovery rate of the Covid-19 patients, but also reduce the mortality in the state of Maharashtra.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/39-of-pune-s-total-covid-19-positives-cases-reported-in-last-two-weeks/story-Hk4WgfT5knnFLfRf49fekN.html

Sanjay Jagtap is a criminal. He has been arrested for attacking me in the past as well. There is a Mumbai-based builder who has hired these people to take control of our land. The watchman told us about these people’s arrival and Sunny reached the spot. I was not present there. If it is their land, they should present documents and take ownership of it in a legal way,” said Vinayak.On the same day, Vinayak claims that Jagtap arrived at the spot with people holding flags of a political party and entered the private property without permission.Jagtap could not be reached for comment as his mobile phone was switched off.“We received a complaint on July 6. There are cases registered against the complainant (Jagtap) as well, including that of trespassing on the same day. We registered a case after conducting an inquiry,” said senior inspector Anil Shewale of Chatuhshrungi police station.A case under Sections 324, 504, 506 and 34 of Indian Penal Code was registered at Chatuhshrungi police station against Nimhan on Tuesday.

With Maharashtra government firm on not conducting final-year exams, Patwardhan said that he is making efforts to reach an amicable solution.State higher education minister Uday Samant on July 13 tweeted: “despite UGC revised guidelines to take final- year exams, the state government is firm on not taking the exams”.Taking about the issue, Patwardhan, who was earlier a biomedical researcher and professor of Health Sciences at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), said, “I am aware of the situation in Maharashtra because of the rising Covid-19 cases in the state. Health and safety of students is supreme for all of us. However, awarding degrees without final examinations is not acceptable academically. I am discussing different options with Maharashtra state chancellor, vice-chancellors and heads of various universities in the state. I will try my best in personal capacity to put forward the Maharashtra case before the Commission to reach a mutually acceptable sustainable solution. I hope the efforts will help to end the current impasse.’’The state government in June decided to cancel final-year and semester exams of all universities due to the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. UGC last week issued new guidelines instructing universities to hold final-year exams before September-end 2020.Samant tweeted on July 13: “Today state disaster management authority meeting was held and led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and it was again decided not to take the final-year exams despite getting guidelines from the UGC”.Arun Adsul, former vice-chancellor of SPPU, said, “The present virus pandemic has caused increased fear of security, worry about future, anxiety, panic and distress among college youth. The confusion over exam is worrying students as the results will decide their future course of action. Parents are worried about the future of their children. Postponing the exams to next academic year will have a big impact on their academic future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/awarding-degrees-without-final-exams-is-not-acceptable-academically-ugc-v-c/story-lvaKvaW7DLPomFuSCdANsJ.html

Detectives found Saleh’s torso near a power saw and later discovered his head and limbs sorted into plastic bags, police told New York crime reporters.Saleh’s sister discovered the body and the fact the saw was still connected led detectives to suspect her arrival may have startled the perpetrator, who would have fled through another exit, The New York Times reported.“We have a torso, a head that’s been removed, arms and legs. Everything is still on the scene. We don’t have a motive,” said police spokesman Carlos Nieves.Security camera video showed Saleh in an elevator with a man in a dark suit, mask and gloves, media reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/torso-removed-head-arms-legs-tech-founder-killed-in-nyc-body-cut-up/story-R1SwWcnsKziF94SFUdAKgP.html
15-07-2020||World||US unloads punitive steps on China over Hong Kong law||The US has hit China with punitive measures over the Hong Kong security law and slapped visa curbs on those working with Beijing-linked firms such as Huawei.US President Donald Trump has signed into law a bill that authorises sanctions on individuals responsible for the Hong Kong law. He also signed an executive order that took away the preferential trade status of Hong Kong, putting it on par with the mainland. “Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away. And with it, goes Hong Kong, in my opinion, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets,” Trump told reporters at the White House.“Hong Kong will now be treated the same as mainland China: no special privileges, no special economic treatment, and no export of sensitive technologies,” he said.China vowed it will take strong countermeasures and sanction US officials and entities over the Hong Kong law. It urged the US to “correct its wrongdoings” and to stop interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs.On Wednesday, the US state department announced visa restrictions on employees of Chinese tech firms that “provide material support to regimes engaging in human rights abuses globally”.Companies impacted include Huawei, which it described as an arm of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) surveillance state “that censors political dissidents and enables mass internment camps in Xinjiang and the indentured servitude of its population shipped all over China”. Certain Huawei employees provide material support to the CCP regime that commits human rights abuses, it said.The New York Times said it will transfer some of its staff out of Hong Kong because of uncertainties about practising journalism under the new security law. Its digital team of journalists will be moved to Seoul over the next year, the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unloads-punitive-steps-on-china-over-hong-kong-law/story-1zij7x9rvvuQrswRPJ7iUM.html
15-07-2020||World||UN warns Covid-19 has threatened child vaccination programs||The United Nations warned Wednesday about an alarming decline in childhood vaccinations because of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying that the likelihood a child born today will have all recommended vaccines by the age of 5 is less than 20 percent.Most of the 82 countries surveyed in May reported vaccination campaigns being disrupted because of coronavirus, according to the study carried out by UNICEF, the World Health Organization and Gavi, a public-private partnership started by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that buys vaccines for about 60% of the world’s children.That survey found more than 30 measles campaigns around the world have been, or are at risk of being halted, a move likely to worsen outbreaks of the highly contagious disease.“The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunizations could be far greater than Covid-19 itself,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Even before the pandemic hit, 14 million children around the world already weren’t receiving vaccinations, most of them in Africa. In South America, vaccination rates already have plummeted over the past decade in Brazil, Bolivia, Haiti and Venezuela.Now it’s become harder for health workers to give vaccines because many have been redirected toward the pandemic response. In other areas, health workers are having more difficulty because of movement restrictions or lack of protective equipment.Even when vaccines are still available, many parents are fearful of taking their children to health centers because of the virus.“Covid-19 has made previously routine vaccination a daunting challenge,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “We must prevent a further deterioration in vaccine coverage and urgently resume vaccination programs before children’s lives are threatened by other diseases. We cannot trade one health crisis for another.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-covid-19-has-threatened-child-vaccination-programs/story-zyOPqd7ZpVgIQVQJUWEYmI.html
15-07-2020||World||Floyd family sues Minneapolis officers charged in his death||George Floyd’s family filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the city of Minneapolis and the four police officers charged in his death, alleging the officers violated Floyd’s rights when they restrained him and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force.The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Minnesota, was announced by attorney Ben Crump and other lawyers representing Floyd’s family members.“This complaint shows what we have said all along, that Mr. Floyd died because the weight of the entire Minneapolis Police Department was on his neck,” Crump said in a statement. “The City of Minneapolis has a history of policies, procedures and deliberate indifference that violates the rights of arrestees, particularly Black men, and highlights the need for officer training and discipline.”Crump said the lawsuit seeks to set a precedent “that makes it financially prohibitive for police to wrongfully kill marginalized people — especially Black people — in the future.”Floyd, who was Black and handcuffed, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes as Floyd said he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers at the scene — Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Kueng — are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.All four officers were fired the day after Floyd’s death, which set off protests that spread around the world and turned into a national reckoning on race in America.Floyd’s death also sparked calls to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department and replace it with a new public safety department. A majority of City Council members support the move, saying the department has a long history and culture of brutality that has resisted change.A public hearing was planned later Wednesday on the proposal, which requires a change in the city’s charter that could go to voters in November.The lawsuit comes on the same day that a court allowed public viewing by appointment of video from the body cameras of Lane and Kueng. A coalition of news organizations and attorneys for Lane and Kueng have been advocating to make the videos public, saying they would provide a more complete picture of what happened when Floyd was taken into custody. The judge hasn’t said why he’s not allowing the video to be disseminated more widely.According to documents in state probate court, Floyd is survived by 11 known heirs, including five children and six siblings. They live in Texas, North Carolina, Florida and New York. All but one of Floyd’s children are adults. He has no living parents or grandparents. A trustee was named last week, paving the way for the lawsuit.The families of victims of other high-profile police shootings have received high payouts in Minnesota. Last year, Minneapolis agreed to pay $20 million to the family of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, an unarmed woman who was shot by an officer after she called 911 to report hearing a possible crime happening behind her home. The settlement came three days after the officer, Mohamed Noor, was convicted of murdering her and is believed to be the largest payout ever stemming from police violence in Minnesota.At the time, Mayor Jacob Frey cited Noor’s unprecedented conviction and his failure to identify a threat before he used deadly force as reasons for the large settlement.The mother of Philando Castile, a black motorist killed by an officer in 2016, reached a nearly $3 million settlement with the suburb of St. Anthony, which employed the officer. The officer, Jeronimo Yanez, was acquitted of manslaughter and other charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floyd-family-sues-minneapolis-officers-charged-in-his-death/story-ZnnPY5TjUxDc8UcCgtCdsL.html
15-07-2020||World||US universities forced Trump administration to retreat on foreign students||President Donald Trump-led administration gave up within 5 minutes of the start of arguments in a federal court in Boston on Tuesday, and to the relief of hundreds of US universities and their hundreds of thousands of international students including many from India, its lawyer told the judge they were rescinding the controversial order issued last week.As a result of rescinding of the order, foreign students in US will not be asked to leave if they are enrolled at a university that offered only online classes for the upcoming fall semester because of Covid-19 lockdown. Additionally, no one will be have to switch course or university for in-person classes to stay “in-status”, as the administration had ordered on July 6.“The government has agreed to rescind the July 6 2020 policy directive and the frequently asked questions, the FAQs, that were released the next day on July 7,” district court judge Allison D. Burroughs said just as the hearing started. “They also agreed to rescind any implementation of the directive.”She added that the administration will go back to its March guideline, which allowed foreign students to stay and pursue their studies through online courses as colleges and universities had begun shutting down due to the Covid-19 disease outbreak sweeping through the country. US continues to remain the worst affected by the pandemic globally with 3,434,636 infection cases and 1,36,699 deaths, as recorded by Johns Hopkins universityThe Harvard Crimson, a campus news publication of Harvard, which was a joint plaintiff with MIT, reported that the judge also said the parties had reached an agreement within five minutes of the start of the arguments.Omkar Joshi, a doctoral student at the University of Maryland (UMD), said, “This is a good development and we are relieved that the order has been rescinded. We can return to the campus, if we choose to, without the fear of infection. This comes as a well deserved relief”.Though UMD opted for a hybrid model of teaching, it was still not clear to students how many courses they had to take under the new directive, or how many hours they had to spend on the campus”.Universities can still offer in-person courses, depending on their programmes but, Joshi said, “students cannot be forced to return to the campus, they have a choice now.”An estimated 1 million international students are enrolled in US colleges and universities every year. They are a significant source of revenue for the colleges, generating economic activity worth around $41 billion and supporting 450,000 jobs alongside. After China, US sees second largest student population from India — with around 200,000 in all at present — ahead of Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Canada.The July 6 order from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency had come “out of the blue”, as one Indian student had then said, shaken, confused and scared as all other foreign students. Universities had been caught in the final planning stages for the fall, as they had weighed options and models for reopening with new Covid-19 infections surging around the country again.Tanujay Saha, of Princeton, said that while he is not personally impacted as he has finished most of his coursework as a doctoral student and now has research work lined up, some students in his lab hailing from other parts of the world had “completely freaked out”. The work in the lab grounded to a “standstill”, Saha said. “We couldn’t not work for a day or two,” he said of the days in the immediate aftermath of the order, which had added to worries and concerns already being felt around the campus because of the Covid-19 epidemic and travel restrictions.He also got calls from India from students who were to start this fall. They were worried, of course about what will happen now.Harvard had announced the same day on July 6, its fall courses will be taught online entirely. And just hours later, it discovered its students will be forced to either leave the country because of new directive from the Trump administration or switch to another university that offered a hybrid of in-person and online classes. Trump had directed his ire at Harvard, saying, the next day, its plans were “ridiculous” and that it had taken the “easy way out”.“This is a significant victory,” Lawrence S Bacow, president of Harvard University, wrote in an email to affiliates, after the court announcement Tuesday. “I have heard from countless international students who said that the July 6 directive had put them at serious risk. These students – our students — can now rest easier and focus on their education, which is all they ever wanted to do,” Bacow said. “It’s deeply encouraging that this case has inspired so much reflection about and enthusiastic recognition of the vital role international students play in academic communities across the United States – and absolutely at MI,” MIT president L Rafael Reif wrote in a note to the campus community. He added, taking a swipe at the administration, “This case also made clear that real lives are at stake in these ‘bureaucratic’ matters, with the potential for real harm. We need to approach policy making, especially now, with more humanity, more decency – not less.”Harvard and MIT’s lawsuit had been joined by more than 200 other universities and some states, which reflected the size and the swiftness of the blowback to the administration’s order.Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator and former presidential candidate, slammed the ICE order as a “dangerous & xenophobic #StudentBan policy”. The reference here was to other travel bans the president has ordered targeting people from certain countries, such as the “Muslim travel man”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-universities-forced-trump-administration-to-retreat-on-foreign-students/story-xvjgjoseycBnibpErbDOBK.html

Pompeo’s statement amps up the pitch against China’s effort to push the envelope and its territory in the South China Sea region.Pompeo said the US will support these countries but stressed this would be done in multilateral and legal forums.“We will then go use the tools that we have available and we will support countries all across the world who recognize that China has violated their legal territorial claims as well – or maritime claims as well,” Pompeo told reporters, according to news agency Reuters. .@SecPompeo comments on the Chinese Communist Party’s implementation of national security legislation in Hong Kong, U.S. policy on the South China Sea, and Huawei and 5G. pic.twitter.com/jkj2rBRZYU“We will go provide them the assistance we can, whether that’s in multilateral bodies, whether that’s in ASEAN, whether that’s through legal responses, we will use all the tools we can,” he said, referring to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).Pompeo, who had last week spoken about building a coalition against China, indicated the plan was on track. He announced a “quick trip” to the United Kingdom and Denmark on Monday next. I’m sure that the Chinese Communist Party and its threat to free peoples around the world will be high on top of that agenda,” Pompeo told a news conference.Pompeo also welcomed London’s ban on Chinese telecom giant Huawei and announced that the US would impose visa restrictions on some workers for Huawei Technologies Corp, continuing the Trump administration’s efforts to bar Huawei’s technology on the grounds that the Chinese technology company could be used by the government in Beijing as a back door for spying. Huawei has said it operates independently.The Trump administration has already delivered a harsh warning to Beijing, insisting that Washington could respond with sanctions against Chinese officials and enterprises involved in coercion in the South China Sea.“Nothing is off the table ... there is room for that. This is a language the Chinese understand - demonstrative and tangible action,” David Stilwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asia, had said earlier in the day.Stilwell’s comment came a day after the United States rejected China’s claims to offshore resources in most of the South China Sea as “completely unlawful”.The US has opposed China’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea in the past and sent warships through the strategic waterway, through which about $3 trillion of trade passes each year, to demonstrate freedom of navigation.China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also claim parts of it. Beijing has built bases on atolls in the region.China has described the US focus on the South China Sea and its threat of sanctions as an attempt to stir up trouble and destabilise the region.“The US arbitrarily talks about sanctions ... this is very pathetic,” she told reporters during a daily briefing in Beijing. “We are not afraid of sanctions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-amps-up-pitch-says-will-use-all-tools-to-support-countries-over-south-china-sea/story-I3nUnUD7Oks1dcikQ6zjPI.html

The Trump administration wants European and other allies to exclude Huawei as they upgrade to fifth-generation, or 5G, networks.On Tuesday, the British government announced Huawei would be excluded from work on the network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the security of Chinese-supplied equipment.“Without any concrete evidence, the United Kingdom took unfounded risks as an excuse and cooperated with the United States to discriminate, suppress and exclude Chinese companies,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.Last year, Washington imposed curbs on Huawei’s access to American components and other technology. In May, the Trump administration tightened controls by blocking non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington’s approval.Chinese officials accuse Washington of misusing national security concerns to block a rising competitor to U.S. tech suppliers.“China will fully and seriously evaluate this incident and take all measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises,” Hua said.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said Washington told other governments to avoid Huawei “if they want to do business with us.”“We convinced many countries — many countries — and I did this myself, for the most part, not to use Huawei because we think it’s an unsafe security risk,” Trump said in Washington. “I talked many countries out of using it. If they want to do business with us, they can’t use it.”Huawei is at the center of U.S.-Chinese conflicts over technology development and possible spying. The company’s chief financial officer is under house arrest in Canada and fighting extradition to the United States to face charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran.Hua said Beijing would warn Chinese companies “to attach great importance to the increasing political security risks” they face in Britain.On Tuesday, Huawei reported its revenue grew 13.1% in the first half of 2020 compared with a year earlier despite U.S. pressure and the coronavirus pandemic.Huawei is, along with Nokia Corp. of Finland and Sweden’s LM Ericsson, a leader in development of fifth-generation technology.5G is meant to expand networks to support self-driving cars, remote surgery and other futuristic applications. That makes the technology more intrusive and sensitive politically.U.S. officials have suggested Washington might provide financing so that other countries can buy Nokia or Ericsson technology instead of Huawei’s lower-priced gear.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government agreed in January to allow Huawei to supply some equipment for the 5G network while it would be barred from providing core components.London reversed course after the Trump administration threatened to end an intelligence-sharing agreement due to concern that Huawei’s involvement might allow Beijing to infiltrate British networks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-britain-of-helping-washington-hurt-huawei/story-W8cDH7oZXVsTYKB2rkGtpO.html
15-07-2020||World||Coronavirus resurgence forces countries to reimpose restrictions||Countries around the world are reimposing lockdowns and implementing new health checks at their borders in an effort to curb a resurgence of the coronavirus before it spins even further out of control.Starting Wednesday, all travelers arriving in Greece from a land border with Bulgaria were required to carry negative coronavirus test results issued in the previous 72 hours and translated into English. The new rules, which follow an increase in tourism-related Covid-19 cases, triggered an immediate drop in arrivals compared to recent days.Residents of Australia’s second-largest city, Melbourne, were warned on Wednesday to comply with lockdown regulations or face tougher restrictions. Melbourne’s 5 million people and part of the city’s semi-rural surroundings are a week into a new, six-week lockdown to contain a new outbreak there.“The time for warnings, the time for cutting people slack, is over,” Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said. “Where we are is in a very serious and deadly position.”The developments come with more than 13 million cases of coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide, and with over 578,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.The actual numbers are thought to be far higher due to a number of reasons including limited testing.In Serbia, which has been hit hard by a spike in infections and anti-government protests, a government crisis team expanded a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people from Belgrade to encompass the entire country. Masks were also made mandatory in public spaces where there is no opportunity for 1.5 meters (around five feet) of distancing, such as in lines to enter shops and bus stations.Renewed restrictions took effect in Hong Kong on Wednesday, with public gatherings limited to four people, restaurants restricted to takeout after 6 p.m., and a one-week closure for gyms, karaoke bars, and selected other businesses. Masks were mandated on public transit for the first time, with the non-compliant being fined.After a surge in daily infections beginning last month, Israel moved last week to reimpose restrictions, closing events spaces, live show venues, bars and clubs. It has imposed lockdowns on areas with high infection rates, which in some cases sparked protests from residents.Officials warn that if case numbers don’t come down in the coming days, Israel will have no choice but to lock the entire country down again, as it did in the spring.“I don’t see what other tools we have aside from a lockdown,” Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told the Israeli news site Ynet. “Unless there is a miracle.”South Africa, Africa’s most developed country, is already showing signs of being overwhelmed by the pandemic — an ominous outlook for the rest of the continent of 1.3 billion people.A ban on alcohol sales and a night curfew have been reimposed this week to reduce the volume of trauma patients to hospitals that are struggling to cope with an influx of Covid-19 patients.Alcohol-related emergencies at hospitals dropped by nearly 60% when South Africa prohibited the sales of liquor in April and May. When that restriction was lifted in June, hospitals saw an immediate return to previous levels of trauma cases, especially on weekends, according to statistics from Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize.One result was more economic pain in a country which already has a high unemployment rate of 30%.“This return to the booze ban is causing havoc to the restaurant business, and it’s causing people to lose jobs,” said Gerald Elliot, owner of a popular Johannesburg restaurant, Ba Pita, which he said closed as a result of the restrictions, with a loss of 28 jobs. “You can look down our street and see several restaurants that are shut. It looks like they are closed permanently.”In Spain, authorities in the northeastern Catalonia region made fresh attempts to stem the spread of new coronavirus outbreaks as health experts warned that more and better contact tracing is needed.Since midnight Tuesday, 160,000 residents in and around the city of Lleida were forbidden to leave their homes unless it’s properly justified. The area is closed off, with police checkpoints outside every municipality. Bars and restaurants are only open for takeout or delivery.In Hospitalet de Llobregat, a densely populated town on the outskirts of the regional capital, Barcelona, dozens of people lined up Tuesday at a local health center to be tested for the virus, as infections have shot up from a few dozen to more than 200 in just over three days.Starting Wednesday, three neighborhoods are seeing more restrictions, including limits to the number of customers in shops and restaurants, while authorities are strongly urging people not to socialize.Authorities in the English town of Blackburn also imposed new restrictions on social mingling amid what they say is a “rising tide” of new coronavirus cases.Director of Public Health Dominic Harrison said that if infection numbers didn’t fall by July 27, officials would begin to reimpose lockdown measures such as the closing of shops and other businesses.Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said Wednesday that the spread of the infections in the Japanese capital have escalated to levels tantamount to “issuing an alarm” and requested that residents and business owners step up their preventive measures.However, even as new restrictions are imposed, steps were being taken to help restore a sense of normalcy.On Tuesday night, Belarusian Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko announced reopening the border with Russia and resuming the transport connection between the two countries “in the coming days.”Travelers arriving in Russia starting Wednesday had to either provide coronavirus test results at the border or take a virus test within three days of arriving to the country. Those measures replace a mandatory two-week self-isolation for those arriving to Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-resurgence-forces-countries-to-reimpose-restrictions/story-KiaX3RHFUC7GBpVSek75lI.html
15-07-2020||World||Tanker off UAE sought by US over Iran sanctions ‘hijacked’||An oil tanker sought by the U.S. over allegedly circumventing sanctions on Iran was hijacked on July 5 off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, a seafarers organization said Wednesday.Satellite photos showed the vessel in Iranian waters on Tuesday and two of its sailors remained in the Iranian capital.It wasn’t immediately clear what happened aboard the Dominica-flagged MT Gulf Sky, though its reported hijacking comes after months of tensions between Iran and the U.S.David Hammond, the CEO of the United Kingdom-based group Human Rights at Sea, said he took a witness statement from the captain of the MT Gulf Sky, confirming the ship had been hijacked.Hammond said that 26 of the Indian sailors on board had made it back to India, while two remained in Tehran, without elaborating.“We are delighted to hear that the crew are safe and well, which has been our fundamental concern from the outset,” Hammond told The Associated Press.Hammond said that he had no other details on the vessel.TankerTrackers.com, a website tracking the oil trade at sea, said it saw the vessel in satellite photos on Tuesday in Iranian waters off Hormuz Island. Hormuz Island, near the port city of Bandar Abbas, is some 190 kilometers (120 miles) north of Khorfakkan, a city on the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates where the vessel had been for months.The Emirati government, the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the U.S. Navy’s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet did not respond to requests for comment. Iranian state media did not immediately report on the vessel and Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In May, the U.S. Justice Department filed criminal charges against two Iranians, accusing them of trying to launder some $12 million to purchase the tanker, then named the MT Nautica, through a series of front companies. The vessel then took on Iranian oil from Kharg Island to sell abroad, the U.S. government said.Court documents allege the scheme involved the Quds Force of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which is its elite expeditionary unit, as well as Iran’s national oil and tanker companies. The two men charged, one of whom also has an Iraqi passport, remain at large.“Because a U.S. bank froze the funds related to the sale of the vessel, the seller never received payment,” the Justice Department said. “As a result, the seller instituted a civil action in the UAE to recover the vessel.”That civil action was believed to still be pending, raising questions of how the tanker sailed away from the Emirates after being seized by authorities there.Data from the MT Gulf Sky’s Automatic Identification System tracker shows it had been turned off around 4:30 a.m. July 5, according to ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.com. Ships are supposed to keep their AIS trackers on, but Iranian vessels routinely turn theirs off to mask their movements.Meanwhile, the 28 Indian sailors on board the vessel found themselves stuck on board without pay for months, according to the International Labor Organization. It filed a report saying the vessel and its sailors had been abandoned by its owners since March off Khorfakkan. The ILO did not respond to a request for comment.As tensions between Iran and the U.S. heated up last year, tankers plying the waters of the Mideast became targets, particularly near the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf’s narrow mouth through which 20% of all oil passes. Suspected limpet mine attacks the U.S. blamed on Iran targeted several tankers. Iran denied being involved, though it did seize several tankers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tanker-off-uae-sought-by-us-over-iran-sanctions-hijacked/story-yui3SCklRT3RQTu3bvzcaK.html
15-07-2020||World||Xi Jinping’s show of force against India is a strategic gift for Donald Trump||A brutal day of hand-to-hand combat on the India-China border last month may accomplish what years of Pentagon and White House outreach has struggled to achieve: draw the U.S. and India closer militarily.U.S. strategists have long wanted to get India firmly on America’s side, seeing the nation of 1.3 billion as a powerful counterweight to China. But while India has historically tried to balance its ties among global powers, the clashes with China at 14,000-feet (4,300 meters) laid bare the potential longer-term risks of not having the U.S. more clearly behind it.“My former Pentagon colleagues see the India dust-up as nothing you’d want but a great opportunity for further strengthening U.S.-India cooperation,” said Randy Schriver who stepped down as assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Affairs in December. “Our defense strategy is really getting a boost from all this.”Closer ties would represent a big strategic win for Donald Trump. The American president has courted Prime Minister Narendra Modi since taking office in 2017. In 2018, the two nations signed a defense agreement that allowed India to purchase advanced American weapons and share sensitive military technology. In 2019 the U.S. approved the largest defense deal between the two countries in four years when it confirmed the sale of $1 billion in naval guns to India.Last year the U.S. and Indian militaries also conducted their first-ever joint land, sea and air exercises. In February, just before the Covid-19 pandemic exploded in the U.S., the two leaders confirmed that $3 billion in defense deals would go forward, including $2.6 billion for MH-60R Seahawk maritime helicopters built by Lockheed Martin Corp. They promised more to come.Then came the border clash on the Tibetan plateau, just as tensions were soaring between Washington and Beijing. Trump, who used to regularly praise his friendship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, now lambastes Beijing over the origins of the coronavirus, its growing intervention in Hong Kong and its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the western region of Xinjiang.That’s all playing out to New Delhi’s benefit as well as Trump’s.One official with Modi’s government who asked not to be identified discussing policy said India is now more likely to pursue complex military exercises with the U.S. and to purchase offensive weapons platforms. The official said India has become less concerned about provoking China since the clash along their remote Himalayan boundary that left 20 Indian troops and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers dead in a fierce skirmish.In the latest sign that New Delhi is open to closer military ties with the West, the country plans to invite Australia to join the annual Malabar naval exercise later this year that has so far included just Japan and the U.S. That would mark the first joint military drills by all the nations that take part in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also referred to as the “Quad.”In the past, India was hesitant to engage in high-level defense exchanges with the other three powers to avoid irritating China, said Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, a distinguished fellow at the Aspen Center in New Delhi. Now, however, “India has no choice or incentive anymore to stay away from the U.S.,” Chaudhuri said.In Beijing, too, there’s a recognition that Sino-Indian tensions are likely to draw the U.S. further into South Asian geopolitics.“India has wanted to strengthen its military alliance with the U.S. in recent years, so the border incident with China may expedite this trend,” said Zhu Jiangming, a senior researcher at the Renmin University’s Overseas Security Research Institute.The geopolitical maneuvering comes after the Trump administration sought to build on an Obama-era effort to brand the region stretching from India to Hawaii as the “Indo-Pacific.” In 2017, Trump delivered a speech in Vietnam stressing the U.S. commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” A year later, then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis renamed U.S. Pacific Command the “U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.”Intelligence SharingThe Pentagon’s strategy report for the region calls out the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to “reorder the region to its advantage by leveraging military modernization, influence operations and predatory economics to coerce other nations.” The Indo-Pacific alliance, the document says, is meant to counter that effort.Enhanced cooperation is also likely in the field of military intelligence, according to Schriver, the former Pentagon official.“When it comes to things like PLA deployments in the Indian Ocean, it means sharing information, shadowing vessels and looking at whether you can hold a vessel and pass it onto another,” he said, referring to China’s People’s Liberation Army. The two sides are also likely to move beyond naval cooperation, branching out into ground force cooperation, Schriver said.Pakistan TiesDeteriorating U.S. ties with India’s South Asian rival Pakistan are easing the way for a closer U.S.-India defense relationship. In September 2018, the U.S. cut $300 million in military aid to Pakistan after longstanding frustration that the country was providing safe haven to the Afghan Taliban. The shift opened a path for “better and more fulsome engagement” with India, the Aspen Center’s Pal Chaudhuri said.U.S.-India ties also have been strengthening for reasons beyond the border spat. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has touted India as a potential supply chain partner as the U.S. seeks to reduce its dependence on China’s economy.Still, many of the obstacles that have stymied US-India military cooperation in the past are likely to persist.New Delhi has continued to maintain friendly security ties with Moscow, going as far as to buy a Russian S-400 air defense system, echoing a move that hobbled U.S. ties with Turkey. Russia remains India’s largest arms supplier, accounting for 56% of its weapons imports from 2015 to 2019, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.For India, analysts say, the pursuit of closer U.S. military ties will be just part of a broader strategy to hedge against Chinese influence.“India will continue to have multiple alignments,” said Kashish Parpiani, a research fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai. “While the U.S. will be the biggest gainer, major partners like France, Israel, Russia and Japan will gain too.”“India is not going to wholeheartedly pick a side,” Parpiani said. “It will signal, and signal hard. But unless the Chinese troops actually start marching down and India is cornered, it will not pick a side.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-s-show-of-force-against-india-is-a-strategic-gift-for-donald-trump/story-AP5QW5TFSVoxc8teZzrg8I.html
15-07-2020||World||Profile of a killer: Unraveling the deadly new coronavirus||What is this enemy?Seven months after the first patients were hospitalized in China battling an infection doctors had never seen before, the world’s scientists and citizens have reached an unsettling crossroads.Countless hours of treatment and research, trial and error now make it possible to take much closer measure of the new coronavirus and the lethal disease it has unleashed. But to take advantage of that intelligence, we must confront our persistent vulnerability: The virus leaves no choice.“It’s like we’re in a battle with something that we can’t see, that we don’t know, and we don’t know where it’s coming from,” said Vivian Castro, a nurse supervisor at St. Joseph’s Medical Center in Yonkers, just north of New York City, which struggled with its caseload this spring.Castro had treated scores of infected patients before she, too, was hospitalized for the virus in April, then spent two weeks in home quarantine. As soon as she returned to the emergency room for her first shift, she rushed to comfort yet another casualty -- a man swallowing the few words he could muster between gasps for air.“It just came back, that fear,” she said. “I just wanted to tell him not to give up.”The coronavirus is invisible, but seemingly everywhere. It requires close contact to spread, but it has reached around the globe faster than any pandemic in history.Covid-19 was not even on the world’s radar in November. But it has caused economic upheaval echoing the Great Depression, while claiming more than 570,000 lives. In the U.S. alone, the virus has already killed more Americans than died fighting in World War I.Even those figures don’t capture the pandemic’s full sweep. Nine of every 10 students worldwide shut out of their schools at one point. More than 7 million flights grounded. Countless moments of celebration and sorrow -- weddings and graduations, baby showers and funerals -- put off, reconfigured or abandoned because of worries about safety.In short, the coronavirus has rescripted nearly every moment of daily life. And fighting it -- whether by searching for a vaccine or seeking to protect family -- takes knowing the enemy. It’s the essential first step in what could be an extended quest for some version of normalcy.“There’s light at the end of tunnel, but it’s a very, very long tunnel,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University.“There’s a lot we don’t know. But I think it’s absolutely certain we’re going to be adapting to a new way of life. That’s the reality.”___The new coronavirus is roughly 1,000 times narrower than a human hair. But scrutinized through an electron scope, it is clear this enemy is well-armed.Coronaviruses, including the newest one, are named for the spikes that cover their outer surface like a crown, or corona in Latin. Using those club-shaped spikes, the virus latches on to the outer wall of a human cell, invades it and replicates, creating viruses to hijack more cells.Find a way to block or bind the spikes and you can stop the virus.Once inside a human cell, the virus’ RNA, or genetic code, commandeers its machinery, providing instructions to make thousands of virus copies.But the coronavirus has a weakness: an outer membrane that can be destroyed by ordinary soap. That neutralizes the virus, which is why health experts emphasize the need to wash hands.Like organisms, viruses evolve, searching for traits that will ensure survival, said Charles Marshall, a professor of paleontology at the University of California and self-described “deep time evolutionary biologist.”“Coronaviruses fit into the standard evolutionary paradigm extremely well, which is if you’ve had some innovation, you get into some new environment ... you get into a human and you do well, you’re going to proliferate,” Marshall said.There are hundreds of coronaviruses, but just seven known to infect people. Four are responsible for some common colds. But in 2002, a virus called SARS, for severe acute respiratory syndrome, spread from China to sicken about 8,000 people worldwide, killing more than 700. Another coronavirus causes Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, identified in 2012, spread to humans through camels.The new coronavirus, though, has captivated scientists’ attention unlike any in decades.When researcher Thomas Friedrich logged on to his computer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison after a meeting in January, he found colleagues had been frantically posting messages to one another about the new virus.“People were getting increasingly excited and beginning to brainstorm ideas,” said Friedrich, who has spent years studying other infectious diseases.Now much of Friedrich’s lab is focused on the coronavirus, studying its spread in Wisconsin, and collaborating with scientists around the world examining the disease’s behavior in monkeys.Even early on it was clear this virus posed a major threat, he said. Human immune systems had never encountered it. And unlike Zika, whose spread can be controlled by targeting mosquitoes, or AIDS, which most often requires sexual contact, the new virus is readily transmitted through air.“It had all the hallmarks, to me, of a potential pandemic,” Friedrich said. “Basically, everyone in the world is susceptible.”___The new virus has breached borders and claimed victims with stealth and speed that make it difficult to track.Scientists are fairly certain the disease originated in bats, which harbor many coronaviruses. To get to humans, it may have been passed through another animal, possibly consumed for meat. By late January, when Chinese authorities walled off the city of Wuhan, where the disease was first diagnosed, it was too late to stop the spread.The most severe pandemic in recent history, the “Spanish flu” of 1918, was spread by infected soldiers dispatched to fight World War I. But aboard ships, it took weeks for the troops and the disease to cross oceans.Now, with more than 100,000 commercials flights a day ferrying tourists, business travelers and students around the globe, the new virus spread rapidly and virtually invisibly, said medical historian Mark Honigsbaum, author of “The Pandemic Century: One Hundred Years of Panic, Hysteria and Hubris.”“By the time we woke up to the outbreak in Italy, it had been there for weeks if not months,” he said.Soon after the first case in Wuhan, Chinese tourists with the virus traveled to France. But doctors there reported recently that a fishmonger contracted the disease even earlier than that, from an unknown source. On January 21, the first confirmed U.S. case was reported in Washington state, in a man who had traveled to Asia.“It’s one person coming in from China and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine,” President Donald Trump said at the time. Ten days later, he blocked entry to most travelers from China.But genetic analysis of samples taken from New York patients showed most of the virus present arrived from Europe instead, and took root in February -- well before anyone thought about quarantining after a trip to Madrid, London or Paris.___Since February, when Dr. Daniel Griffin began treating patients suspected of having COVID-19, he’s cared for more than 1,000 people with the disease, first noted for attacking the lungs. But the infection certainly does not stop there.“I am actually shocked,” said Griffin, a specialist in infectious diseases at New York’s Columbia University Medical Center. “This virus seems to leave nothing untouched.”Scientists are getting a handle on the many ways the disease affects the body, but it’s a scramble.The lungs are, indeed, ground zero. Many patients find themselves gasping for breath, unable to say more than a word or two.Even after five days in the hospital, Vivian Castro, the nurse who became infected, said she returned home struggling for air.“I climbed two flights of stairs to my room and I felt like I was going to die,” she said.The reason why becomes clear in autopsies of those who have died, some with lungs that weigh far more than usual. Under a microscope, evidence of the virus’ destruction is even more striking.When Dr. Sanjay Mukhopadhyay examined autopsy samples from a 77-year-old Oklahoma man, he noted changes to the microscopic sacs in the patient’s lungs. In a healthy lung, oxygen passes through the thin walls of those sacs into the bloodstream. But in the Oklahoma patient, the virus had turned the sac walls so thick with debris that oxygen was blocked.The thickened walls “were everywhere,” preventing the lungs from sustaining the rest of the body, said Mukhopadhyay, of Ohio’s Cleveland Clinic.Autopsies reveal “what the virus is actually doing” inside patient’s bodies, said Dr. Desiree Marshall, a pathologist at the University of Washington who recently examined the heart of a Seattle man who died from disease.“Each autopsy has the chance to tell us something new,” she said. And those insights from the bodies of the dead could lead to more effective treatment of the living.The coronavirus, though, keeps raising fresh questions. It left the hearts of two men in their 40s, recently treated by Griffin, flaccid and unable to pump enough blood. Some younger people have arrived in emergency rooms suffering strokes caused by blood clotting, another calling card.Kidneys and livers fail in some patients and blood clots puts limbs at risk of amputation. Some patients hallucinate or have trouble maintaining balance. Some get a treatable paralysis in arms or legs. Many have diarrhea, but often don’t mention it until Griffin asks.Their explanation? “That’s the least of my problems when I can’t breathe.”Initially, doctors often put patients on ventilators if their blood oxygen levels dropped. But death rates were so high they now try other strategies first, like turning patients on their stomachs, which can help them breathe. The truth is that hospital workers are learning as they go, sometimes painfully.“Every patient that I see, I think that could’ve been me,” said Dr. Stuart Moser, a cardiologist hospitalized in New York in March after he was infected. He recalls fearing that he might be put on a ventilator and wondering if he’d ever see his family again. Now, back at work, he said much of what he and his colleagues have learned about the virus’ myriad effects enables them only to treat patients’ symptoms.“It’s difficult because they have so many problems and there are so many patients,” Moser said, “and you just want to do the right thing -- give people the best chance to get better.”____In recent weeks, researchers have recruited 3,000 patients from around the world in a bid to solve a puzzling anomaly. Why does the coronavirus ravage some previously healthy patients, while leaving others relatively unscathed?The project, called the COVID Human Genetic Effort, focuses on each person’s unique genetic makeup to seek explanations for why some got sick while others stay healthy. It’s one of several projects looking for genetic causes of susceptibility, including recent work by other labs suggesting a link between blood type and risk of serious illness.“Step one is understanding and step two is fixing. There is no other way,” said one of the project’s leaders, Jean-Laurent Casanova, of The Rockefeller University in New York. He is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also helps fund The Associated Press Health and Science Department.His project focuses on people 50 or younger who had no health problems before the coronavirus put them in intensive care. But the question of why the disease affects people so differently has broader implications.It’s not clear, for example, why the disease has had such a limited impact on children, compared to other age groups. People older than 65 are well over 100 times more likely to be hospitalized for the virus than people under 18. But so far, there’s no explanation why.Do children resist infection for some reason? Or is it that, even when infected, they are less likely to develop symptoms? If so, what does that mean about their chances for passing the infection along to others, like their grandparents?These aren’t just academic questions. Answers will help in assessing the risks of reopening schools. And they could eventually lead to ways to help make older people resistant to the disease.In largely sparing children, the pandemic virus echoes the bugs that caused SARS and MERS, said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of Florida.Scientists wonder if children might have some key difference in their cells, such as fewer of the specialized proteins that the coronavirus latch onto. Or maybe their immune systems react differently than in adults.While the virus has mostly bypassed children, researchers have recently been troubled by a serious, albeit uncommon, condition in some young patients, that can cause inflammation in hearts, kidneys, lungs and other organs. Most patients recovered, but the potential for long-term damage remains uncertain.“This is what happens with a new virus,” Rasmussen said. “There’s a lot we don’t know about it. We’re on that steep learning curve.’’___With states and countries reopening in the face of an ongoing pandemic, it’s even more crucial to find solutions. At least the last few months have spotlighted the most critical questions.Can people who have been infected with the disease get it again?Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious disease expert, has said that having the disease once should confer some degree of immunity. But it’s not clear how much or for how long, or what levels or types of antibodies people must have to protect them against future illness.If some people harbor the virus without symptoms, how can we block transmission?The reality is that many infected people will never feel symptoms or get sick. That means temperature checks and other strategies based on symptoms won’t be enough to stop it. Instead, many experts believe, widespread testing is needed to find silent carriers, isolate them until they are no longer contagious, and track down those they may have infected. Masks and distancing can help prevent infection and slow the spread of the virus.Will researchers find medicines that can be used to treat the disease?Hundreds of studies are under way, testing existing medicines and experimental ones. So far, only one -- a common steroid called dexamethasone -- has been shown to increase survival. An antiviral medicine, remdesivir, has been shown to shorten recovery time. Two others -- the malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine -- have not proven safe or effective for treating Covid-19 in large-scale trials, but some studies are still testing them to see if they might help prevent infection or illness.How long will it take to find a vaccine?Scientists in more than 150 labs around the world are pursuing a vaccine and nearly two dozen candidates are in various stages of testing. But there’s no guarantee any will pan out. Finding out if any offer true protection will require testing thousands of people in places where the virus is spreading widely. Some huge studies are expected to begin this month.“It’s almost the Manhattan Project of today, where an enormous amount of resources are being devoted to this,” said Rene Najera, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University and the editor of a vaccine history website run by The College of Physicians of Philadelphia.In the U.S., the goal is to have 300 million doses of potential vaccines by January. But any that fail tests will have to be thrown out. The World Health Organization has called for equitable sharing of any eventual vaccine between rich and poor countries, but how that will happen is far from clear.It’s also uncertain how useful any vaccine will be if a sizable number of people, their skepticism fed by misinformation, refuse to be inoculated.Even an effective vaccine will not address the likelihood that, given the large number of coronaviruses and increasing contact between people and the animals harboring them, the world is very likely to face other pandemics, said Honigsbaum, the medical historian.That means uncertainty will linger as a hallmark of the new normal.The knowledge gained about the coronavirus could prove invaluable in defusing that doubt and, eventually, in defeating the enemy. The real uncertainty, Redlener said, is whether people will use the lessons learned to protect themselves from the virus -- or downplay the threat at their peril.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/profile-of-a-killer-unraveling-the-deadly-new-coronavirus/story-66u1nInQMnndGImdAkdLhK.html
15-07-2020||World||‘Black lives still matter’: Protester’s statue installed in Bristol||A produced statue by a London-based artist of a protestor was quietly installed early on Wednesday morning in Bristol on the plinth of the statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston, which was pulled down on June 7, with a note left behind: ‘Black lives still matter’.The BLM movement was sparked by the death of George Floyd in the US, with several protests and demands for statues and public spaces in the UK to be reviewed, renamed or restructured to remove vestiges of slavery and colonialism.One of the images of the day Colston’s statue was pulled down and consigned to the Avon river was of Jen Reid, a protestor of Afro-Caribbean origin, who stood on the empty plinth with a raised fist. The image went viral, prompting artist Marc Quinn to produce the statue.After Reid’s statue was illegally installed, she expressed her delight: “This is going to continue the conversation. I can’t see it coming down in a hurry.”Marvin Rees, the Labour mayor of Bristol, said permission was not given for her statue to be installed, but said the people of Bristol will decide on its future: whether to retain it or install that of another person.Rees said: “My relentless commitment is to build a city for all Bristolians, with all our differences. To this end, the future of the plinth and what is installed on it must be decided by the people of Bristol”. “This will be critical to building a city that is home to those who are elated at the statue being pulled down, those who sympathise with its removal but are dismayed at how it happened and those who feel that in its removal, they’ve lost a piece of the Bristol they know and therefore themselves. We need change”.Bristol in south-west England has a long history of slave trade, prompting demands that the city removes statues and reminders of the trade in public spaces. The police did not prevent Colston’s statue being pulled down on June 7. It has since been retrieved from the river, to be placed in a city museum.Rees added: “We have set out a process to manage our journey. We have established a history commission which will help us tell our full city history. As we learn this fuller history including the part played by black people, women, the working class, trade unions, and children among others, we will be in a better position to understand who we are, how we got here and who we wish to honour”. “Crucial to our heritage has been the harbour and the docks, manufacturing and industry, research and innovation, transport, slum clearances, housing, modern gentrification and faith. As the commission shares this information, the city will decide on city memorials and the future of the plinth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-still-matter-protestor-s-statue-installed-in-bristol/story-fOT8wZAhjd67qpFxiP3qGL.html

More than 140 people were tested, but no other cases were found.A herdsman also contracted the plague in China’s northern Inner Mongolia region, prompting local authorities to ban the hunting and eating of animals that could carry the plague until the end of the year.At least one person dies of the plague every year in Mongolia despite government campaigns to discourage people from eating marmot or approaching the animal.But many in rural areas grow up learning to hunt and eat the large ground quirrel, and some believe eating its innards is good for health.An ethnic Kazakh couple died of the plague last year after eating raw marmot kidney.The recent cases prompted Russia’s eastern Siberian region of Burytia to test rodents for the bubonic plague and urge residents not to hunt or eat marmot.It also comes as Mongolia’s borders remain closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teenage-boy-dies-of-bubonic-plague-in-mongolia/story-uKzAu6cl7AQnTa6EyO3ufL.html

Floodwaters have inundated villages, cities and farms in many parts of southern China.The Agriculture Ministry, declaring its second highest emergency response level, has sent teams to Jiangxi and four other provinces to help with disaster relief and minimize the damage.Rain was forecast Wednesday for nine provinces, the national meteorological agency said. Sichuan province in the southwest could see 10 to 12 centimeters (4 to 5 inches) of rain per hour.This month’s flooding forced a rare two-day delay for college entrance exams for more than 2,000 students on the Yangtze River in Anhui province. The tests are supposed to be taken by students nationwide on the same days.China’s worst floods in recent years were in 1998, when more than 2,000 people died and almost 3 million homes were destroyed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flooded-southern-china-braces-for-more-storms/story-WMyOr4s5C2Ih6LDR6ZmDQP.html
15-07-2020||World||Trump says he’ll sign merit-based immigration plan ‘very soon’||President Donald Trump said he will soon sign a merit-based immigration measure and would address “in a very Republican way” a program he has sought to end that shields 670,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation.“We’re going to be signing an immigration act very soon,” Trump told reporters Tuesday at a White House press briefing. “It’s going to be based on merit. It’s going to be very strong.”Trump has previously said he would seek sweeping changes to US immigration policy through an executive order. Critics -- including high-profile lawmakers in the president’s own party -- have questioned whether he has the legal authority to overhaul immigration laws without passing legislation through Congress.The president cast immigration in partisan terms on Tuesday, attacking Democratic rival Joe Biden over what he described as lax policies toward those illegally entering the US Trump is seeking to reprise an issue that helped him win election in 2016 as he lags in polls behind Biden.Trump, who has been repeatedly stymied on Capitol Hill as he has pursued efforts to toughen immigration criteria, said he believed the Supreme Court provided him new powers when it rejected the administration’s efforts to dismantle the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which provides legal status for some young migrants in the country illegally.“Very importantly, we’ll be taking care of people from DACA in a very Republican way,” Trump said.Last month, a divided Supreme Court rebuked Trump by blocking him from ending the Obama administration program.Trump has offered no specific explanation of why he believes the Supreme Court decision -- which found his administration did not follow proper procedure in eliminating DACA -- granted him substantial new immigration authority.His foray into immigration comes even as the US has largely shut down the issuance of new work visas and green cards for the remainder of the year because of the coronavirus pandemic.The US on Tuesday reversed a new policy on student visas after a high-profile confrontation with Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and hundreds of other colleges, ending a standoff that could have sent thousands of students back to their home countries and left schools rushing to plan for the fall semester.US District Judge Allison Burroughs announced at an online hearing on Tuesday that the government had agreed to rescind last week’s requirement that international students take at least one in-person class, even amid the resurgent virus and as colleges prepare online-only coursework.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-ll-sign-merit-based-immigration-plan-very-soon/story-P0ymHx9nDZQqqr8JLeb8YJ.html

15-07-2020||World||Hospital staffer admits to murdering 7 patients with insulin in US||A former staffer at a veterans hospital in West Virginia pleaded guilty Tuesday to intentionally killing seven patients with fatal doses of insulin, capping a sweeping federal investigation into a series of mysterious deaths at the medical center.Reta Mays, a former nursing assistant at the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center in Clarksburg was charged with seven counts of second-degree murder and one count of assault with the intent to commit murder of an eighth person. She faces life sentences for each murder.At a plea hearing, Mays, 46, admitted to purposely killing the veterans, injecting them with unprescribed insulin while she worked overnight shifts at the hospital in northern West Virginia between 2017 and 2018. Her voice cracked throughout the hearing as she answered a judge’s questions. She shook and appeared to weep as details of the charges were read aloud.US Attorney Bill Powell told reporters that Mays’ motive is still unclear, saying that authorities did not receive a “satisfactory response” to questions about the reasoning behind her actions.“Though we can’t bring these men back because of her evil acts, we hope the conclusion of the investigation and guilty plea helps ease the pain of the victims’ families,” Powell said.Court records unsealed Tuesday, which named Mays publicly for the first time, came after multiple families initiated civil lawsuits against VA leadership alleging a widespread system of failures at the hospital, where victims were wrongfully given insulin and suddenly died.The widow of one of the victims, 81-year-old George Nelson Shaw Sr., filed a case against the VA alleging the retired Air Force member was given four insulin shots without a doctor’s order in March 2018, accusing the hospital of failing to securely store insulin and prevent its access by unauthorized personnel. As a nursing assistant, Mays did not have authorization or qualifications to administer medications.In a statement, a spokesman for the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center said hospital officials reported the deaths to the VA inspector general and noted that they fired Mays.Powell has described a criminal investigation of the deaths, which initially involved at least 11 fatalities, as a top priority that required the exhumation of multiple victims. He told reporters Tuesday that prosecutors brought charges in all instances where there was sufficient evidence against Mays.US Sen. Joe Manchin, who previously expressed “grave concerns over the pace of the investigation” to Attorney General William Barr, said then that the VA inspector general told his office that the probe was opened in July 2018, after at least nine patients were diagnosed with unexplained low blood sugar.“While overdue, today justice is finally being served,” Manchin said in a statement Tuesday. “I hope today’s announcement brings some semblance of peace to their hearts and to the families who are still uncertain about the fate of their Veterans.”The VA is the government’s second-largest department, responsible for 9 million military veterans. The agency’s former director was fired in 2018 in the wake of a bruising ethics scandal and a mounting rebellion within the agency, and the doctor who Trump nominated to replace him had to withdraw his nomination amid accusations of misconduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hospital-staffer-admits-to-murdering-7-patients-with-insulin-in-us/story-FnSq0vEZfDTVu07GRd4glJ.html

15-07-2020||World||US Navy warship stable, fire could be out in 24 hours, says official||Hundreds of sailors have isolated the fire ravaging the USS Bonhomme Richard down to two areas of the warship and a top Navy official said Tuesday it’s possible the blaze could be extinguished over the next 24 hours.Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck said the ship, which has been listing because of the water being poured on it to douse the flames, was stable and the structure was safe, giving a sign that it may still be saved.“We have made significant progress,” he said.Helicopters had dumped 1,200 buckets of water on the amphibious assault vessel, allowing crews to move further on board to fight the blaze. Tugboats were assisting from the waterline.Sobeck said the fire’s threat of moving toward the million gallons (3.8 million liters) of fuel on board had subsided because of the significant progress crews made overnight.When asked if the blaze could be put out within 24 hours he said, “It’s absolutely possible.”The ship was emitting much less smoke than the previous two days, when acrid billows blanketed parts of the region.The U.S. Coast Guard has hired an oil clean-up crew to put a containment boom in place that could be ready if any oil were to be spilled. It also halted boat and air traffic within a nautical mile of the vessel.On Monday, health officials warned people to stay indoors as acrid smoke wafted across San Diego from one of the Navy’s worst shipyard fires in recent years. At least 61 people, including 38 sailors and 23 civilians, have been treated for heat exhaustion, smoke inhalation and minor injuries. None were in the hospital Tuesday.About 400 sailors along with Navy helicopters and firefighters poured water on the carrier-like ship, which erupted in flames Sunday morning.Sobeck, commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 3, said fire temperatures had reached up to 1,000 degrees (538 Celsius), causing the mast to collapse and threatening the central control island where the captain operates the vessel. He said Tuesday there were now more than two decks between the fire and the fuel supplies.The 840-foot (255-meter) amphibious assault ship was undergoing maintenance when the fire was first reported in a lower cargo area where seafaring tanks are parked. It appears to have started where cardboard boxes, rags and other maintenance supplies were being stored, Sobeck said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-warship-stable-fire-could-be-out-in-24-hours-says-official/story-JxUf9cVtyNLkLZjnft9VrK.html
15-07-2020||World||China set to post return to growth after easing lockdowns||China’s economy is set to post a return to growth for the second quarter, with a range of indicators due Thursday to confirm the upward trend as the nation slowly climbs out of the virus-induced slump.Gross domestic product is forecast to have expanded 2.4% in the three months to June, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That reverses the historic decline of 6.8% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.The steady resumption of growth in the Chinese economy will be a signal for a world still mired in an accelerating pandemic that the virus can be contained and output can recover. At the same time, China remains vulnerable to the effects of demand-sapping containment measures elsewhere, and local consumer confidence is fragile.“Since mid-March, China’s economy has staged an impressive comeback, bolstered by pent-up demand, a catch-up in production, a surge in medical product exports and stimulus in both China and other major economies that has bolstered demand for goods made in China,” Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS Group AG in Hong Kong, wrote in a note.Industrial output likely continued to lead the rebound in June, jumping 4.8% from a year earlier, survey results showed.Fixed-asset investment in the first six months is expected to decline 3.3%, a much slower pace than previously. Retail sales, the weak link in China’s fragile recovery, is projected to have grown for the first time since the pandemic, expanding by 0.5% on the year.However, for the first six months of the year, none of the main indicators are forecast to have recovered the level they were at in June 2019, showing how hard it will be to climb out of the deep slump. GDP is forecast to have shrunk 2.4% compared to the first six months of 2019.The pace of China’s recovery will depend to an extent on the effectiveness of the moderate stimulus measures rolled out so far. The government has earmarked a record 3.75 trillion yuan ($534 billion) in special local government bonds this year, most of which will be channeled to infrastructure projects. However, infrastructure investment has so far remained a drag on growth, while property investment is expected to have returned to expansion, despite Beijing’s reluctance to further support the property market.“The economic recovery has been slow domestically due to the unexpectedly slow kick-off of infrastructure investments,” said Iris Pang, chief economist for greater China at ING Bank NV. “The slow growth in infrastructure investments is dragging on growth, and is very damaging on future economic growth as jobless rates would increase with a slow recovery, and then will feed back into the economy with shrinking consumption.”Uneven RecoveryWhile the incremental recovery has demonstrated the resilience in the world’s second-largest economy, it remains an uneven one, mainly driven by supply rather than demand. Industrial production growth has already returned to pre-virus levels with the possibility to rise further, but consumers have so far stayed wary as small outbreaks within the country and shrinking income hurt sentiment.That unevenness can also be seen in the gap between the state and private sector, with the former receiving more resources. However, domestic demand is picking up faster than external demand, with China being the first to reopen most of its economy and the rest of the world still largely under lock-downs.Uncertainty and HeadwindsLooking ahead, the recovery momentum may weaken on rising uncertainty and strong headwinds.Pent-up demand that has supported growth in the second quarter will naturally lose some steam. Exports that have been bolstered by demand for medical equipment may fall significantly when production catches up overseas. Rising trade tensions could also hit China’s exports and export-related manufacturing investment.The risks of a second wave will also linger. The recent resurgence of cases in Beijing triggered a re-imposition of restrictions, and sporadic cases around the country continue to occur.Serious floods in southern China could threaten to wipe out much of the country’s output this summer, with 27 provinces being hit to some extent and the current direct losses standing at 61.8 billion yuan, according to state media.Considering the other factors weighing on growth, including unemployment and deflation pressure, a reversal from the current accommodative policy stance is unlikely.“Despite the strong recovery between March and mid-June, we believe a full economic recovery remains distant,” Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura International Ltd in Hong Kong, wrote in a note. “It is too early for Beijing to reverse its easing stance.”Global ImplicationsAs the country first hit by the coronavirus pandemic and first to climb out of the slump, China’s recovery still implies a brighter outlook for the rest of the world ahead if the pandemic can be arrested.“China is showing that the virus can be contained, but the trade-off has been very tight pandemic mitigation policies, among the tightest across major economies,” said Shaun Roache, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. “The lesson here is that virus containment is not enough to drive a quick rebound and that we may have to wait for a lasting medical solution to truly get back to business-as-usual.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-set-to-post-return-to-growth-after-easing-lockdowns/story-hvJvuuA2ppy5iC2yex5nqI.html

He said that countries need to be able to trust that 5G equipment and software will not threaten national security, economic security, privacy, intellectual property, or human rights.“We welcome news that the United Kingdom plans to ban Huawei from future 5G networks and phase out untrusted Huawei equipment from existing networks. With this decision, the UK joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors,” Pompeo said in a statement.“We will continue to work with our British friends on fostering a secure and vibrant 5G ecosystem, which is critical to Transatlantic security and prosperity,” it added.The momentum in favour of secure 5G is building. The UK joins democracies such as the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Sweden in banning Huawei from future 5G networks, he said.“Clean carriers like Jio in India, Telstra in Australia, SK and KT in South Korea, NTT in Japan, and others have also prohibited the use of Huawei equipment in their networks,” he addedThe UK on Tuesday announced its decision to ban British companies from buying Huawei-produced equipment for 5G networks from the end of the year.“We have been clear-eyed from the start that Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE were deemed to be high-risk...The NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) has now reported to ministers that they have significantly changed their security assessment of Huawei’s presence in the UK’s 5G network...The UK can no longer be confident it will be able to guarantee the security of future Huawei 5G equipment...,” Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, told the UK Parliament.This comes in the backdrop of US designating Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE Corp as national security threats, saying they have close ties with the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military apparatus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-welcomes-uk-s-huawei-ban-says-carriers-like-jio-have-prohibited-its-equipment/story-ZftWXIBMQiV0IO93AQEnvK.html

15-07-2020||World||Britain bans China’s Huawei, handing US big win||Britain on Tuesday bowed to growing US pressure and ordered the phased removal of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from its 5G network despite warnings of retaliation from Beijing.The policy reversal hands a long-sought victory to US President Donald Trump’s administration in its geopolitical tug-of-war with China.The White House said the decision “reflects a growing international consensus that Huawei and other untrusted vendors pose a threat to national security, as they remain beholden to the Chinese Communist Party”.But the move threatens to further damage Britain’s ties with the Asian power and carry a big cost for UK mobile providers that have relied on Huawei equipment for nearly 20 years.Huawei called it “politicised” and likely to put Britain “in the digital slow lane”.China’s ambassador in London, Liu Xiaoming, called it a “disappointing and wrong decision”.“It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries,” he wrote on Twitter.The politically-fraught change in Britain’s digital future was made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson during a meeting with his cabinet and National Security Council.It requires companies to stop buying new 5G equipment from Huawei starting next year and strip out existing gear by the end of 2027.“This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one for the UK telecoms networks, for our national security and our economy,” digital minister Oliver Dowden told parliament.- US sanctions -Johnson infuriated Trump and upset some members of his own Conservative party by allowing the Chinese leader in global 5G technology to help roll out Britain’s speedy new data network in January.The UK was then completing its tortuous departure from the European Union and looking to establish strong ties with powerful Asian economies that could fulfil Johnson’s vision of a “Global Britain”.But the Trump administration told the UK government that its choice imperilled intelligence sharing because British signals could be intercepted or manipulated by China.Washington believes the private company can also shut down rival countries’ 5G networks under Beijing’s orders in times of war.Huawei has always denied this and pointed to two decades of cooperation with British security agencies that checked on the safety of its existing 3G and 4G networks.The British review was triggered by Washington sanctions in May that blocked Huawei’s access to US chips at the heart of 5G networks.The sanctions did not impact older 3G and 4G providers and Britain left its guidance for those networks unchanged.‘Outages’Johnson had come under intensifying pressure to not only dump Huawei but also adopt a tough line with China for its treatment of Hong Kong and repression of ethnic Uighurs in the western Xinjiang region.But he also pledged to voters last year to bring broadband access to all Britons by 2025.British telecoms companies had lobbied strongly against the policy reversal because of the cost of taking existing equipment out and finding untested alternatives.Dowden conceded Britons will now have to wait longer to get full access to the rapid new network.“This means a cumulative delay to 5G roll-out of two to three years and costs of up to £2 billion ($2.5 billion, 2.2 billion euros),” he said. “This will have real consequences for the connections on which all our constituents rely.”But officials insisted that Huawei had managed to install only a “small amount” of equipment since the 5G system began being offered to UK consumers last year.DiversificationJohnson has challenged the Trump administration to come up with a reliable and cost-effective alternative to the Chinese firm.Britain is pushing for the creation of a 5G club of nations that can pool their resources and provide individual components for an alternative solution that could be applied across the world.The UK government said the process would begin with South Korea’s Samsung and Japan’s NEC -- two veterans with broad production capabilities -- while offering protection for Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson to ensure they remained viable players in the field.Ericsson’s regional head Arun Bansal said his firm was “ready to work with the UK operators to meet their timetable, with no disruption to customers”.Nokia’s chief executive for UK and Ireland, Cormac Whelan, said the firm also has “the capacity and expertise to replace all of the Huawei equipment in the UK’s networks at scale and speed”.But UK officials caution that all existing players have some Huawei equipment in their supply chains that needs to be taken into account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-bans-china-s-huawei-handing-us-big-win/story-hPh9rMBXbjHvHkXSAzRmLM.html

These were more likely to occur after the second dose and in people who got the highest dose.Experts say a vaccine is needed to put an end to the coronavirus pandemic that has sickened millions and caused nearly 575,000 deaths worldwide. Moderna was the first to start human testing of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus on March 16, 66 days after the genetic sequence of the virus was released.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose researchers developed Moderna’s vaccine candidate, called the results “good news,” noting that the study found no serious adverse events and the vaccine produced “reasonably high” levels of virus-killing or neutralizing antibodies. “If your vaccine can induce a response comparable with natural infection, that’s a winner,” Fauci said in a telephone interview. “That’s why we’re very pleased by the results.”Moderna shares jumped more than 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday.The US government is supporting Moderna’s vaccine with nearly half a billion dollars and has chosen it as one of the first to enter large-scale human trials. A successful vaccine could be a turning point for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna, which has never had a licensed product.Moderna’s shot, mRNA-1273, uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) - a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins. When injected into people, the vaccine instructs cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the coronavirus, which the body recognises as a foreign invader, and mounts an immune response against.The results released Tuesday involved three doses of the vaccine, tested in groups of 15 volunteers aged 18-55 who got two shots, 28 days apart. The groups tested 25, 100 or 250 micrograms of the vaccine.Adverse events after the second dose occurred in seven of the 13 volunteers who got the 25-microgram dose, all 15 participants who received the 100 microgram dose and all 14 who got the 250 microgram dose. In the highest-dose group, three patients had severe reactions such as fever, chills, headache or nausea. One of these had a fever of 103.28 Fahrenheit (39.6 C). “We didn’t see any events that are characterized as serious adverse events,” said lead author Dr Lisa Jackson of Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, referring to reactions that require hospitalization or result in death. In June, Moderna said it selected the 100-microgram dose for its late-stage study to minimize adverse reactions. At that dose, Moderna said the company is on track to deliver about 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, starting in 2021, from the company’s internal US manufacturing site and strategic collaboration with Swiss drugmaker Lonza
15-07-2020||World||Trump signs bill, order rebuking China, and slams Biden||President Donald Trump signed legislation and an executive order on Tuesday that he said will hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong, then quickly shifted his policy speech into a political one, hurling broadsides against Democratic rival Joe Biden.The legislation and order are part of the Trump administration’s stepped-up offensive against China for what he calls the rising Asian superpower’s exploitation of America and its effort to conceal details about the human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus from the world. The almost daily administration attacks on Beijing come as Trump defends his own response to the virus, with cases surging in parts of the United States, and as he works ahead of the election to portray Biden as soft on China.“So Joe Biden and President Obama freely allowed China to pillage our factories, plunder our communities and steal our most precious secrets,” Trump said, adding, “I’ve stopped it largely.”Trump said that as vice president, Biden advocated for the Paris Agreement addressing climate change; Trump withdrew the US from the accord. “It would have crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute the atmosphere with impunity, yet one more gift from Biden to the Chinese Communist Party,” Trump said.Trump talked up his own tough approach to Beijing, though he spent the early weeks of the pandemic praising Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two nations signed phase one of a trade deal, but since then, relations have soured and Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden that he has no interest in talking to Xi.The legislation Trump signed into law targets police units that have cracked down on Hong Kong protesters as well as Chinese Communist Party officials responsible for imposing a new, strict national security law widely seen as chipping away at Hong Kong’s autonomy. The mandatory sanctions are also required to be imposed on banks that conduct business with the officials.While he signed the bill into law, Trump issued a statement saying the administration would not view as binding certain sections of the law that the White House believes limit a president’s powers to conduct foreign policy.Lawmakers from both parties have urged Trump to take strong action in response to China’s new national security law that erodes the “one country, two systems” framework under which Britain handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997. Hong Kong is considered a special administrative region within China and has its own governing and economic systems.“This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom,” Trump said. “Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away, and with it goes Hong Kong in my opinion because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets. A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect.”The executive order he signed did not appear to go beyond his administration’s previous determinations that Hong Kong is no longer eligible for preferential treatment from the United States. Trump said the order strikes those privileges but, in fact, the administration already has been in the process of eliminating them for nearly two months.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo first made the determination in late May that China’s decision to impose a new national security law in Hong Kong meant the former British territory was no longer a democracy and so was no longer eligible for trade, commercial and other US perks it had enjoyed. Just three days later, when Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the World Health Organization because of Chinese influence, he echoed Pompeo’s determination and instructed his administration to immediately begin eliminating the preferences, which it did.In late June, the administration barred Hong Kong from importing US weapons, saying its purchase of items that have both civilian and military applications would be subject to the same licensing requirements as mainland China. Other actions in the works include suspending an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, something Australia has already done, as well as ending legal cooperation agreements, taxation accords and financial understandings that cover accounting rules for Chinese businesses that work in the USAt the same time, the administration has pressed ahead with travel bans for Chinese, Hong Kong and communist party officials the US believes are responsible for curtailing democracy in Hong Kong.The administration also also gone after China by imposing travel bans on officials for repressing minorities in western China and hindering foreigners’ access to Tibet. On Monday, Pompeo announced that the US had decided to reject outright virtually all Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea, a determination that could lead to increased tensions in disputed, critical international shipping lanes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-signs-bill-order-rebuking-china-and-slams-biden/story-VXALGlvRk5Vk0BedvgpldN.html
15-07-2020||World||New York Times editor resigns, saying she was harassed for her ideas||Bari Weiss, an opinion editor at The New York Times, quit her job on Tuesday with a public resignation letter that alleged harassment and a hostile work environment created by people who disagreed with her.Andrew Sullivan, another prominent journalist who expressed concern that a “woke” culture is crowding out dissenting opinion, similarly announced his resignation from New York magazine.Sullivan is a conservative columnist and Weiss is considered conservative by some, although she labels herself a centrist.“Intellectual curiosity is now a liability at The Times,” said Weiss, who was also a writer at the newspaper.She was brought to the Times in 2017 by James Bennet, the opinion editor who lost his job in the aftermath of an op-ed published by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton that advocated using federal troops to quell unrest in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Some Black reporters at The Times said they felt endangered by the piece and they were supported by dozens of colleagues.She wrote that she was hired to attract new voices to the Times in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election, but that lessons from that time hadn’t been learned.“Instead, a new consensus has emerged in the press, but perhaps especially at this paper: that truth isn’t a process of collective discovery, but an orthodoxy already known to an enlightened few whose job is to inform everyone else,” she wrote.She said she was openly smeared and demeaned by colleagues who didn’t fear their behavior would be checked.“Showing up to work as a centrist at an American newspaper should not require bravery,” Weiss wrote.Kathleen Kingsbury, acting editorial page editor at the newspaper, said she wants to ensure that viewpoints from across the political spectrum are published.The Times didn’t address Weiss’ specific harassment allegations.“We’re committed to fostering an environment of honest, searching and empathetic dialogue between colleagues, one where mutual respect is required of all,” spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said.On Twitter, Sullivan wrote that “the mob” bullied Weiss for thought crimes “and her editors stood by and watched.”Later, he tweeted that he was resigning as a columnist at New York magazine for “reasons that are pretty self-evident.” He didn’t specify those reasons but said he’ll have a farewell column later this week and will continue his work elsewhere.In a June 12 column titled “Is There Still Room to Debate?” Sullivan wrote about an increasingly furious campaign to quell dissent from the central idea that society’s evils stem from discrimination against Blacks.“In these past two weeks, if you didn’t put up on Instagram or Facebook some kind of slogan or symbol displaying your wokeness, you were instantly suspect,” he wrote.David Haskell, editor-in-chief of New York magazine, said he and Sullivan both agreed that his ideas and the magazine’s were no longer a match.“While I found myself often disagreeing with his politics, I also found it valuable to be publishing work that challenged my thinking,” he said in a memo to staff members.He said he’ll continue to push work that challenges the liberal assumptions of much of New York’s readership, while acknowledging that such commentary is difficult to get right in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-times-editor-resigns-saying-she-was-harassed-for-her-ideas/story-bC4jDwp3F4yWbaS0erDiKP.html
15-07-2020||World||‘Not interested in talking to China’: Donald Trump on Phase 2 of trade deal||As tensions between China and US heighten, President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he is not interested in talking to China regarding a Phase Two of the trade deal.“I’m not interested right now in talking to China,” Trump said in an interview with CBS News. “We made a great trade deal. But as soon as the deal was done, the ink wasn’t even dry and they hit us with the plague.”Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping signed the Phase One deal in January. The two sides described the pact as a first-phase agreement, to be followed by new negotiations toward a more expansive deal in a second and possibly third phase.The world’s two largest economies never set a timeline for the second phase, however, and trade negotiations were quickly overshadowed as countries around the world grappled with the coronavirus pandemic.The economic fallout from the pandemic also made it increasingly unlikely that China would meet its targets for expanded purchases of US goods under the Phase-One deal, fueling further doubts about prospects for new talks.The US had a USD 308 billion trade deficit in goods and services with China in 2019, due to the US importing far more goods than it exports. That deficit is little changed since 2016, when Trump took office but is down from a peak imbalance of nearly USD 380 billion that was reached in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-interested-in-talking-to-china-donald-trump-on-phase-2-of-trade-deal/story-DSifs7oCAKjTegGBUUERTJ.html

Brian Oleksyk said.A sheriff’s deputy spotted the man’s vehicle in a residential neighborhood and shot him when he got out of his car and tried to attack her, Oleksyk said.“Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!” the officer, a 22-year veteran, demanded, according to neighborhood security video released by police.The man, Sean Ruis, was holding a screwdriver and knives, Eaton County Sheriff Tom Reich said.“It’s very unfortunate she had to use her weapon, but she had to save her life,” Reich said. “She had to use deadly force. She did it properly.”Ruis, 43, of Grand Ledge, who worked at the Michigan Department of Transportation, died at a hospital. He was suspected of stabbing a 77-year-old man inside the store when he was confronted about not wearing a mask, Oleksyk said.The stabbing victim was in stable condition at a hospital. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered people to wear masks in stores to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.“The goal here is to be safe. We all have to do our part so this doesn’t spread,” Reich said.The decision about whether to wear a mask in public for some has become a political statement, and there have been other violent encounters. In May, a security guard at a Family Dollar store in Flint was fatally shot after denying entry to a customer without a mask.Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Republican, said masks are important. But he also urged the general public not to confront people over a lack of a mask.“There is no reason to risk your health or your life over the debate of wearing masks in public,” Shirkey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-killed-by-police-after-mask-dispute-at-michigan-store/story-BPLKLn4q6hiuQmSHaPYTxJ.html
15-07-2020||World||Donald Trump ends Hong Kong’s special status with US to punish China||President Donald Trump said he issued an order to end Hong Kong’s special status with the US and signed legislation that would sanction Chinese officials responsible for cracking down on political dissent in Hong Kong, the latest escalation in tensions between the world’s largest economies.“No administration has been tougher on China than this administration,” Trump said Tuesday at the White House.Trump, speaking in the Rose Garden, announced both moves, and used the event to repeat attacks on his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, portraying him as having been cozy with China during his time as vice president.Trump approved the legislation on Tuesday after spending weeks blaming Beijing for the coronavirus pandemic and criticizing its handling of Hong Kong. The president has faced widespread criticism over his response to the virus, with cases once again surging as businesses reopen.Under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, the US treats Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous part of China with its own legal and economic system, differently than the Chinese mainland in trade, commerce and other areas.Trump said that his order meant that Hong Kong would now be treated the same as mainland China.The bipartisan legislation that Trump also signed comes in response to the Chinese government’s new national security law for the former British colony, which critics say is aimed at quashing political protests and stifling dissent. People found guilty under the law could, in some cases, face life imprisonment.Targeting BanksThe legislation would penalize banks doing business with Chinese officials involved in the national security law the country is seeking to impose on Hong Kong. It’s the latest in a series of efforts designed to pressure China amid tensions over the spread of the coronavirus, implementation of a trade pact finalized earlier this year, and efforts to tighten control over Hong Kong.The legislation would require the State Department to report to Congress every year about officials who seek to undermine the “one country, two systems” model that applies to the special administrative region. It also gives the president the power to seize the assets of and block entry to the US for those individuals.Under the legislation, banks are granted a kind of year-long grace period to stop doing business with entities and individuals the State Department determines to be “primary offenders” when it comes to undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy.After that period, the Treasury Department can impose a variety of penalties on those institutions, including barring top executives from entering the US and restricting the ability to engage in US dollar-denominated transactions, according to Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who co-sponsored the legislation.Hong Kong AnnouncementTrump announced last month that he would end preferential treatment for Hong Kong, and signed legislation aimed at punishing Chinese officials for oppression of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups.The tougher stance toward Beijing represents a pivot for Trump, who largely avoided human rights-related interventions as he was negotiating the first phase of his trade deal. On Monday, the US president said the deal was still “intact” because China was purchasing the promised agricultural products. But Trump also expressed frustration with the country over the spread of the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan.“What they did to the world should not be forgotten,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-ends-hong-kong-s-special-status-with-u-s-to-punish-china/story-TcH9QqOsZivNodKExecJtN.html

Step by step their arguments are being dismantled, and Qatar’s position vindicated.” Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates cut ties with Qatar in the summer of 2017 over its support for Islamist opposition groups that they view as terrorists.They also launched an economic boycott, stopping Qatar Airways flights from using their airspace, closing off the small country’s sole land border with Saudi Arabia and blocking its ships from using their ports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-court-rules-in-qatar-s-favour-in-aviation-boycott-case/story-J1azmAvlRACG00LMo0UC8K.html

I’ll keep fighting to make sure it stays that way,” Elizabeth Warren, Democratic senator and former presidential candidate, wrote on twitter. “When we fight back, we can make a real difference.”Foreign students enrolled in US institutions offering online-only classes for their fall semester will be not allowed to come to the US and if they are already here they may be forced to leave, unless a majority of their coursework was taught in-person, according to a proposed rule the Trump administration announced Monday, according to an announcement from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency last week. It was expected to be notified later this month.But foreign students of colleges and universities that were shifting to a hybrid model of mixed online and in-person classes will be allowed opt for more online classes than previously allowed. But these institutions had show to authorities that hey had indeed shifted to this model, also called “blended”.The Unites States has admitted an estimated 1 million international students every year, who generated around $41 billion worth of economic activity and supported 450,000 jobs, according to the American Council on Education, which represents US colleges and universities. Incomes generated from foreign students are critical to the financial health of many US colleges.China, India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Canada are the top-five sources of international students, in that order.Indian government has raised the issue with the United States at a meeting of senior officials, called Foreign Office Consultations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-rescinds-foreign-students-order/story-1FT9ytQGts5kmfomV4AmVJ.html

The court is expected to take up his plea on July 24.Vadakkumcherry, a priest of the Syro-Malabar church, was convicted of raping and impregnating a 16-year-old girl in 2016. The girl gave birth to her child in 2017, and a genetic test confirmed the former vicar’s crime. He was later defrocked by Pope Francis. The girl, who was a student of a church-run institute where 54-year-old Vadakkumchery taught, was declared a hostile witness for claiming that she was 18 at the time of the rape. However, her birth certificate proved her age. Her father too claimed responsibility for the crime during the investigation but eventually broke down and named the accused. The scientific evidence against the priest was irrefutable.During the 2018 trial, Vadakkumchery and the survivor’s parents made a similar suggestion of marriage, which the court rejected it before sentencing him to 20 years of concurrent rigorous imprisonment. The trial court had also directed the police to register a case against parents for retracting their statements. Reformists in the church said it was a ploy by Vadakkumchery to have his sentence commuted. “We are sure the judiciary will see through his designs,” said Shyju Antony, joint convenor of Save Our Sisters, a reformist body floated in the wake of protest against former Bishop of Jalandhar Franco Mulakkal, who is accused of raping a nun.The case surfaced in 2017 after the rape survivor gave birth to a baby in the church-run Christu Raja Hospital in Koothuparambha of Kannur district. Attempts were made to hush the matter up, and the child was even put up for adoption. Investigations also revealed that the priest was protected by several Church-run institutions. However, six other persons, including the doctors who helped deliver the child and the superintendent of a Wayanad orphanage were acquitted for a lack of evidence. Vadakkumchery, who was once tipped to become bishop of Mananthavady was arrested near Kochi airport while trying to flee to Canada.During the trial, the church itself came under criticism as special prayers were conducted in some churches to seek his release on the day the verdict was delivered.When asked about the latest petition, a spokesperson of the Mananthavady Diocese refused to comment stating that Vadakkumchery was no longer a member of the clergy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-priest-in-jail-for-raping-minor-moves-hc-for-nod-to-marry-victim/story-RtAxIRWi4e465Wla5AGW9O.html

Addressing reporters in Chitradurga, the minister said, “Worldwide the number of Corona cases is increasing. All of us should be alert. Whether you are ruling or in opposition, rich or poor, the virus doesn’t discriminate. Cases - I am sure one hundred percent - will only go up in the next two months. One can keep claiming government negligence or irresponsibility of ministers or that cases are going up because of a lack of coordination among ministers.

The case fatality rate (CFR) among doctors is 7.6%, an analysis of the data reveals, which is much higher than the national average of about 2.5%. Of the 99, about 73 doctors were above the age of 50. The voluntary organisation of doctors with chapters across India said that the data showed both young and old doctors were equally infected, but the mortality was higher among the old. “While this is on expected lines there is scope for lessening deaths across the age spectrum. Covid death amongst doctors is of great concern,” said Dr Ranjan Sharma, national president of IMA.Citing the data, Indian Medical Association (IMA) declared a red alert for doctors and medical administration. A letter signed by Dr Sharma and Honorary Secretary General Dr R V Asokan said that best practices must be followed to reduce fatalities among doctors. “Working hours to be tempered by concerns of safety. Providing PPE, triaging, physical distancing and sanitisers should be monitored. Operation theatres, labour rooms, laboratories and casualty require special care. ICU and critical care units deserve close scrutiny for adherence to best practices and protocols,” the letter suggested.Any gap in providing safety of doctors, nurses and staff needs to be closed, the organisation said. A feedback system from doctors, employees and public must be put in place, it added.The letter also called for meticulous adherence to cleaning and sanitizing protocols in healthcare facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-300-infections-99-deaths-among-doctors-so-far-ima-data/story-VTgYshrFibZnajIcQrvPEN.html

At about 9 pm during shift change, it was observed that the intensity of vacuum in the tank had gone up and Malleswara Rao had cut off the steam supply to reactor and gone to the second floor to check the vacuum pumps.Also Read: Andhra Pradesh to reorganise its 13 districts into 25 for optimal use of resourcesWhen he came down to the first floor, he found smoke coming out from the shaft seal of agitator of reactor 102. He immediately alerted Srinivasa Rao asking him to run out of the block, but by that time, the reactor had exploded, the report said.While Malleshwar Rao sustained burn injuries on the body, Srinivasa Rao was found dead at the incident spot the next morning.The committee observed that the chemists on shift had failed to maintain the required vacuum pressure in the reactor. “With the increase in intensity of vacuum the boiling point of the above chemical mixture obviously decreased and it reached the flash point resulting in explosion,” the committee said.Minister for industries Mekapati Gautam Reddy said the company management had agreed to extend ex gratia of Rs 35 lakh to the family of the deceased chemist Srinivasa Rao, while the state government would release another Rs 15 lakh from the chief minister’s relief fund.“Similarly, an amount of Rs 20 lakh would be paid to the family of Malleshwar Rao who sustained burn injuries,” he said.Main opposition Telugu Desam Party on Wednesday demanded that the state government should pay ex gratia of Rs 1 crore to the family of the deceased chemist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visakha-solvents-explosion-was-result-of-negligence-by-chemists-on-shift-rules-expert-panel/story-PowwvHbNqbH62XKIVjTyrL.html

Formal talks on such a pact can only begin after December 31, but some talks on exploring ‘building blocks’ have begun. Other sectors identified are food and drink, life sciences and chemicals to address non-tariff barriers to trade.Official sources here said the 14th Joint Economic and Trade Committee (Jetco) – the annual mechanism for government-to-government negotiations – is scheduled for July 24 between Commerce minister Piyush Goyal and International trade secretary Elizabeth Truss virtually.Minister of state for Commerce Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday held a virtual bilateral meeting with Ranil Jayawardena, the UK’s minister for International Trade, to discuss market access and other bilateral trade issues as a prelude to the Jetco meeting.British ministers have emphasised to Indian interlocutors that the country would not become protectionist, but more open after leaving the EU. The Brexit process is currently in the one-year transition phase that ends on December 31, when the UK’s exit will be complete.The UK’s eagerness for an FTA with India has been met with a wait-and-watch approach in New Delhi, where a review of FTAs with various countries is envisaged by Goyal to protect the interests of Indian industry and traders.In the long-stalled EU-India free trade talks, easier mobility of Indian professionals (the so-called Mode 4) is one of the key areas New Delhi has been insisting on. Brussels believes that there will be better chances of reaching the agreement with India after Britain leaves the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/post-brexit-trade-with-india-to-focus-on-5-sectors/story-ljexiVDTCpopXL0aS173OL.html

In the petition, Vadakkumchery (54) said he will have to look after his child and establish his parenthood and needs parole to solemnize his marriage. The High Court is expected to take up his plea on July 24.During the trial in 2018 he and the survivor’s parents also came out with the same suggestion but the court rejected it and sentenced him to 20 years rigorous of imprisonment. The trial court had also directed the police to register a case against parents for retracting their earlier statements. A year after his conviction, in February 2019 he was defrocked by Pope Francis.Reformists in the church said the marriage proposal was another ploy by Vadakkumchery to get his sentence commuted. “We are sure the judiciary will see through his designs,” said Shyju Antony, joint convener of Save Our Sisters, a reformist body floated in the wake of protests against former Bishop of Jalandhar Franco Mullakal for alleged rape.Vadakkumchery was also sentenced to imprisonment for impregnating the survivor who was then 17 years old. The case in Mananthavady diocese surfaced in early 2017 after the rape survivor, a higher secondary student, gave birth to a baby in the church-run Christu Raja Hospital in Koothuparambha of Kannur district. She was a student of a school run by the church. it is one of the many educational institutions that Vadakkumchery managed. Vadakkumchery tried to cover up his crime. Initially, the survivor’s father owned up the crime of raping his daughter and was arrested. However, police found discrepancies in his statements and during sustained interrogation he broke down and named Vadakkumchery as the culprit. He said he was forced by church authorities to own up a crime he did not commit. Vadakkumchery, who was once tipped to become Mananthawady Bishop, was arrested near Kochi airport while trying to flee to Canada.The trial which began in 2018 in the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court in Thalassery in north Kerala saw many twists and turns. The survivor, who had crossed 18 then, had told the court that she had consensual sex and they should be allowed to live together. Later, her parents and many other witnesses also turned hostile.In February 2019 Vadakkumchery was sentenced to a total of 60 years of rigorous imprisonment and slapped Rs 3 lakh fine under various offences. Since the sentences are running concurrently he has to spend 20 years in jail. When asked about Vadakkumchery latest move a spokesman of the Mananthawady Diocese refused any comment saying he was no longer a member of the clergy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-kerala-priest-a-rape-convict-moves-court-to-marry-survivor/story-3yl9Jo9LwRwhNv7CQzM5wL.html

If COVID-19 mortality has to be lessened, it has to start with doctors and hospitals,” the doctors’ body said in a statement on Wednesday.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesMajority of the casualties among the doctors are among the general practitioners. The IMA appealed to the leadership of doctors to adopt all scientific best practices to reduce the spectre of death hanging over the heads of medical professionals engaged in saving the lives of hundreds of thousands infected by the disease.This requires intense review and updating of all administrative set ups in the hospitals, including infection control protocols. Any gap in providing for the safety of doctors, nurses and staff have to be plugged, it said in the statement.IMA also stressed on the need to put in place a feedback system from the doctors, employees and public apart from a meticulous adherence to cleaning and sanitising protocols inside treatment facilities.“Analysis of data shows that while senior and young doctors are equally infected with COVID-19, mortality is higher among elders. While this is on expected lines, there is scope for lessening deaths across the age spectrum. Meticulous adherence to norms and discipline inside hospitals will have a salutary effect,” the statement said.National President of IMA Dr Rajan Sharma said that while the medical profession remains the beacon of hope for the nation in its fight against the pandemic, COVID-19 death among doctors has become a matter of great concern.“IMA strongly advocates the leadership of doctors in adopting all scientific best practices. Doctors need to take charge of the situation and ensure the safety of themselves, their families, their colleagues and staff,” said Sharma.He added that senior doctors in decision making positions have enhanced responsibility of taking care of their flock.Among other measures, the medical body advised implementing a friendly and scientific batch posting method along with tempering the number of working hours guided by concerns of safety. It added that operation theaters, labour rooms, laboratories and casualties require special care and ICUs and Critical Care units needed close scrutiny for adherence to best practices and protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/99-doctors-have-died-fighting-covid-19-ima-sounds-red-alert/story-biwJIkaUVfRPejhJYEj8DK.html
15-07-2020||India||Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s brother-in-law appointed state MP Congress vice-president||Madhya Pradesh Congress unit president Kamal Nath nominated chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s brother-in-law Sanjay Singh Masani as the vice-president of the grand old party’s state unit on Wednesday, party functionaries said.But there was confusion over Masani’s role in the party after he initially claimed that he would also act as a coordinator for the publicity campaign for all the 25 assembly constituencies in the state where bye elections are to be held.However, Kamal Nath’s office denied that Masani was given any responsibility other than that of the party’s state unit vice-president.Masani who originally belongs to Gondia in Maharashtra joined the Congress from the BJP ahead of 2018 assembly elections. He contested the assembly elections from Wareseoni assembly constituency in Balaghat district, the neighbouring district of Gondia, unsuccessfully while securing the third position with 7.59% of polled votes.Outside politics, he has also dabbled in films and has done cameos. One of those roles was in the 2018 Bollywood movie Padman.“The state Congress president told me over the phone that I have to take care of the responsibility of the bypolls. After assuming office I will have meetings with leaders in charge of all the constituencies and then other leaders up to the block level before going ahead with my work,” Masani said.He described his relationship with chief minister Chouhan as one made by God but said that was not a hurdle to working as a Congressman.“There is no denying the fact that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan happens to be my brother-in-law. This relationship was made by God and it will remain forever but as a Congressman I will do my best to ensure the party’s victory on all the 25 seats. For us, various decisions and its implementation by the then Kamal Nath government during its 15-month rule for farmers, youth, women and other sections of society will be the main issue and also how the government was toppled by the BJP under a conspiracy,” he said.Kamal Nath’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Sanjay Singh Masani has been appointed as the vice-president of the state unit of the party. He has not been given any other responsibility in the party so far.”BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai dismissed Masani’s appointment as immaterial.“Appointment of any individual in the Congress on any post is its internal matter but it will hardly have any effect on the BJP’s prospects in the bypolls. Of course, the state Congress will try a lot of permutations and combinations till the elections as the Congress leaders know the results of the bypolls and the party’s imminent defeat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-s-brother-in-law-appointed-state-mp-congress-vice-president/story-HuD14qgxFOPapojvjNun8N.html
15-07-2020||India||Opposition to India’s biggest hydrocarbon complex in Odisha brews||A Rs 78,225 crore project which involves setting up a mega hydrocarbon complex in coastal Odisha district of Balasore and likely to give employment to about 10,000 youths is facing public opposition over land acquisition.The hydrocarbon complex near the proposed port at Subarnarekha river in Balasore to be developed by Haldia Petrochemicals Limited and it would comprise a 1.08 million tonnes per annum of polyethylene plant, a 1.6 million tonnes of paraxylene per annum and 1.25 million tonnes of purified purified terepthalic acid per annum. The first phase of the project involving an amount of Rs 28,700 crore was sanctioned by the state last year. Kolkata-based HPL had promised to rope in a global oil and petrochemicals company as a strategic partner to provide the feedstock supply. Odisha industry department officials described it as the biggest domestic investment project in the country.However, the project seems to have hit a roadblock with people in Baliapal block, the project site, now opposing land acquisition. On June 9 and June 12, the local administration tried to conduct a public hearing over the project at Aladiha and Jambhirai villages respectively but met with strong public resistance over govt move to remove encroachers of government land.Of the 3,520 acres of land needed for the project, 2,979 acres of land belongs to the government while the rest are private. However, hundreds of people in 6 grampanchayats of Baliapal block of Balasore are doing farming and have set up betel vines over government land. In Jambhirai grampanchayat, one of the project-affected grampanchayat, people are up against the project, saying it would snatch their livelihood.Kartik Nayak, sarpanch of Jambhirai grampanchayat said people would not allow their land to be used for any industrial purpose as it is a highly fertile land. “Our people have been eking out a livelihood for decades. Many villagers don’t have any land which they can call their own and are tilling government land. They are unlikely to find employment in the industrial project due to low literacy level. We are going to oppose this,” said Nayak.Nayak said a couple of days ago, hundreds of women in the affected grampanchayat of Jambhirai had blown conch to show their opposition to the project.Arun Jena, who is leading the protest under the banner of Upakula Bhitamati Suraksha Committee, said people in the affected grampanchayats make at least Rs 7 lakh a year by cultivating paddy, groundnut and betel. “In the name of an industrial project, the government is out to make paupers out of farmers. The government should not forget that people here in the 90s had opposed DRDO’s plan of establishing its missile test range. The hydrocarbon project would meet the same fate,” said Jena.Sambit Kumar Nayak, additional district magistrate of Balasore admitted that the opposition to the project was growing, but added that efforts are on to persuade the villagers. “We are trying to reach out to the people in batches to make them understand about the all-round development that the project would bring to the region. Odisha should not miss out on such a project,” said Nayak.Haldia Petrochemical Limited officials refused to comment on the developments.Meanwhile, business leaders of Odisha said contrary to what some people are trying to portray, the opposition is not widespread. “Some people who have made a career out of opposing any big-ticket project are inciting people against it. The kind of development the project would bring is unimaginable and may change the face of Balasore for all time to come. The government should give a good rehabilitation package to villagers and ensure that land is acquired at the quickest,” said Amit Behera of North Odisha Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Another business leader said the opposition to the project may have been fuelled by popular mistrust over lack of progress in the proposed port project at Chumukh over Subarnarekha river in Baliapal block at a cost of Rs 5,000 crore. Though the foundation stone for the port project was laid over a year and a half ago, no work has started yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/opposition-to-india-s-biggest-hydrocarbon-complex-in-odisha-brews/story-rwLZMLNFu93xUYJw1JrjvN.html

On account of their historical importance and magnificent architecture, these ancient temples will also be renovated and preserved.An initiative by the Kashi Vishwanath Temple administration, the museum will be set up with the help of the department of history of Arts, Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and the National Museum of Archives. An ambitious project backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor is being constructed in around 5 lakh square feet area. To meet the requirement of land for the corridor, around 300 buildings, including houses, were acquired and demolished. This led to the discovery of about 60 temples and several sculptures in the area. Some of the temples were among the buildings, while others were inside the houses.PM Modi reviews plan to enhance Kedarnath’s divinity, make 16-km trek comfortableGaurang Rathi, chief executive of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple, said, “Architecture of about a dozen of these temples is amazing and carving on stones is magnificent and very special. In addition, 30 (out of 60) of these temples are mentioned in Kashi Khand (section) of the Skanda Puran. So it is very important to renovate and preserve these temples in Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham area. We are going to do the preservation with the help of BHU and the National Museum of Archives.”The temple administration has also started working on a project to create a virtual museum of the ancient temples. It will showcase the history and the art of the ancient temples along with the style of architecture used in these ancient temples.Divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal said, “A joint team of BHU and National Museum of Archives will together collect information about the temples, like how old they are, which style of architecture was used in their construction and which ruler built them.”He added that each temple’s high resolution picture with 3- D effect, along with information, would be available in the virtual museum which would also showcase the scenic view of river Ganga and Kashi Vishwanath Corridor. The virtual museum will be made available on the Kashi Vishwanath Temple for a virtual tour, which will recreate temples’ actual physical locations on the corridor premises.The first part of the museum is likely to be ready by September end.Prof Pradosh Mishra, head of the department of history of Arts, BHU, said, “The project intends to bring out the temples unearthed from the complex and promote research. The web repository will help to reconstruct the history of the site as well as safeguard the cultural heritage of Varanasi.”“All the temples unearthed are of historical importance,” Prof Mishra said and added that the work on the web repository project had already begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-a-virtual-tour-of-60-ancient-kashi-temples-hidden-for-a-long-time/story-HM6xs4DR6LFhadLB7VIFvM.html
15-07-2020||India||Now, BJP accused of ‘luring’ Jharkhand MLAs, saffron party says govt hiding failures||Rameshwar Oraon, Jharkhand Congress president and the finance minister in the incumbent coalition government led by chief minister Hemant Soren, has alleged that the BJP is trying to topple the state government by luring some of its legislators but it would not succeed. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Oraon claimed that the saffron party tried to entice a few Congress MLAs during the recently-held Rajya Sabha elections in a bid to form a BJP government, following the example of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. “The BJP has been regularly violating the democratic values. The BJP crossed all limits in Madhya Pradesh and everyone saw how they formed a government there. While there is a provision for appointing non-elected members as ministers as an exception, they have made dozen such appointments. The BJP tried to topple the government in Rajasthan as well by using one person, but has failed,” said Oraon. He tried to draw a parallel by claiming Congress MLAs were offered money and posts during the RS elections to jump ship.“They tried to topple the government by offering money and post to our MLAs during the Rajya Sabha elections. But the legislators of our party and alliance parties are intact. The BJP will never succeed in Jharkhand as our legislators got elected after fighting the BJP on the street for the people,” he added. The coalition government currently has a comfortable majority in the 81-member Jharkhand assembly. Two seats in the assembly are vacant as chief minister Hemant Soren vacated Dumka seat while retaining Barhait after the assembly polls in December last. The Bermo assembly seat fell vacant after senior Congress MLA Rajendra Prasad Singh died in May. While the JMM has 29 legislators in the current assembly, the BJP has 26 members including former chief minister Babulal Marandi, who merged his party, JVM (P), with the saffron party after the assembly polls. The Congress currently has 17 representatives in the legislature, including two members of JVM (P) who joined the party after a spilt in the party. The RJD is the third partner in the alliance with a single legislator in the House. Requiring 27 first preference votes, both JMM and BJP managed to send one party candidate each to Rajya Sabha in the RS election held for two seats in June by bagging 30 and 31 votes, respectively. The Congress candidate could however, secure only 18 votes. Reacting to the allegations, Jharkhand BJP president Deepak Prakash said Oraon’s statement was an attempt to divert attention from the failures of the state government in handling the Corona crisis. “His statement is objectionable. He should instead put their house in order. They do not trust their own legislators and he is trying to be in the news by making such allegations. The truth is that it’s an attempt to divert attention of people from the failure of the Hemant Soren government in handling the Corona crisis,” Prakash said. The senior partner in the ruling alliance, the JMM said while the BJP might try such tricks, it won’t succeed in Jharkhand. “BJP will try to destabilise the Hemant Soren government but it wouldn’t succeed. JMM is a solid wall and it would not collapse,” said JMM principal general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-bjp-accused-of-luring-jharkhand-mlas-saffron-party-says-govt-hiding-failures/story-vylgF3YmKrRMoCbIypyLDJ.html

He was rushed to the local Bhatpara state general hospital and later shifted to a private hospital in Kolkata.Since Kankinara, which is part of the Bhatpara assembly constituency, is a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stronghold, the ruling party accused the BJP of carrying out the attack.Arjun Singh, a former four-time TMC legislator from Bhatpara and former chairman of the local civic body, joined BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and defeated TMC’s two-time MP Dinesh Trivedi from Barrackpore, the Lok Sabha seat under which Bhatpara falls. There have been several clashes in different parts of the constituency, including Bhatpara, during and after the election. Singh’s son is a legislator from Bhatpara.The area has a sizeable Hindi-speaking population comprising jute mill and factory workers hailing mostly from Bihar.“Arjun Singh has established a reign of terror. He has brought shooters from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to carry out attacks on our men. Dharmendra Singh is an active local leader,” said TMC’s district unit president and food minister Jyotipriyo Mullick.“It is BJP that is coming under attack every day. These are baseless allegations. The attack is a fallout of the TMC’s interval dispute over collection of protection money from local factory owners,” said Arjun Singh.Officers from Barrackpore police district rushed to the spot and started an investigation. “We are trying to get a description of the motorcycle and the two riders from local people,” said an officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.In June last year, Arjun Singh sustained head injury when the police resorted to baton charge to stop a clash between his followers and TMC workers in the Jagaddal area of North 24 Parganas district over control of party offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-leader-injured-in-shooting-in-bjp-stronghold-in-bengal-parties-trade-charges/story-fSV4csI6jXR4LbxnfTsLrM.html

Such recruitments of graduates in law, forensics and commerce & other domains would also give an opportunity to the educated youth of Punjab in getting jobs and making careers in the Punjab Police service.  The new positions, however, are unlikely to add any additional wage burden on the force since it will be created through restructuring of the force. The bureau is abolishing 4,849 existing posts to ensure the hiring remains “revenue-neutral”, said the statement.The fresh recruitments would be done after taking out these posts from the purview of the Subordinate Service Selection Board through Police Recruitment Board.The remaining posts of subordinate ranks ranging from Inspectors to Constables out of the total 4,521 sanctioned posts in Punjab Bureau of Investigation would initially be filled up by deputation from Punjab Police and, thereafter, by promotion from the ranks of Punjab Bureau of Investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-police-1st-to-employ-field-experts-to-give-cutting-edge-to-investigations/story-Ho0NhRZgCB676muHL5d9WO.html

It had spent a few hours resting near the national highway 37 that passes close to the park before it took shelter in the kitchen of a thatched hut in a nearby Baghmari village,” informed KNPTR director P. Sivakumar.“We kept observing the tigress the entire time hoping that it would move out on its own. In the meantime, the family was shifted to a forest guest house. As we were worried about the animal’s health, it was tranquilised at 2:30 pm on Wednesday and rescued,” he added.A team comprising veterinarian Shamsul Ali and forest personnel who carried out the rescue operation took the tigress to the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) located at Borjuri near the national park where it is recuperating.“The tigress has recovered from anaesthesia and is out of danger. She doesn’t appear to have suffered any injuries. We will keep her under observation for 2-3 days before releasing her in the park,” head of CWRC Rathin Barman said.The rescued tigress is one of the two tigers that had strayed out of the park on Tuesday to escape flood waters. While the other tiger was successfully driven out of the area and reached the higher locations in nearby Karbi Anglong district safely, the tigress had moved into a hut.On Monday, a sub-adult male tiger had come out of the Agratoli range of the park to escape flood waters and took shelter in a goat shed in Kandolimari village for several hours before moving back to the park.Floods, which ravage Kaziranga, the largest habitat of one-horned rhinos in the world, annually affects its inhabitants who try to find safety in higher locations or cross the nearby NH 37 and head to the hills in Karbi Anglong district.On Tuesday, an adult rhino had come out of the park’s Kohora range and spent some time on the national highway before heading back to the park.

The Haryana government has no role in it.” Khattar was reported as saying on being asked about the rebel MLAs staying at a hotel in Haryana’s Manesar, also not far from the national capital of Delhi.Earlier today, Pilot, too, scorched speculations and stated that he was not considering joining the BJP, the principal opposition party in Rajasthan.Following his statement, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked Pilot to not accept the “hospitality” of BJP-ruled Haryana, if he was not joining the BJP.“Come back to your family, sit with your family and place your view before the family,” Surjewala was quoted as saying by ANI in Jaipur, where MLAs loyal to CM Ashok Gehlot are camping.Sachin Pilot and 18 of his followers were earlier served with disqualification notices from the state assembly on the request of the party chief. They have been given time till Friday to reply.While the party is asking Pilot to return and sort things out, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on the other hand sought to set the record straight by accusing his former deputy of direct involvement in the alleged horse-trading of ruling party MLAs in connivance with BJP to bring down his government.How the Rajasthan impasse is different from Madhya Pradesh sagaWhile Gehlot didn’t take Pilot’s name, he also left little doubt over the identity of the person he was targeting.“Our deputy chief minister and PCC president himself was doing the deal and was giving statements that no horse-trading was taking place. What clarification are you giving when you yourself were involved?” he asked.Pilot was sacked as the deputy CM and party’s Rajasthan unit chief on Tuesday.Pilot had earlier indirectly accused Gehlot of conspiring to defame him and lower his image in the eyes of the Gandhi family. He had also denied any truck with the BJP with an aim to topple the Rajasthan government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-asks-pilot-to-vacate-haryana-hotel-to-delink-with-bjp-khattar-says-hotels-welcome-everyone/story-VjOd7gb2vqU4cQsCdtdH8H.html
15-07-2020||India||Mulayam biopic trailer goes online||The trailer of a biopic on Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav has been released online by the film’s producer Meena Sethi Mondal. The film, titled Main Mulayam Singh Yadav, would probably be released in October if the theatres were allowed to reopen by then, said its director Suvendu Raj Ghosh on the phone from Mumbai.“There is no point in releasing the movie online because it is related with Dhartiputra (son of the soil) and most of the audience that we are expecting would be from the rural pockets. The movie carries the aspirations of labourers, villagers and farmers. They are the ones who would come to watch the movie about their hero. We can’t expect the rural folks to watch the movie online,” Ghosh added.“Netaji (Mulayam) was happy when he saw the trailer (which released on Monday). He knows what it takes for a farmer’s son to work hard for bringing about a change in the society,” he said.Ghosh also said, “If things don’t improve by October, I will release the movie near the state assembly elections, that means at the end of 2021.” The state assembly elections are due in early 2022.Amyth Sethi features in the title role as Mulayam Singh Yadav. Mimoh, son of film star Mithun Chakraborty, has essayed the character of Mulayam’s brother Shivpal Singh Yadav. Prerna Mondal appears as Mulayam Singh Yadav’s wife. Prakash Balbeto has played the role of Ram Manohar Lohia and Govind Namdeo appears as Chaudhary Charan Singh. Noted actress Zareena Wahab and Anupam Shyam have played the roles of Mulayam’s mother and father respectively. While Toshi and Sharib have composed the music, Saleem Shaikh has penned the lyrics.Suvendu Raj Ghosh said, “I met him many times to study his character. He was very down to earth .This film is a must for anyone in the Samajwadi Party as it would enable to know the struggle of their leader. I have highlighted some unknown facts about his life.”“What Mulayam Singh Yadav did for his state and people is astonishing. I am honoured to bring his journey to the 70mm screen,” said Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mulayam-biopic-trailer-goes-online/story-9LSmjbGuKPv7WQyvK62RAP.html

I want to categorically state that those reports are baseless. This was an internal NSUI meeting and we only discussed students and youth issues,” All India Congress Committee (AICC) joint secretary and national in-charge of NSUI, Ruchi Gupta tweeted.Gupta’s rebuttal came after a news agency tweeted citing sources who quoted Gandhi as saying at the NSUI meeting, “If anybody wants to leave the party they will. It opens the door for young leaders like you.” Rahul Gandhi has not commented on the crisis in Rajasthan that the Congress party has been grappling with this week. On Monday, the former Congress chief’s office said “Sachin Pilot is always in his heart. And they speak often and directly. They have great respect and affection for each other.”This response came when HT asked for Rahul Gandhi’s rejoinder to whether he had been in touch with Pilot, Although Pilot has been dropped as deputy chief minister in the Ashok Gehlot cabinet sacked as the party chief in Rajasthan, the Congress party has not yet shut the door on him.On Wednesday, the party asked Pilot to “stop all conversation with the BJP and return to Jaipur”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baseless-says-congress-on-reports-of-rahul-gandhi-s-purported-comment-on-sachin-pilot/story-NTeSO1eeDlbNuktjwP7PHJ.html

The state of Maharashtra, on the other hand, totals 2,67,665 cases including 6,741 fresh cases recorded on Tuesday.“Covid facilities presently have 1,053 ventilators in active condition and out of these 125 are not in use because Mumbai doesn’t have that many patients who are to be put on ventilators so these are installed but are not in use,” ANI quoted Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation as saying.Clarifying its statement even further, the municipal body said that this was an indicator that the situation in the maximum city was getting better.“This doesn’t mean that these ventilators are left to get dusted but this is an indicator that Mumbai’s Covid situation is getting better and not even total available ventilators are needed,” the BMC official quoted above said.

15-07-2020||India||HC refuses temporary bail to police officer sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping||An Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) last week rejected an application for an interim bail filed by former Maharashtra service police officer Manoj Prabhakar Lohar, who was convicted last year for kidnapping for ransom and sentenced to life imprisonment.Lohar had sought an interim bail on health grounds.He contended that he is a cancer survivor and also recently underwent a heart surgery, which requires follow-up treatment in Mumbai.It was also argued on his behalf that since several inmates at Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai were found to have tested coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive, Lohar, a heart patient, is apprehensive of contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease.The two-member division HC bench, comprising Justices TV Nalawade and Shrikant Kulkarni, was not impressed with the argument.The judges found the period of follow-up treatment after the heart surgery had lapsed and a fresh report by jail authorities stated that the petitioner was in sound health condition and leading a normal life.Besides the court noted that on April 3, 2019, another HC bench, also headed by Justice Nalawade, had rejected the applications filed by Lohar for suspension of the substantive sentence handed down to him and his purported agent, Dhiraj Yeole, and grant of bail.Lohar, who was working as additional superintendent (ASP) of police at Chalisgaon in Jalgaon district, and Yeole, a local resident, were convicted by Jalgaon sessions court last year.They were convicted for kidnapping for ransom a local politician, Uttamrao Mahajan, the principal of an Ayurvedic medical college at Chalisgaon, in June 2009, and demanding a ransom of Rs 60 lakh for his release.Mahajan, according to the prosecution, was detained illegally and let off only after the Jalgaon SP intervened in the matter.The HC noted that there was no change in circumstances after the order dated April 3, 2019, when the bench headed by justice Nalawade rejected his bail plea.The court had said that releasing them on bail would send a wrong signal to the public at large and such persons need to be kept behind bars in a bid to send a strong message to others indulging in similar offences.“These days police officers like the accused No.1 (Lohar) are virtually acting as leaders of gangs of dacoit,” the HC had said in its April 3, 2019 order. “It can be said that public is afraid of police like the accused No.1 more than the dacoits, who commit robberies or burglaries,” the order had added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-refuses-temporary-bail-to-police-officer-sentenced-to-life-imprisonment-for-kidnapping/story-MFD3ZTFh0zy4QMhnApKIlM.html

The BJP claims that the government is in a minority but says it will not seek a floor test.Leader of opposition in the assembly Gulab Chand Kataria said Wednesday it was for the Congress government or the rebel MLAs who are supporting former deputy CM Sachin Pilot to seek a floor test.On the notice issued by the assembly Speaker to the 19 MLAs who are supporting Pilot, Kataria said the assembly secretariat had no locus standi in the matter.“Who attends or does not attend a party meet is not in the assembly secretariat. It is for the party to decide. The assembly cannot issue notices to MLAs. Such notices will be struck down by the courts,” he said.He also played down the absence of former CM Vasundhara Raje from meetings of the BJP. “I am in touch with her. She was supposed to come today for a meeting. But since Sachin Pilot cancelled his press conference, we also put off our meeting. After Pilot clears his future course of action, we will hold a meeting,” Kataria said.Earlier in the day, Pilot ruled out joining the BJPKataria said all MLAs have been asked to be available on phone as they could be called to Jaipur on short notice.State BJP president Satish Poonia said the government is trying to intimidate MLAs and the notice is an attempt to put the MLAs under pressure.“The notice is laughable... If some action takes place within the house then a whip is issued. But if some MLAs skip a party meeting but are held in a resort that cannot be the basis for a notice by the Speaker,” he said.He said the Congress’s aim was to get these MLAs disqualified and then call for an assembly session. “The government and the Speaker are working in tandem and the effort is to kill democratic traditions.”Poonia said the government was resorting to strong-arm tactics to scare the legislators. “They talk of democracy but they are threatening MLAs using the SOG and ACB and the notice shows that their intentions are suspect.”Poonia cited a video circulated by a BTP MLA who said he was stopped by police who snatched his car keys and held him hostage for several hours.“If they have the numbers then why are all these actions being taken? Why are the MLAs under lockdown in a resort?” he asked.Poonia said Congress has 107 MLAs of which about 20 are with Pilot which brings down the figure to 87 which is short of the majority mark of 101. He said smaller parties which supported Congress in the Rajya Sabha are not with them any longer.“BTP has said it will remain neutral, one of two CPI (M) MLAs is not supporting Congress. They had made 13 independents as associate members of which three have jumped ship. So they are still short of majority.”Poonia said the BJP has also given a petition to the Speaker some months back challenging the merger of the six BSP MLAs with the Congress. Poonia said the Speaker has not taken a decision on that.“The petition is pending with the Speaker but no decision has been taken yet. If he had given a decision, we would have appealed in court, if required,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-says-ashok-gehlot-govt-in-minority-accuses-it-of-intimidating-mlas/story-978hWwGixxKJ0qZgHRr1wO.html
15-07-2020||India||Follow all agreed protocols for border management: India’s clear message to China in marathon military talks, says report||The Indian military conveyed a “very clear” message to the Chinese army during a nearly 15-hour-long talks that status quo ante must be restored in eastern Ladakh and it will have to follow all mutually agreed protocols for border management to bring back peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control, government sources said on Wednesday. During the course of the intense and complex negotiations between senior commanders of the two armies that ended at 2 am on Wednesday, the Indian delegation also apprised the Chinese PLA about the “red lines” and conveyed that the onus was largely on China to improve the overall situation in the region, the sources said. The two sides agreed on certain modalities for rolling out the next phase of disengagement and are expected to get in touch with each other after discussing agreed points with the higher authorities of both sides, the sources said. The fourth round of Lt General-level talks began around 11 AM on Tuesday at a designated meeting point in Chushul on the Indian side of the LAC, they said. There was no official word on the outcome of the talks. The Indian delegation was led by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, the Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, while the Chinese side was headed by Major General Liu Lin, Commander of the South Xinjiang military region. Army Chief Gen MM Naravane was apprised about the details of the negotiations following which he held discussions with senior military officers. He is scheduled to hold another meeting with a number of senior military officers later in the day. Tuesday’s discussions were the longest negotiations between the two armies after the tense standoff that began on May 5. The third round of Lt General-level talks on June 30 lasted 12 hours. During this round, both sides agreed on an “expeditious, phased and step wise” de-escalation as a “priority” to end the standoff. The sources said the main focus of the latest round was on finalising a framework for a “time-bound and verifiable” disengagement process from all the friction points like Pangong Tso and Depsang and pulling back large numbers of troops and weapons from rear bases along the LAC as part of modalities for further de-esalation. “It was clearly conveyed to China that it must follow all the relevant provisions of agreements and protocols that govern management of the border by both the sides,” they said. The Indian side insisted on “total restoration” of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to May 5 when the standoff began following a clash between the troops of the two countries in Pangong Tso, they said. The Indian delegation also conveyed concerns over China’s “new claim lines” in the region, and insisted that Beijing must adhere to earlier framework on carrying out patrolling in the areas, the sources said. The talks took place days after implementation of the first phase of the disengagement process from the friction points. China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has already completed pulling back troops from Gogra, Hot Springs and Galwan Valley and significantly thinned down its presence in the ridgeline of Finger Four in the Pangong Tso area in the last one week as demanded by India. In line with a mutually agreed decision, the two sides created a minimum buffer zone of three kilometres in most of the friction points where they were locked in a standoff. The formal process of disengagement of troops began on June 6, a day after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tension in the area. The first round of the Lt General talks was held on June 6 during which both sides finalised an agreement to disengage gradually from all the standoff points beginning with Galwan Valley. However, the situation deteriorated following the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC. The second round of talks took place on June 22. The Indian and Chinese armies were locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for over eight weeks since May 5. The tension escalated manifold after the violent clashes in Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35. Following the Galwan Valley incident, the government has given the armed forces “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC. The Army has sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border following the deadly clashes. The IAF has also moved air defence systems as well as a sizable number of its frontline combat jets and attack helicopters to several key air bases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/follow-all-agreed-protocols-for-border-management-india-s-clear-message-to-china-in-marathon-military-talks-report/story-xFG2EE3Qk9XDNalEzLqinL.html

15-07-2020||India||Air India to send certain employees on leave without pay for up to five years||Air India has started the process of identifying employees, based on various factors like efficiency, health and redundancy, who will be sent on compulsory leave without pay (LWP) for up to five years, according to an official order. The airline’s board of directors have authorised its Chairman and Managing Director Rajiv Bansal to send employees on LWP “for six months or for a period of two years extendable upto five years, depending upon the following factors - suitability, efficiency, competence, quality of performance, health of the employee, instance of non-availability of the employee for duty in the past as a result of ill health or otherwise and redundancy”, the order said on Tuesday. The departmental heads in the headquarter as well as regional directors are required to assess each employee “on the above mentioned factors and identify the cases where option of compulsory LWP can be exercised”, stated the order dated July 14. “Names of such employees need to be forwarded to the General Manager (Personnel) in headquarter for obtaining necessary approval of CMD,” the order added. In response to queries regarding this matter, Air India spokesperson said,”We would not like to make any comment on the issue.” Aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries due to the coronavirus pandemic. All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, LWP and firings of employees in order to conserve cash flow. For example, GoAir has put most of its employees on compulsory LWP since April. India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the airlines have been allowed to operate only a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights. Occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around 50-60 per cent since May 25. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23. The passenger demand for air travel will contract by 49 per cent in 2020 for Indian carriers in comparison to 2019 due to Covid-19 crisis, said global airlines body IATA on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-to-send-certain-employees-on-leave-without-pay-for-up-to-five-years/story-Ky4YEkucIt4Df3O79vPQxL.html
15-07-2020||India||PM Modi reminds EU of common values, seeks deeper ties as the China factor looms||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that India and the European Union were natural partners with shared values and common goals as evidenced in the cooperation demonstrated by the two sides in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. He also invited European investments for the further development of environment friendly technologies in India.The prime minister also underlined India’s demonstration of its policy of global cooperation through supply of emergency medicine to around 150 countries across the world, with an aim to strengthen efforts to defeat the coronavirus pandemic.“India has taken care of the interests of other countries apart from its own citizens by sending medicines to almost 150 countries and has also initiated a joint response to the pandemic in the region,” PM said, while addressing the delegates at the 15th India-EU virtual summit.He added that Indian researchers and pharmaceutical companies were ready to make even greater contributions to global efforts to contain the pandemic.Earlier in his address, the prime minister said that India’s partnership with the EU can play an important role in maintaining peace and stability in the world. He added that this reality had become starker in the global situation today.“Several types of pressures are being exerted on rules-based international order. In a situation like this India-EU partnership, can play an important role in economic rebuilding, a human centric and also humanity-centric globalization,” said the PM.Underlining that India and EU were “natural” partners, Modi said, “Our partnership is significant for peace and stability of the world.” The India-EU summit comes amid a protracted border conflict with China that was followed by the Indian government’s decision to cancel a few contracts awarded to Chinese companies and to ban several popular Chinese mobile applications like TikTok.Yesterday, Britain decided to oust Chinese company Huwaei from its 5G project in line with the stand taken by the United States against the company. The US had recently warned Europe against cozying up to China and ignoring Beijing’s perceived expansionist tendencies including use of bullying of its trade partners as a tactic to advance its territorial ambition.Modi said India’s relationship with the EU needed to be deeper, wider and more strategic given the overlapping of values and goals.“For this, we need to adopt a long-term strategic perspective. We also need an action-oriented agenda, which can be implemented in a set time frame,” the PM said underlining the shared values of democracy, pluralism, inclusivity, respect for international institutions, multilateralism, freedom and transparency, which, he said, made the scaling up of ties to the next level a natural process. “Apart from current challenges, long-term challenges like climate change are also a priority for India and the EU. In our efforts to increase the use of renewable energy in India, we invite investment and technology from Europe,” the PM said at the summit.At the outset, the European Council President Charles Michel thanked India for the “cooperation” shown with the EU, especially in fighting the pandemic.“I would like to thank India for the cooperation your country has shown with the EU. I would like to pay tribute to your role nationally and internationally, multilaterally in combating Covid 19 pandemic,” Michel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reminds-eu-of-common-values-seeks-deeper-ties-as-the-china-factor-looms/story-ZJiKR4bg2fm9SsmVcfUVfP.html
15-07-2020||India||Congress considers anti-defection law against Sachin Pilot, experts weigh in||The Congress has taken a wider view of the anti-defection law inked under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution in its bid to disqualify the ousted Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot from the assembly.Congress leaders involved in the strategy maintained that Pilot’s conduct, statement of his close aides and his absence from two meetings of the Congress legislature party in Rajasthan make a strong case against him.But a section of constitutional experts also feels that Pilot may take a legal route and even seek removal of CP Joshi as the Rajasthan assembly speaker to buy more. While the Congress aims to remove team Pilot to command a stronger foothold in the Rajasthan assembly, Pilot may aim to complete his term in the House and continue to prick the ruling party.The Tenth Schedule says that a lawmaker can be disqualified from the House “if he has voluntarily given up his membership of such political party” or “if he votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction issued by the political party to which he belongs or by any person or authority authorised by it in this behalf without obtaining prior permission of such political party.”Two Congress leaders involved in the strategy argued that it is a conservative view to look at what is happening inside the House. “An elected lawmaker’s conduct, his speeches, his hobnobbing with rivals too can be counted as ground for disqualification,” said a senior party leader.“He skipped two meetings of Congress legislature party, his loyalists gave three interviews demanding trust vote is proof of his intention. There are several examples of how the Supreme Court considered such an issue in the Ravi Nayak and the BS Yeddiyurappa case,” said another leader.But P Sreedharan, former secretary general of the Lok Sabha, thinks otherwise. “Disqualification on ground of defection is mentioned clearly in the para 2 of the Tenth Schedule: If he has voluntarily given up his membership or if he votes against the party or abstains from voting. The issue of not following the direction of the party is connected to the House only. So any whip issued for non-House activities can’t be a sufficient ground,” said Sreedharan.For Rajasthan assembly speaker CP Joshi, too, these are testing times. In the recent past, Joshi had advocated that speaker’s powers vis-a-vis the Tenth Schedule should be curtailed and the decision to expel a member should be given to political parties.In two conferences of presiding officers, he spearheaded the campaign to de-link speakers from the anti-defection issues as he felt that speakers come under unnecessary political pressure and courts have often tarnished the image of the speakers in their judgments on defection issues. But now, Joshi himself has a high-profile defection issue — the first in 2020 — on his table.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-considers-anti-defection-law-against-sachin-pilot-experts-weigh-in/story-34UpMclWrJ2EYTOQChILhO.html
15-07-2020||India||Andhra Pradesh to reorganise its 13 districts into 25 for optimal use of resources||The Andhra Pradesh cabinet on Wednesday decided to reorganise its 13 districts into 25 districts by March 31 in such a way that each of the 25 parliamentary constituencies will represent a new district.Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s cabinet which met at Amaravati, approved the decision to form a committee to look into reorganisation of existing 13 districts into 25.The committee headed by the chief secretary comprises chief commissioner of land administration (CCLA), secretary (services) of general administration department, secretary of planning department and an official from the chief minister’s office as members. Principal secretary (finance) will be its convener.The committee will look into various issues concerning the reorganisation of districts, including controlling the administrative expenditure. The committee has been asked to submit the report at the earliest. “In all probability, the formation of new districts would be completed by March 31,” state minister for information and public relations Perni Venkatramaiah alias Nani said.The whole objective of the reorganisation of districts was to make optimum and effective utilisation of human resources and infrastructure facilities. The cabinet felt that the existing districts are very large with huge population making them difficult for administration.“The smaller districts would be administratively convenient. Moreover, there is already a system of village and ward secretariats at the grassroots level to take the benefits of the government schemes to the people,” Nani said.It was decided that the geographical boundary of each district would cover each parliamentary constituency. As such, there would be one district for each of 25 parliamentary constituencies in the state.The cabinet also decided to extend monthly pensions to the extent of Rs 3,000 per month to physically challenged women as well under YSR Cheyutha programme. Already, the government has been providing pensions to widows and also single women.“The latest decision will benefit another 8.21 lakh women,” the minister said.The cabinet also approved the decision to set up a mega 10,000 MW solar power plant and also renewable energy export policy to encourage the private sector in the generation of non-conventional energy. The cabinet decided that long-term power purchase agreements would be signed to ensure that the cost of power would be affordable and the burden on the government would be lesser.The cabinet further approved the creation of a special purpose vehicle in the name of Andhra Pradesh Rayalaseema Drought Mitigation Projects Development Corporation (APRSDMPCL) with an outlay of Rs 40,000 crore. The SPV is aimed at raising funds for enhancement of the capacity of Rayalaseema projects and expansion of the existing canals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-to-reorganise-its-13-districts-into-25-for-optimal-use-of-resources/story-bALZViBhm1kZ4Ozs4EoIJO.html
15-07-2020||India||A day after Corbett’s rogue elephant was radio-collared, carcass spotted in jungles||A day after Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) landscape’s most aggressive elephant was radio-collared, its carcass was found near Mohan range of Almora forest division on Tuesday, said forest officials.The carcass of the wild tusker (25) was spotted in jungles near a factory under the Mohan range of Almora forest division, which is adjacent to the CTR, on Tuesday.Forest officials rushed to the spot along with a veterinary team from CTR, which had radio-collared the elephant on Monday.RK Tiwari, warden, CTR, said that even though the elephant died in Almora forest division, officials were monitoring its movement, as the animal had created panic among the public in Corbett landscape and Ramnagar region.“The jumbo was very aggressive and had attacked many people in the past two years. A team of doctors from CTR had radio-collared it on Monday. The animal had a habit of vandalising moving vehicles on the Ramnagar-Almora highway, which lies on the border between Corbett and Ramnagar forest division. It had also killed a person in Mohan range area near Ramnagar,” he said.Tiwari ruled out the cause of the elephant’s death due to an overdose of a tranquiliser.“We were monitoring the elephant after it was radio-collared around 11 am on Monday. It was found to be moving during the afternoon hours. There is no question of an overdose from tranquilisation, as it had kept moving the whole day,” he said.JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand, said, “A team of doctors along with the CTR director is at the site inspecting the matter. Prima facie, it appears that the elephant died due to in-fighting with another male elephant.”The viscera sample of the wild tusker has been taken and it would be sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, for further investigation, a forest official said.This is the fourth death of an elephant in Corbett landscape this year.Earlier, pachyderms were found dead in CTR’s Dhela, Jhirna range and the Kalagarh area. On June 14, the carcass of a female elephant (7) was found in CTR’s Dhela range.Uttarakhand government recently reported that the elephant population in the state stands at 2,206, a 29.9% spike since 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-day-after-corbett-s-rogue-elephant-was-radio-collared-carcass-spotted-in-jungles/story-Q9iVVw6SVR12Zq0Go0vNcN.html
15-07-2020||India||PM Modi says India and EU ‘natural partners’, committed to deepen relations||The India-European Union (EU) partnership can play a key role in economic reconstruction and building human-centric globalisation in the post-Covid-19 world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday.Addressing the virtual India-EU Summit, he said the two sides are natural partners because of their shared values, such as democracy, pluralism, inclusivity, respect for international institutions, multilateralism and transparency, at a time when there are “different types of pressures on the rules-based international order”.Modi co-chaired the summit along with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. On the eve of the summit, the two sides signed a civil nuclear cooperation agreement on Tuesday while Europol and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are negotiating a mechanism to jointly combat organised crime and terrorism.The summit is expected to focus on strengthening multilateralism and global institutions in the face of the rise of an increasingly assertive China.Speaking in Hindi, Modi noted that the summit was postponed in March because of the Covid-19 pandemic and expressed his condolences for the damage caused by the Coronavirus in Europe.“Like you, I am also committed to deepen relations between India and the EU. For this, we must adopt a long-term strategic perspective. Along with this, an action-oriented agenda should be implemented within a stipulated timeframe,” he said.“India and EU are natural partners. Our partnership is also useful for peace and stability in the world. This reality has become even clearer in today’s global situation,” he added.The health and prosperity of people in India and Europe are facing challenges and there are “different types of pressures on the rules-based international order”, Modi said.“In such a situation, the India-EU partnership can play an important role in economic reconstruction and in building human-centric globalisation,” he said. “Apart from the current challenges, long-term challenges such as climate change are also a priority for both of us.”Modi sought investment and technology from Europe for India’s efforts to increase the use of renewable energy.The agreement between the European Atomic Energy Community or Euratom and Indian authorities signed on Tuesday will focus on cooperation between EU’s research programmes on new ways of using nuclear energy and similar activities on the Indian side.The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation or Europol and CBI are negotiating a working arrangement to support law enforcement authorities of EU member states and India to prevent and combat organised crime and terror.The two sides are also set to launch a high-level trade dialogue to address issues such as stalled negotiations on a trade and investment agreement and a maritime security dialogue, and develop security and defence consultations and military contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-india-and-eu-natural-partners-committed-to-deepen-relations/story-8hfqsVIQrgraRGDjFpXW1I.html
15-07-2020||India||Three-day lockdown in Goa from Friday to curb Covid-19 spread||Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawat has announced fresh lockdown restrictions, starting Thursday at 8 pm and until Monday at 6 am, in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the tiny coastal state.Besides, a fresh daily night curfew from 8 pm to 6 pm, starting Wednesday and until August 10, would also be enforced, the CM added.Sawant made this announcement at a press conference on Wednesday and justified the fresh lockdown restrictions in a bid to strictly enforce hygiene amid the heavy monsoon rains that Goa has been receiving, leading to a growing fear of the spread of the viral infection.“We are in mid-July, when the state receives the highest rainfall. On Tuesday, the state reported 170 Covid-19 positive cases, which is the highest single-day spike so far. The figure could rise in the coming days. There is a lack of seriousness to contain the viral outbreak. The need of the hour is to create more awareness among the public and stricter compliance with all standard operating procedures (SOPs). A section of the public has started holding parties while flouting all social distancing norms with impunity,” the CM said.“The public only understands the language of the law. The state has reported over 1,000 active Covid-19 positive cases and 18 deaths,” he added.The decision to enforce fresh lockdown restrictions was taken at a cabinet meeting that was held after Goa Governor Satya Pal Malik had expressed concerns about the worsening Covid-19 situation in the state. Of the 18 deaths, at least half of them were reported in the past three days and there are still 1,128 active Covid-19 positive cases.On Tuesday, the state reported a surge with 170 Covid-19 positive cases largely owing to a pharmaceutical company, whose 136 employees tested positive.“We are at peak monsoon and it could be a peak for Covid-19 positive cases as well,” the CM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-day-lockdown-in-goa-from-friday-to-curb-covid-19-spread/story-eg6ixC4S4y3GnhtXboaWiI.html

The Mahadayi river basin drains an area of 2032 sq km, out of which an area of 375 sq km lies in Karnataka, 77 sq km in Maharashtra and rest in Goa.Both the Goa and Karnataka governments have, for very different reasons, challenged the final award granted by the Mahadayi Interstate Water Disputes Tribunal which in a verdict in August 2018 granted Karnataka a total of 13.42 Thousand Million Cubic Feet (TMC) of water out of their demand for from their total claims of 36.558 TMC of water.While Goa has approached the Supreme Court arguing that Karnataka shouldn’t be allowed to divert any water owing to the fact that the Mahadayi river is a water deficient river, Karnataka had approached the Supreme Court arguing that the tribunal erred in granting it only 13.42 TMC of water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-will-hear-in-person-petitions-on-mahadayi-river-says-goa-cm/story-xbdKBlGjpoOKtpUn1Zh4jM.html

The project to use technology to showcase the historical and cultural significance of the pilgrimage also came up for discussion.This was the second such review chaired by the Prime Minister in the last two months. The Kedarnath pilgrimage is considered to be one of the toughest among the four religious sites that form part of the Uttarakhand Char Dham pilgrimage circuit comprising Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath.The journey to Badrinath, nestled in the Himalayas, involves a 16-km trek through snow-clad mountains. It is Prime Minister Modi’s one of the most regularly frequented destinations. He had even spent a night in one of the caves near the Kedarnath temple after the general elections in 2019.The development project also involves developing more such caves for the purpose of meditation along with development of ghats.Another Central project to improve and develop 889 km of national highway linking the famed circuit at a cost of over Rs 11,700 crore is also in the progress. It was originally scheduled to get completed by March 2020.Earlier today, while addressing the digital conclave on the occasion of World Youth Skills Day, the prime minister said India has the potential to capitalise the skilling opportunities, which in-turn can supplement the global demand.The Prime Minister stressed on the need to map this demand and align Indian standards with those of other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-plan-to-enhance-kedarnath-s-divinity-make-16-km-trek-comfortable/story-veLCwuOynr1tJbDDrdRv8M.html

15-07-2020||India||‘Come back to your home in Jaipur’: Congress to Sachin Pilot after his ‘not joining BJP’ remark||Stop all conversation with the BJP and head back to your home in Jaipur, the Congress urged Sachin Pilot in yet another outreach attempt. The state has been teetering on the edge since Pilot made his differences with chief minister Ashok Gehlot public. It was only yesterday that the party sacked Pilot as deputy chief minister and also from the post of Rajasthan Pradesh Congress chief.The latest peace offering follows the leader’s statement this morning where he categorically ruled out joining hands with the BJP. Pilot, 42, said the attempt to connect him to the opposition party was being done to malign his reputation in the eyes of the Gandhis. He further underlined that he fought against the BJP to bring the Congress to power in the state. “We’ve seen Sachin Pilot’s statement that he won’t join BJP. I’d like to tell him that if you don’t want that, then immediately come out of the security cover of BJP’s Haryana government, stop all conversations with them and come back to your home in Jaipur,” said Randeep S Surjewala at a press briefing this afternoon.Pilot, along with his MLAs, has been camping in Delhi since Saturday.Rajasthan Congress in-charge Avinash Pande also tweeted saying that the party doors were not closed on the leader.“The Congress doors haven’t been shut on Sachin Pilot, may lord grant him good sense and may he understand his mistake. I hope he gets out of the BJP’s deceptive ways,” tweeted Avinash Pande.Hindustan Times has learnt that KC Venugopal, general secretary, organisation, is trying to convince chief minister Ashok Gehlot to try to bury differences with his former Number 2. Gehlot, however, does not appear too keen and wants his detractor to be expelled immediately for “anti-party” activities. The CM today claimed that horse trading was being done in Jaipur, and said he has the proof as well. Gehlot, in a swipe at Sachin Pilot, claimed that the “new generation” in politics was impatient.“I have been in politics for 40 years, we love the new generation, the future will be theirs. This new generation, they have become central ministers, state presidents. if they had gone through what we did in our time, they would have understood,” Gehlot was quoted as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/come-back-to-your-home-in-jaipur-congress-to-sachin-pilot-after-his-not-joining-bjp-remark/story-XafsBaEGxr8MqS5rqlsFsI.html
15-07-2020||India||Galwan clash: On border row, China says military talks with India made further progress without giving details||China on Wednesday said the fourth round of Sino-India military talks held on Tuesday to reduce tension at the border had made progress in disengaging troops in the western section of the disputed boundary.The Chinese foreign ministry said it hoped New Delhi would work with Beijing to safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas. The talks, aimed at de-escalation, have taken place in a phased manner weeks after after Indian and Chinese troops clashed along the Line of Actual Control in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh. The violent brawl between troops of both sides on June 15 claimed the lives of 20 Indian army personnel and an unspecified number of Chinese were also reportedly killed.Responding to a query on the talks, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said: “As I know on July the 14, border troops of China and India held the fourth round of commander-level talks building on the consensus of the previous three rounds and the implementation of relevant work have reached progress on promoting further disengagement between troops at the western section of the boundary and de-escalating tensions.”“We hope India can work with China to implement our consensus with real actions and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas,” she said in her short response without sharing details or elaborating on the exact agenda of the talks.Hua was referring to the fourth round of talks held between 14 Corps commander Lt General Harinder Singh and South Xinjiang Military District chief Major General Liu Lin.China has so far not shared any detail of the parametres of disengagement the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is following; no detail has been forthcoming from Beijing about how far back its troops have pulled back given the differing perceptions that New Delhi and Beijing have on LAC transgressions.The two sides had held previous talks to reduce tension along the disputed boundary on June 6, June 22 and June 30.India is moving forward with great caution in the disengagement process after the worst crisis along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in decades, officials in New Delhi told HT last week. Troops from both sides have pulled back in a limited manner at key friction points along the LAC since the Special Representatives on the border issue – India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and China’s state councilor foreign minister Wang Yi – held a phone conversation earlier this month and agreed peace and tranquillity along the border is essential for overall development of bilateral ties.Last week, India again rejected China’s claim on Galwan Valley and said the LAC must be strictly respected.Following a virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs last Friday – the third since the Sino-India standoff began in early May -- both sides issued similarly worded statements focused on progress in the disengagement and de-escalation process that began last weekend after a phone conversation between the Special Representatives on the boundary issue.The WMCC meeting was co-chaired by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and director general Hong Liang of the boundary and oceanic affairs department of China’s foreign ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-clash-on-border-row-china-says-military-talks-with-india-made-further-progress-without-giving-details/story-y0N9Ztgv8dHSKpQOnzImfP.html
15-07-2020||India||Congress employs KC Venugopal to broker peace between Ashok Gehlot, Sachin Pilot||Sachin Pilot’s firm and clear message this morning that he is “not joining the BJP” has got the Congress working behind the scenes to bring about a possible rapprochement between Ashok Gehlot and him.It may appear that the party went too far when it sacked him as deputy chief minister and the Rajasthan party chief, but KC Venugopal, the key general secretary, organisation, is making a last-ditch attempt at fixing things.Hindustan Times has learnt that Venugopal is trying to convince chief minister Ashok Gehlot to try to bury differences with his former Number 2.Gehlot, however, does not appear too keen and wants his detractor to be expelled immediately for “anti-party” activities. Venugopal arrived in Jaipur on Monday and is at the moment locked in meetings at the Fairmont hotel, the site of the second Congress legislature party meeting. He is also, one Congressman said, in touch with the Pilot’s side.The former deputy chief minister also struck a conciliatory note this morning when he told Hindustan Times that he is not going to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“I am not joining BJP. Those saying that are just trying to lower me in Gandhis’ eyes,” he told Hindustan Times. ``There are various people who want to do that and they have a motive to do that and it’s just not true.’’Sachin Pilot also cancelled a press conference scheduled for today, setting off speculation that things may have changed since last night when the party charged him with being a part of BJP’s conspiracy to bring down the Congress government in Rajasthan. Pilot’s only response was “Truth may be harassed, but can’t be defeated.’’The Congress had removed Pilot as Rajasthan Congress chief on Tuesday. He was also dropped by chief minister Ashok Gehlot from the cabinet after a meeting of the Congress’ legislature party meeting(CLP). Two more of his loyalists were expelled from the cabinet: Ramesh Meena and Vishvendra Singh.Rajasthan education minister Govind Singh Dotasra was named the new Congress chief in the desert state. The party also sacked Mukesh Bhakar and Rakesh Pareek as presidents of frontal organisations Youth Congress and Sewa Dal, respectively.The crisis in Rajasthan unit reached a breaking point when Pilot received a notice from the special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan police to record his statement regarding the alleged attempt to topple the Congress government in the state. He, along with his MLAs, has been campin in Delhi since Saturday.And alleged that the Gehlot government does not have the numbers.Swinging into action, the grand old party immediately deputed two senior leaders to resolve the crisis and bring Pilot and the other rebels back into the fold. But the efforts did not bear fruit as Pilot stayed away from the two CLP meetings called by the party on Monday and Tuesday.Then came his dismissal from the cabinet and the charge that he was “conspiring” with the BJP to destabilise the government.On Tuesday, 101 legislators - in a 200-member strong assembly - attended the CLP meeting at the Fairmont hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur, which included 10 independent legislators and two from Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) and one from the Communist Party of India (Marxist); the other CPIM legislator was unwell. However, in the afternoon, the two BTP legislators left the hotel, and went home, saying they would take a call on supporting a political party at an “appropriate” time.It remains to be seen how the next chapter in this drama unfolds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-another-push-congress-works-peace-talks-between-ashok-gehlot-sachin-pilot/story-nKjs9OqGKB5R3BGZQaX75M.html
15-07-2020||India||Gehlot says he has proof, after Sachin Pilot denies plotting against govt with the BJP||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday claimed that his team had proof that Congress MLAs were being lured into a rebellion against the state government. He said the attempts to topple his government have been going on since some time, forcing the party to sequester all party MLAs in a Jaipur hotel on multiple occasions. He added that the current crisis would have unfolded before had the party not been on guard. “Horse trading was being done in Jaipur, we have the proof. We had to keep people at a hotel for 10 days, if we had not done that, the same thing that is happening in Manesar now would have happened back then,” Ashok Gehlot was reported as saying by a news agency.Gehlot’s statement follows his former deputy Sachin Pilot’s denial of planning the Congress government’s downfall in conjunction with the opposition party, the BJP. Sachin, who is camping with several of his loyal party MLAs at a Manesar hotel, also declared that he was not joining the BJP. His statement was a counter to Gehlot camp’s persistent claims that Pilot had fallen trap to a BJP plot to overthrow the Rajasthan government. Gehlot, also in a broad swipe at Sachin Pilot, claimed that the “new generation” in politics didn’t have the patience to wait for their turn.“I have been in politics for 40 years, we love the new generation, the future will be theirs. This new generation, they have become central ministers, state presidents. if they had gone through what we did in our time, they would have understood,” Gehlot was quoted as saying.Gehlot’s statement is a reflection of an opinion gaining ground among the old guard in the Congress that the young leaders ought to wait for their turn in the pecking order, bringing to fore the friction between the young and the old guard in the party. While yesterday, a few party young guns including Priya Dutt, Jitin Prasada and Shashi Tharoor had expressed sympathy for Pilot, several senior party leaders, including Digvijaya Singh, Veerappa Moily, have come out today hitting out at the young generation for being in a hurry at the expense of the party.Pilot, however, had alleged a counter-plot to weaken his position within the party, especially before the Gandhis-- a reference to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, her son and former party president Rahul Gandhi and her daughter and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi. He didn’t specifically name Gehlot for plotting his downfall but the opposition BJP has not been mincing words while accusing Gehlot of “having produced, scripted, directed and acted in a film” aimed at ousting his challenger Sachin Pilot from the party.While party national general secretary and Rajasthan in-charge Avinash Pande suggested it was still not the end of the road for Pilot in the party, the sword of disqualification from the state assembly hangs over Pilot and his 18 followers, who have been asked to explain their position by Friday. Party chief whip Mahesh Joshi has asked the assembly speaker to disqualify Pilot and his supporters claiming they have been plotting against the party and deliberately disobeyed a whip to attend legislative council meetings in Jaipur over the past two days.Among those sent notices are Vishvendra Singh and Ramesh Meena, who were sacked along with Pilot from the state cabinet after their rebellion against CM Gehlot. Deepender Singh Shekhawat, Bhanwar Lal Sharma and Harish Chandra Meena, who had given statements against the Gehlot government, are others on the chopping block.On Tuesday, Sachin Pilot was sacked as deputy chief minister and the state Congress president after he did not attend the Congress legislature party (CLP) meetings, held over Monday and Tuesday. Two other ministers loyal to him were also given the boot from the Cabinet.In another important move, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) has dissolved all district and block party committees in the state, said Avinash Pande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-says-he-has-proof-after-sachin-pilot-denies-plotting-against-govt-with-the-bjp/story-objJpSBajnLz113x00GXYP.html
15-07-2020||India||BJP distorting facts about MLA’s suspected suicide, Mamata Banerjee tells President||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday saying the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was “distorting facts” about the death of Debendranath Roy, MLA from Hemtabad in North Dinajpur district who won the reserved seat on a CPI (M) ticket in 2016 before joining the BJP in 2019.Hours after her letter, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police charged Niloy Singh, an acquaintance of Roy, with murder. Singh was picked up from Malda district on Tuesday and interrogated for hours.The 63-year-old legislator’s body was found hanging on Monday morning outside a roadside shop about two kilometers away from his home. He left home around 1 am in the night with an unidentified person. Roy’s family and the BJP have alleged that he was murdered. The BJP has demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and met Kovind on Tuesday. Bengal BJP leaders led agitations outside police stations across the state on Wednesday. Roy’s body was found hanging outside a mobile phone shop that he used to visit to meet local people, Banerjee said in the letter that was handed to the President by Trinamool Congress (TMC) Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien. “I am constrained to invite your kind and personal attention to a particular fact. This is in context of your meeting with a delegation of BJP who might have apprised with some distorted facts” says the letter’s opening lines.“On receipt of post mortem report and on primary investigation West Bengal police has reported that it is a cause of suspected suicide and could be related to some local money transfer activities. The note found in a pocket of the deceased also names two persons who are allegedly found to be related to such money transfer activities in the locality,” Banerjee wrote.“Therefore, I am sorry to say that it does not appear to be a political case as being projected by BJP,” she said.She said her government has taken all necessary actions immediately for a comprehensive investigation and has handed over the case to CID for proper investigation.“I would like to assure that West Bengal is a state where we always respect all political parties, their leaders and workers,” the letter said.“The death of one of our compatriots in the West Bengal legislative assembly is very unfortunate. Let his soul rest in peace and let the truth unravel,” Banerjee’s letter said.The BJP reacted by saying that the letter is proof of the ruling the TMC’s guilty consciousness.“In the past, several murders were passed off as suicides by the police in Bengal. In none of those occasions the chief minister felt the urge to rush letters to the President. This proves that dal main kuchh kala hai (something is fishy),” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha told HT.Till Wednesday afternoon, state CID officers made no comment on the investigation. Nilay Sinha, one of the two men mentioned in the note found in Roy’s pocket, is being questioned by the police. Roy’s wife told the police that he was trying to get into the rice trade and had taken a huge loan from banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-distorting-facts-about-mla-s-suspected-suicide-mamata-banerjee-tells-president/story-bYfzoS1QdBekgZCi5VSgiJ.html

Later, Thiruvananthapuram MP Tharoor put out a tweet about the meeting.“The Parliamentary Standing Committee in Information Technology met on Tuesday. The eight MPs, who braved quarantine restrictions to attend, heard briefings from MeitY & the Union Ministry of Home Affairs on recent developments including the Aarogya Setu app and cybersecurity,” Tharoor tweeted. “Due social distancing norms were observed and attendees came masked. This could well be the new normal for a long time to come. Still, it was a useful meeting, where serious questions were asked and constructive discussions took place,” he further tweeted. According to officials present at the meeting and familiar with the matter, some MPs sought to know whether they could be allowed to virtually attend the monsoon session of Parliament.“Our response was simple, we can do it tomorrow,” said a MeitY official on the condition of anonymity. “We just need the go-ahead to conduct it. Parliament, in any case, is telecast live so it is not much of an issue.” However, the standing committee members need to meet in person, as these are confidential matters, said the official.Derek O’Brien, Trinamool Congress’s RS MP and a member of the panel, also raised the issue of virtual presence during Tuesday’s meeting. “The Meeting of the Parliamentary Select Committee examining the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, has called a meeting on Friday (July 17). Amid these Covid-19 times, a three-day notice was given to members. This is strange. A virtual presence is still not allowed. Strange methods are playing out in Parliament,” O’Brien tweeted.However, the official quoted above said that the notification for the standing committee for IT was done over a week ago. According to another official present at the meeting, Surya, the BJP’s Bengaluru South MP, was among those, who wanted to know about the ban on 59 Chinese apps and Aarogya Setu. “Everyone praised the move to ban the apps. Some even asked whether there are other apps that are likely to be banned soon,” said the second official.“The MPs were keen to know about the new features of Aarogya Setu and also about the government’s move to protect data,” he added.An MP, who was present at the meeting, the thrust of the discussion was about cybersecurity, Aarogya Setu and the ban on 59 Chinese apps. “It was a productive discussion,” said the MP, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-it-panel-s-first-meet-since-covid-19-mps-ask-if-they-could-attend-parliament-online/story-yAhc3MhVNeUmeROVsDaJ6K.html

Officials said he will be summoned again after cross-examining information provided by him.Kerala gold smuggling drama unfolded after the customs seized 30 kilograms of gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to the country’s consular office in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. Later it arrested four persons including Swapna Suresh, a consultant with the state IT department. CM’s powerful secretary Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was later removed from his post after reports surfaced that he was allegedly close to Suresh. The case was later handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).As the multi-agency investigation progressed, customs commissioner in-charge of Kerala and Lakshadweep Sumit Kumar, known for his tough stance, gave out an ultimatum to smugglers to either surrender or face action. There are reports that at least six of them have already surrendered and more are in touch with the officials.Also read: Customs question Kerala CM’s former secretary in gold smuggling case“We have told them to surrender or face music. We have a list of regular offenders and we are out to break their syndicate. The multi-agency probe is going as planned. Since the investigation is on, I can’t say more at this juncture,” he said.Meanwhile, the NIA has approached the Interpol, international criminal/police organisation, for the extradition of Faisal Fareed, the third person accused in the case, who is reported to be in the UAE. A court in Kochi had issued an arrest warrant against him. Reports from Dubai also suggest he was absconding fearing arrest and extradition.The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Intelligence Bureau, Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax and other agencies are also helping the ongoing probe. People familiar with central agencies also said this is the strongest ever probe conducted by central agencies being supervised by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. This is the first time the NIA is taking up a smuggling case, said an official familiar with the probe.In the custody application for those arrested, the NIA said a good amount of money generated through smuggling was pumped in to funding terror activities. It also said 150 kilograms of gold was smuggled through Thiruvananthapuram airport in last six months in a similar fashion.Four persons had been named in NIA FIR and include, Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the consulate; Swapna Suresh, Fareed and Suresh’s friend Sandeep Nair. The customs department has arrested three others and detained many, some of them will soon figure in the FIR after a detailed questioning, said the official.There are also reports that at least two dozen smugglers and hawala operators, including some living abroad, have expressed their willingness to surrender.“After we tightened the grip they are running for cover. We will net them. If it goes unchecked it will take the proportion of notorious cartels of Columbia. Their roots are very strong in south India, especially in Kerala. They are posing a big threat to the economy and national security,” said the senior official.There are reports that the customs department has prepared a list of 100 known offenders from south India and some people from Mangaluru in Karnataka and Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu figure in this. There are also reports that the Union Finance Ministry will amend some of the gold and money laundering laws to give them more teeth and plug loopholes. Usually, carriers get away after coughing up fine and only small fries get netted and now the multi-agency probe is after elusive kingpins, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-multi-agency-probe-takes-speed-in-kerala-smugglers-and-hawala-operators-feel-heat/story-x3BXQgUbpB96nQZf0J32kK.html

But, never in his wildest dream had he thought that in a career spanning just seven years he will receive a special mention at 66th National Film Awards (2019). “I was shocked instead of being surprised. I vividly remember when I got a call from actor Vinay Pathak to inform about the award that I had won for my role in Rajat Kapoor’s directorial ‘Kadakh,’ I was all numb and emotional at the same time. It was difficult for me to believe till I read it in the newspaper myself,” he said over phone.Talking about his early days, Chandrachoor said, “I come from a non-filmi background was asked to take up a career in journalism by my parents. But I was well aware with my penchant for acting. I had made up my mind to give it a shot because during my mass communication course I had understood what the craft of acting was all about and I simply enjoyed the process. The only condition laid by my father was to train myself in acting.”He joined Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) and completed two-year of acting course. Chandrachoor has been part of films like ‘Ankhon Dekhi,’ ‘Dum Laga Ke Haisha,’ Meri Pyaari Bindu,’ ‘Meeruthiya Gangsters’ and web series ‘Upstarts.’ “When I came Mumbai, I called up Saurabh (Shukla) sir as he and Rajat (Kapoor) sir had come to FTII for workshops. They were like my gurus so when I reached Mumbai, I called them. When I spoke to Saurabh sir he was like ‘office aa jao’. He was writing some plays and I assisted him in writing my version of scenes and stories and then we used to jam over them. It was there only when I got to know that Rajat sir was casting for his film ‘Ankhon Dekhi’ and one of his friends asked me to go for its auditions and rest is history,” he said.His mother hails from UP and he has many of his relatives and school bestie living in the state capital. “I have also shot one of my films here. With relatives and my best friend from school living here, I have visited Lucknow umpteen number times during my younger days. Hanging around in Chowk and Gomti Nagar was our favourite pastime then.”His latest release ‘Kadakh’, that won appreciation across globe, is being well received on OTT platform. Chandrachoor hopes to be back to work soon, “My career is going well but finding work as per your choice is not that easy but it’s gradually happening. My next film to release will be ‘Fairyfolk’ with actor Rasika Duggal. It’s in post-production followed by film ‘Rk rk’ and ‘Sir’. The latter went to Cannes Film Fest,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/winning-a-national-award-was-numbing-moment/story-xDVy0XvV3vymTrK7rJ4q2K.html

His comments on Lord Ram are unwarranted,” said Mahant Nritya Gopal Das.“Lord Ram was a ‘Chakravarti’ emperor and Nepal was also part of his kingdom. Ties between India and Nepal are even older than history. His (Nepalese PM) comments are unfortunate,” added the chief priest.It may be pointed out that every year ‘Ram Baraat’ (wedding procession of Lord Ram) from Ayodhya leaves for Janakpur in Nepal with much fanfare. Large number of saints take part in the much-awaited annual event.Commenting on Oli’s remark, Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson of the VHP, who operates from Karsevakpuram in Ayodhya, said: “It is at the behest of China that PM of Nepal has given such baseless and unwarranted statement.”“Nothing can be more absurd than this. All religious scriptures prove that Lord Ram was born in Ayodhya here in India,” added Sharma.Raju Das, priest of Hanuman Garhi, dubbed Oli’s statement as another ploy to divert attention from increasing opposition he is facing in Nepal.“At present Nepalese PM is under immense pressure from the Opposition to resign from his post. As there is no option left, he has given this absurd statement just to divert attention of people from ongoing political turmoil in the country,” said Das.“In recently concluded decades’ old Ram Janmabhoomi case in Supreme Court all historical facts were present before the court to prove Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya is birth place of Lord Ram,” said Das. This is second controversy created by Oli in connection with India.Last month, Nepal cleared a constitution amendment bill to reflect new map in the national emblem kicking off boundary dispute with India.This map shows Indian territories Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-lord-ram-out-of-regional-politics-ayodhya-saints-lash-out-at-nepal-pm-oli/story-ygZ8z3VZLdMSyqL1CygTSL.html
15-07-2020||India||Ashok Lavasa to quit Election Commission, appointed ADB vice president||Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa, who was next in the line to head the poll panel, has been appointed as vice president for Private Sector Operations and Public-Private Partnerships at the Asian Development Bank. The surprise announcement was made by the regional development bank on Wednesday.Lavasa would be only the second election commissioner to step down from the poll panel before completion of his term. The last time an election commissioner put in his papers was in 1973 when chief election commissioner Nagendra Singh was appointed a judge in the International Court of Justice at The Hague.The ADB statement said Lavasa succeeds Diwakar Gupta whose term ends on August 31.Lavasa, a retired IAS officer, was appointed as election commissioner in January 2018 and would be in line to be appointed as the chief election commissioner when Sunil Arora completes his term if the government sticks to the tradition of appointing the senior-most commissioner to the top post. There is, however, no rule that requires the President to stick to this convention.The retired 1980 batch IAS officer did not agree with the Election Commission of India’s (ECI) decisions to clear Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then BJP president Amit Shah of charges of violating Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during the 2019 general elections.Lavasa later told Hindustan Times that he had no axe to grind. “My concern is to have a system of disposal of Model Code of Conduct (MCC) violation cases in a time bound, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner,” Lavasa told HT in an interview.The rift within the three-member commission had come into the open after reports emerged that Lavasa recused himself from meetings to discuss MCC issues unless his dissent was recorded.The spotlight remained on the election commissioner later when the income tax department issued notices to his wife Novel Singhal Lavasa for alleged tax evasion.Prior to his appointment as election commissioner, Lavasa played a critical role in running of several ministries at varying points of time in his career. Among other highlights, he was also held the union finance secretary job. Lavasa has an MBA degree from Southern Cross University in Australia, and MPhil in Defense and Strategic Studies degree from the University of Madras. He completed his Bachelor of Arts Degree with English Honors and a Master of Arts in English Literature from Delhi University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commissioner-ashok-lavasa-appointed-vice-president-of-asian-development-bank/story-zQzCuPMNGCtN8Rjoz1wapI.html

15-07-2020||India||Rajasthan political turmoil: How Congress legal experts joined Gehlot to ground Pilot||As the war between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot intensified over the last three days, the Congress dialled prominent legal brains to join the battle and guide team Gehlot at every step even as legal eagles held the young Pilot in high regards.A six-pronged legal strategy was evolved to counter Pilot and his loyalists, which culminated in state assembly speaker PC Joshi sending a show-cause notice to them.The decision to hold two Congress Legislative Party (CLP) meetings - one at CM’s residence and another a hotel - keeping the doors open for Pilot even as he was incommunicado, stripping him of his portfolios but retaining him in the party, preparing drafts of letters, were all done in close consultations with Abhishek Singhvi, senior party leader and its key legal brain.Also read: ‘Party doors not shut’ - Congress leader after Sachin Pilot denies joining BJPFive Congress leaders, including CM Gehlot, Randeep Surjewala, Ajay Maken and Avinash Pandey, held frequent consultation with Singhvi. They clubbed the Rajasthan’s state anti-defection law with the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution to make a case of disqualification of Sachin Pilot and his loyal MLAs.“As the shadow of the BJP loomed large, we realized that we have to try our best to protect the Congress government. We decided to ask for disqualification of Pilot and his loyalists from the assembly as it would reduce the numbers in the House and brighten the prospect of the Congress’ majority,” said a leader involved in the strategy.They also decided not to sack Pilot from the Congress as it would benefit him. Under the legislative laws, if a lawmaker is sacked from the party, he or she will remain an independent member of the House. Such a move could have benefited Pilot and spoiled the Congress’ objectives. Also read: I’m not joining BJP, those saying so are trying to lower me in Gandhis’ eyes, says Sachin PilotFor Gehlot, the advisors suggested, it was a chance to kill 3 birds with one stone. He can minimize the prospects of the BJP toppling his government, oust his arch-rival Pilot and raise his stocks with the party in this crisis as he can show how he is confronting attacks from different fronts, said a senior Congress leader. To be sure, Singhvi and many other central leaders of the Congress enjoyed great rapport with Pilot. While some senior leaders even considered him a possible face of the Congress in the future, many Pilot admirers felt that he miscalculated his strength and Gehlot’s weight in the organisation.“We also felt that Pilot carried his rebellion too far. He refused to meet emissaries and didn’t allow the party to find a middle ground. When Gehlot realized that Pilot has stretched his limits, he moved swiftly to throw him out of the cabinet,” said another leader who was involved in the discussions. The decision to remove him from the party’s state president’s post was taken in New Delhi. The legal team invoked several Supreme Court judgments including the Rajiv Nair and the BS Yeddyurappa cases. They maintained that defection should not be seen only if an MLA or an MP defies party whip in the House but his utterances, conduct can also lead to a case for disqualification.Even as they planned to nail Pilot, the personal equations didn’t end. On Tuesday, Pilot called Singhvi and requested him to fight his legal battle, oblivious of the fact that he is actually helping the other side. “Singhvi revealed his role and told Pilot that the honourable thing for him would be not to take his case,” said a Singhvi aide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-political-turmoil-how-congress-legal-experts-joined-gehlot-to-ground-pilot/story-NNToLvtgz2ArYtHEP1mBSM.html
15-07-2020||India||‘Laughable’: Shiv Sena on Nepal PM Oli’s claims on Lord Ram||The Shiv Sena has criticised Nepal prime minister KP Sharma Oli over his statement that the real Ayodhya - birth place of Lord Ram - lies in Nepal, and not in India.Calling the statement “laughable”, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana termed Oli a “puppet” of China, who has been “spewing venom” against India lately.“Nepal prime minister KP Sharma Oli is the puppet of China. He has been speaking against India daily on the instructions of China. First he created controversy on maps now he’s directly dragged Lord Ram in the Nepal-India conflict... He has said that India’s Ayodhya is fake, the real Ayodhya is in Nepal; Lord Ram was Nepalese. These statements of Oli are laughable,” the editorial said on Tuesday. The editorial referred to the Puranas and said that River Saryu flows near Ayodhya but there is no such river in Nepal. It added that thousands of Karsevaks have spilled their blood on the river turning it red during the struggle. The editorial further asked why Oli did not come forward to make his claim as the Ram Janmabhoomi movement has been on for 70-75 years.The Sena further ridiculed Oli’s statement and said, “Today, he has claimed Ayodhya and Lord Ram are Nepalese. Tomorrow, he will claim even Babur was from Nepal. Lord Ram belongs to the whole world, but Ram Janmabhoomi belongs to only India and there is no need for a controversy on this.”In another sarcastic remark, the editorial said Oli’s ancestors hoodwinked even Babur, who wanted to bring down the Ram temple to build a mosque in place of it, by diverting the Mughal emperor to North India instead of Nepal.“Ayodhya was in Nepal and Oli’s ancestors hoodwinked Babur and diverted him towards India (instead). Oli fooled Babur. This is in a way insult of Islam and will Oli’s junior father Pakistan punish him as per Islamic laws?” it asked.The editorial further said that Oli has forgotten the cultural and religious ties between the two countries and is speaking against India as his chair is under a threat. “Therefore, the Chinese ambassadors are fighting to save his chair. Oli has become a slave of China and has decided to convert his countries culture into Chinese,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/laughable-shiv-sena-on-nepal-pm-oli-s-claims-on-lord-ram/story-WOjEiUgATgzRp315oq9K7N.html
15-07-2020||India||PM Oli’s Ayodhya remark fits the pattern. China is the elephant in the room||Chastised at home and abroad over his Ayodhya claim, Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli resumed negotiations on Wednesday with his lead rival within the Nepal Communist Party Pushpa Kamal Dahal who has fronted a campaign to oust him from the prime minister’s office. But the negotiations didn’t last for long. After 15 minutes or so, PM Oli who was meeting Dahal at his official residence in Kathmandu’s Baluwatar told Dahal that he wasn’t feeling well and abruptly ended the meeting.Dahal, a former prime minister commonly known by his nom de guerre Prachanda, has for months tried to get PM KP Sharma Oli to step down from either of the two posts that he holds; the prime minister’s post and the co-chairman of the ruling communist party. But he has been outsmarted by PM Oli on more than one occasion, with some help from China that is comfortable with the 68-year-old Nepal politician and prefers his continuation.PM Oli has earned Beijing’s trust over the last several months with his sniping attacks at New Delhi, right from setting up a new boundary dispute, claiming that the SARS-Cov-2 pathogen from India is deadlier than the one in China or Italy and accusing India of trying to topple his government.Also Read: Nepal bought 6 Chinese planes that Dhaka rejected. Now it grounds them: ReportHis comment on Lord Ram and the “real Ayodhya” on Monday was part of this continuing tirade against India, designed to drive a wedge between people of the two countries, a Kathmandu watcher in New Delhi said.When India’s external affairs ministry made it clear that it would not initiate dialogue with Kathmandu after PM Oli pushed Nepal’s new political map through Parliament, it had underscored that the government would continue to work to strengthen people-to-people relations between the two countries.PM Oli’s claim that Lord Ram was born in Ayodhya, described by his party leaders as ludicrous, was aimed at upsetting this effort. Indian government officials said PM Oli’s larger effort was to stoke anti-India sentiment in Nepal - a continuing effort of his government - by accusing India of encroaching on cultural facts.Nepal “has become a victim of cultural encroachment and its history has been manipulated,” he said at an event to mark the birth anniversary of Nepalese poet Bhanubhakta, credited for translating Valmiki’s Ramayan into Nepali language.But PM Oli’s effort backfired. There are already loud voices in his party and outside that have spoken about his concerted effort at chipping away at the goodwill between the two countries.On Wednesday, Nepal’s leading newspaper Kathmandu Post’s front page story on PM Oli’s Ayodhya remark is titled, “Amid soured Nepal-India ties, Oli is threatening relations between peoples of two countries, leaders and experts say”.A foreign ministry statement on PM Oli’s Ayodhya remark attempted to give it a new spin. The PM, the statement said, “was simply highlighting the importance of further studies and research... to obtain facts about Shri Ram, Ramayana and various places linked to this rich civilization”.This isn’t the first time that PM Oli has come under attack in Kathmandu for his sharp tilt against India. “But the elephant in the room is China,” said an analyst based in New Delhi, echoing the government’s reading of PM Oli and his pitch against India. He said PM Oli’s statements and actions fit the pattern of serving China’s interests, starting from the Lipulekh boundary dispute.In her conversations with PM Oli’s rivals in the communist party, Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi is learnt to have explained China’s interest in Nepal’s ruling party to ideology: Communist China doesn’t want Nepal Communist Party - formed in 2018 with the merger of 2 leading left parties - to split again. And since PM Oli could split the party if he is up against the wall, the rival camps should take measured steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-oli-s-ayodhya-remark-fits-the-pattern-china-is-the-elephant-in-the-room/story-sbels4hLu02fd0V7SU1blO.html
15-07-2020||India||‘Party doors not shut’: Congress leader after Sachin Pilot denies joining BJP||Shortly after Sachin Pilot, who was sacked as Rajasthan deputy chief minister and pradesh Congress chief yesterday, announced on Wednesday that he was not joining the BJP, the Rajasthan Congress in-charge tweeted that the party doors were not closed on the leader.“The Congress doors haven’t been shut on Sachin Pilot, may lord grant him good sense and may he understand his mistake. I hope he gets out of the BJP’s deceptive ways,” tweeted Avinash Pande. The Congress is wary of what happened in Madhya Pradesh and has been making overtures to the rebel leader to sit with the party and resolve issues. At the same time, Rajasthan Speaker has issued notices to Sachin Pilot and 18 other rebel Congress MLAs after the party sought their disqualification from the state assembly. They have been asked to respond by Friday.The Congress complained that the rebel MLAs allegedly made statements to the media in an “openly hostile and prejudicial” manner against the interests of Congress and its government in Rajasthan.Also read: Congress dissolves all party panels in Rajasthan, aims for fresh startPilot, 42, underscored today that he had worked hard to defeat the BJP and bring the Congress back to power in Rajasthan. “I am not joining the BJP,” he said as rumours swirled around about him joining the opposition camp. He further said that connecting him with the BJP was being done to tarnish his reputation in the eyes of the Gandhis.The rebel leader, who has been camping in Delhi, has still not met the Gandhis. However, the Gandhis have reached out to him through their emissaries. The BJP, on its part, has kept its distance from the Congress drama playing out in Rajasthan, saying they are tracking the developments. The party does not want a repeat of the Maharashtra fiasco where despite being short on numbers it backed the leader from the rebel camp and rushed in to form the government. It had to beat a hasty, and ignominious, retreat. In the 200-member Rajasthan assembly, the BJP has only 72 MLAs, while the majority mark is 101. Pilot claims the support of 30 MLAs, but has also made it clear that he is not looking to jump ship as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/party-doors-not-shut-congress-leader-after-sachin-pilot-denies-joining-bjp/story-1ttgGtZfn5sB7Obemja4DO.html

Forest personnel has rescued 117 animals, including a one-year-old female rhino calf, which had got separated from its mother to date.Every year as floods ravage Kaziranga, the park’s animals including elephants, rhinos, and tigers cross the nearby national highway to find safety in the hills of adjoining Karbi Anglong district.Though vehicle movement is regulated and a speed limit of a maximum of 40 km per hour (kmph) has been imposed, several animals get injured or die due to speeding vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-rhinos-drown-to-death-as-flood-waters-submerge-assam-s-kaziranga-national-park/story-uuh4NvCOw5zhlsuxN5nJbI.html

He said skill, re-skilling and upskilling is the only way to remain relevant in the ever changing market scenario.Speaking on the occasion of the World Youth Skill Day, the PM said, “The biggest strength of the millennials is their ability to get skilled.”“The ongoing cornonavirus pandemic has changed the work culture and started the concept of work from home; for this the youth are acquiring new skills keeping in mind the new work culture and new nature of job,” he added.“People ask me business and markets are changing too fast, it’s hard to remain relevant. In times of corona, this is even more relevant. My answer to that is to skill, re-skill and upskill. To keep learning new skills is to re-skill and continuing to scale it up is to upskill,” he said.The PM, who has in the past stressed on self-reliance and the need to become employment generators, said, “Skill is something which you give yourself and which is timeless and keeps getting better with time, it is unique and makes your different from others, makes you self-reliant and also self-employable.”PM Modi also underlined that there is a difference between skill and knowledge and said people often confuse the two. “People get confused between Knowledge and skill. You can watch on YouTube or read in books how to ride a bike, this is Knowledge, but to ride a bike you need skill,” he said.Referring to the work opportunity for skilled people he said there is a requirement for lakhs of skilled people especially in the health sector. “...That is why we have started skill mapping. Information about which country needs skilled works in which sector will be available,” he said.He also referred to the portal for skill mapping of migrant labour that has been started and said employers can connect with labour at the click of a button. “Friends, in today’s rapidly changing world, millions of skilled people are needed in many sectors. There is a huge potential, especially in health services,” PM Modi said.He also spoke about the skilling centres opened by the government and how the number of ITIs was increased. “During this, skill development of more than 5 crore people has been done. And this campaign continues,” he said.The PM also reiterated that people should remember to stay healthy, maintain social distancing, wear mask and stop spitting during the worldwide pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-message-on-skill-development-pm-modi-highlights-importance-of-being-self-reliant/story-I7xId7vdwNt0byv04i0qCP.html

This is a true example of lab to market,” IIT Delhi Director V Ramgopal Rao said.The product is approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hrd-minister-launches-world-s-most-affordable-covid-19-test-kit-developed-by-iit-delhi/story-LwHzGuc1FsSCXeTapJZ7ZP.html

15-07-2020||India||In a first, Uttarakhand develops ‘Green’ Ramayana Park with plant species associated with Lord Rama||In a first, Uttarakhand’s forest department has developed a Green Ramayana Park where plant species mentioned in Valmiki’s Ramayan and associated with Lord Rama in six major forest types in India, have been grown.Uttarakhand chief conservator of forests (research wing) Sanjiv Chaturvedi said Green Ramayana Park, which took over six months to develop in Kumaon’s Haldwani area, is the first of its kind thematic project touching the little-explored aspect of Ramayana, especially in the context of the flora mentioned in it and associated with the journey of Lord Rama across four main forest types in India. The two other forests types are associated with deities Sita and Hanuman, he said.“We explored the available literature and religious texts to find out the plant species associated with Lord Rama. And to our surprise, we found sage Valmiki’s Ramayana as the treasure trove of such information. It is a botanist’s delight. We found around 139 species that have been mentioned in it. So we did some research on these plants and found that nearly 90 percent of them are still found in the areas mentioned by the sage. Then we found their scientific names and selected some 30 representative plants from six main forest types associated with Lord Rama journey, Sita and Hanuman,” he said.“During Lord Rama’s journey from Ayodhya to Sri Lanka, he came across four types of forests in the Indian subcontinent including Chitrakoot (tropical deciduous), Dandakarnanya (tropical deciduous), Panchavati (tropical dry deciduous) and Kishkindha (dry and moist deciduous). Ashok Vatika (evergreen) is associated with Sita while Dronagiri (alpine forest) is associated with Lord Hanuman,” he said.Also read: Uttarakhand reports 7th Covid-19 death, 78 new cases take state’s toll to 3,686Chaturvedi said the most fascinating part is that geographical location and species composition of the forests described in Valmiki’s Ramayana are still more or less the same whether it is Saal and Sagaun in Dandkarayana - which falls in Central India - or Chandan or Raktchandan in Kishkindha region situated in present-day Karnataka or the occurrence of Sita Ashok and Nagkesar in the evergreen forests of Sri Lanka where Ashok Vatika was believed to be situated.“After a lot of research work, we decided to develop Green Ramayana Park here at Haldwani Biodiversity Park over an acre of land where we have grown these plants and mentioned their Sanskrit names as mentioned in Valmiki’s Ramayana. Their scientific names and the precise number of ‘shloka’ (hymn) wherein the plant species have been mentioned have also been mentioned,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-uttarakhand-develops-green-ramayana-park-with-plant-species-associated-with-lord-rama/story-bYHtVxgtpBtXe9YTRWNaWI.html

You increased the value of the wood by doing some value addition, and to stay relevant, you need to keep adding stuff to it. But it is important to expand our skill further. This is known as upskill,” PM Modi said.He added that not only the youth, but anyone can tread the path - learn new things and keep enhancing their skills. “This will help make us self-reliant,” he said.Many fields require people who have skills, especially in the health services sector, the prime minister said.This day marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of Skill India Mission.

The letters asked them to attend a virtual meeting called by Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Wednesday morning to discuss problems faced by students during the Covid-19 lockdown.Dhankhar, who is also the de facto chancellor of all state universities, sent his first letter to the vice-chancellors on July 7, asking them to attend the meeting. The vice-chancellors wrote back, saying the invitation had to be routed through the education department according to law. Their letter was routed through the government.The vice-chancellors said that on Monday and Tuesday Dhankhar sent them two more letters which they described as “humiliating” and “intimidating” and therefore decided not to attend the meeting. Keeping Student Welfare uppermost in mind VCs must attend VIRTUAL CONFERENCE and desist partisan stance.

Dhankhar, who is known for posting tweets frequently, reacted on Twitter and hinted at an “undesirable situation” if the vice-chancellors did not attend the virtual meeting at 11 am on Wednesday.Dhankhar tweeted, “Looking forward to VIRTUAL CONFERENCE tomorrow with VCs as regards student welfare. The conduct of VCs in not indicating open ended issues of students not appreciated. Surely not in sync with their office. Primary concern ought to be student welfare and not otherwise.”“To break stalemate flagged issue @MamataOfficial. Her stance is “Universities and VCs are governed by their own statute and rules.” VCs must abide by directive of Governor/Chancellor, respond as per Act so as to avoid unwholesome situations and attend VIRTUAL CONFERENCE,” read Dhankhar’s second tweet.At around 9.30 am on Wednesday, Dhankhar tweeted an image of a letter chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to him on Tuesday stating that vice-chancellors were governed by their own statute and rules and the governor had already met the high education minister. The chief minister also quoted a message that she received from the governor on Tuesday stating that non-attendance by the vice-chancellors would be a “serious matter in law.”In the tweet, Dhankhar wrote, “political caging of education would be disaster and suicidal.”In another tweet written in Bengali around 9.45 am, Dhankhar described the action by the vice-chancellors as biased.Academicians said the issue might trigger a fresh acrimony between Dhankhar and the Mamata Banerjee government which earlier accused the governor of overstepping his jurisdiction on several occasions. Partha Chatterjee even alleged that the Raj Bhawan in Kolkata had turned into an extension of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s state headquarters.On Tuesday evening, Upacharya Parishad, the vice-chancellors’ body, issued a strongly-worded statement. It said, “…the Vice Chancellors received a humiliating letter (No. 358- S) from the office of the Hon’ble Chancellor on 13.07.2020 and again received an intimidating letter (No. 361-S) on 14.07.2020. Upacharya Parishad considers it extremely unfortunate to receive such communications from the office of the Hon’ble Chancellor during this critical national crisis.” “The language used in the governor’s letters has hurt the prestige of the vice-chancellors. It is not possible for us to attend any meeting unless the invitation is routed through the high education department,” Dr Subires Bhattacharyya, vice-chancellor of North Bengal University and general-secretary of the Parishad, told local media.The statement issued by the Parishad said that direct communication between the chancellor and the vice-chancellors is not possible under Rule 8 (5) of West Bengal State Universities (Terms and Conditions of Service of the Vice-Chancellors and the Manner and Procedure of Official Communication ), Rules 2019.The law was framed last year by the government.The Parishad’s statement said, “…..the vice-chancellors, acting legitimately as per rules cited above, find it extremely undesirable to receive such communications from the Hon’ble Chancellor’s office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-vice-chancellors-accuse-guv-dhankhar-of-humiliating-them-refuse-to-attend-meet/story-bkj6IMbS1wl7lNPofU1YnJ.html

However, in the afternoon, the two BTP legislators left the hotel, and went home, saying they would take a call on supporting a political party at an “appropriate” time.Also Read: Numbers behind Rajasthan storyPilot’s camp claimed to have the support of 22 legislators, including three independents, also said that six other legislators would join it soon, and rejected Gehlot’s claims of being in a majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-m-not-joining-bjp-says-sachin-pilot/story-ll9EmizHTKq0vCZeCJ6byJ.html
15-07-2020||India||MHA asks states to set up more anti-trafficking units in wake of Covid-19||In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Home Affairs has written to states, Union territories to expedite the setting up of new anti-human trafficking units (AHTUs) and upgrade the infrastructure of existing ones to ‘combat and prevent’ human trafficking. The AHTUs are an integrated task force to prevent and combat the menace of human trafficking. Trained representatives from the police, department of women and child development, other relevant departments and renowned non-government organisations are part of the unit which was first established in 2007. While the Central government has provided financial assistance for setting up physical infrastructure in these units, it is the responsibility of various states to depute suitable manpower to manage them. The advisory comes in the wake of nearly Rs 100 crore being released from the Nirbhaya fund in March by the government to facilitate the setting up of the AHTUs in districts across the country. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there were nearly 4,000 cases of trafficking in 2018, of which 99 percent accounted for internal trafficking. Moreover, 92 percent of the trafficking victims who were rescued were women and children.At present, there are over 330 AHTUs that work as convergence centres for the MHA, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Labour and External Affairs to fight human trafficking within India as well as outside it. Also read: Odisha asks MHA to remove 5 Maoist-affected districts from SRE list“Domestic violence, emotional or psychological abuse, neglect and other forms of trauma and violence makes a person vulnerable to human trafficking,” read the advisory which was issued on July 6 and was accessed by Hindustan Times. “Traffickers often exploit the vulnerabilities of people by making false promises of a new job, better income, better living conditions and support to their families etc. While such promises of perpetrators appear legitimate to people, unfortunately, it makes many men, women, and children easy prey for exploitation,” the advisory added. The MHA has also suggested that state governments evolve a co-ordination mechanism, monitored at periodic intervals by the highest level in the state, to handle the issue of human trafficking. Community awareness programmes and engagement at the local level with panchayats, leaders and village wards have also been recommended. “Because children can be transported at a large scale for wage labour, prostitution and trafficking, panchayats may be asked to maintain a register of complete information about the persons living in the village and a keep track of their movement,” the advisory stated. “Specific ‘intelligence’ and ‘surveillance’ mechanism to identify gangs, gather information about its history, affiliations, modus operandi to deceive people, activities of gang members, links with others, etc., should be worked out by the police department,” it added. The advisory also suggested shelters for women and children to be allowed to remain open and called for sensitisation of police personnel at regular and intervals. It asked police personnel deployed at border outposts to be on the “look-out for trafficked children”. “The police force should make full use of CCTNS and CriMAC application, launched by the National Crime Records Bureau in March this year, which facilitates the dissemination of information about significant crimes including human trafficking cases across the country on a real-time basis. These portals can help in locating and identifying the trafficked victims as also in prevention, detection and investigation of crimes,” the advisory added. Amid the pandemic, experts describe the advisory as a welcome step as the ‘situation in the wake of the pandemic is ripe for traffickers to exploit’ due to massive job losses and a likely increase in child labour. According to former DGP PM Nair who was integral in setting up the first batch of AHTUs in 2007, there has been an increase in trafficking of children both online and physically. “I have held various discussion with many stakeholders across the government and non-government sector,” Nair told Hindustan Times. “Trafficking during Covid-19 times has increased manifold,” he said.Nair said that the increase in the consumption of child pornography, which has been accessed by nearly 5 million Indians, leads to sexual exploitation of children. President of Shakti Vahini, an NGO that works with trafficking victims, Ravi Kant said that the NCRB’s numbers are only a fraction of the number of trafficking case. “The case becomes one of trafficking only after the rescued victim’s statement is recorded,” Kant told HT. “Most of the cases are actually recorded as kidnapping or abductions or missing persons,” Kant added. Kant added that the post the pandemic, job losses will drive traffickers to exploit more and more people. “West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand and Orissa are among the worst affected states,” Kant said. “We will see an increase in the number of cases as the vulnerability factor for the exposed section will go up. Parents who have lost their jobs will force their children into labour and others may be driven to it due to desperation. The MHA’s advisory is a welcome one as it will strengthen the efforts to counter it.” Nair too welcomed the decision, however, he added that issuing an advisory is not enough. “The MHA should make the officers at district level accountable, only then will we be able to implement this decision well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-asks-states-to-set-up-more-anti-trafficking-units-in-wake-of-covid-19/story-rGcgi5duSpfGVzvl4g27OK.html

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced a number of development projects for the district on the occasion.“On one side there is a party which imposed Emergency that was a lockdown on democracy and on the other side there is Prime Minister Narendra Modi who implemented lockdown to save the life of people,” said Scindia in his speech.He said, “People may say that I am opposing Emergency now when I have joined the BJP but the fact remains that I opposed it even when I was in Congress.”Lashing out at the then chief minister Kamal Nath, Scindia said when he (Scindia) raised the issues concerning people of the state for the sake of justice to them Nath said let him (Scindia) take to streets “but Kamal Nath ji forgot whose grandson and whose son I am”.He said the then Kamal Nath government betrayed every section of people whether it was farmers, youth, women or others. “There was someone on the chair but its key was in the hand of someone else,” he added.He said whereas a corrupt government did nothing for welfare of people in Madhya Pradesh in its 15-month rule, Chouhan took several decisions for people in just 90 days.Speaking on the occasion, Chouhan said, “On one hand the then Kamal Nath government dumped several welfare schemes which had been introduced by his government earlier and on the other he didn’t fulfill a single promise out of the Congress manifesto including farmers loan waiver, unemployment allowance to youths and welfare schemes for women and students.”Chouhan and Scindia also unveiled a statue of former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Kailash Joshi at Hat Pipalya. Scindia had earlier met senior BJP leader Uma Bharti in Bhopal.Talking to journalists after the meeting, he said that the Congress ran the government during its 15-month rule in Madhya Pradesh as a business instead of fulfilling aspirations of people. There was rampant corruption in the government, he alleged.On Congress’ repeated attacks against him, Scindia said that he didn’t say anything for 90 days as the entire world was fighting the coronavirus but he would now respond to all their charges.State Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “When Scindia ji was in Congress he used to issue warning to the government on every issue that he would take to streets but he didn’t say a single word when the BJP government failed to control Covid-19 situation in the state and is responsible for spread of coronavirus in the state. He must look into his earlier speeches to realise what his opinion was for the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/emergency-was-lockdown-on-democracy-jyotiraditya-scindia/story-4l8v8bU7WiJnqjk3zBORHN.html

The vermicompost will be under the goods section of the short-term agricultural loan of the Primary Agriculture Credit Cooperative Society.Under the scheme, the cow dung will be procured from cow and buffalo owners through gauthan samitis and it will be utilised to make vermicompost and other products.“This will not only promote organic farming but will also create new employment opportunities, encourage protection of cows, stop open grazing and will expand the double-crop area creating a source of extra income of livestock owners,” the government said in a press release.The cabinet has also decided to merge the remaining batch of teachers (panchayat and urban body cadre), who have completed two years or more in service, under the school education department from November 1, 2020, which will benefit 16,278 teachers in the state.It also decided to distribute 5kg of rice per person per month from July 2020 to November 2020 on ration cards (except above poverty line category) issued under the Chhattisgarh Food Security Act, the same way is provided under the National Food Security Act.A kilo of chickpea will also be distributed to people for the same period under the same conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-will-procure-cow-dung-at-rs-2-per-kg-including-transportation-cost-state-cabinet/story-hd6EM32OXv005Q6aQZmQVI.html

The report came out in last week of June.According to the census report, dolphins’ number in Chambal river has been reduced by 13 per cent in four years. The decreasing trend is continuing from 2016 when there were 78 dolphins.In 2006, the Supreme Court’s Central Empowered Committee (CEC) ordered a ban on mining in the sanctuary area to save the flora and fauna of the river. “But illegal sand mining and consumption of water is so rampant that it is putting the whole ecosystem of the river in danger,” said Jyoti Dandotiya, chief scientist of the Deori Gharial Eco-park in Chambal sanctuary in Morena.Principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF), wildlife, SK Mandal said, “The decrease in number of dolphins is a matter of concern but Chambal is a lifeline for three states and the locals of MP, UP and Rajasthan are withdrawing water daily. Similarly, illegal sand mining is rampant in Bhind and Morena in MP and Dholpur in Rajasthan. Forest teams face so many life threatening attacks while taking actions against illegal sand mafia. Forest team needs support of locals, which they never get.” “Dolphin is a sensitive animal and we didn’t find many studies so we roped in a team of experts including scientists of Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to do a research for safeguarding and increasing the population of dolphins in Chambal,” he added.Experts raised concerns on the decreasing number of the national aquatic animal.Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, scientist Qamar Qureshi, who is doing a research on dolphins in Chambal, said, “The maximum carrying capacity of dolphins in Chambal is 125. It’s a rare species of dolphins - platanista gangetica - and has been declared endangered by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It requires at least 3 metre depth and 266.42-289.67 m3 per sec flow of water for sustainable habitat.”“But perennial problems like illegal extraction of sand from the river bed and water withdrawal projects in Morena, Dholpur and Kota are disturbing the whole ecosystem of the river and decreasing the water level and flow. It needs to be addressed properly to save the dolphins as well as ghariyal,” he added.Qureshi said, “With research on what is their favourable environment, we are also doing research to know about their communication system. There is lot to know about this species. It has rudimentary eyes. From preying to surfing, dolphins do it through ultrasonic sound. Now, the research has come to a halt due to Covid-19. We would resume it once this pandemic is over to know more about dolphins.”“The dolphins were spotted for the first time in 1985 in Chambal river near Etawah. That time, the number was more than 110 but poaching reduced the number. Now poaching is not at all a problem but unfavourable habitat is. Not only dolphins, but population of ghariyals has also been affected,” said Dandotiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dolphin-number-dips-in-chambal-river-experts-raise-concern/story-cxZFf1gM2TI46Q5y4Zu1jO.html

15-07-2020||India||Chhattisgarh govt appoints 15 parliamentary secretaries, BJP calls it unconstitutional||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has slammed the Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress government in Chhattisgarh for appointing 15 parliamentary secretaries. The Opposition party said the move is unconstitutional and an attempt to pacify dissent.Baghel on Tuesday administered the oath to these parliamentary secretaries, all member of legislative assembly (MLAs), in the chief minister’s office.All the MLAs, except two - Chintmani Maharaj and Parasnath Rajwade - are first-time MLAs in the state assembly and will now be allotted different departments under cabinet ministers.Senior leader of BJP and former minister Ajay Chandrakar told Hindustan Times said that the appointment is completely unconstitutional.“Congress has always opposed the appointment of parliamentary secretaries when they were in the Opposition and now they doing the same. It also reflected that there is rift and dissent among the MLAs of the state, just like Rajasthan,” said Chandrakar.The BJP leader also said that they should tell the public about the directions of court about the powers which were curtailed by the court. “They should also tell whether any writ is pending before the high court over the appointment of parliamentary secretaries,” said Chandrakar.The BJP also alleged that the appointed parliamentary secretaries which will add additional burden to state exchequer at a time when it is dealing with the Covid-19 crisis.It is worth mentioning that in 2017, current cabinet minister Mohammad Akbar had challenged the appointment of 11 parliamentary secretaries by the previous BJP government in the high court. Akbar claimed that these appointments were illegal and unconstitutional.In April 2018, the court had dismissed the petitions but maintained its interim order, passed in 2017, that parliamentary secretaries will not be entitled to power and facilities at par with ministers.Recently, speaking about the appointments of parliamentary secretaries by his government, Akbar said that the Congress government will appoint MLAs as parliamentary secretaries but they will not be entitled to facilities at par with the cabinet ministers.“In our government, parliamentary secretaries will not function as ministers but will work as their assistants without holding the office of profit. We will strictly comply with the directives of the HC,” he added.The BJP’s legal unit slammed the Chhattisgarh government saying it is a mockery of democracy and law.“The appointment of parliamentary secretaries has been declared unconstitutional by Himachal Pradesh government and the case is pending before the apex court of India. Same thing happened with the Delhi government and the case is lying before the Election Commission of India. So far as Chhattisgarh government is concerned, Congress government led by Bhupesh government is going to appoint 15 ministers against 12 ministers which is unconstitutional and the mockery of democracy,” Naresh Gupta, in-charge of BJP’s legal unit of Chhattisgarh, had said ahead of the appointment.Responding to the allegations, agriculture minister Ravindra Chaubey said that the BJP government had first appointed parliamentary secretaries.“First the BJP should answer whey they had appointed parliamentary secretaries when they were power,” he said while talking to reporters.“Parliamentary secretaries give opportunity to the government to serve the larger part of the state by dividing the portfolios between MLAs which will be extension to the ministers and will lessen the burden of the departments and will also give an opportunity of learning the political and administrative skills to the younger MLAs under the guidance of senior ministers. The appointment of parliamentary secretary in our state is absolutely as per the dictum given by Chhattisgarh high court,” said Peeyush Bhatia, government advocate at the high court of Chhattisgarh and state president, youth bar association of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-govt-appoints-15-parliamentary-secretaries-bjp-calls-it-unconstitutional/story-SIxMGI55fjtL5m3mvmpaXO.html

Jani had gone to the local forest on June 24 afternoon when she collapsed and died. She was buried instead of being cremated because there were no survivors in her immediate family to perform the funeral.After the local media reported about her death, a fact-finding team from Odisha Khadya Adhikar Abhiyan had visited her village early this month and found that Jani did not have access to food for three days before she died.“Jani depended on collection of non-timber forest produce from nearby jungles as she had no other source of income. Her access to subsidised food grain supplies from the public distribution system was limited and irregular,” said Sameet Panda, one of the members of the forum on food rights.“Though she had an Annapurna card sanctioned in March 2016 that entitled her to get 10 kilos of rice free from the public distribution system, she had got the rice last in November 2018. She was deprived of free ration from November 2018. She was entitled to pension as a single woman but couldn’t get one in spite of applying several times via panchayat and block officials. This is a clear case of administrative negligence and apathy on many counts,” Panda said.Panda said the tribal woman didn’t have a job card under MGNREGA, which could have provided her unskilled work. Neither did she get the Jan Dhan support provided by the central government as assistance during the lockdown. She didn’t get the rice and dal offered under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana even she had presumably did not have a ration card.The investigating team’s members who spoke to local villagers said despite approaching panchayat and block officials, Jani could not get a ration card under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana.“She got a State Food Security Scheme card only after she went to the district collector’s grievance cell on February 24 this year. She did not have any other social security scheme to support herself,” said Laxmidhar Singh, another member of the team.Local sarpanch Trilochan Sahu said he had arranged for 15kg of rice and Rs 1,000 during the lockdown for her.Anganwadi worker Basanti Behera said Jani was given cooked food for some days during the initial period of the lockdown by the community resource person of the gram panchayat but it stopped after some time.“It was a sad case of complete social apathy. The person like Dukhi in such a dire case was not supported much by the community. Jani being a single woman without any income support should have provided with AAY card to provide protection from hunger and starvation,” a member of the Odisha Khadya Adhikar Abhiyan said.“The current situation due to the pandemic has made many poor people like Jani vulnerable to starvation death,” the member added.Nayagarh district collector Poma Tudu did not respond to messages or calls seeking the administration’s comment on the alleged starvation death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-tribal-woman-dies-of-starvation-during-lockdown-food-rights-group-alleges/story-JfLJSCurrF2s6IkyZoWOYJ.html

And if they lose India and the United States, they lose some western European countries, that takes a big tool away from the espionage work or the surveillance work of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party),” he said in response to a question on the dangers posed by apps like TikTok.“The kids who are using TikTok -- and it can be a lot of fun -- but there are a lot of other social media platforms they could use. TikTok is getting facial recognition on you,” O’Brien said.“They are getting all of your personal, private data, your most intimate data. They are getting to know who your friends are, who your parents are. They can map all your relationships,” he added.All the information is going straight to massive super computers in the cloud in China, O’Brien said, adding, “So China is going to know everything about you. They are going to have biometrics on you. You ought to be very careful regarding who you give such personal information to.” The Trump administration, he said, is looking not just at TikTok but at WeChat and some other Chinese apps as well, because the Chinese are veracious consumers of America’s personal data.“They will either try and get you to give it to them for free through WeChat or TikTok -- if they cannot get it that way, they will steal it,” O’Brien said.China, he said, has hacked into Marriott and stolen the personal data of hundreds of millions of people, including their passport numbers.“They have hacked into Experian and other credit rating agencies to get most intimate credit details. They have hacked into Anthem healthcare so that they can get medical details.“So this is not just an advertiser trying to find out what you are interested in searching for on Google so they can sell you a different brand of car, this is a country that is looking to get every bit of personal, private information they can, so they know everything about you,” O’Brien said.“There are social credit scores in China. They give people scores based on how compliant they are with Communist Party dictates. They are going to be able to put social credit scores together on all Americans and everyone in the world soon because of artificial intelligence and super computing.“We need to make sure that does not happen,” the US National Security Advisor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banning-tiktok-takes-a-big-tool-away-from-chinese-surveillance-work-us-nsa/story-74Z2V4KOSZnC6GNpJ9YZ3O.html
15-07-2020||India||Rajasthan political crisis: BJP waiting in wings, watching events unfold||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday made friendly overtures to rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot after he was sacked as the deputy chief minister and Rajasthan Congress chief amid his face-off with Ashok Gehlot.Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who is a BJP Parliament member from Rajasthan, said the party has grown manifold and any leader with the people’s mandate is welcome to join it. Another BJP lawmaker, Om Mathur, echoed him.The comments came shortly after Gehlot blamed the BJP for conspiring with Pilot to topple his government. Mathur rejected the allegation saying “by shutting the eyes one does not erase the sun”. In a tweet, he said “the structure of your house is weak” and questioned how could Gehlot blame the BJP for it.Also read: How Ashok Gehlot retained support, made inroads into Sachin Pilot campThe BJP sharpened its attack on the Congress leadership for blaming it for the crisis in Rajasthan. It also shifted its stance from watching from the sidelines to taking on an aggressive posture.Shekhawat called the events unfolding in Rajasthan a diversionary tactic. He likened them to the Bollywood trend of “propaganda” to make a film work if it seems it will not do well. “This is what has happened in Rajasthan where the government has been unable to provide good governance, and crime and corruption have grown. In the last one and a half years, the way the Congress has been ruling in Rajasthan, it is only natural that they would have created propaganda,” he said.He blamed Gehlot for orchestrating the discord and said he has directed, produced, and acted in “the film” that was in the making for the last six months. Shekhawat said Gehlot “seemed very happy” when he stepped out of the governor’s house on Tuesday whereas lawmakers have been held against their wishes.Shekhawat said Gehlot has been successful in planning Pilot’s ouster and added democracy and Rajasthan’s people have had to pay a heavy price. “This government is a minority government and making efforts to save its chair...”Also read: Congress ejects Pilot from power; CM Gehlot still in Rajasthan cockpitShekhawat’s statement about the government lacking numbers was also an indication that the party could raise the issue of a floor test, even though Rajasthan unit president Satish Poonia told ANI, “At present, we are not demanding anything as of now. Our priority was that it is a corrupt government and it did mismanagement in the coronavirus crisis. It has become a weak government. First thing is that this government should go away in the interest of the people.”Satish Poonia, the BJP’s Rajasthan chief, said they were not demanding anything as of now while calling Gehlot’s government inept and corrupt. He also accused it of mismanaging the coronavirus crisis. “It has become a weak government. First thing is that this government should go away in the interest of the people,” Poonia said.A BJP leader in Delhi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, earlier said the party will not seek a floor test unless it is confident that both Gehlot and Pilot factions are falling short of numbers.Also read: Numbers behind Rajasthan storyGehlot on Tuesday claimed to have the support of 109 lawmakers in the 200-member state assembly, where the halfway mark is 101. The BJP has only 72 lawmakers.The BJP has maintained it will keep its options open should the Gehlot government fall in the wake of defections to the Pilot camp. It has made no overt attempts to initiate an alliance with Pilot-led Congress rebels.Functionaries aware of the matter said senior BJP leaders, including general secretary Anil Jain and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, have been tasked with tracking developments in Rajasthan.Jain and Pradhan declined to comment on whether there was a meeting between BJP leaders and Pilot. The BJP has dismissed speculation about a meeting between Pilot and BJP chief JP Nadda.A second BJP leader, when asked about the speculation that the BJP could support Pilot if he floats his party and stakes claim to form the government, said they will watch from the sidelines until it becomes clear that the Gehlot faction does not have the required numbers to stay in power.“A clear situation has to emerge for the party [BJP] to take its next steps. We are currently watching the Congress collapse because of infighting. The inability of the Congress leadership in keeping the unit together is showing and if the government falls, naturally we will explore all options open to us,” said the second leader in Delhi, requesting anonymity.“If Pilot has the numbers to form the government, the party will consider support. But if we go by the anti-defection law, he will need 2/3rd of the MLAs with him otherwise they stand disqualified and will require re-election.”There has also been no statement from former Rajasthan chief minister and BJP leader Vasundhara Raje on the developments in the state, leading to speculation that she is not on board with Pilot joining the party.Raje, who claims to have the support of over 40 MLAs, has been at loggerheads with the central leadership over several issues in the past.The BJP has deputed Mathur to take stock of situation in the state. He is expected to chair a meeting of the BJP leaders in the state on Wednesday.The BJP leaders have insisted that they have had no role in engineering defections in the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-political-crisis-bjp-waiting-in-wings-watching-events-unfold/story-jQxtVJJzDV0NwwYhvvCurN.html
15-07-2020||India||Rajasthan turmoil exposes fault lines, indecisiveness in Congress||The political crisis in Rajasthan, coming just three months after the fall of its government in Madhya Pradesh, has once again exposed the fault lines in the Congress as it confronts infighting in many states. Indecisiveness on the part of the Congress leadership cost the party dearly in Madhya Pradesh and triggered turbulence for its government in Rajasthan.The power struggle between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot has been going on for a long time. It escalated after the Congress came to power in the 2018 assembly elections when the party high command opted for Gehlot as the chief minister.The gamesmanship peaked with a notice to Pilot from the Special Operations Group of the Rajasthan police to record his statement in connection with its probe into an alleged attempt to topple the Gehlot government.Also read: How Ashok Gehlot retained support, made inroads into Sachin Pilot campBoth Gehlot and Pilot repeatedly conveyed their grievances to senior leader Ahmed Patel, party general secretary in-charge of the organisation, KC Venugopal, and general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan Avinash Pande. But the differences persisted.The developments in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have cast a shadow also on the stability of the government in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh where chief minister Bhupesh Baghel is engaged in a bitter power tussle with his cabinet colleague TS Singh Deo.“The issue has also been brought to the notice of the Congress high command on many occasions but there seems to be no end to the turf war. Chhattisgarh in-charge PL Punia has failed to unite the warring leaders,” said a Congress functionary familiar with the development, requesting anonymity.In Punjab, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu is sulking and the Congress central leadership has failed to resolve differences between him and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.Also read: Congress ejects Pilot from power; CM Gehlot still in Rajasthan cockpit“Sidhu is incommunicado for the past several months. He is visibly hurt and there is no reconciliation attempt from the central leadership so far,” said a Punjab Congress leader on condition of anonymity.Sidhu is dealing directly with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and has had no interaction with party’s Punjab in-charge Asha Kumari.State chiefs of Telangana (Uttam Kumar Reddy) and Odisha (Niranjan Patnaik) resigned from their posts soon after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections but the party leadership is still struggling to find replacements for them. There is a broad consensus in the party that regional satraps need to be strengthened but the status quoist approach of the leadership has also demoralised the party cadre eagerly waiting for the oganisational reshuffle that was due after the humiliating defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Also read: As Congress picks old guard over new, future tense for both Gehlot, PilotHyderabad-based political analyst and Congress watcher C Narasimha Rao said groupism had always plagued the party. “That is weakening the Congress.

15-07-2020||India||HT Salutes: A helping hand to tackle mental health issues||A 32-year-old woman, who was diagnosed with clinical depression two years ago, was forced to skip the appointments with her psychiatrist for three months after the lockdown was imposed in March to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). A cash crunch — her spouse had lost his job and income was tight — made it difficult for her to continue her therapy. But she resumed her sessions in the last week of June. And it was a stranger on Twitter who made it happen, as he offered to pay for her next few counselling sessions.Ankit Gupta, a content writer and Urdu poet who has been living in Delhi for the past year, has been using Twitter to connect those expressing a need for mental health help with two psychologists based in Mumbai and Delhi, who have slashed fees and agreed to conduct online or telephonic counselling during the lockdown.“Ever since the lockdown was implemented, I’ve heard of several people losing jobs and therefore being unable to afford their psychiatric treatments. Professional mental health is expensive in India, and I know this because I have myself overcome depression. I know how tough the struggle is,” said the 27-year-old. Watch | HT Salutes: Delhi poet who arranges free mental health counselling sessionsThe idea to help people access mental healthcare was sparked by the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, who died by suicide on June 14. That’s when he tweeted out his offer to fund counselling sessions for people who couldn’t afford a counsellor.After the tweet offering to help pay for counselling sessions, more than 20 people connected with him almost immediately. “I asked them for basic information: were they consulting a doctor for the first time, or did they need to continue their treatment. Accordingly I connected them with either of the two therapists who are helping me,” said Gupta. In most cases, people shared their inability to continue treatment due to increasing costs. “Both of them (counsellors) have been charging a nominal fee of ₹300 per session and have been conducting virtual therapy sessions for over 35 people in the last three weeks,” said Gupta.Mental health experts, who have been witnessing a consistent spike in cases of anxiety and depression among all age groups, lauded Gupta’s efforts.“Not only is the pandemic an unprecedented time, but anxiety and claustrophobia is taking over daily routine because people are understanding that this is going to be the way of life for some time now,” said clinical psychologist Seema Hingorrany.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-a-helping-hand-to-tackle-mental-health-issues/story-Bj7t1S9clo3tUNIJ4SNLHJ.html
15-07-2020||India||India set for pivotal role in Covid-19 vaccine production: ICMR||India will play a crucial role in scaling up production of any Covid-19 vaccine that is developed anywhere in the world, the head of India’s top medical research body said on Tuesday, citing the size of the domestic pharma industry and expressing hope that the country will be well poised for the production of successful candidates. The comments come weeks after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) appeared to rush the trial process of one of the two Indian vaccines by setting an August 15 launch deadline, before widespread criticism forced officials to clarify that a letter mentioning that date was meant to speed up the regulatory approvals process rather than lay down a hard timeline. “India is well-known as the pharmacy of the world... It also supplies 60% of the world’s vaccines, whether it be Africa, Europe, south east Asia or anywhere. So, any vaccine candidate that’s produced or developed in any part of the world will ultimately have to be scaled-up in India or by China because these are the two major vaccine producers of the world,” said Balram Bhargava, the head of ICMR, while adding that several developed nations are in touch with Indian entities for vaccine distribution.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayBhargava said two India-made vaccines are now being trialled with 1,000 volunteers each, and the focus will be on easing regulatory clearances for the process without compromising on scientific or ethical parameters. “The two indigenous vaccine candidates have undergone successful toxicity studies in rates, mice and rabbits and their data was submitted to the drugs controller general of India, following which both these candidate vaccines got clearance to start the early phase human trials early this month,” he said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Among the two is Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which received drugs controller general of India’s nod for human trials on June 29 . On July 2, a letter sent by Bhargava to hospitals where vaccine trials were to be done said, “it is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by 15th August 2020 after completion of all clinical trials”. Criticised for setting an unrealistic timeline that would compromise vaccine safety, the ICMR later backtracked and said international trial protocols will be followed.Another vaccine candidate is from Zydus Cadila called ZyCov-D, which received the drug controller’s approval for human trials on July 2. It was developed indigenously at the company’s Vaccine Technology Centre in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.Also read: Regulate Covid treatment costs at private hospitals, orders Supreme Court“They have got their sites ready and they are doing their clinical studies on approximately a 1,000 human volunteers each at different sites, some have six and some 12. They are trying to do the early clinical testing for these two indigenous candidate vaccines. Over and above there are pre-clinical experiments for other vaccine being done at National Institute of Virology in Pune, which is trying to work day and night to do these experiments because it is our moral duty to develop these vaccines as fast as possible,” said Bhargava.The world over, vaccine candidates that have been put on a fast-track are from Russia, China, United States of America and the United Kingdom. “We are making all efforts to fast-track developing the vaccine and it is the moral duty that there should not be a delay even by a day for the regulatory clearances for these vaccines so that we can break the transmission of the virus as soon as possible,” said Bhargava.Dr VK Paul, member, Niti Ayog, in an earlier interview to HT, also had said that India will take the lead in manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine when it is developed. Experts also say that eventually it is the vaccine that will provide the key to break the transmission cycle.“The vaccine will be ultimate to check the disease spread but we don’t know when will an effective vaccine be available for use even though all our efforts are being directed towards making it happen as soon as possible. A good vaccine is the most cost-effective way of preventing a disease,” said Dr Amita Jain, head, microbiology department, KGMU, Lucknow.Bhargava was speaking at briefing organised by the Union government on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-for-pivotal-role-in-covid-19-vaccine-production-icmr/story-FHkz2CuK4afNLcgGGgIfZN.html
15-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||I have questions.It is clear, from the trajectory of infections in countries around the world, that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) starts slow, builds up momentum, rises to a peak, then starts plateauing, and finally falls.This is more or less true for every country in Europe. It is true for Italy, France, Spain, and Germany.And, within every country, it is true for every region.In large countries, it is also true of states that were early hunting grounds for the virus — New York in the US; Delhi, perhaps, in India.So, the first question is simply this: Is there a pattern?Does the trajectory of infections across countries follow a certain timeline? If so, what is this timeline? 45 days? Two months?Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Or, does it dance to a different metric — say, the population infection rate, rising till a certain proportion of the population is infected, and then falling? If so, what is this proportion? 15%? 20%? 25%?And if this is indeed the case, what does it mean for the herd immunity level? 60% or 43%? Or could it be some other value?I ask these questions because I haven’t come across any answers on why the infection followed the pattern it did in continental Europe, and New York City. Countries on the continent may see a flare-up, but, on current evidence and case statistics, the worst is definitely behind them. That can be said of New York State and New York City too. And closer home, the same can be said, albeit tentatively, of Delhi.Why did the infections start falling in Europe? Why did they start falling in New York? And why in Delhi?Also read: Regulate Covid treatment costs at private hospitals, orders Supreme CourtSure, masks, lockdowns, social distancing, better hygiene, and extensive testing and tracing helped, but the infection still traversed a similar trajectory in most countries (and states within countries) that have seen off the worst of it.Does it indicate an overall population infection rate that is rarely crossed? And because this can’t be herd immunity (not at the levels we are talking of), does this mean only 15%, 20%, 25% of a population is vulnerable to the infection itself under certain conditions (which would include our current response to the disease)?Like I said at the beginning of this column, I have questions. Scientists who believe they are good enough to be hypotheses that merit research are welcome to use them. I’m not particular about credit — I just want the answers.We know that the Sars-CoV2 virus which causes Covid-19 does not infect everybody. In fact, why it infects who it does is one of the questions researchers are scrambling to answer (they have a reasonably good explanation on how it infects, though, and also how it kills). It might be even better to flip the question around – why does the virus not infect those it doesn’t?We also know that not everyone who is infected spreads the disease — research has shown that a lot of the spreading is caused by super spreaders, perhaps explaining the clusters of infection that emerge.And finally, we know that the infection rate on the Diamond Princess (the yacht, which for some time had more cases than most countries) was 20%, and that on the US Navy’s Theodore Roosevelt 25%. Both were contained spaces and, at least in theory, the virus should have infected more people, perhaps everyone on board.Why did it not?Still, the preceding three statements are internally consistent – not everyone exposed to the virus gets infected; and not everyone infected by the virus passes it on.It would help to know the prevalence of the infection in, say, Italy, New York City, and Delhi, because that could be a starting point for some of the answers.That’s what makes serological surveys (blood tests) of the population, to find out who has antibodies to the virus and who doesn’t, important.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-ND0LT7himhu0HmcL1rtn2K.html

While initially Visakhapatnam police commissioner R K Meena said that there were no casualties, except injuries to four workers, the police later recovered the charred body of senior chemist Kandregula Srinivasa Rao. Visakhapatnam district collector V Vinay Chand said the fire broke out in one of the columns during the solvents’ recovery process. There were five reactors in the plant and one of them exploded. The fire spread to a few other adjacent tanks storing chemicals resulting in their explosion. The sound was so deafening that people in Visakhapatnam city, about 15 km from the pharma city, could also hear it. The police commissioner said the cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained. “The police and fire tenders rushed there and brought the flames under control,” he said. The opposition Telugu Desam Party and CPI (M) blamed it on the state government for adopting callous approach towards industrial accidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-dead-in-visakhapatnam-pharma-unit-fire/story-XuJGw5HtajN1CectMrgpyM.html
15-07-2020||India||Railways creates prototype of post-Covid coach to fight virus||The railways is preparing to provide better hygiene and sanitation standards in train coaches as it plans to install foot-operated soap dispensers, copper-coated handrails, fixtures with titanium dioxide (TiO2) coating that kills viruses and plasma air equipment inside air conditioning (AC) ducts to steralise and make the interiors particulate matter-resistant. The national carrier’s production unit, Rail Coach Factory in Kapurthala, has built the first prototype. The railways plans to retrofit all its existing coaches with these amenities, officials aware of the matter said.“Post Covid Coach will have hands-free amenities like foot operated water tap and soap dispenser, foot operated lavatory door (outside), foot operated flush valve, foot operated latches in lavatory door, outside washbasin with foot operated water tap and soap dispenser and forearm operated handle on compartment doors,” the railway ministry said in its design note for the coaches. The first two coaches built at the unit have fixtures coated with TiO2 and the provision for plasma air equipment in AC ducts to sterilise interiors using ionised air. “This plasma air equipment will sterilize the air and surfaces inside the AC coach using ionised air to make the coach Covid-19 and particulate matter resistant. This provision will also improve the ion concentration from 100 ions/cm3 to more than 6000 ions/cm,” the ministry said.The ministry said nano structured TiO2 functions as photoactive material. “This is eco-friendly water-based coating that kills viruses, bacteria, mould, and fungal growth and most importantly enhances indoor air quality,” the ministry said. “It is non-toxic and approved by [the] food testing laboratory of the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA), CE certified. TiO2 is considered to be a safe substance and is harmless to humans. This Titanium Dioxide coating [will be] applied on washbasins, lavatory, seats & berths, snack table, glass window, floor, virtually every surface that comes in human contact.” The effective life of this coating is expected to be a year. The coaches will also be equipped with copper-coated handrails and latches. “Copper degrades the virus landed on it within few hours. Copper has anti-microbial properties,” the ministry noted.The railways is planning to manufacture all coaches with these specifications. “ All future coach production will have these features. For existing coaches, too, we will try to retrofit wherever it is technically possible. The same was also done for bio toilets, which were retrofitted in existing coaches,” an official said on condition of anonymity.An estimate of the cost of production was not immediately available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-creates-prototype-of-post-covid-coach-to-fight-virus/story-llhw9bDcSGNldaSKiI4G0O.html
15-07-2020||India||First ‘virtual’ Constitution bench hearing in SC||New DelhiThe Supreme Court held its first Constitution bench sitting through videoconferencing on Tuesday, with, for the first time since March 5, five judges sitting together in one court to take up critical matters that require an interpretation of the Constitution. The court moved into virtual mode on March 25, as the coronavirus disease started infecting more people across India. The country declared a 68-day hard lockdown (in four phases), between March 25 and June 1. A bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose appeared wearing masks and maintaining nearly two-feet distance between themselves on the bench. There were previously concerns in some quarters that the Constitution bench would not be able to sit during the pandemic. Several important cases are awaiting the attention of the Constitution bench. These include the matter on rights versus faith relating to religious practices that restrict women from entering mosques, Parsi worship places and the Sabarimala temple, petitions challenging scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Articles 370 and 35A, validity of the Citizenship Amendment Act granting citizenship to non-Muslims from neighbouring Islamic countries, and the legal case to determine what is a money bill.The first case the five-judge bench heard was a legal tussle on whether the Centre has the power to provide reservation to in-service candidates (those already in government service, as doctors in this case) in post-graduate medical degree courses. The plea was brought up by the Tamil Nadu Medical Officers Association.Senior advocate Arvind Datar opened arguments in the case, sharing the extensive compilation of his arguments including cases to be referred through Google drive . One of the lawyers, senior advocate Vikas Singh appearing for Medical Council of India (MCI) complained of being unable to access the Google Drive. He objected to Datar referring to the same. The problem was sorted out when the court asked Datar to give case law citations.As the hearing proceeded, Datar was inaudible to the court. Justice Shah commented in a lighter vein, “Don’t keep social distancing with your mike.” Datar heard mike as “wife” leaving the bench in splits. “There is no bar if the Court continues hearing Constitution bench matters but the present system must be geared up to support such hearings. Screen sharing must be activated on VIDYO app to allow documents to be exhibited. Case files should be digitized and given to judges. There must be a steady bandwidth to support multiple video links. And lastly, the online platform must provide an enclosure allowing privacy of discussion happening between senior lawyers and their briefing counsels,” said senior advocate KV Vishwanathan. Other matters listed before the Constitution Bench could not be taken up.The day also witnessed veteran jurist Fali S Nariman make a maiden appearance through videoconferencing before a three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde. Seeing him, the CJI remarked, “So happy to see you Mr Nariman. For the first time you are appearing through videoconferencing.”True to his tradition at the bar to stand and address the Court, Nariman stood and addressed the Court expressing his inhibitions of appearing in a “virtual court”. The CJI corrected him by saying, “This is not a virtual court. It’s a real court where only the hearing is virtual.”The Court began hearing of urgent cases through a videoconferencing app called VIDYO in March . The volume of cases taken up on a daily basis has been less in the past three months.Beginning March 23, the SC took up close to 7,000 cases till June 20.Beginning this week, the Supreme Court has listed Constitution Bench matters for hearing as well. With the pandemic showing no signs of let up there is uncertainty over when physical court hearings can resume. The Constitution Bench heard and reserved judgment in the first case it took up through videoconferencing .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-virtual-constitution-bench-hearing-in-sc/story-FVVS9DUCXE2tPhY1ZqKAAI.html
15-07-2020||India||From MP in 2004 to a rebel in 2020: Sachin Pilot’s journey in Congress||Sachin Pilot’s entry into the Congress in 2002, two years after the death of his father Rajesh Pilot in a road accident, was marked by jubilation, and cheered , among others, by his current bête noire chief minister Ashok Gehlot.Now, 18 years later, the long-standing rivalry between Gehlot, 69, and Pilot, 42, has culminated in a bitter out-in-the-open feud, threatening to destablise the Congress govermment in Rajasthan.Pilot, was inducted into the Congress in February 2002 by then state chief Girija Vyas with much fanfare during a Kisan rally in Jaipur. Gehlot was also present at the rally.Two year later in 2004, he contested his first election and emerged victorious from the Dausa Lok Sabha seat in Rajasthan.Also read: Congress ejects Pilot from power; CM Gehlot still in Rajasthan cockpitIn the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Pilot, then 32, contested and won from Ajmer and was appointed union minister of state for communications and information technology.In the 2012 union cabinet reshuffle, Pilot was elevated as a minister of state with independent charge and given the portfolio of corporate affairs.Barely few months before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Pilot, then 36, was named as the Rajasthan Congress chief. By then, the party had badly lost the assembly elections in 2013 with Gehlot as the chief minister.While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) recorded its highest ever margin in Rajasthan winning 163 seats in that election, the Congress registered its worst ever poll performance with 21 seats.The grand old party repeated its performance in the 2014 national elections and failed to win any of the 25 Lok Sabha seats from the state. Pilot too lost from Ajmer.By then, the rivalry between Gehlot and Pilot had begun, with each blaming the other for the poll debacle.Since Pilot was considered close to Rahul Gandhi, the Gehlot camp viewed his appointment as state chief as an attempt to cut the veteran leader to size.Also read: How Ashok Gehlot retained support, made inroads into Sachin Pilot campIn 2017, Gehlot was brought to Delhi and made general secretary in-charge of BJP-ruled Gujarat just before the assembly elections.The appointment was seen as an attempt by the Congress high command to strike a balance of power in Rajasthan, with Gehlot being handed over a key position at the national level; the move also gave Pilot the much-needed political space in the state.Under Gehlot’s charge, the Congress fought a keenly contested election in Gujarat i. That period also saw Rahul Gandhi beginning to rely on the veteran leader.Soon after Rahul Gandhi became the Congress president in December 2017, he appointed Gehlot to the key position of general secretary in charge of organisation, replacing another veteran Janardan Dwivedi.In the run-up to the 2018 assembly elections and with Pilot at helm, the Congress had won by-elections to few assembly and Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan, and also performed well in local body elections. When the Congress won the 2018 assembly elections, Pilot staked claim to the chief minister’s post arguing that he worked hard , reviving the Congress in the state. Also read: Numbers behind Rajasthan storyBut Pilot’s claim was overlooked and the Congress leadership once again opted for Gehlot, who became Rajasthan chief minister for the third time. Pilot, then 40, was named his deputy.The rivalry had by then turned into a bitter power tussle between the two with Pilot claiming that his authority was being repeatedly undermined by Gehlot. Both once again blamed each other for the debacle in the 2019 Lok Sabha when the Congress failed to open its account from the state.There were also frequent run-ins between the two. Pilot has commented critically on Rajasthan’s record in public health and law and order. In turn, Gehlot sidelined Pilot completely. The Congress’ central leadership was aware of the differences between the two but both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi ignored it. The flashpoint came late last week when Pilot received a notice from the special operations group (SOG) of the state police to record his statement regarding the alleged attempts to topple the Congress government in the state.Though the SOG also served similar notices to Gehlot, government’s chief whip Mahesh Joshi and several legislators, Pilot’s loyalists termed it yet another move to “humiliate” their leader and “undermine” his authority. The police report to Gehlot. Pilot rushed to Delhi soon after receiving the notice along with some of his loyal legislators. The rebellion was now out in the open. Pilot’s refusal to attend the two Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meetings in Jaipur and to sort out the differences with Gehlot culminated in his sacking as the deputy chief minister and the state Congress president. Gehlot, who received Pilot in the Congress with warmth and enthusiasm in 2002, oversaw his removal from key positions 18 years later in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-mp-in-2004-to-a-rebel-in-2020/story-vw8ovxe9g3lQcSXg0k4QaP.html
15-07-2020||India||Rajasthan political crisis: Truce hinged on three key demands||How did the Congress party go from reaching out to Rajasthan’s deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and Rahul Gandhi expressing his “affection’’ for him, to removing him as the deputy chief minister in under 24 hours? Hindustan Times has spoken to several key Congress leaders to piece together the events that led to Pilot’s exit as deputy CM and also as the Pradesh Congress Committee chief.According to a senior Congress leader who spoke on condition of anonymity, Pilot placed three conditions before the party leadership that simply couldn’t be met. The first was that Pilot would be made chief minister in 2022, a year before the elections.“He wanted a public committment right away that in the last year, he would be the Chief minister. He wanted us to announce it to all ,’’ added the leader, who is involved in the party’s decisions at the highest level. Also read: Congress ejects Pilot from power; CM Gehlot still in Rajasthan cockpitThe second demand was that all of Pilot’s supporters would be given some position in the government -- not necessarily as ministers, but “rewarded” in some way, this person said -- “made heads of corporations or any other bodies.’’The third and final demand was that Avinash Pandey, the general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan should be removed from his post. Pilot believes that Pandey is biased towards chief minister Ashok Gehlot and that the situation could return to normal only if another person was brought in his place.“We really tried to bring him around but we couldn’t accept his condition. What if other leaders in other states started asking for this as well?’’ asked the senior leader. Also read: How Ashok Gehlot retained support, made inroads into Sachin Pilot campPilot didn’t respond to queries on whether he laid down these conditions, but one of his supporters said: ”But the Congress is not in power in other states. So why do they have this fear?’’However, the senior Congress leader insisted that the party tried its best. He added that Congress President Sonia Gandhi’s brief to the mediators was simple -- try to bring Pilot around.“Even till this morning, till before the CLP (Congress Legislative Party) meeting began, we kept talking to him. All of us spoke to him-- his well wishers within and outside the party but he wouldn’t listen,’’ said the leader.Hindustan times has confirmed that while Rahul Gandhi did not speak to him, Priyanka Gandhi did make a call to Pilot. Also read: Numbers behind Rajasthan storyWhen the last call from the emissaries was made at around 1030 am on Tuesday and Pilot still wouldn’t budge, the party went ahead with its meeting and passed a resolution against him. That’s when Randeep Surjewala announced , ``We are sorry that Sachin Pilot and some of his ministers have gotten involved in a BJP conspiracy to bring down a democratically elected government.’’“I have never said or done anything in my life against the Congress party,’’ a second supporter quoted Sachin Pilot as having said soon after the decision. “All I wanted was that the public humiliation that Ashok Gehlot put me through should also be publicly acknowledged and set right.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/truce-hinged-on-three-key-demands/story-rqe4YOqisCh6CoJCXHjWAO.html
15-07-2020||India||Congress begins process to disqualify rebel legislators||The Congress initiated late on Tuesday the process of disqualifying legislators who failed to attend two consecutive legislature party meetings in Jaipur as the party scrambled to shore up its numbers and save its government.The decision came hours after Sachin Pilot was removed as deputy chief minister and two other ministers, Vishwendra Singh and Ramesh Meena, were dropped from the cabinet. Singh and Meena are considered close associates of 42-year-old Pilot.Congress general secretary in charge of Rajasthan, Avinash Pande, said the party had initiated the process of issuing notices to the MLAs who did not attend the Congress Legislature Party meeting by submitting a petition before assembly speaker CP Joshi.Also read: How Ashok Gehlot retained support, made inroads into Sachin Pilot campHe said the absence of the MLAs from the CLP meeting amounted to giving up their membership of the party voluntarily as they tried to destabilise the government. “We have filed a petition before the speaker for dismissal, if the replies aren’t found justified, then it is up to the speaker to decide the action,” said Pande.There was no immediate response from the office of speaker CP Joshi. None of the MLAs who skipped the two meetings – one on Monday and one on Tuesday – was available for comment.To be sure, Pilot has neither been expelled nor has he formally quit the primary membership of the party. The same holds true for all the other rebel MLAs.Also read: Numbers behind Rajasthan storyPande refused to specify the number of MLAs who will get the and when asked, only said, “All who were absent from the CLP.”Also read: As Congress picks old guard over new, future tense for both Gehlot, PilotSenior Congress leaders confirmed to HT that 88 party MLAs attended Monday’s meeting while 86 were present at Tuesday’s meeting.

15-07-2020||India||How the Rajasthan impasse is different from Madhya Pradesh saga||The Congress’ decision to sack Sachin Pilot from both deputy chief ministership and state unit presidency of the party in Rajasthan — and Pilot’s open rebellion over the past few days — has thrown up comparisons with Madhya Pradesh. In MP, Jyotiraditya Scindia — the party’s young and popular face — walked out in March, along with legislators loyal to him, and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), leading to the ouster of the Kamal Nath government, and the subsequent installation of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government. But there are significant differences between the two states. Here are three such variations:1 Ashok Gehlot versus Kamal NathRajasthan’s CM Ashok Gehlot is a political veteran, who is serving as CM for the third time. In contrast, Kamal Nath — while being a senior leader — was a newcomer to state politics, having been almost entirely in national politics. MP, for him, for much of his political career, was largely limited to his Lok Sabha constituency of Chindwara. He was resourceful, but lacked the ground experience, control over all regions of the state, and skills of political management. Also read: Congress ejects Pilot from power; CM Gehlot still in Rajasthan cockpitGehlot — as reflected in his current legislative strength — appears to have a firmer grasp over the party organisation. He has grown up in Rajasthan politics, from ground-up. His network in each constituency is formidable. Gehlot’s caste identity — he is a Mali, belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category — is seen as relatively neutral in the otherwise bitter caste-driven politics of the state; the scattered nature of his community across the state also gives him an edge. Gehlot also has good links with both the old guard and the younger leadership of the Congress in Delhi, which explains the prompt and unequivocal support he has got in this current battle.2 The arithmetic questionThe MP assembly election results of 2018 was fragmented. In the house of 230 members, Congress won 114 seats and the BJP trailed behind, just narrowly, 109 seats. The Congress won the support of smaller parties and independents to form the government under Kamal Nath. Also read: How Ashok Gehlot retained support, made inroads into Sachin Pilot campBut the narrow difference in seats left the BJP smelling an opportunity. This presented itself when Scindia — unhappy at how the party leadership has failed in ensuring what he saw as a just distribution of power in the state, and Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh’s attitude towards his group — decided to walk out with 22 legislators loyal to him. This reduced the size of the assembly, ensured the Nath government slid into a minority, and enabled the BJP to stake claim to form the government and prove its majority.In Rajasthan, by contrast, while the Congress had just about reached the half-way mark — in the assembly of 200 members, it won 100 seats — it was able to secure the support of other parties and independents and bolster its strength. The BJP, by comparison, won 73 seats. This leaves the gap wider and makes it more challenging for the BJP to oust the Gehlot government. It also means that Pilot will need to muster up greater strength to be able to effect a change in government. Also read: As Congress picks old guard over new, future tense for both Gehlot, Pilot3 Differing ambitions of the young TurksWhile Scindia is invested in the politics of MP and has a mass base in the state, his immediate aspirations did not revolve around seeking leadership in the state. The BJP, which already had Chouhan as a prominent leader and former CM, too, found it politically easier to get him back in the saddle. Scindia’s loyalists were accommodated in the state cabinet, but Scindia himself was elected to the Rajya Sabha. There is speculation that a greater national role is planned for him.Also read: Numbers behind Rajasthan storyIn contrast, Pilot’s ambition appears state-centric at the moment. He was keen to become CM while he was leading the Congress in the elections; he fought hard to ensure that it was him, rather than Gehlot, who got the seat; his camp’s demand over the past week has revolved around ensuring that he becomes CM. This, then, complicates the situation on two counts. One, it is not clear that Pilot has the numbers. But two, it is also not clear if the BJP will be willing to accommodate this ambition — given that it has a set of its own leaders in the state. It is instructive that the party has not made a single leader who has shifted from another party a CM in any state where it is in power. The closest example is Manipur, where N Biren Singh, a former Congressman is CM — but he had joined the party before the elections.At the same time, there is a remarkable similarity in the two episodes — particularly with the regard to the inability of the Congress leadership in retaining its top talent. Whether Pilot goes the Scindia way, and whether Rajasthan goes the MP way, remains to be seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-raj-impasse-is-different-from-mp-saga/story-X4kZ0dxAGxOWutNyrcf9YL.html
15-07-2020||India||Rajasthan crisis exposes infighting, indecisiveness in Congress||New Delhi: The political crisis in Rajasthan, coming just three months after the fall of its government in Madhya Pradesh, has once again exposed the fault lines in the Congress as it confronts infighting in many states. Indecisiveness on the part of the Congress leadership cost the party dearly in Madhya Pradesh and triggered turbulence for its government in Rajasthan.The power struggle between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot has been going on for a long time. It escalated after the Congress came to power in the 2018 assembly elections when the party high command opted for Gehlot as the chief minister.The gamesmanship peaked with a notice to Pilot from the Special Operations Group of the Rajasthan police to record his statement in connection with its probe into an alleged attempt to topple the Gehlot government.Both Gehlot and Pilot repeatedly conveyed their grievances to senior leader Ahmed Patel, party general secretary in-charge of the organisation, KC Venugopal, and general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan Avinash Pande. But the differences persisted.The developments in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have cast a shadow also on the stability of the government in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh where chief minister Bhupesh Baghel is engaged in a bitter power tussle with his cabinet colleague TS Singh Deo.“The issue has also been brought to the notice of the Congress high command on many occasions but there seems to be no end to the turf war. Chhattisgarh in-charge PL Punia has failed to unite the warring leaders,” said a Congress functionary familiar with the development, requesting anonymity.In Punjab, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu is sulking and the Congress central leadership has failed to resolve differences between him and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.“Sidhu is incommunicado for the past several months. He is visibly hurt and there is no reconciliation attempt from the central leadership so far,” said a Punjab Congress leader on condition of anonymity.Sidhu is dealing directly with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and has had no interaction with party’s Punjab in-charge Asha Kumari.State chiefs of Telangana (Uttam Kumar Reddy) and Odisha (Niranjan Patnaik) resigned from their posts soon after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections but the party leadership is still struggling to find replacements for them.There is a broad consensus in the party that regional satraps need to be strengthened after the party’s unexpectedly good show in Haryana polls under former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda last year.But the status quoist approach of the leadership has also demoralised the party cadre eagerly waiting for the oganisational reshuffle that was due after the humiliating defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Many All India Congress Committee (AICC) office bearers are continuing in their posts despite having submitted their resignations over a year ago, owning responsibility for the party’s poor show in the national elections.General secretaries like Harish Rawat (Assam), Oommen Chandy (Andhra Pradesh), who is said to be spend much of his time in his home state Kerala, Luizinho Falerio (North East) are on the edge.The party’s general secretary in-charge of Haryana, Ghulam Nabi Azad, is also not keen on looking after the affairs of the state.Some in-charges of states like A Chella Kumar (Goa), Anugrah Narayan Singh (Uttarakhand), Ram Chandra Khuntia (Telangana) and Rajni Patil (Himachal Pradesh) are likely to be divested of their responsibilities.Also, party general secretary in-charge of Jammu and Kashmir Ambika Soni had in 2017 requested the Congress high command to relieve her of the charge of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand because of health reasons.Sonia Gandhi will complete her one-year term as interim Congress president on August 10 and is likely to be given an extension with Rahul Gandhi unwilling to once again assume the reins of the party in the immediate future.Hyderabad-based political analyst and Congress watcher C Narasimha Rao said groupism had always plagued the party. “That is weakening the Congress. The central leadership has to take bold decisions and nip the factionalism in the bud. For that, there has to be a strong central leadership which is not the case right now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-crisis-exposes-infighting-indecisiveness-in-congress/story-WijxjWv2aZPS78amq3emMJ.html
15-07-2020||India||How Ashok Gehlot retained support, made inroads into Sachin Pilot camp||Pradyumn Singh, a former three-term legislator, an old-time associate of Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot may have been the key in the latter’s success in wooing back four rebel Congress MLAs from the Sachin Pilot camp.  Singh’s son Rohit Bohra was one of them. He arrived in Delhi on Friday with three other Congress legislators Danish Abrar, Prashant Bairwa, and Chetan Dudi. All were considered Pilot loyalists. On Saturday evening Gehlot managed to get through to Bohra on phone. And then, through Bohra, he was able to speak to the other three. Also read: Congress ejects Pilot from power; CM Gehlot still in Rajasthan cockpitA Rajasthan Congress functionary said on condition of anonymity that Gehlot was able to convince the four that they would have no future with Pilot, who was then rumoured to be joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Gehlot promised to address all their grievances and dangled the carrot of important responsibilities.Soon after the call, the functionary said, the four left Delhi and reached Jaipur at 4 am on Sunday, where they had separate meetings with Gehlot. “One of the MLAs [members of legislative assembly] sought forgiveness,” said a second Congress functionary, who was present at Gehlot’s residence when the four returned.“With their return, Gehlot was able to break Pilot’s camp and convince party leaders in Delhi that more rebel legislators would return to the fold,” the first functionary said. The four held a press conference on Sunday and said they were with Gehlot. “We are Congress soldiers for generations and are with the party,” said Abrar. The others echoed the sentiment.Their return also seemed to enthuse others in the Gehlot camp. Also read: As Congress picks old guard over new, future tense for both Gehlot, PilotAccording to the first functionary, Gehlot called almost all the legislators himself and assured them that he would take care of them. Once he was convinced he had the numbers, he called a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) on Monday. Legislators belonging to the Congress’ allies in the state were also invited to the meeting. “The CLP is a forum where party MLAs can raise their issues in front of Central observers, who then submit a report to the party high command,” said a third party functionary who asked not to be named. “The central observers have given specific instances of how Pilot and his supporters were trying to undermine the chief minister’s authority and were hobnobbing with the opposition,” a fourth functionary said on condition of anonymity. The CLP passed a resolution on Monday, seeking “strict action” against any member of the legislative party indulging in anti-party activities even as central leaders appealed to Pilot and rebel legislators to return.Hours before the CLP met again on Tuesday morning, party leaders again reached out to Pilot to resolve the crisis. According to a fifth Congress functionary who did not wish to be identified, Pilot was told that if he does not want to attend the CLP meeting, he should address the media in Delhi and clarify that he is a “loyal soldier” of the party.

But they, too, failed to persuade him, said another leader involved in the crisis management.“His refusal was like the final nail in the coffin.

15-07-2020||India||Congress ejects Pilot from power; CM Gehlot still in Rajasthan cockpit||Responding to Sachin Pilot’s rebellion against the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan, the Congress on Tuesday dismissed Pilot as deputy chief minister, sacked him as the state unit president of the party, removed two of his loyalists from the cabinet, accused his camp of “conspiring” with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to destabilise the government, and contended that its government has numbers. Soon after the decision, Pilot — who has maintained a studied silence on the issue — tweeted in Hindi: “Truth can be harassed, but not defeated.” Later in the evening, he thanked people who expressed their support to him.While Pilot — who has also served as a Congress member of Parliament and a Union minister, and was widely perceived as a rising star of the party with a national future — has not commented about his future plans, observers saw Tuesday’s developments as marking the end of his association with the Congress.Officially, he has neither been expelled nor has he formally quit the primary membership of the party. Coming in the wake of developments in Madhya Pradesh earlier this year, where Jyotiraditya Scindia left the party, senior Congress figures expressed regret at the possible exit of another young leader. Pilot, 42, is likely to set up his own regional party, according to a person familiar with his thinking.As the intra-Congress battle took a decisive turn, the BJP — which had, so far, claimed to be just “watching the developments” and blamed it on the Gandhi family — indicated that its doors were open for Pilot, and claimed that Gehlot’s government had lost its majority.Also read: As Congress picks old guard over new, future tense for both Gehlot, PilotThe Congress’s decision to sack Pilot came in the backdrop of its assessment that the arithmetic in the Rajasthan assembly favours Gehlot — though party leaders acknowledge privately that there will now be questions over the “stability” of the government and the situation will remain fragile.On Tuesday, 101 legislators — in an assembly of 200 — attended the Congress legislative party meeting at the Fairmont hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur, which included 10 independent legislators and two from Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) and one from the Communist Party of India (Marxist); the other CPIM legislator was unwell. However, in the afternoon, the two BTP legislators left the hotel, and went home, saying they would take a call on supporting a political party at an “appropriate” time. Pilot’s camp claimed to have the support of 22 legislators, including three independents, also said that six other legislators would join it soon, and rejected Gehlot’s claims of being in a majority. Two of the legislators in the Pilot camp, Ramesh Meena and Vishwendra Singh, who were both sacked as ministers, issued a statement saying that they were with Pilot and Gehlot government was in minority. Also read| ‘Was a 20-20. Test match next’: Team Sachin Pilot tweets to Ashok GehlotThe dramatic decision came on a day when the Congress held a second legislative party meeting in as many days — which Pilot and legislators loyal to him, once again, did not attend.A Congress leader familiar with the developments said that senior party leaders reached out to Pilot again, and conveyed to him that if he did not want to attend the meeting, he should address the media in Delhi, clarify that he was a “loyal soldier” of the Congress, that he would not do anything that would bring down the government in Rajasthan. “But Pilot turned this offer and insisted on his demand for immediate removal of Gehlot as the chief minister,” the leader said.Despite repeated attempts, Pilot did not respond to questions about the Congress’s accusations and the chain of events put forth by it. Also read: Sachin Pilot welcome to join, say BJP leaders as party weighs its optionsA leader close to Pilot, however, dismissed the claim that the party was responsive, and said that the former deputy CM had consistently expressed his concerns to the party’s top leadership in the past year and a half. Pilot’s camp has been resentful of what they see as Gehlot’s dominance and attempt to marginalise the former deputy CM, including by implicating him in a case regarding the destabilisation of the government. Randeep Singh Surjewala, the party’s chief spokesperson and one of the party’s central observers sent to the state, formally made the announcement. He said Pilot had enjoyed the “blessings” of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and was given political power at a young age, and alleged that despite this, he and other ministers were trying to topple the state government as part of a “BJP conspiracy”. “This cannot be acceptable to any political party. Therefore, the Congress took the decision with a heavy heart,” he said. He declared that state’s education minister, Govind Singh Dotasara, would be the new Rajasthan Congress president. Soon after, CM Gehlot met state governor Kalraj Mishra and apprised him of the dismissal of the three ministers. Gehlot categorically blamed the BJP. “The party high command was compelled to take the decision [to sack Sachin Pilot] because for a long time, the BJP was conspiring and resorting to horse-trading.” He claimed that it was not Pilot, but the BJP, which was “managing everything”. Pilot is scheduled to address reporters on Wednesday at 10am.The BJP categorically rejected the accusation of conspiring to destabilise the government, with senior leader and MP, Om Mathur, saying, “Dear Ashok Gehlot, closing your eyes does not make the sun disappear. There is weakness in the structure of your house, and you are blaming the BJP national leadership for this.”However, Mathur, who is also from Rajasthan, opened the party’s doors for Pilot. “Our doors are open for Sachin Pilot. Anyone who wishes to join the party and adapt to the ideals of the party, they are welcome,” he said.The party’s central leaders were circumspect.According to a person familiar with the party’s thinking in Delhi, BJP general secretary Anil Jain and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan have been at the helm of tracking developments in the state. A second leader said that it would only be natural if the party was in touch with Pilot, for he would not have gone so far in his battle with the Congress without signals. A third party leader, when asked about the speculation that the BJP could support Pilot if he floats his own party, said the BJP will watch from the sidelines till the time it becomes clear that the Gehlot faction does not have the required numbers to stay in power.But even as the permutations and combinations of the political alignment in Rajasthan were being worked out, observers said that the big takeaway from Tuesday’s development was the exit of yet another young leader from the Congress, which is in the middle of a deep political crisis after losing two Lok Sabha elections. Mumbai-based political analyst Abhay Deshpande said young leaders are restive and there is a trust deficit between them and the leadership. “One the aspirational leadership doesn’t see its future in the party and also don’t see the future of the party. They have lost hope and lack confidence in the leadership which has become unpredictable in the recent past,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-ejects-pilot-from-power-cm-gehlot-still-in-raj-cockpit/story-BtEVIqfSRuNkwSjWbCKF4K.html
15-07-2020||India||Govt recommends cap on screen time for online classes||Schoolchildren in Classes 1-8 should spend no more than two teaching sessions of 30-45 minutes each in a day and those in higher classes must have only four such sessions, the Union human resource department (HRD) ministry said on Tuesday in guidelines meant to limit the time students spend in front of screens at a time when the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has shut schools around the world.The guidelines — which are not binding but are likely to be adopted by schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Kendriya Vidyalayas — are meant “to mitigate the impact of the pandemic” on the roughly 240 million children as schools stay shut to reduce the risk of infection. The document notes that schools will need to “remodel” and “re-imagine” teaching and learning methods by introducing suitable home and institutional schooling methods. According to the guidelines, made in consultation with CBSE and the National Council for Education, Research and Training (NCERT), pre-primary children should not be made to sit in front of screens for over 30 minutes while children of Classes I to 8 should not be asked to attend more than two sessions of 30-45 minutes on days they hold online classes. For students in Classes 9-12, they can be part of up to four sessions a day of 30-45 minutes each. “Do not rush for the sake of completing the syllabus, rather focus on the consolidation of learning. Plan the interventions keeping in mind students’ level, age, resource availability, nature of content, etc,” the guidelines suggest.Rather than relying too much on teaching in front of screens, schools have been asked to focus on the alternative academic calendar, which the NCERT is preparing for the year.Children exposed to digital technologies or gadgets for a longer time are prone to severe health issues, officials and past research has said, prompting authorities to look for ways in which exposure to digital gadgets can be avoided by designing age-appropriate schedules.HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said the guidelines, titled PRAGYATA, have been developed from the perspective of learners, with a focus on online, blended or digital education for students who are presently at home.A CBSE official, who asked not to be named, said the board “takes all directions from the HRD ministry seriously and implements them with sincerity even if they are of an advisory nature”.Some of the other aspects of the guidelines describe the need for assessment, planning and steps to implement digital education while ensuring cyber safety and privacy measures. It also outlines the support to be provided to students with special needs. For parents, the guidelines focus on understanding the need for physical, mental health and wellbeing along with the cyber safety measures for children at home. While parents welcomed the HRD ministry’s new guidelines on capping the screen timing, school principals and students expressed mixed reactions. CR Park resident Rupa, who goes only by her first name and has a son in nursery, said: “I don’t mind classes every day but I definitely wanted reduced timings. While the online sessions are a good guide for parents, we want our son to continue doing activities under teacher’s guidance as younger children are more likely to listen to their teachers, especially if they are studying at home.”Kavita Arora, whose daughter is a Class 6 student at a south Delhi private school, said: “The reduced timings won’t affect their education much because they have been submitting multiple assignments anyway. The guidelines are welcome because my daughter was complaining of headaches and irritation in her eyes. We had to visit an eye specialist and there were several children there indicating that increased screen time was leading to a lot of problems. We hope the school implements this quickly.” Several school principals said that the capping of screen timing was essential. “It is important to have some capping on the screen timing. The screen time should be a time which is productive. Listening to classes hours after hours is not productive. We have been following quite a similar time frame for online classes even now. This capping of screen timing will also allow teachers and students to balance the online and offline activities taking place simultaneously,” said Amita Wattal, principal of Springdales School in Pusa Road.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said that the new screen timing is fine for junior classes but it can be a challenge for senior classes. “For primary and upper primary classes there could be recorded videos which the students can access any time. There are certain topics which can be converted into activities and we can just brief students about it and they can do it at home. This way, children will also get an opportunity to do some research. However, for senior classes from 9 to 12, schools will need some more time. We have lots of syllabus to finish and there is also a requirement of extra explanations from teachers’ side,” she said.Darshan Ram, a Class 12 student at Bluebells School International in Kailash Colony, also said that 30 to 45 minutes for a session will be too less for students of senior classes. “Currently, we are having one hour-long three sessions a day. So if we cut down the duration to 45 minutes we will not get time for any kind of discussion,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-recommends-cap-on-screen-time-for-online-classes/story-g3xaGUTrGVK8ASyGxADBIJ.html
15-07-2020||India||‘Was a 20-20. Test match next’: Team Sachin Pilot tweets to Ashok Gehlot||Hours after Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot appeared to have survived the immediate challenge to his government on Tuesday, Congress rebel Sachin Pilot’s team made it clear that this was just the beginning. “Today, this was a 20-20 match. The test match begins tomorrow,” Vishvendra Singh, one of the two ministers to be dropped from the Gehlot government earlier in the day along with Sachin Pilot, tweeted.“Now you see what happens next,” he said, a warning that appeared to be directed at Ashok Gehlot.Earlier today, in the biggest development of the day, Gehlot had leaned on party to get Pilot fired from all position of prominence in the government and the party right after a show of strength in a legislative party meet called at a city hotel, making people question if Sachin Pilot had been outwitted by the old political warhorse in a tussle for power in Rajasthan. While Gehlot had successfully paraded 102 MLAs this morning to signal that he had the numerical superiority to survive a floor test in the 200-member strong state assembly, Sachin Pilot’s decision to stand his ground suggested he was confident of his numbers as well.Also read: Congress hits reset after Sachin Pilot’s exit, dissolves party teamsHe had claimed to have the support of 30 MLAs including some from other parties. Congress has a total of 107 MLAs in the assembly, followed by BJP’s 72 MLAs. 88 Congress MLAs, 10 independents, two legislatures from the Bharatiya Tribal Party and one CPM MLA was present today at the Fairmont hotel in Jaipur.According to the party, the chief minister, however, claimed to have the support of 104 MLAs when he met the governor later in the day. He could be counting on Assembly Speaker C P Joshi, indisposed minister Bhanwarlal Meghwal and another CPI(M) legislator.Whether Pilot has the support of 30 MLAs or if that number could eventually turn out to be a few more or a little less on the floor of the house, could be crucial. And since possible disqualification of MLAs could also impact the equations, it cannot be said which side will have the advantage when it counts.Also read: Sachin Pilot welcome to join, say BJP leaders as party weighs its optionsWhich is why, Sachin Pilot’s aide’s challenge for a test match cannot be taken lightly, even more so since the BJP has not opened up its cards yet. Sachin Pilot himself has not been very vocal. After he was sacked, he only sent out two terse tweets. “Truth can be frustrated but not defeated,” he said in his first and used his second to express gratitude for “all those who came out in my (his) support today.” It will be interesting to see how the politics in Rajasthan unfolds tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-a-20-20-test-match-next-team-sachin-pilot-tweets-to-ashok-gehlot/story-1jeDm5QSFwNDrhEjiZdLPN.html
15-07-2020||India||House official tests Covid-19 positive, MPs isolate||After a senior parliament official, who had attended a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee last week, tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday morning, several MPs have gone into self-isolation. Two MPs and a senior Lok Sabha official confirmed the developments. Covid-19 cases had been reported among parliament staff earlier, but this is the first time it involved the main parliament building and affected MPs. It underlines the vulnerability of holding meetings amid the Covid-19 pandemic and some lawmakers feel that the demand for online meetings will now get louder. A total of 18 MPs attended the meeting.With many MPs swiftly moving into to self-isolation, some of the upcoming meetings of the parliamentary panels have been affected. Biju Janata Dal’s (BJD) Bhartruhari Mahtab, the chairman of the labour panel and a member of the PAC, said, “I am in self-isolation and so the meeting of the labour committee has been deferred to July 20.”Another MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar announced on twitter that he is going into quarantine. Although strict health norms—members wore masks and maintained distance— were observed at the meeting of the Parliament’s audit watchdog on July 10, the emergence of an active case of an official who sat throughout the meeting and assisted MPs took many by surprise. BJP MPs had thwarted PAC chief Adhir Chowdhury’s attempt to discuss PM Cares fund in that meeting.The first time such an incident inadvertently involving a parliamentary panel meeting and MPs comes amid the demand for digital meetings. Four panel heads —Shashi Tharoor, Anand Sharma, Jairam Ramesh and Adhir Chowdhury (all four Congress leaders) — had sought permission to go online but no digital plan for panels has been finalised yet.An opposition leader said, “After this incident, the demand for holding online meetings will grow even louder. We have a stronger case to underline the risk of meeting offline when Covid cases are exponentially growing in India.”The labour panel was scheduled to discuss the crucial subject of changes in labour laws by some states and issues relating to migrant labour force. Five meetings of different panels are also slated in this week.Officials also said that a few weeks ago, two junior staff members were detected with Covid-19 in one of high offices of the Lok Sabha, prompting a few top officials to go into self-quarantine.Previously, a few senior officers and a senior housekeeper had also tested positive. The Lok Sabha officials have started attending office in select numbers since May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-official-tests-positive-mps-isolate/story-iyuS0dqqK2E4HWVOkmaT5M.html
15-07-2020||India||Independence Day celebrations to be muted amid Covid-19 pandemic||Independence Day celebrations are expected to be muted this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic and fewer VIPs are likely to attend the annual August 15 event at Delhi’s Red Fort while schoolchildren will skip it altogether, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Corona winners, or people who have recovered from the disease, will be the highlight at the celebrations. Around 1,500 such people are expected to attend the function and listen to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech from the ramparts of Red Fort, said one of the persons cited above. The corona winners will include around 500 local policemen. The remaining will travel to Delhi from other parts of the country. The defence ministry, which plays a key role in organising the event, has asked the Union home ministry to implement the plan for inviting corona winners for the function.Schoolchildren have traditionally been a part of the Independence Day celebrations. Thousands of them show up to hear the Prime Minister’s speech at the Red Fort. This time they will be missing at the event because of Covid-19, said a second official. Modi mingled with over 8,000 children, who attended the Independence Day function at Red Fort last year, after his speech. The children enthusiastically crowded around him hoping to shake hands with him or speak to him.Defence secretary Ajay Kumar, who visited the Red Fort last week to inspect the preparations for the function, gave clear directions that social distancing norms have to be strictly adhered to, said a third official. While schoolchildren will not attend the celebrations, cadets from the National Cadet Corps are expected to be a part of the function.Fewer dignitaries will attend the event because of the social distancing norms, said the third official. Only 150 to 200 of them will be seated in the VIP enclosure compared to almost 1,000 in previous years. Last year, 10,000 people attended the Independence Day function.In his sixth Independence Day speech from Red Fort last year, Modi highlighted the nullification of the Constitution’s Articles 370 and 35A to divest Jammu & Kashmir of its special status in August last year. He also spoke about the legislation that criminalised the practice of instant divorce among a section of Muslims, strengthening of anti-terror laws. Modi said the country was moving towards “one nation, one Constitution” while highlighting key accomplishments of his government in less than 70 days after it was voted back to power in May last year.Modi also announced the creation of Chief of Defence Staff’s post for more effective coordination between the three services. This came after the proposal for the post remained in limbo for decades.He also outlined India’s journey from 2014 to 2019 as one from disappointment to hope and urged citizen participation in environmental initiatives, water conservation, end of single-use plastic. He flagged the population explosion as a key concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-day-celebrations-to-be-muted/story-9JxO9SMgeNFn6IHtGttSTM.html
15-07-2020||India||India, EU ink nuclear cooperation pact||New DelhiIndia and the European Union (EU) on Tuesday signed a civil nuclear cooperation agreement on the eve of a virtual summit, while Europol and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are negotiating a working arrangement to combat organised crime and terrorism.The agreement between the European Atomic Energy Community or Euratom and Indian authorities will focus on cooperation between EU’s research programmes on new ways of using nuclear energy and similar activities on the Indian side, EU officials said during a briefing for journalists.“The agreement is on research and development cooperation for peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which was negotiated for 13 years and finally can be cemented by the summit,” said one of the EU officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The India-EU Summit, to be co-chaired on Wednesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is expected to focus on strengthening multilateralism and global institutions in the face of the rise of an increasingly assertive China.The leadership of both sides are expected to reiterate their strong commitment to combat terrorism in all forms during the summit, the EU officials said. The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation or Europol and CBI are negotiating a working arrangement that will support law enforcement authorities of EU member states and India to prevent and combat organised crime and terror, they said.Asked specifically about the India-China border standoff, the EU officials described the recent incidents on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as a matter of considerable concern.“We are pleased to see that since these very deadly clashes took place on the LAC, both sides have committed to show restraint, to engage in military de-escalation and to engage in dialogue,” one of the officials said.Reports showed there has been a withdrawal of troops by both sides in key areas, and diplomatic and military efforts are having a “de-escalatory effect and we trust that both sides will continue dialogue to find a peaceful solution to their differences”, the official added.However, the EU officials said two sides are “quite far apart” on the issue of a Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), negotiations for which were suspended in 2017. They were also critical of what they described as “protectionist” measures adopted by India and the termination of bilateral investment treaties with 25 EU member states.The trade relationship was far below the potential, with India accounting for less than 3% of EU’s total trade, they said. They added EU wants an ambitious and comprehensive trade agreement that brings in strong rules, removes barriers to trade in goods and services and investments and opens up human markets.“India maintains a quite protectionist stance when it comes to negotiations on tariffs and on opening up its services sector, it goes backward in many areas, [such as] reducing access to the Indian procurement market for European companies,” one of the EU officials said. “At the moment, we are quite far apart in agreeing on joint operations we want to see in such an exercise.”EU is looking forward to the launch of a high-level trade dialogue between the EU trade commissioner and India’s comer minister to address these issues, they said.Besides the trade dialogue and a cooperation roadmap for the period till 2025, other deliverables expected from the summit are a joint declaration on circular economy and resource efficiency, the renewal of a science and technology cooperation agreement, the launch of a new maritime security dialogue, and the development of security and defence consultations and military contacts, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-ink-nuclear-cooperation-pact/story-qQjMRGMKMEBaDw0syIwHeL.html
15-07-2020||India||Boost to rural economy: Record sowing points to good harvest||Plentiful rains and a rural stimulus have led to frenzied planting of kharif, or summer-sown crops, this year, as acreages of four key crops surpassed their five-year averages for this time of the year, a welcome record amid the county’s economic crisis. If this results in a bountiful harvest (as it is expected to), the result could be a boost for the rural economy -- and more demand for everything from consumer products to mobile phones to motorcycles. Buoyed by robust showers from May onwards, farmers sprinted into action earlier than usual, planting crops in 58.6 million hectares until July 12, compared to 40.2 million hectare last year, a 45% jump, according to data from the farm ministry.In all, the respective areas under pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds, and cotton are currently the highest in five years pointing to a bumper harvest. The five-year average represents the normal sowing area.  A good monsoon is critical because 60% of the country’s farmlands don’t have access to irrigation and almost half of all Indians depend on a farm-based livelihood. And a good harvest keeps prices low and stokes demand for manufactured items, spurring factory output. Rural buyers, for instance, account for nearly half of all motorcycles sold annually, according to Citibank Research. The monsoon so far has been either “normal” or “excess” in 26 states, according to the India Meteorological Department. Countrywide, the rains have been surplus by 14%. Also read: After vigorous monsoon rains, crop planting gathers pace in IndiaOne hundred and twenty-one nationally monitored reservoirs -- critical for power, drinking and irrigation -- currently have twice as much water as last year (171 billion cubic meters on July 9), official data showed.Better farm output will cushion the impact of a widely expected recession this year, as the Covid-19 pandemic roils economic activity. The World Bank on June 8 forecast India’s economy will shrink 3.2% in 2020-21. The farm sector, by contrast, is poised to grow 3%, government think-tank Niti Aayog said in April.Farmers have sown paddy on 12 million hectares, up 25% from last year. The area under cotton stands at 10.4 million hectares, compared to last year’s 7.7 million. Oilseeds are at 13.9 million hectares, against 7.5 million last year. Pulses acreage is at a record 6.4 million hectares, sharply higher than 2.4 million hectares in 2019. One hectare equals 2.5 acre.“Farmers were able to sow crops faster this year due to good pre-monsoon showers ; the fact that the rural economy was kept outside the [Covid-19] lockdown helped. Farm incomes are critical for revival of consumption demand,” said KS Mani, an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. In June, 4.2 million farmers received about Rs73,500 crore in cash, from prices the government paid for crops. Fertilizer sales were 73% higher year-on-year in May.In April, nearly 80 million farmers also received a fresh instalment of Rs 2,000 each as cash transfer under the PM KISAN programme, totalling Rs 17000 crore. Data from two farm equipment manufacturers showed that in June, tractor sales by Mahindra & Mahindra and Escorts Ltd rose 13% and 24% from a year ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boost-to-rural-economy-record-sowing-points-to-good-harvest/story-NP0ETMFwn4nWd3m4nob8EJ.html
15-07-2020||India||In marathon meet, India, China talk tricky issues||Complicated negotiations on kicking off the next stage of disengagement between the Indian and Chinese armies in eastern Ladakh saw senior military commanders from both sides hold an hours-long meeting at Chushul on Tuesday to discuss the road map for further reducing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.The talks that began at 11.30am were in progress when this report was filed.The focus of the latest round of military talks was to hammer out a consensus on easing tensions in the Finger Area near Pangong Tso and Depsang plains as well as pulling back weapons and equipment from friction points in other sectors, said one of the officials cited above.“Tricky issues are on the table. Addressing them will take time,” he said.This was the fourth meeting between the corps commander-ranked officers who made previous attempts to reduce tensions along the contested border on June 6, June 22 and June 30.The previous two meetings went on for up to 11 hours while the first one was the shortest at seven hours.Negotiations are expected to be harder going forward as the continued presence of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the Finger Area and the Depsang sector could be the sticking point of the talks, as reported by Hindustan Times on Tuesday.In Tuesday’s talks, the agenda included the step-wise withdrawal of weapons and equipment to mutually agreed distances from all friction areas along the LAC and thinning the military build-up in the region, a second official said.The military dialogue will be followed by another meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. The military commanders set the time-frame and method of disengagement, while the WMCC monitors the process.A limited military disengagement was initiated last month after the commanders reached an understanding on reducing tensions during their first meeting on June 6. But the Galwan Valley skirmish on June 15 dashed disengagement hopes, leaving 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead.The July 14 talks follow a series of steps taken by the two armies at friction points in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra to implement a complex disengagement plan worked out during the June 30 meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region.The current disengagement process began after the June 30 military dialogue and a subsequent conversation on July 5 between national security adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi.At the June 30 meeting, the Indian side reiterated its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from friction points along the LAC and sought the restoration of status quo ante (the situation as it existed in early April) in the Finger Area, Galwan Valley, Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang plains, apart from emphasising the need for thinning the military build-up in the region.The disengagement effort involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides.The military build-up in Indian and Chinese depth areas hasn’t thinned, with both sides keeping their guard up. The deployment of thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence weapons continues in the region.The PLA pulled back 2km from Patrolling Point 14 (Galwan Valley), PP-15 (Hot Springs) and PP-17 (Gogra) last week, with the Indian Army also withdrawing proportionately in these areas.The army observed some thinning of PLA troops, vehicles and removal of structures from a key spur in the Finger Area over the last week but the army doesn’t view it as disengagement, said a third official, asking not to be named.The Finger Area, which refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong lake, remains the biggest test and the hardest part of the disengagement process.The army is keeping a strict vigil along the contested border in the Depsang sector where the PLA’s forward presence is a matter of serious concern and where a 2013 Chinese intrusion blocked the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes, including the ones leading to PPs-10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-marathon-meet-india-china-talk-tricky-issues/story-51yN6OMumnwAxugPOecbqI.html
15-07-2020||India||Supreme Court directs telcos to maintain data seized in criminal cases||Cellular companies and internet service providers (ISPs) should maintain call data records (CDR) and other relevant data in a segregated and secure manner if a particular CDR or other record is seized during the investigation of a criminal case, the Supreme Court ordered on Tuesday in an order aimed at obviating difficulties arising due to non-availability of CDR and other data in criminal trials.Parties to the criminal case can then summon such record at the stage of presenting defence evidence, or in the event such data is required to cross-examine a particular witness, the top court said. “This direction shall be applied, in criminal trials, till appropriate directions are issued under relevant terms of the applicable licenses (under which mobile companies operate), or under Section 67C of the Information Technology Act (which mandate central government to issue such directions)”, the bench headed by justice Rohinton Nariman said.The court noted that the Department of Telecommunication’s license conditions generally oblige internet service providers and providers of mobile telephony to preserve and maintain electronic call records and records of logs of internet users for a limited duration of one year.But, if the police or other interested individuals fail to secure those records or secure the records but fail to secure the certificate (validating its authenticity) within the period of one year, the production of a post-dated certificate (i.e. one issued after commencement of the trial) would in all probability render the data unverifiable, the court said. Therefore, the court ruled that it was necessary to issue general directions to mobile companies till appropriate rules are framed by the centre. “General directions are issued to cellular companies and internet service providers to maintain CDRs and other relevant records for the concerned period in a segregated and secure manner if a particular CDR or other record is seized during investigation in the said period”, the judgment said. The court was hearing a case from Maharashtra relating to admissibility of electronic evidence which itself stemmed from an election petition challenging the election of Shiv Sena candidate Arjun Panditrao Khotkar tothe Maharashtra assembly from the Jalna constituency in 2014.The election petition was filed before the Bombay high court in 2014 by the defeated Congress candidate Kailash Kishanrao Gorantyal. The case set up by Gorantyal was that Khotkar had filed his nomination papers after the stipulated time of 3 pm on September 27, 2014.In order to buttress this argument, Gorantyal had sought to rely upon video-camera arrangements that were made both inside and outside the office of the returning officer (RO).The High Court, in March 2016, ordered the Election Commission and the concerned officers to produce the entire record of the election including the original video recordings. A specific order was made that this electronic record needs to be produced along with the ‘necessary certificates’.As per section 65B of Indian Evidence Act, such certificates from the concerned authorities are required, if secondary evidence like CDs, VCDs, chips etc are sought to be produced as evidence.But such certificates were not produced before the Bombay high court in this case. Despite that, the high court relied upon the statement made by the returning officer who admitted that the video cameras were regularly used in her office for recording incidents and daily VCDs were collected of the recording by her office.Based on the same, the video evidence was accepted and Khotkar’s election was declared invalid.The Supreme Court ruled that a certificate from the relevant authority is a condition precedent for admissibility of electronic evidence.“Oral evidence in the place of such certificate cannot possibly suffice as Section 65B(4) is a mandatory requirement of the law”, the court held.But in the current case, the court noted that Gorantyal had done everything in his power to obtain the requisite certificate from the appropriate authorities, that is Election Commission, including directions from the court to produce the requisite certificate, but no such certificate was forthcoming. Hence the high court judgment cannot be faulted, the Supreme Court ruled while also imposing a fine of Rs. 2 lakh on Khotkar.“It is clear that apart from the evidence in the form of electronic record, other evidence was also relied upon (by the high court)”, the Supreme Court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-directs-telcos-to-maintain-data-seized-in-criminal-cases/story-DwpVH4rzscsxgAfAhuNN6J.html
15-07-2020||India||J’khand plea: SC to examine decision to auction coal blocks to pvt firms||The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notice to the central government in a plea by Jharkhand government challenging the centre’s decision to auction coal blocks situated in the state to private firms for commercial mining on the grounds that it would have an adverse impact on the state’s forest cover as well indigenous population. .A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde sought the centre’s response in the plea which alleged that centre unilaterally decided to auctions coal resources within the territory of Jharkhand without consulting the state government.“We are inclined to issue notice and hear on the injunction (to stay the auction)”, CJI Bobde said.The decision was welcomed by Jharkand chief minister Hemant Soren in a tweet: “As reiterated before, Jharkand Government is committed to an inclusive welfare centric development model safeguarding the environment, forests, and forest-dwelling communities; minimising socio-environmental impact.” The Jharkand government also believes that the current adverse investment climate will mean the auctions are unlikely to generate as much revenue as they could have. On June 10, Soren wrote to Union coal minister Prahlad Joshi seeking a six to nine months moratorium on the auction. Rajeev Jain, additional director general and spokesperson of the coal ministry said, “Hon’ble Supreme Court has not stayed it. The policy decision was taken by the Cabinet. The government will take the legal recourse.”Senior counsel Fali S Nariman, who represented the Jharkhand government along with senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, pointed out that the auction will take place on August 18 and the matter should be heard before that.CJI Bobde said that the centre can extend the auction date and that Attorney General KK Venugopal, who was representing the centre, should look into it.The matter is likely to be heard next on August 17.Prime Minister Narendra Modi , on June 18, launched the virtual auction process of 41 coal blocks for commercial mining. These coal blocks are situated in the states of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra; nine of the forty-one coal blocks are in Jharkhand.HT has reported that several are located in biodiversity-rich forest areas in central India, including a few in one of the largest contiguous stretches of dense forest called Hasdeo Arand that spans 170,000 hectares.The decision was part of the series of announcements made by the Government of India, under the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan aimed at making India a self-reliant nation, and boosting an economy ravaged by the coronavirus disease and the lockdown imposed to slow its spread. The Jharkhand government moved the Supreme Court in June, first by filing a writ petition and then by way of a suit under Article 131 of the Constitution, challenging the centre’s decision. Article 131 empowers the Supreme Court to hear disputes between central government and states.“The state is the owner of the mines and minerals situated within the territory of the plaintiff (Jharkhand). “The defendant (Centre) has announced the auction unilaterally without consultation with the plaintiff (Jharkhand)”, the suit said.Though there were consultation regarding the same between the centre and states in Februay, Jharkhand has contended that fresh consultations should have been held in view of the changed situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to combat the same.“The meetings of February 2020 are meaningless as they do not take into account the materially changed circumstance arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Renewed consultation with the plaintiff state was indeed required due to COVID-19 pandemic which has brought the nation and the entire globe to a standstill, in a manner never seen before,” the plea stated.It also took objection to the fact that centre resorted to such a move during time of Covid-19 pandemic.“The impugned action impinges the rights of the indigenous people of the plaintiff state and will lead to large scale displacement and consequential rehabilitation and re-settlement issues,” the plea added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-khand-plea-sc-to-examine-decision-to-auction-coal-blocks-to-pvt-firms/story-VVNMLz4g6pyBRaj0vp5JPP.html

A senior official aware of the development said that seven firms have submitted their bids, which will be under consideration. “It will take two to three weeks to shortlist the bidder based on their technical qualifications,” the official added.Hindustan Times has verified the submission documents of the seven firms, which specify similar work completed in the past seven years, ongoing projects, as well as tentative plans to indicate manpower requirement, sourcing of materials, and establishment of facilities such as for fabrication, among other things.Mumbai-based construction and civil engineering company ITD Cementation India Limited, Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited, Larsen & Toubro Limited, NCC Limited (head quartered in Hyderabad), PSP Projects Ltd based in Ahmedabad, Tata Projects and Uttar Pradesh state government undertaking U.P. Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Limited filed their bids online seeking to construct the triangular shaped building with a built-up area of approximately 60,000 metre square on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate.The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had invited pre-qualification bids in a two-bid system to construct the new Parliament building adjacent to the current Parliament building. The bid document offered an estimated cost of Rs 889 crore, which it referred to as “a rough guide” to the project. It laid out strict eligibility criteria based on a firm’s past work — such as having built an assembly hall of minimum 1000 capacity and a building with a basement — as well as experience of ongoing projects, average monthly turnover, and net worth, among other factors.Construction on the new Parliament building, which will comprise halls with greater seating capacity for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, offices for members of Parliament, as well as a courtyard, dining facilities and a lounge for lawmakers, is likely to begin after the Parliament’s winter session.“The construction work will begin post the Parliament’s winter session. It is expected to be completed by end of the year 2022,” said Bimal Patel, managing director of HCP Design, Planning And Management Private Limited, the architecture firm which won the bid for the redesign of Central Vista last year.“The proposed work is of very prestigious nature and is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit of 21 months with the highest standards of quality and workmanship,” the bid document said.“The proposed new Parliament Building shall be of reinforced cement concrete framed structure building. The plinth of building shall match with plinth of existing building which is approximately 1.8 metre above the ground level,” the document stated.The bid document also specified that 50% of the workers will need to be skilled for work of stone masonry, carving, fresco, furniture, and adequate health and safety measures would need to be taken in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.Centre will provide land free of cost to the contractor for establishing a labour camp within Delhi NCR area. The contractor shall make his own arrangement of transportation of labour from labour camp to site for working in three shifts.CPWD had additionally modified the pre-qualification bid and stated that contractor in collaboration with CPWD shall arrange on-site skill training for at least 30% of unskilled workers through reputed institutions like CPWD National Training Academy, CIDC, ITI, National Institute of Construction Management (NICMAR). National Academy of Construction or any similar reputed and recognised institute managed or certified by state or Central Government.“The contractor may have to execute the work in three shifts with large man power of skilled, semi-skilled and un-skilled workers, experienced and professional supervisors of engineers,” it said.It will be the contractor’s scope to arrange the labourers, Patel told HT. “They will plan and arrange for the required labour.”CPWD, which is the project implementation arm of the ministry of housing and urban affairs, specified that existing Parliament building shall continue to function during the entire period of execution of this project.The new Parliament complex, which has an earlier deadline of 2022 under the Central Vista redevelopment plan, will be among the first plans to be finalised and tendered out. The redevelopment will also see North and South Block turning into a museum as well as new administrative offices with an underground metro on either side of the avenue.On January 21, Hindustan Times reported that the new Lok Sabha hall would be big enough to house up to 1,350 parliamentarians for joint sessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-project-7-firms-in-race-to-build-new-parliament/story-HebL5XHNK2p8oaQICq8XhK.html
15-07-2020||India||Monsoon to resume over northwest region from today: IMD||After a brief lull, monsoon rains will resume in northwest and central India from Wednesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). There is an 8% monsoon rain deficiency over northwest India during this season. The monsoon trough which had moved northwards to the Himalayan foothills around July 8 bringing intense rains to east and northeast India has moved back almost to its normal position and is passing along Amritsar in Punjab; Chandigarh; Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh; Dumka in Jharkhand and Canning in West Bengal.It’s likely to rain all along these regions because of high moisture incursion and easterly winds blowing from the direction of Bay of Bengal. Delhi however is likely to receive light, patchy rain during the period.The eastern end of the monsoon trough (line of low pressure) has shifted further southwards causing significant reduction in rainfall intensity over northeast India. Under influence of likely strengthening of lower level easterlies and hence the monsoon tough, widespread rain with some heavy to very heavy rain is likely over northwestern plains during July 15 to 18 with maximum intensity and distribution of rainfall on July 16 and 18, IMD’s Tuesday bulletin said.Widespread and very heavy rain is likely over Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal during next 2 days. Under the influence of strong lower level wind convergence along the West coast, heavy to very heavy rain will affect north Madhya Maharashtra, south Gujarat region and north Konkan from July 14 to 16 with extremely heavy rain over parts of north Madhya Maharashtra and north Konkan on July 15 and over south Gujarat region on July 16.“The monsoon trough has come down so there will be relief from extreme rains in northeast India. When the trough moves to the plains, there is easterly wind flow. This makes conditions favourable for rain in regions where the trough passes. There is a feeble western disturbance affecting the northwestern region and a cyclonic circulation over Uttar Pradesh. These will help bring rain to northwest India but it will not be very intense. There will be a lot of rain along the west coast also mainly due to wind convergence,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.“We are expecting rain intensity to be higher in Uttarakhand, east and west UP, east Rajasthan, Delhi NCR may get light rain and thunder,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.The country has received 12% excess rains till now since June 1 when monsoon arrived; 16% excess over east and northeast India; 8% deficient in northwest India; 17% excess over central India and 14% excess over peninsular India.Bihar and east UP have 57% and 54% excess rains respectively since June 1 because of extremely heavy rains and flooding in the foothills but Jammu and Kashmir is 60% deficient; Himachal Pradesh is 28% deficient; Uttarakhand in 7% deficient and west Uttar Pradesh is 27% deficient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-monsoon-to-resume-over-north-west-region-from-today/story-NFv2ahuczRXs7dTKgTeMtL.html
15-07-2020||India||New draft rules for transpersons act issued, 30 days for giving suggestions||Nearly a month after the ministry of social justice and empowerment sought suggestions to the draft rules of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2020, a new draft was issued Monday that offered 30 days to submit further suggestions or objections.The new draft has incorporated some of the changes submitted by members and activists of the transgender community in May, including the definition of discrimination based on the internationally recognized human rights proposition laid down by the Yogyakarta Principles, a provision on equal opportunities in employment, and formulation of state and Central schemes on social security, health and welfare for trans communities. The draft offers a list of suggested welfare schemes that the government could consider in access to health, education, housing, welfare measures, and economic support. Some of the suggested measures included providing zero-interest and other micro-finance schemes, inclusion in employment guarantee schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, universal access to food security schemes, free gender affirmative surgery, old age homes and shelters for at risk transgender youth. “We need reservation, and without it any guarantee of protection is empty. But the draft rules don’t even mention a word of reservation,” said Tamil Nadu-based trans and Dalit rights activist, Grace Banu.The new draft removed the previous document’s provision to penalize “false declaration to obtain certificate of identity” and further defined discrimination as: “Any distinction, exclusion or restriction on the basis of gender identity and expression, which has the purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal basis with others, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field and includes all forms of discrimination, including denial of reasonable accommodation.”However, the draft retained the provision to differentiate between certifications of the transgender identity and the male or female identity. While the former would require the submission of a form, the latter would require proof of medical intervention to change gender. The 2014 Supreme Court verdict, National Legal Services Authority (Nalsa) vs Union of India, which granted legal recognition to the transgender identity stated that self-identification was central to gender identity, and that government cannot ask for any medical certification.“The new draft rules have made minor modifications in response to our considerable suggestions, but they retain the core of the Act which strips us of the right to self-determination and self recognition that Nalsa [judgment of Supreme Court] granted. The bill continues to rely on medical interventions to grant binary gender identities,” said Bittu Kondaiah, an associate professor at Ashoka University, New Delhi. Members of the community from around the country held consultations over video calling applications to build consensus on modifications and additions to the first set of draft rules which were released earlier this year, and were required to be submitted by May 18.The United Nations Development Programme as well as non-profit organisations like SAATHII, which works towards universal access to health care and social welfare held sessions with trans persons from around the country to formulate the feedback to the draft rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-draft-rules-for-transpersons-act-issued-30-days-for-giving-suggestions/story-TeSGKCILXM37Be5YhkY2iJ.html
15-07-2020||India||If FB is so dear to you, put in your papers, Delhi high court tells Lt Col||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked an army officer to either abide by his organisation’s mandate or resign while declining his plea seeking a stay on the army’s directive to soldiers to delete 89 apps from their smartphones. The court said the stay cannot be granted as the matter related to the country’s security and safety.The officer, Lieutenant Colonel PK Choudhary, moved the court after he was directed to remove the applications and also delete his Facebook and Instagram profiles.“You please delete... You can always create a new one. It cannot work like this. You are part of an organisation. You have to abide by its mandate,” a bench of justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Asha Menon said. “If you are so dear to FB [Facebook], then put in your papers. See you have to make a choice, what do you want to do. You have other choices which are also irreversible.”Choudhary, who is posted in Jammu & Kashmir, sought a direction to withdraw the Centre’s June 6 policy to “ensure that the fundamental rights of armed forces personnel are not abrogated amended or modified by arbitrary executive action”. It added the order is “not backed by the mandate of law, offends the provisions of the Army Act and Rules made thereunder and is unconstitutional”.In his plea, he called himself an active Facebook user, who used the platform to connect with his friends and family as most of them are settled abroad, including his daughter.Choudhary’s lawyer, Shivank Pratap Singh, contended the order will compromise the right to privacy and data. He said if the interim relief is not granted, his client’s valuable data will be lost due to the deletion of the accounts. He said it is an “irreversible” process and the account once deleted cannot be retrieved.Additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, who appeared for the Centre, opposed the plea and said the decision was taken as the government found Facebook had a bug. “It was infiltrating as cyber warfare and there were so many instances of personnel being targeted.”Sharma cited the petitioner argument that he needed Facebook to communicate with his family and added there are other modes of communication like WhatsApp, Twitter and Skype available to him.The court will hear the matter next on July 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-fb-is-so-dear-to-you-put-in-your-papers-hc-tells-lt-col/story-ZZslMzjrKWwuAPNrBvKBcP.html
15-07-2020||India||Supreme Court hints at judicial probe in Vikas Dubey case||The Supreme Court on Tuesday indicated that it may order a judicial probe into the killings of gangster Vikas Dubey and his associates as it issued a notice seeking Uttar Pradesh government’s response to a bunch of petitions demanding an independent investigation into them.The Uttar police claimed Dubey was killed on Friday when he tried to flee after a car bringing him from Madhya Pradesh, where he was arrested for his alleged involvement in the July 3 killing of eight policemen in Kanpur, overturned. Politicians, former police officers, and rights groups have demanded a probe into the killing, saying the police version of what happened did not add up. Five people linked to Dubey were killed between July 3 and July 9.“This is something which this court will do reluctantly. But since we have done it in the other case pertaining to Telangana, we will do something similar here,” said chief justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde as a three-judge bench he heads began hearing three petitions seeking a probe into Dubey’s killing. “Monitoring [of the probe] is something we cannot do as finally the appeal arising out of this case has to come to this court.” The court posted the matter for hearing next on Monday when the Uttar Pradesh government has to file its response.The Supreme Court in December constituted a three-member commission to investigate the killing of four men days after they were arrested for allegedly raping and murdering a 26-year-old veterinary doctor near Hyderabad. The former Supreme Court judge VS Sirpurkar-led panel was constituted after two lawyers moved the court seeking an independent probe into the Hyderabad killings. The Telangana police have insisted the four accused were killed in an exchange of fire on December 6 after they allegedly snatched their weapons when they were taken to the crime scene. The killings triggered a fierce debate and raised concerns about the violation of the due process.The three-member Supreme Court bench drew parallels between the two cases. It asked the petitioners to suggest the composition of the judicial inquiry committee to probe the murders of Dubey and his accomplices.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who represented the Uttar Pradesh government, said the state has addressed all concerns of the petitioners. “We have taken up the matter seriously. Let me first place before the court what has been done and then the court can take a decision.” The court allowed Mehta to file his response by Thursday.Ghanshyam Upadhyay, a lawyer and one of the petitioners, had filed a petition before Dubey was killed fearing he will be eliminated like his accomplices. Anoop Prakash Awasthi, another petitioner, has sought a probe into the alleged police-politician-gangster nexus behind Dubey and his gang members killings. He has alleged the state police consider themselves to be above the law and hence “their excesses” in this case should be subject to a court-monitored probe either by central agencies or a panel headed by a retired judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-hints-at-judicial-probe-in-dubey-case/story-15h1Zl8Xnp9ALRphpDzcpN.html
15-07-2020||India||No ‘actionable evidence’ against politicians in Delhi riots: Police||Delhi Police on Tuesday told the Delhi high court that no “actionable evidence” has been found against several political leaders -- including the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma, and the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Amanatullah Khan -- against whom public interest litigations were filed for allegedly making hate speeches and instigating people during the anti-CAA protests.In an affidavit filed before a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan, the police said that “the prima facie investigation has revealed that this is not the case of any sporadic or spontaneous violence but appears to be a part of a well-thought-out conspiracy to destabilise harmony in society”, and that the petitions should be dismissed. It stated that investigation in the case is still on, and if anything incriminating is found, FIRs will be registered.The reply comes in a bunch of pleas that sought registration of FIRs against several political leaders for allegedly making speeches during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act agitation that, the petition said, eventually led to communal riots in north-east Delhi in February.On February 26, the Human Rights Law Network filed a plea on behalf of activist Harsh Mander seeking FIRs against Bharatiya Janata Party leaders such as Kapil Mishra and Anurag Thakur to be booked for making that speeches that purportedly triggered communal violence in northeast Delhi. The following day, an organisation named Lawyers Voice filed an intervention in the plea, making similar allegations against Congress's Sonia and Rahul Gandhi as well as leaders of AAP.“It is submitted that during the investigations conducted so far in all the aforesaid matters related to north-east Delhi riots, no actionable evidence has yet surfaced indicating any role being played by the persons named in the writ petitions in instigating and/or participating in the riots,” the police affidavit said.It added that the “investigation conducted so far is pointing towards a wider and a larger conspiracy and concerted attempts of creating disruption of law and order situation in the city through violent means by disrupting communal harmony in the state and to perpetrate chaos in the society”.On Monday, the court gave two days to the Delhi Police to file their replies to the pleas seeking various directions to speed up action in the case of violence at Jamia Milia Islamia that had broken out during the anti-CAA protests after some of the petitioners said they had not received the copy of the reply. Reacting to the affidavit, BJP leader Kapil Mishra said: “Today it is clear that the entire propaganda campaign against me was fake. People who organised riots in Delhi are filling fake complaints against me and some ‘urban Naxals’ tried to promote that. The fake campaign against me stands exposed. I am sure not only rioters but also their support groups in media and politics will be punished by the law.”BJP leader Abhay Verma added that he was confident that nothing would be found against him. “I was sure that whenever the investigation would be conducted; no evidence would be found against me. I am a public representative and had gone to the riots hit area because the residents and shopkeepers of the area were angry after the murder of IB official Ankit Sharma. I had not made any instigating speeches and it can be seen on the video. Rather, I had tried to stop some people when they raised slogans,” Verma said. AAP leaders Manish Sisodia and Amanatullah Khan did not respond to requests for a comment.While representatives of the Congress did not immediately respond to the police affidavit, the party’s senior leadership has maintained that none of their speeches have incited communal violence. The police said in its affidavit that exercising the fundamental right of dissent should be respected, but no person can be allowed to commit a breach of law, indulge in violence, arson and riotous activity causing danger “under the garb of exercise of the fundamental right of free speech and assembly”.The matter will be now heard on July 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-actionable-evidence-against-politicians-in-delhi-riots-police/story-l5JDjra4BdUS1fmYLk32FP.html

Unable to bear the stench coming from the dead body, some of the patients moved out of the ward,” a relative of a Covid-19 patient said.It was only after the other inmates raised a hue and cry that the hospital authorities shifted the body to the mortuary.Gandhi Hospital is the designated government hospital for Covid-19 and has been declared as centre of excellence.Later in the night, superintendent of Gandhi Hospital Dr Raja Rao issued a statement acknowledging that there was delay in shifting the body from the ward and attributed the same to the strike by outsourced staff, sanitary workers and security personnel since the morning.Rao, however, said the delay was not up to seven or eight hours as claimed by the other patients. “The patient expired at around 1 pm. As per the protocol, we had to take the Electro Cardio Gram (ECG) to confirm the death and document the same. This exercise was delayed,” he said.The superintendent further said the clearance of the dead body was also delayed because only a few regular staff members were available because of the strike by other staff. “With the available workers, we were forced to manage 6 Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and all other wards. As we concentrated more on patient care and treatment, clearing the body got delayed,” he explained.Rao also denied the reports that the body was decaying. “The dead body does not putrefy and emanate stench in a few hours. But, in this big pandemic, where so many people are fearing even to enter Gandhi Hospital, every one of us is working hard. Anyway, we will see that it will not happen again,” he said.Meanwhile, the outsourcing, sanitation, security and patient care staff have called for indefinite strike demanding settlement of their pending demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-patients-in-hyderabad-hospital-protest-after-body-left-on-bed-for-hours/story-hDDLoSQdKxhlOdiVazprpN.html
15-07-2020||India||As Congress picks old guard over new, future tense for both Gehlot, Pilot||An anecdote from the 2014 Lok Sabha elections involving Punjab’s Captain Amarinder Singh held perhaps the template for striking an equitable balance between the competing ambitions of Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot. The story goes that Singh was talked into playing a more proactive role in the elections in a direct phone call from Sonia Gandhi. She struck a personal note with the reluctant Punjab leader, saying it’ll help if he does so, and the Captain agreed to contest.Cut to 2020.“The Congress president has to take a call,” Pilot told this writer shortly before he was removed as deputy chief minister and president of the party’s state unit. He said he conveyed to the central leadership his grievances against chief minister Gehlot, who “sidelined and humiliated” him and his supporters in the legislature party. With the party high command choosing to back the incumbent chief minister who, at 69, is elder by 27 years to Pilot, the Congress has lost another young and promising leader after Jyotiraditya Scindia. Gehlot might pass a trust vote in the assembly. But winning the perception war will be an exacting task for his fractured regime. Only a party united can deliver governance in a divided polity. Organisational power is centralised in the Congress even when it is out of power. That apart, Sonia Gandhi’s regard in the rank and file is intact despite the party’s falling graph. A personal appeal by her to Pilot or his mother, Rama Pilot, who has been a Congress legislator, could have set the stage for an honourable truce. For that to happen, Pilot should’ve have grabbed the olive leaf the party publicly extended through emissaries dispatched to Jaipur.That he received a lot in too short a time in the Congress was accepted by Pilot in an interview when Gehlot became CM against his claims after the 2018 polls: “Today’s the payback time ....Congress has given me a lot. At age 26, I became an MP, at 30 a minister and at 35 the party chief....”What changed then in the span of 19 months? It is understood that Rahul Gandhi, who then was the Congress president, invoked their friendship to make Pilot wait his turn for the CM’s office: “Do it for the sake of our friendship...”.But the euphoria of the assembly poll victory died fast. Five months down the line, the 2019 Lok Sabha elections saw the Congress losing all the 25 seats, including Jodhpur, where Gehlot’s son Vaibhav was the candidate. He was defeated by the sitting MP and the BJP’s emerging face, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, believed to be groomed by the PM as a latter-day Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.The late vice-president of India and three-time CM of Rajasthan was from the Shekhawati region from where Gajendra Singh’s family migrated to Jodhpur (Marwar). In that sense, he fits the “Shekhawat 2” tag perfectly.The parliamentary debacle provided the early sparks that today gutted the Congress’s facade of unity. Gehlot and Pilot blamed each other for the humiliating outcome. Their distrust of each other that got shrouded by government-formation in Rajasthan was as much the cause of the party’s below-par victory. The original Congress tally was 99 in the House of 200.Ironically, the party’s tenuous numbers tilted the scales in Gehlot’s favour. He seemed better qualified to helm the government in a touch-and-go legislative arithmetic. He consolidated his position by delivering fast on that front, winning over the Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs and marshalling the support of Independents -- among whom some were his men who were denied tickets in the tussle with Pilot. Gehlot was also helped by other factors: proximity to influential Congress apparatchiks; bigger support in the legislature party and a social identity that was a threat to none. Rightly or wrongly, in the tug-of-war for the CM’s office, Pilot was projected as a leader of his Gujjar community, and viewed with circumspection by other social groups.To be sure, Rajasthan hasn’t had any Gujjar CM since Independence. The office mostly went to Brahmins, Baniyas, Kayasthas and Rajputs barring the exception of Barkatullah Khan, a Muslim, and Jagannath Pahadia, a Dalit. The talk in the Congress circles at that time was that Pilot’s ascendance as CM could antagonise the Meena community that has been with the party since the days of the freedom struggle.The end of Rahul’s party presidency, which was a collateral casualty of the Congress’s poor show in the Lok Sabha elections, was another setback for Pilot. It was on his assurance that he agreed to Gehlot as an “interregnum” CM.At the Congress Working Committee meeting, where he announced his resignation, Rahul lashed out against three senior colleagues for focusing more on the prospects of their sons than the party. Gehlot was one among them.Even that wasn’t a cause for Gehlot to lose favour. He said he put up his son to create a semblance of a fight rather than giving the BJP a walkover in his home town. That brings one to the question whether the BJP can offer Pilot the CM’s slot he seeks. This writer’s reading is that Gajendra Singh will be its choice if Vasundhara cedes ground, or is bypassed in the eventuality of the party assembling the numbers required.But as the leader of a regional outfit with numbers touching 30 (after by-elections), the 75-member BJP combine could see value in Pilot’s bid. The identity question will remain a nagging worry which only the wholesome support of the Prime Minister can negate in the people’s arena.For the present, it is future uncertain for both Gehlot and Pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-congress-picks-old-guard-over-new-future-tense-for-both-gehlot-pilot/story-7GKDLnxFQndGI2FQLLf4iK.html
15-07-2020||India||Supreme Court holds first ‘virtual’ Constitution Bench hearing||The Supreme Court held its first Constitution bench sitting through videoconferencing on Tuesday. This is the first time since March 5 the five judges sat together in a single court hall ever since the lockdown forced the apex court to stop physical court hearings and begin hearing cases through videoconferencing from March 25 this year. A bench of justices Arun Mishra, Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose appeared wearing masks and maintaining nearly two-feet distance between them on the bench. The first case that was heard by the five-judge bench was a legal tussle on whether Centre or states have the power to provide reservation to in-service candidates in post-graduate medical degree courses. The plea was brought up by Tamil Nadu Medical Officers Association.Opening the argument, senior advocate Arvind Datar exchanged the extensive compilation of his arguments including cases to be referred through Google drive with all lawyers. One of the lawyers, senior advocate Vikas Singh appearing for Medical Council of India (MCI) complained about being unable to access Google Drive. He objected to Datar referring to the same, the first hiccup encountered by the Court in the virtual proceeding. The problem was sorted as court asked Datar to give case law citations.As the hearing proceeded, Datar was inaudible to the Court. Justice Shah commented in a lighter vein, “Don’t keep social distancing with your mike.” Datar heard ‘mike’ as “wife”, leaving the bench in splits.The bench reserved judgment in the case, allowing parties to submit their written submissions in the case by July 20. Other matters listed before the Constitution Bench could not be taken up due to lack of time.The day also witnessed veteran jurist and the senior among the bar Fali S Nariman make maiden appearance through videoconferencing before a three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde. Seeing him, CJI remarked, “So happy to see you Mr Nariman. For the first time you are appearing through videoconferencing.”The Supreme Court began hearing of urgent cases through video conferencing app called VIDYO in March after the imposition of lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. The volume of cases taken up on a daily basis has been less in the past three months. Beginning this week, the Supreme Court has listed regular matters and Constitution Bench matters for hearing as well. With the pandemic showing no signs of let up, there is uncertainty over when physical court hearings can resume. Till such time, virtual mode may be the only way left for courts to keep functioning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-holds-first-virtual-constitution-bench-hearing/story-6OIJDbbzpliujLFjz1z3mI.html
15-07-2020||Editorials||Make local lockdowns conditional||As Covid-19 cases continue to surge in new regions, India is witnessing another round of local lockdowns, where state governments have imposed restrictions in large parts of their state or key cities. The 68-day national lockdown offered several lessons to the country. One, restrictions can slow the spread of the infection but nothalt it. Two, the period needs to be used to improve health infrastructure, aggressively test and trace, and instil sustainable behavioural change. Three, any lockdown has tremendous economic costs.In principle, there is nothing wrong if states/cities want to impose lockdowns to control infections. Such autonomy is in keeping with India’s federal setup. But any lockdown-related decision must be taken based on a comprehensive assessment. For instance, Bihar, which is in the middle of one such lockdown, has the lowest testing rate in the country. Anecdotal reports, from across India, suggest that safety measures such as social distancing and using masks are not being followed by a lot of people. A proliferation of local lockdowns may inconvenience citizens and add to the already difficult economic situation.A vicious cycle of imposition and withdrawal of lockdowns cannot be allowed to become the norm. A national consensus needs to be evolved to make the imposition of lockdowns conditional — on what they are being utilised for, and the measures the state imposing a lockdown has already undertaken (including testing levels). Any such exercise must also have clearly defined goals, with resources marked to achieve those goals. The central government should take a lead in initiating this process and help devise a protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/make-local-lockdowns-conditional/story-fC392xkDc8PlsAFyuMO45M.html

The second is the reassurance given by both Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and home minister Amit Shah, to representatives of the newly-formed J&K Apni Party that there are no plans to change the demography of the Union Territory (UT). The home minister went a step further and said that J&K will have a better domicile policy than other regions. And the Centre assured political leaders that the gradual restoration of statehood remained on the agenda. Both steps, seen together, are an indication that the Centre has, somewhat belatedly, recognised the need for normal political and democratic activity to be restored in the UT. Mr Abdullah’s detention was legally tenuous and politically counterproductive and sparked international concern. It is also time to release the other two former chief ministers — Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti — and allow them to express their views freely, and conduct political activity. All these leaders have firmly stood by the Indian Union in difficult times, and despite their differences with the government’s current approach, their fundamental rights must be respected. The Apni Party will need to be the voice of Kashmiris, rather than of the Indian State, if it is to win credibility on the Srinagar street. It is noteworthy that the party has indeed conveyed apprehensions that exist on the ground that the nullification of Article 370 will lead to a change in the composition of the population. It is equally noteworthy, and laudable, that at the highest levels, the government has allayed these apprehensions. The Centre must now build on it, unveil a more intensive outreach, and come up with a concrete plan that leads up to the restoration of statehood. This is the only way to restore political normalcy in J&K, even as the security apparatus remains alert and battles violence and cross-border terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-centre-s-kashmir-moves-are-welcome-ht-editorial/story-UCB0HRTAkbJjYpwGKarTwJ.html
