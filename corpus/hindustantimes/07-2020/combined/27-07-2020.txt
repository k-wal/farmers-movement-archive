27-07-2020||News||India will resist China’s economic imperialism |Opinion||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, at a recent India-United States (US) business summit, invited global investors to invest in India. He told them that India offered a combination of “openness, opportunities and options”; pointed out that India had undertaken deep structural reforms, improved domestic manufacturing and was committed to diversified international trade; and spoke of merging domestic production and consumption with global supply chains. PM Modi has never shied away from taking tough decisions. The privatisation of the Indian Railways, public sector disinvestments, reducing corporate tax and opening up coal mining to the private sector are measures which may have been unpopular in certain quarters, but are necessary for the long-term health of our economy, particularly in strengthening our manufacturing base. To achieve the goal of a politically and economically strong India, the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan is a 360-degree initiative to make India an economic superpower. The focus is on five pillars of development: Economy, infrastructure, technology, demography and demand. Our targets are the factors of production. These are land, labour, legislation and liquidity, improving their efficiency and reducing the cost to make our industries globally competitive. This is not restricted to the manufacturing, but targeted at direct benefit transfers to the needy. This has also resulted in demand creation in the economy and helping the vulnerable, particularly farmers, migrant workers and daily wagers.The campaign for self-reliance has little to do with disengagement with China alone. We discerned the designs of Chinese economic imperialism early on. Our delinking from China began much early than many would like to believe. It began with PM opting out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The Chinese leadership tried hard to pressure India to join RCEP or face isolation in the grouping’s 16 countries. But the PM stood firm. In 2010, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government signed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with 10 Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) countries, the benefits of which were reaped by China as well. Reduced custom duties from these countries were creating an inverted duty structure in our domestic manufacturing sector, destroying local industries and converting manufacturers into traders. Therefore, in the Union Budget in 2019, the government increased import duties on over 56 items spread across eight classifications. Items such as toys saw an increase of 60% from 20% earlier. All these efforts were to protect domestic industries from the onslaught of dumping and competition. Without first strengthening domestic manufacturing by providing a level-playing field, and reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of factors of production, we cannot open the floodgates for imports. The Chinese leadership had almost managed to get the UPA government to accept RCEP. There are reports to suggest this. India’s signing of FTAs with Asean countries, without strengthening India’s domestic industries before opening them to regional and global competition, shows that the country’s interests were compromised. One important question must be asked. Why did India, which was a global leader in the pharma sector, gradually concede Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) production to China? The UPA must answer this. As of now, with the coronavirus pandemic, the world has realised the risks of over-dependence on supply chains from one nation. We rose to the occasion by identifying this as a risk diversion strategy for global manufacturing companies. It provided India an opportunity to deal domestically with the challenges thrown up by the coronavirus. Further, the Chinese aggression at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) at the Galwan Valley forced the government to immediately impose trade curbs and ban 59 apps from China. This is being hailed as a timely move, though certain economists and industrialists have sounded a note of caution on its long-term impact. But their logic seems based on the line propagated by the Chinese media and China’s government officials.Fortunately, what we import from China is mostly in areas in which India has the domestic technology to leverage for import substitution. Most of these items do not come under the essential consumption requirements category and are generally non-merit goods. Except in pharma, which China dominates through the supply chain of APIs, it has not been able to penetrate strategic sectors. India’s manufacturers need to seize this golden opportunity in sectors such as toys, electrical equipment, electronics, minerals, chemicals, iron and steel, plastics, furniture, sports goods, musical instruments, fertilisers and apps. Earlier, the ministry of commerce and industry had identified 12 such sectors; these now constitute 20 sectors. And 371 items have been identified for increasing import duties including non-tariff barriers on some of them. If you look into the comparative advantage theory domestically, we have to focus on areas such as agriculture, particularly food processing, textiles, affordable housing, health care and education, and increase their contribution to India’s Gross Domestic Product. These sectors can generate large-scale employment and are looking up. This will be our path to recovery.Gopal Krishna Agarwal is the Bharatiya Janata Party’s national spokesperson on economic affairsThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-will-resist-china-s-economic-imperialism/story-FILTh6ha7R7EyGu12QYuQI.html
27-07-2020||News||On the economy, don’t disengage with China | Opinion||The debate on the future role of China in the economy is now at the forefront of India’s strategic conversation. But the fundamental questions that must inform this assessment have receded into the background. Take the ban on Chinese products. The main impetus was to signal that there are costs for China’s coercion on the border. And if wielded judiciously, this will influence Beijing’s outlook. But, brandishing the economic card cannot be indiscriminate and policymakers must be conscious of the repercussions on domestic livelihoods, India’s modernisation efforts, and geopolitical goals. More broadly, New Delhi must ask questions around structural trends in the global economy, particularly with respect to the nature of competition between the United States (US) and China, and by implication, on the evolution of globalisation going forward. To what extent will there be US-China decoupling in the near and medium-term? Should we lean to one side in an age of geo-economic competition? Is there an opportunity for India to absorb the manufacturing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as well as assume a major role in global production networks? If we proceed from the premise that India needs more high-tech industrialisation, more quality manufacturing, more employment-generating supply side capacities, and, greater participation in international supply chains, then the disruptions in globalisation need to be leveraged realistically. Added to this is another strategic goal — India’s quest to re-establish its traditional commercial and social networks with Indo-Pacific and Eurasia. In this backdrop, how should we restructure China’s role in the Indian economy? For the past six years, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s approach has been to rebalance and broaden economic ties from a trade-dominated to an investment-oriented one. This was to manage the trade deficit and attract Chinese investment and technologies to India. Today, India’s dependence on China for its non-consumption economy remains high as inputs, components, industrial equipment and technology all feed India’s growth and exports to the rest of the world. Decoupling, therefore, should not be pursued until a deeper assessment is undertaken to determine the cost-benefit calculations and impact, across sectors, and for the economy as a whole. Only after this has yielded credible data should policymakers formulate a plan to develop more interdependence with China in select sectors or lessen it in others by import-substitution and sourcing from elsewhere. It must not be a blanket policy. We first need to articulate a sophisticated industrialisation blueprint and identify where Beijing brings value or can be a catalyst in the way the US was for China’s reform process. The US-China competition over high technology, particularly in digital sectors, is posing another policy challenge. Here, India’s policymakers need to avoid leaping from one digital superpower to another. After all, both Chinese and US companies bring the same baggage to the table — the risk of compromising data sovereignty, dependence on imported software and hardware, and impact on domestic capabilities. Before handing over the family silver, India needs to support a framework for domestic innovation that promotes a competitive digital ecosystem and one that moves India up the value chain. India’s future connection with the Indo-Pacific is another theme. The decision on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) suggests India is in no hurry to lock into a trading bloc while its domestic economy remains mired in structural problems. While India gets its domestic act together, the broader regional geo-economic landscape will not necessarily move in tandem with the US-China decoupling, whose contours are still in flux. A slowdown in the China-US economic ties will not undermine the China-Asia interdependence. China is already emerging as a key pillar of the Asian political economy. Last year, the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) overtook the US to emerge as China’s second-largest trading partner with $644 billion in two-way commerce. So far, in 2020, Asean has overtaken the European Union (EU) to become China’s largest trading partner. The investment flows that support such commerce are less visible but nevertheless real. The scenario of China’s economic links with its continental and maritime neighbours deepening is more probable if the US does not re-engage Asia with a more pragmatic economic blueprint. The “America First” impulse is, however, part of the domestic political discourse across both parties. It is unclear how the next president would reconcile the dualism of renewing the US and simultaneously engaging Asia by offering superior terms to states than what China could. In essence, this is what the next great game will be about. India can benefit from this competition if it plays its cards skillfully. Rather than being tethered to an unpredictable US political dynamic, India should start thinking of more proactive strategies where we keep a foot in the door in the various geo-economic networks and linkages that develop around our region. While the China relationship is likely to remain competitive and complex, if the grand strategic goal is to deepen ties with Asia, then India will have to acquire the ability to conceive geo-economic strategies in the neighbourhood and beyond while recognising that states will not deprive themselves of economic ties with mainland China. Many Asian states, including India’s neighbours, will adopt eclectic strategies of leveraging the US, Chinese, Japanese, and European technologies and capital. By attempting something different, we only risk reducing our competitive advantages and future position in Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/on-the-economy-don-t-disengage-with-china/story-Er5AOSLoDjS7bqTcB3ffEI.html
27-07-2020||News||As Covid-19 spreads, the silver lining | Opinion||Looking at the rising curve of new cases in India, it may seem premature to talk about what the new normal will look like. However, just as it was important early in the pandemic to look ahead to save lives, it is also important to look ahead now to preserve the social fabric and the economy. The pendulum of fear has swung from one extreme to another with much misinformation. So, it is time to review what we do know. The Sars-CoV-2 infection has taken a huge toll globally, with over 600,000 deaths so far. The actual number of infections is far greater than the known cases. This is important, because it has led to many misconceptions about the fatality of the disease. For example, in Delhi, antibody data, which tells us about the percentage of the population that has been infected and recovered, points to about two to three million infections. When compared to the 130,000-plus known cases and less than 4,000 deaths, the difference is staggering; fatality is less than 0.2% by antibody data and around 3% by known cases. It is clear that when diagnostic testing is done extensively, as is now happening in the United States (US), more than 99% of diagnosed infections recover uneventfully. The additional risk of dying of Covid-19 is unlikely to be more than a person’s current one-year risk of death. For example, for a young Indian male, the risk of dying of Covid-19 is not more than the risk of dying in a road accident this year. For a young Indian woman, it is comparable to the risk of dying during pregnancy. A 70-year-old elderly Indian male already has an annual risk of death of 5% or more, to which Covid-19 adds about 1% additional risk. However, none of this means that the problem is small. Restated in another way, the annual risk of death is being doubled during the pandemic — the additional risk compressed into a few months. Also, this risk is transmissible to those around us. The real problems begin when the disease starts to spread so rapidly that it overwhelms the health care system. Then, deaths start not only because of Covid-19 but also because of other causes that would normally be preventable. The focus of the new normal should be to get on with our lives, while observing reasonable precautions to prevent a catastrophic spread.At the first semblance of normal life, with schools, universities, and more restaurants and malls opening, there will be a further rise in Covid-19 cases and, consequently, deaths. This cannot be helped until we have new effective treatments or vaccines. The universal use of masks in public spaces will probably be the single-most important intervention to reduce the risks. We don’t require more debate on airborne transmission. It is quite straightforward. Large droplets from sneezes and coughs are more likely to transmit infections but settle down fast from the air. While speaking, we expel very small droplets that are less likely to infect, but remain in the air longer, creating tangible infection risks in closed, crowded and poorly-ventilated spaces. Wearing a mask reduces the droplets we send out and those that we breathe in. Comfortable surgical masks, or almost any mask, do a good job of the former, while N95 respirators are required to effectively do the latter. If everyone is wearing a mask, N95 is not required and people can stay comfortable and protected. This is the simplest strategy to reduce not only the number of infections, but probably also the severity of infection, since it seems that a higher amount of virus exposure may lead to higher chances of severe disease. The other necessary intervention is to restrict indoor crowding and increase fresh air ventilation. As the summer comes to an end in about a month, it will become possible to bring in fresh air without compromising the temperature control of air-conditioned buildings. However, optimal design of indoor spaces is still a problem that requires thought on the part of architects and engineers, especially for restaurants where masks are not possible. Rapid air exchange with filtration or decontamination is a viable option where fresh air cannot be brought in. The other critical need is to destigmatise Covid-19. None of us know where it is coming from, but there is no reason for panic beyond rational precautions. Most people can safely self-isolate and recover at home, preferably without any consternation on the part of neighbours. Reverse isolation, in which high-risk people are temporarily isolated, is another option. The large number of infections has a silver lining: When managed well, there will be a large fraction of recovered people with some immunity. Herd immunity is still some distance away as a nation, but local immunity may be sufficient to prevent large outbreaks in such areas. In data collected by others and us, about 20-30% of Delhi and Mumbai residents seem to be in the recovered category based on antibody presence, although these are not neutralising antibodies with definite anti-virus action. A very positive sign is that there have been no proven re-infections in over six months of global experience, despite poor antibody response and lack of neutralising antibodies in many people. Better immunity tests will allow immunity passports for those who can safely serve at the frontline of critical high-risk services. The size of our problem may yet become the size of our opportunity. It is time, despite the doom and gloom, to start thinking of the new normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/as-covid-19-spreads-the-silver-lining/story-iiFa7ZQbVycikW4BMmiSSN.html
27-07-2020||Mumbai||Centre gives nod to radio-collar five leopards in Mumbai||The Union environment ministry has approved a proposal to study the movement of leopards in and around Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Mumbai by radio-collaring (GPS collar) five leopards.Forest minister Sanjay Rathod on Monday announced the development and said, “The satellite telemetry study will help us understand leopard movement and behaviour, human-leopard correlation, how these animals use congested human-dominated landscape, and most importantly, how conflict can be reduced. It can develop a model for other parts of the state.” Till date, no leopard in and around SGNP has been radio-collared. This would be the first project planned at a forest close to a large metropolitan area.First discussed in 2016, the Maharashtra forest department had approved the proposal by Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), India for the two-year project in August 2019. A memorandum of understanding was signed soon after. “However, since leopards are schedule 1 species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, an approval was needed from the Centre to commence the project. We received the approval last week. WCS India has indicated that the project will commence in January 2021,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife).The cost of project is ₹62 lakh, of which the state will fund ₹40 lakh and the remaining will be borne by WCS-India. “The project implementation also depends upon the release of funds by the state,” said Kakodkar. GPS collars work by sending a signal to a satellite, which obtains the time and date of the signal sent from the collar. This information is then shared with researchers who can then investigate where the animal is and what it is doing.There are 47 free-roaming leopards in and around SGNP and Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary. In 2017, there were 41 leopards, 35 in 2015 with an average of eight to 10 leopards moving outside the periphery of SGNP. Aarey Colony in Goregaon has at least six leopards. “The study will shed light on how leopard population is changing in and around SGNP with new leopards documented during census study and some animals missing or not identified at all in previous ones,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife west).According to the proposal, the study would monitor the density of leopards in SGNP and Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, their movement outside protected areas such as Ghodbunder Road, Nagla Block, and Aarey Colony, and check for population parameters such as turn-over rates, survival, dispersal and movement within this landscape. “The study will also help understand the dispersal pattern of leopards through corridors extending from Mumbai region to Tansa and Malshej Ghat,” said Limaye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/centre-gives-nod-to-radio-collar-five-leopards-in-mumbai/story-T8ht2D8nQDZo6M2FMBqh2H.html
27-07-2020||Mumbai||Not interested in bringing MVA govt down: Fadnavis||In the first meeting of the newly appointed state executive of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis clarified that his party was not interested in bringing the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government (MVA) down, but in a jibe, also asked the ruling parties to run the state, instead of just crying foul. BJP president J P Nadda, who addressed the meet, asked party workers to be committed to get power in the state on its own strength in the future. He also asked them to actively expose the failures of the state government. “The BJP is not interested in bringing this government down. We are focussing on tackling Covid-19. The ruling government should stop crying and try to at least run the government,” said Fadnavis, in his concluding virtual address. He also taunted chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who in an interview to his party mouthpiece, Saamna, had said that his government may be a three-wheeler, but he held its steering wheel. “An autorickshaw is driven as per the wishes of the passengers and not the driver. That’s the only way the autorickshaw driver will earn his daily income. This government is going in three different directions, at the cost of Maharashtra,” said Fadnavis. Nadda underscored the Modi government’s efficiency in handling the pandemic, even as he slammed the state’s failure. The national BJP president said the timely decision to impose a lockdown in the country averted a major loss of life, unlike Europe and the US. “Party workers must effectively reach out to common man and communicate the work done by the Centre and aggressively expose the failures of the state government,” said Nadda. State party president Chandrakant Patil also addressed party workers and reiterated the need to come out effectively as a party against the MVA government’s failures, from handling the pandemic to farmers’ issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-interested-in-bringing-mva-govt-down-fadnavis/story-F9gHRJUh8puHhk2RKWHL5H.html

A police team was present at the spot at the time. The woman, Balbir Kaur, along with her family members, had allegedly encroached upon a part of the street, which led the neighbours to raise the matter with the panchayat.“Around 4pm, Balbir’s daughter-in-law Kuljit Kaur lodged a complaint with the 112 helpline stating that one Sumit Singh had attacked them,” said Goindwal Sahib station house officer (SHO) Harwinder Singh, adding that a team was immediately dispatched to the spot. “When the team reached there, they saw a crowd gathered there. After a few minutes, Balbir and her daughter-in-law came out of their house and the former poured petrol over herself and set it alight.” She was rushed to the hospital, where doctors said she suffered more than 50% burns. The woman, her daughter-in-law, son Manjit Singh and granddaughter Harman Kaur have been booked under Sections 309 (attempt to commit suicide) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/65-year-old-woman-sets-self-on-fire-after-altercation-with-neighbours-in-tarn-taran/story-9JhFhPdg2byb9cPAIVVDWK.html

The family, in the letter written on Monday, stated, “It is inhuman and unethical to withhold the information about Rao’s health to his anxious family. It is very clear that the jail authorities have regular updates about Mr Rao’s health.”The family claimed that since Rao has been taken to the hospital, they have been trying to call both the jail and hospital authorities regularly but have not received any update.When Rao’s daughter tried to contact the authority at Nanavati Hospital, she was told that they have informed the jail administration and that she should approach the jail authorities for the same. However, jail authorities later asked them to approach the hospital. Citing this, the family said, “It is a mystery why this information is not passed on to the family by the jail authorities.”The family further said that “Rao is an undertrial prisoner in your custody and the jail authorities have the responsibility to give us regular updates or instruct Nanavati Hospital to release regular health bulletins.”They have now requested the home minister to intervene and direct Taloja jail authorities or Nanavati Hospital to provide regular updates on Rao’s health status, the diagnosis of his health problems and line of treatment to the family.The family had, on Friday, approached the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) over the issue.In the letter to NHRC, Rao’s wife P Hemalatha and his daughters P Sahaja, P Anala, P Pavana asked NHRC to intervene and direct the state government and prison authorities to give periodic update on Rao’s health and share details of the treatment with the family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-rao-s-family-writes-to-home-minister-seeks-update-on-his-health/story-PulIR9NIBYQ9BOQR4ZYQhP.html
27-07-2020||City||Gurugram: Discom calls for action against 25 unauthorised colonies within a month||Gurugram: The Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (DHBVN) has asked the department of town and country planning (DTCP) to take action against 25 unauthorised colonies, or it would be compelled to suspend power connections in these areas. In its letter, the discom has mentioned the names of the localities and asked the DTCP to take suitable legal action within a month.The letter, by the sub divisional officer of Badshahpur, dated on July 9, states that unauthorised colonies have come up near Bhondsi, Sehjawas, Nayagaon, Rithauj and Badshahpur. The colonies mentioned in the letter are Shriram Enclave, Bhajan Park, Mohan Nagar, Shyam Kunj, Lakshmi Kunj, Shanti Kunj, Shani enclave, Krishna Kunj, Vatika Kunj, Sneh Vihar, Keshar Nagla, opposite BSF Colony, near Ryan School colony, Shiv Colony, Rama Enclave, Om Kunj, Govardhan Kunj, Bhoop Singh Nagar, Bhawani Enclave, Prem Kunj, Sohan Nagar, Dev Nagar I and II, Gajraj Colony, RBSM Colony and Vaishnav Colony.“A detailed affidavit as well as an indemnity bond shall be taken from all such consumers stating clearly that they shall be liable for any legal action regarding the nature of their premises by the urban local bodies department or DTCP or Panchayat department or any other legal authority as the case may be. Of course, release of the connection shall, in no way whatsoever, entitle such power consumers to strengthen their claim for regulation of their premises/ colony,” the letter stated. The letter assumes significance on account of the fact that the DTCP has been carrying out large-scale demolition drives across the city in the last eight-to-nine months to prevent mushrooming of unauthorised colonies. It is because of this reason that the state government has now banned the registration of property deeds across the state as has been observed that illegal registrations of small plots has allegedly been taking place, which led to development of unauthorised colonies. RS Bhath, district town planner, who is also the incharge of the enforcement department, said that action has already been taken in most of the colonies that have come up in these areas. “In the coming days, we are planning demolitions on a larger scale to curb unauthorised constructions and development of unauthorised colonies. This will send a clear message that unauthorised development will not be allowed in the city,” he said. A sustained campaign against unauthorised colonies is being carried out in the city as it causes losses to both, the state in terms of revenue as well as home buyers, who end up staying in areas with poor infrastructure, said Makrand Pandurang, director, town and country planning while speaking on the issue on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-discom-calls-for-action-against-25-unauthorised-colonies-within-a-month/story-7woNDSSQz94eRdwFlxJRnL.html
27-07-2020||Gurugram||Masked men snatch cash, motorcycle at gunpoint||Three unidentified suspects allegedly snatched a motorcycle and cash at gunpoint from a motorcyclist on Basai Road near Chandu village, a few metres from the Sector 102 area on Saturday night, said the police. The police said the victim did not lodge a complaint at the time of the incident as he was scared. An FIR was registered on Sunday after the victim and his friend called the police control room. According to the police, the incident took place around 10.30pm when the victim, Nitish Saini and his friend, Arun Rohilla, were on their way on a motorcycle to their residence in Garhi Harsaru in Sector 10, after visiting a friend’s warehouse in Dhankot. The police said three suspects, wearing masks, who were also riding a motorcycle, blocked their path near a farm on the road between Chandu and Dhankot. In the police complaint, Saini, said, “Two of the suspects snatched the keys of my motorcycle and my phone. A third suspect aimed a gun at me. They also took ₹2,000 in cash from me and asked us to return home on foot. They threatened to kill us if we reported the incident. I did not inform the police earlier as I was scared.” A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “The suspects are yet to be identified. The victims were unable to note down the registration number of the motorcycle used by the suspects.” A case has been registered against the unidentified suspects under sections 379 A (snatching) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Rajendra Park police station on Sunday, said the police on Monday. In another incident, two motorcycle-borne men allegedly snatched gold chain of a 67-year-old woman in Sector 38 on Sunday. The police said the woman had stepped out of her house to feed stray animals around 9am when the suspects drove past her on a motorcycle. The suspects then returned and the man riding pillion alighted from the motorcycle and snatched the gold chain before escaping with his aide. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “The suspects were wearing helmets and police is checking CCTVs in the area to trace them.” A case was registered under Section 379 A of IPC at Sadar police station on Sunday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/masked-men-snatch-cash-motorcycle-at-gunpoint/story-Hkn93JVtiAkLepw1iaopUL.html
27-07-2020||Chandigarh||Amalgamation of plots: Rules revised, marla property owners of Chandigarh to gain most||In a major relief to city residents looking for amalgamation of two or more more plots, the UT administration has notified the Chandigarh Building Rules (Amendment), 2020, which supersedes the amendment rules of 2018.In 2018, the administration had allowed amalgamation of two or more plots under same ownership. Later, the administration had stopped giving permission to applicants as a dispute had arisen over whether the covered area and floor area ratio (FAR) of the new amalgamated plot was to be allowed or for the original smaller sized plots amalgamated.Through the new notification, the amalgamation of plots are allowed with no change in original FAR. Moreover, there will be no change in building lines. “In 10 marla plots where amalgamation is allowed, 70% coverage area will be allowed in both plots and in case of 1 kanal plots, only 50% coverage will be allowed. With this clarification, marlas plots will get the benefit of excess coverage area which was earlier withheld by the urban planning department,” said Vikas Jain, a city-based advocate.RECONSTITUTION CHARGES REDUCEDThe administration, through the new notification, has also reduced the charges for reconstitution of the amalgamated plots. As per the 2018 notification it was 10%, now it has been reduced to 5%. “In case, the amalgamated plot is to be reinstated to its original category, then the charges at 5% of the prevailing rates of the size amalgamated plot will be applicable,” reads the 2020 notification.The development control regulations applicable, that is, category of plot, zoned area, coverage norms, etc., will be as per the size of the plots before the amalgamation. However, the existing covered area and FAR of the plots under amalgamation should be applicable as per the original category of the plot.The owner concerned will have to maintain front and rear building line as per the original category of plots for ensuring uniform street picture in view of the adjoining plots. For rear coverage in non-standard plots, for example corner plots, the applicant will have to seek zoning plans from the UT chief architect.In case of residential sites falling in the marla category, the building controls/frame control, wherever applicable, will continue to be applicable and no changes whatsoever will be permitted in the external facades, elevations, projects, and building set back lines.AMALGAMATED UNITS SHOULD APPEAR DISTINCTThe frame controls/outer facade controls must also be maintained in such a way that the amalgamated plots do not appear to be a single unit but as distinct units of the original.The UT estate office will sanction the amalgamation of sites only if no-dues are pending against the site. Once the permission is granted by the estate office, then the revised building plans will get approved by the owner as per the revised zoning plan or prevailing norms as per the requirement of the case.The processing charges for amalgamation of residential plots have been fixed at ₹10,000. The scheme will continue to be governed by the prevailing provisions including the other conditions of the Chandigarh Estates Rules, 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amalgamation-of-plots-rules-revised-marla-property-owners-of-chandigarh-to-gain-most/story-QBBWPPSPIwHMO9zAXr6VpK.html
27-07-2020||City||City’s rental housing market remains stunted due to Covid-19 pandemic||Gurugram In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, the city’s rental housing market -- recognised as one of the most lucrative housing markets in Delhi-NCR -- is decelerating. Experts and property owners have attributed the new trend to returning of salaried professionals, most of who are allowed to work from home, to their native towns and only a few takers for rental properties in the city. With the older lease agreements expiring every month, an increasing number of tenants are choosing to leave the city, even if just for the time being. “Most are young or middle aged professionals in corporate jobs. They make up the bulk of my business, and across Gurugram it is the professional class that drives the demand for rental housing,” said Kuldeep Khokri, who owns a property brokerage firm in Palam Vihar. “Corporate professionals don’t want to stay back in this atmosphere, and new people are not shifting here for work. This month, I made only 50% of the deals as compared to March,” he added. With most corporate offices in Gurugram enforcing work from home practices for the foreseeable future, many professionals in the salaried segment say they do not find it financially viable to continue renting a house in the city. Harinder Cheema, who works with a city-based corporate law firm, said, “I have been allowed to work from home till at least December. So I came back to my parents’ house in Chandigarh. I am in no hurry to return to Gurugram. I’m saving money and there’s a sense of security, being with family during the pandemic.” Some property agents have now begun adjusting their rates in hope of procuring more clients. Kartar Adhana, an independent broker operating in and around Sector 29, was earlier charging 15 days’ rent amount from clients as brokerage. “Now, I have started charging only 10 days’ rent as my fee. Since I do the business on my own, I can cut the fee a little. But many brokers in the city are actually middlemen who work for big property dealers. They are the ones who are really stuck,” Adhana said. At least a dozen other brokers, either employed at small firms or providing services to them independently, and who rely on fixing rental deals as their main source of income, complained of work having dried up. They feared a much longer wait for business to pick up than they had anticipated during the Covid-induced lockdown. “We thought that business will pick up after lockdown, once the metro and offices open up. This hasn’t happened. New lease agreements are not being signed at the same rate. I am looking for other work now,” said 24-year-old Dev Yaduvanshi, who works part-time in the Sikanderpur area, showing vacant homes to prospective tenants for established brokers.The slowing down of rental market has also forced landlords to renegotiate rents with existing and newer tenants. Dheeraj Dagar Chaudhury, a property owner who rents out builder-floor homes in Sushant Lok, said, “One of my lessees is vacating the home at the end of this month, and I have not been able to find a new tenant. This has not happened in five years since I started giving it out. In another case, I brought down the rent of a 2BHK house in Sushant Lok to Rs 20,000, because the tenant is facing some financial problems after salary cuts. I was charging Rs 25,000 earlier.” These testimonies stand in sharp contrast to a January’s report, which pegged Gurugram as a key market for rental housing in Delhi-NCR. An analysis by real estate consultant Anarock showed that the rental yield — or annual return on investment — for most rental properties in Gurugram was 3.5%, higher than the national average of 3%. In Delhi, the rental yield at the time stood at 2.2%. The report also showed that 45% of real estate investments in Gurugram happened with the view of earning rental income from the property after purchase.“Those who have invested in property with rental yield in mind should reconcile to a longer wait before they can recoup the investment. There will be a lot more empty homes now, and that will drive down prices further,” said Khokri, anticipating that things will remain this way until work from home practices continue at corporate offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/city-s-rental-housing-market-remains-stunted-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-Jzksfm7AFZNgG5JXRmIMvM.html
27-07-2020||Mumbai||Glimpse at Indian matchmaking in the real world||Sima Aunty or Sima Tarapia, the woman with the starring role in the docu-series Indian Matchmaking, is being called the stuff of nightmares. The Netflix show is meant to be a behind-the-scenes look at how arranged matches are orchestrated. But it’s so carefully curated that there’s never a mention of dowry, and yet plenty of the gossip, drama, judgement and heartbreak that make any reality show work.So what’s it like in the real world? How much did Indian Matchmaking get right, what did the show get wrong, and how much did they leave out altogether?The fundamentals, it would appear, remain largely unchanged on the surface, but the details do look different. A ‘good’ education used to mean Convent school, now ‘nothing below a Masters will work’ says matchmaker Deepika Godiawala. A good family still means one with ideally no crime records, divorce records, or children born out of wedlock. A good paycheque is ‘a must’ even for women who must cease to work as soon as they marry. Young and good looking are now variable; well-cultured is still listed, but is variable too –it can mean multi-lingual, practised in the fine arts, and sometimes just money will do.One thing that has changed is that parents’ preferences tend to take a backseat to the preferences of the offspring looking for a spouse. This can make it harder to predict the parameters, matchmakers say. “Back in the day, it was easier — girls would go for education and family background and boys would go for looks. Then you factored in job, business family etc,” says Godiawala, who ran the Parichay bureau in Ahmedabad till she retired two years ago.The agency is now run by her protégé, Ami Shah. “Suitors are now looking for ‘matching wavelengths’ and ‘mental connection’,” she says. “It’s not easy to measure or assess such a thing from just the biodata.”The vanity checklist — age, height, weight, complexion (read skin tone) and good looks – still holds. Caste remains a factor, as do matching horoscopes. Vegetarian or non-vegetarian or pure vegetarian has become trickier, since young Jains may eat this and that, and traditionally pork- or beef-averse communities may have offspring that are not so averse.Type of job has become a more complex differentiator too. How many countries have you lived in? Do your ambitions include an overseas stint? These are questions that are now a significant part of the conversation.The Taruni Shroff Marriage Bureau caters to upper-middle-class and high-net-worth clients in the Gujarati, Jain and Marwari communities and says location is a differentiator too. A family from the city and a suitor from the suburbs? There’s no point even trying to get them to meet halfway.With HNI clients, a lot more work goes into each meeting anyway. “You have to match the location, coordinate time slots, placate larger egos,” says Zameer Shroff, who inherited the bureau from his aunt. Which party will make the first call, for instance, is highly discussed and negotiated.The idea of the housewife is fading in this category, Shroff adds. “We’ve begun to decline to take cases if the man is looking for a homemaker and a guarantee she won’t work. It’s difficult to find such a match in the circles we work in.”In an aside, Shroff explains the hierarchy within this slice — “First-generation share trading and diamond trading are considered volatile businesses, and if you’re a freelancer like many media professionals are today, then it’s difficult to get a match.”“In India, marriages are breaking like biscuits,” Sima Aunty proclaims, on the show, and yet matchmakers agree universally that divorced people are far, far more difficult to match. And divorced women with children, next to impossible. “Singles over 32 are open to meeting divorcees,” says Hitesh Chhabria who runs the Soulmeet marriage bureau for Sindhis and Punjabis. “Overall, people are less picky about age. The woman doesn’t always have to be younger. Cross-ing 30 no longer moves you automatically to the back of the line.”Where earlier only the parents would talk to the matchmaker, now the spouse-to-be often coordinates directly too. A 28-year-old woman who signed up with Shroff six months ago says she spoke to Zameer for half an hour, to explain what she’s looking for — an equal partner, essentially; someone she won’t have to babysit. She studied and worked in Australia for three years before returning home to Gujarat to join the family food processing business. Her filters include well-travelled, respectful towards service people, and able to handle a crisis in business or in life. “I’ve had a couple of virtual meetings, but it has not worked out yet,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/glimpse-at-indian-matchmaking-in-the-real-world/story-tvy2vpTCCxFUPBKHppoNCJ.html
27-07-2020||Gurugram||Antigen testing camps come to condominiums, townships||Over the last two weeks, the health department has started conducting rapid antigen testing camps on the request of residents at several townships, condominiums and societies across the city. Till now, 10 such camps have been organised in places such as Sushant Lok 1, DLF Phase 1, and sector 47 to trace new Covid-19 cases, according to the health officials.Residents, housekeeping staff, security guards and domestic helps are mostly tested in these camps. Health officials said an elaborate plan was in the offing to cover maximum ground with such camps in as many townships as possible. “Even if a single family in a condominium tests Covid-19 positive, we plan to set up a camp within the premises of the township to cover as many people as possible,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.“There is no restriction on the people coming for testing. It can be domestic helps, drivers, estate officers among others, who are part of the society. Through antigen detection test, we can cover more people in less time, as the test can deliver results in 15-30 minutes. More kits have been ordered for the purpose,” said Yadav.In Gurugram, more than 38,000 antigen kits have been used, out of which almost 11,00 have tested positive. The antigen diagnostic test detects proteins attached to coronavirus or within it by testing the sample collected from the nasal cavity using swabs. The antigen test, however, may not detect all active infection since it is not specific as Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Therefore those who are symptomatic but antigen-negative are required to be tested through the frontline RT-PCR test.Officials said that the rationale behind conducting such camps in townships, condominiums, societies is to ensure a larger number of people are tested for Covid-19 which not only helps in forming a more accurate assessment of the spread of the virus in the city but also helps in undertaking swift treatment interventions for people who have tested positive. On Monday, one such camp was conducted at the clubhouse of Bestech Park View Spa Apartments in sector 47, in collaboration with officials of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on the behest of residents. Health department officials tested 100 people including residents, people from nearby areas, domestic helps, security guards, housekeeping staff at the camp for the virus. Of the 100 people tested, 82 tested negative for the virus. One resident of Rosewood City in sector 49, a visitor, however, tested positive for the virus, and he was put under home quarantine immediately. Seventeen other people, who tested negative for the virus during rapid antigen testing but exhibited symptoms, were also tested for the virus through RT-PCR method and their results will be revealed in the next 48 hours.“We have been conducting such camps across the city since the start of the month, primarily in large outbreak regions (LORs). Now we have received directions to carry out such camps in other parts of the city as well to ensure more people are tested for the virus and put in home quarantine or in hospitals for treatment as and when needed. A resident of sector 49 tested positive for the virus during Monday’s testing and he was sent home immediately. We have been regularly following up with him since then,” said Hardeep Kaur Saluja, medical officer, health department and in-charge of urban primary health centres (UPHC).Kaur was conducting the camp at Bestech Park View Spa Apartments in sector 47. “Since these camps are not being conducted in LORs, where the chances of cases emerging are much higher, the scale of testing is much lower. In LORs we are testing around 2,000 people every day, but in specific residential areas, testing of 100 people is sufficient,” she said.Sukhbir Palta, a resident of the condominium who had placed the request with the health department for setting up a testing camp, said there were several reasons for people of his locality being tested.“We have a sizeable number of people who are senior citizens and some have comorbid conditions. They aren’t necessarily in a position to venture out and get themselves tested for Covid-19. In addition to this, a lot of our staff and domestic helps are also coming to the condominium from various parts of the city and interacting with each other. As a precautionary measure, we requested the health department to conduct a camp in our neighbourhood,” said Palta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/antigen-testing-camps-come-to-condominiums-townships/story-pNNWx5lNubb7nkdL2o7JmK.html
27-07-2020||Gurugram||DTCP sends notices to developers of affordable housing projects for delay in completion||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has issued notices to eight real estate developers of affordable housing projects in the city for slow pace of construction work and missing the deadline by nearly 15 to 18 months. The department asked the developers to expedite the construction work as a large number of homebuyers have complained about the slow progress despite making timely payments. In addition to this, the department had also issued notices to 18 other developers who had missed a review meeting on affordable housing projects held on July 16. In view of the issues raised by home buyers, the department has directed all the developers to submit a progress report of the construction work after every 15 days. There are 80 licenced projects in the affordable category in the city, out of which, only eight have been delivered to the buyers and occupancy certificates(OCs) have been issued so far, said officials. The affordable projects were launched in the city under the new affordable housing policy introduced by the government in 2013. As per this policy, a housing project has to be completed within four years from the date building permissions are granted to the developer. Officials said that around half of the affordable projects were lagging behind in the progress of their construction work. Affordable housing projects in the city are mostly located in sectors 103, 99A and Sohna Road. Ravi Sihag, senior town planner, Gurugram, said that notices have been issued to developers for slow pace of work and they have been asked to expedite construction work. “They have also been asked to provide updates on the progress of construction work every 15 days so that their progress can be monitored,” he said. The department also said that it has taken into account the complaints lodged by the home buyers regarding excessive charges demanded by the developers on various accounts. The issue was raised by the home buyers during a meeting called by Badshahpur MLA on Sunday at John Hall. “The issues pertaining to excess charges being demanded by the developers is a serious matter, We will analyse all of its aspects and send our recommendations to the headquarters for an early resolution,” said RS Bhath, district town planner. Affordable home buyers have been repeatedly complained against the developers for demanding maintenance charges from them, which they allege is against the government policy. The DTCP, however, maintains that there is an ambiguity at the policy level in this regard and has promised to seek clarity on the issue from higher authorities. Reacting to the delay in the completion of the affordable housing projects in the city, a home buyer, seeking anonymity, said. “We have been repeatedly asking our developer to complete the project as we are forced to live on rent while paying EMI at the same time. However, things are not moving.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-sends-notices-to-developers-of-affordable-housing-projects-for-delay-in-completion/story-dv3zkYI976kvUGqYSzLDrL.html
27-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram Police arrests four members of a gang for duping people on LGBTQ dating app||The Gurugram Police arrested four members of a gang from Sector 40 on Sunday night for allegedly duping at least 300 people via a mobile dating app for the LGBTQ community by taking inappropriate photos and blackmailing them to pay huge sums of money. The police said they had arrested the mastermind earlier this month and were tracking movements of four others, who were based in Delhi. The four members were on way to meet another victim on MG Road on Sunday, when they were nabbed, said senior officers and investigators associated with the case. The suspects were identified as Sunder Kumar alias Sagar, Pushp Kumar alias Piyush, Vinod Messy alias Kake and Rahul Kumar alias Pehalwan staying in different parts of Delhi. The police recovered mobile phones and cash from their possession. The alleged mastermind in this case, Jaswinder Singh, aged 23, a resident of Faridabad was arrested earlier. The police said Rahul is a gym trainer and an aspiring model, Vinod is a cab driver, and Sunder and Pushp are mechanics, who also deal in car accessories near Nizamuddin. They also worked as part-time cab drivers. Earlier, in February, HT reported that the city police had busted another similar racket. At least 50 senior executives — including CEOs — of companies based in the National Capital Region (NCR) were among the 150 people who fell victim to the members of that gang over the past three months. In a similar modus operandi, the gang members befriended victims on a popular LGBTQ dating app and blackmailed them with intimate pictures. The latest gang was busted after a preliminary inquiry was made into a snatching complaint by a 24-year-old executive, who did not reveal the exact manner in which he was duped out of fear of stigma. When the police investigated the matter, it was found out that the executive was cheated by the gang members, who befriended him on the dating app in June this year.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the victim cooked up a story and tried to mislead police, following which investigation was carried out. “We arrested one of the suspects from Faridabad, who spilled the beans and revealed that he is a part of a five-member gang, which had duped several people in Delhi-NCR over the past year for lakhs after befriending them on the dating app,” he said. The probe revealed that the gang had made their profiles on the dating app and used to move around in their cars. They used to go together to meet the victims and offered them sexual services. “They used to charge anywhere between ₹10,000 and ₹15,000 from the victims and one of them used to record the act. Later they used to blackmail the victim and extort money,” said Sangwan. They used to fix up a meeting after getting friendly with the victims and once they gained their confidence and victim assured them that their identities will be kept safe, they used to meet them at a place agreed upon mutually. “In the recent case, the executive called one of the gang members to Sohna Road in a commercial complex and finalised a deal for ₹11,000. Later, when the victim met the other gang members, he changed his mind and asked for services from another gang member who asked him to pay ₹15,000. The victim took him to a men’s washroom in the complex. Later when the suspect demanded the money, victim tried to negotiate, which led to a tiff. The gang members snatched his mobile phone and forced him to withdraw nearly ₹35,000 from an ATM kiosk,” said Sangwan. The police said the gang members used their original pictures on the dating sites and mentioned their original mobile numbers, which helped police to identify and nab them. The police said the gang used commercial complexes in the city during the lockdown to meet victims. Sometimes, they also met in one of their cars or used the empty office spaces, taking advantage of the lockdown. Police commissioner KK Rao said that they have arrested all the members involved in the case and have written to the dating app company to ensure that all app users are verified before their profiles are uploaded. “We have received only one complaint recently as people usually do not reveal such incidents out of fear of stigma. I want to appeal to residents to approach us if such incidents occur. We will keep their names and credentials secret and strict action will be taken against the suspects. Also, people should be careful while using these online dating applications,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-arrests-four-members-of-a-gang-for-duping-people-on-lgbtq-dating-app/story-76TWSUcyPZakbL2AzsM6FP.html

27-07-2020||City||Four arrested for killing former cop||Rohtak police on Monday claimed to have solved the murder case of a former cop with the arrest of four persons. The accused are Sunil, Rajkumar, Dharambir and Nathuram of Khedi village in Meham. Virender Kumar, who was terminated from services, was abducted from outside the local court complex on July 24 by at least seven car-borne persons and later, his body was found on the outskirts of the city. Addressing a press conference, DSP (headquarters) Gorakhpal Rana said the victim and accused had a dispute over a land near their village. “A court case was also filed and the accused party had won it. After the verdict, the victim had attacked the accused and subsequently, an FIR was registered against him,” he added. The victim had on July 24 come to the court for his bail hearing when he was abducted and later murdered by the accused. Meanwhile, Rohtak SP Rahul Sharma has placed three police personnel — ASI Roshan, head constables Dinesh and Ramphal — under suspension for negligence in performing their duties.

27-07-2020||Mumbai||CM says he has steering wheel, Ajit tweets photo in driver’s seat||Hours after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said he is in firm control of the “steering wheel” of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) — a coalition government comprising the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, his deputy Ajit Pawar of the NCP sent him wishes for his 60th birthday on Twitter with a picture of the two leaders with Pawar in the driver’s seat. At the stroke of midnight on Sunday, Pawar tweeted the picture of him at the wheel of a golf cart and CM Thackeray in the passenger’s seat. Pawar, who was among the first to wish the CM, caused a flutter in the political circles with the mischievous picture. “Best wishes to the Hon. CM of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena Party President & Maha Vikas Aghadi Leader, Shri. Uddhav Thackeray ji. Wish you a healthy & long life!” Pawar tweeted. Thackeray, in an interview to Rajya Sabha member and Saamana executive editor Sanjay Raut, published on Sunday had said, “The future of my government is not in the hands of the Opposition... It is a strong government and I am at the steering wheel with two other partners. A three-wheeler (rickshaw) is a vehicle of poor people.” Later in the day, Pawar went to Thackeray’s residence Matoshree in Bandra to wish the CM on his birthday. Both leaders, according to party insiders, chatted for a few minutes. Reacting on the tweet, Raut said, “I saw the picture, that’s alright. He might have the steering but we provide him with the cars.” He added, “He has a lot of experience with steering wheels. From time to time, he keeps on checking the oil and other things for the Maha Vikas Aghadi car to keep going faster.”Former chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis taunted Thackeray on steering wheel comment and said that rickshaw drivers do not decide the destination. “He said that he has the autorickshaw’s steering in his hand but Uddhav ji forgot to say that where the rickshaw will go is not decided by the driver, but the passengers sitting behind. If the rickshaw does not go to the passenger’s destination then the driver does not get his fare,” Fadnavis said during a party event in Mumbai.Calling it a display of the silent tussle between the two top leaders in the government, political observers say it could continue. Political analyst Surendra Jondhale called it “political indecency” on Pawar’s part. “There is some amount of restlessness to show who is more decisive and assertive, as the two leaders have different styles of functioning. It is unfortunate that Pawar chose to put out such a picture. There should be some kind of political decency. One should not take it lightly, as it is impolite and indecent,” he said. Earlier in July, Thackeray made sure he got back five Sena corporators, who had defected to the NCP in the presence of Pawar, back into his party fold. His deputy had presided over the entry of the Sena corporators into the NCP, which did not go down well with Thackeray, as he made his displeasure known to Pawar. “There must be some friction due to that [episode] too, but (Ajit) Pawar should not forget that Thackeray has direct access to Sharad Pawar. He (Ajit Pawar) has never hidden his vaulting political ambition, but this is not the opportune moment to bare such thoughts amid the pandemic,” Jondhale added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-says-he-has-steering-wheel-ajit-tweets-photo-in-driver-s-seat/story-NtJCj8ao3cMgcZpte6ylBJ.html
27-07-2020||Mumbai||Activist questions scope of work; CEO says didn’t share data||RTI activist Saket Gokhale, who brought to light the alleged appointment of an agency run by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, Devang Dave, to manage a social media page of the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Maharashtra during last year’s Assembly elections, has raised questions over the scope of work allotted to the agency. Gokhale alleged that not only was the appointment in conflict of interest, but the work allotted to it was also with the intention of muzzling the voice of the Opposition. Gokhale on Monday tweeted contents of a government resolution issued in October 2017, describing the scope of work. He alleged the agency, Signpost, was not just responsible for social media posts, but also data targeting and neutralising negative sentiments against then ruling BJP government. He alleged there was a possibility of compromise of personal information related to voters. CEO Baldev Singh said, “The allegations are denied in toto. Signpost’s role was limited to social awareness of voters, there was no question of sharing any other data. DGIPR has scrutinised and confirmed that Signpost has no political link. The impression created by Gokhale that Dave and his company were given contract is baseless.” The Office of CEO Maharashtra later tweeted to clarify that DGIPR had appointed Signpost India Pvt Ltd owned by Dave and not the Socialcentral Solutions. In a series of tweets on Friday, Gokhale alleged that CEO, Maharashtra appointed Signpost India Pvt Ltd, which was controlled by Dave, who was the BJP’s information technology and social media cell head. Gokhale alleged Signpost India Pvt ltd and Dave’s Socialcentral Solutions share same office address and Dave on his profile page admitted to having worked for the CEO, Maharashtra. Signpost India was empanelled by DGIPR. Congress leader and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan then wrote to the chief election commissioner of India demanding a thorough inquiry. Dave in his tweets on Friday had admitted that he controls Signpost and Socialsentral Solutions, which are located on the same address. Dave refused to speak on the issue on Monday.Dilip Pandharpatte, director general, DGIPR, said, “In our internal assessment, we have found that Dave was not linked with Signpost, the agency empanelled by us. We do not qualify any agency linked with any political party, but it is difficult to track indirect or discreet links.” Maharashtra BJP’s vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “The allegations are related to DGIPR and office of CEO, Maharashtra, and not against us. The Congress should conduct a probe.” Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant tweeted that taking the issued raised by Gokhale forward, the party will unearth some very serious revelations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/activist-questions-scope-of-work-ceo-says-didn-t-share-data/story-bejbPOVoFw37MtvnerkECN.html
27-07-2020||City||Over 5,000 employees of Noida authority to undergo Covid-19 test||NOIDA The Noida authority has decided to conduct Covid-19 test of all its permanent and temporary employees to identify the infected staff and provide them treatment at an early stage, officials said.To begin with, the authority on Monday organised a testing camp at its main administrative building in Sector 6. The drive is expected to be completed in a week, the officials said, adding that the testing will be done using rapid antigen kits. The drive will cover about 1,200 permanent employees, including top officials, and nearly 4,000 temporary employees, who are engaged in jobs like sanitation and supply of essential goods, the officials said.“On day one, 132 employees were tested. Of which only one employee, who is an assistant junior engineer, was found positive. The administration is taking required action in this regard to ensure the infection can be prevented,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer, Noida authority. The Noida authority has its water department office building in Sector 5, horticulture department office in Sector 39 and engineering department office in Sector 19, and other smaller offices.“We aim to test all of our employees in the next one week or so. The camp will cover both the permanent and temporary staff members,” said Mishra.On Monday, among senior officials, two additional CEOs and three officers on special duty (OSDs) also tested negative. Last month, five employees of the authority, including one OSD level officer, had tested positive, but all of them have recovered.Residents’ welfare associations, apartment owners associations and other social groups were demanding that those employees, who are engaged in sanitization, waste collection and supply of essential goods in containment zones, should be tested as they are vulnerable to the infection. The district administration is already taking help of RWAs and AOAs in organising camps to conduct rapid antigen tests to identify the positive cases early. “We have requested all social groups to help us organise camps for the rapid antigen tests. The objective is that testing and treatment should not be delayed at all,” said Narendra Bhooshan, nodal officer for Covid-19 preparations in the Gautam Budh Nagar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-5-000-employees-of-noida-authority-to-undergo-covid-19-test/story-5ZUMeVt7HflvVCYXlk2AaI.html
27-07-2020||Noida||Noida: Since May, Covid deaths per month have increased but fatality rate has gone down||Gautam Budh nagar witnessed its first Covid positive case on March 8. Till April 30, the number of cases had multiplies to xx but there no deaths reported from the district.The first patient succumbed to the virus on May 2, with more than 40 others dying due to the virus till date, when the number of cases stood at xx.  Figures now, however, show that the fatality rate among Covid patients, seen on a monthly basis, is on the decline.Official figures show that the number of deaths had been on the rise every month from May. While as many as seven deaths were reported out of a total of 315 positive cases in May (2.22%), in June 15 more deaths were reported out of a tally of 1,851 positive cases (0.81%), while 18 more deaths were reported out of a total of 2,482 positive cases till July 26 (0.72%).District chief medical officer, Dr Deepak Ohri, said that despite the increase in Covid-19 deaths every month, the fatality rate has gone down drastically, which was a good sign. “It clearly indicates that our sampling rate and recovery rate have been increasing day by day. In the past week, no fresh death was reported due to Covid-19 in the district. Not only that, Gautam Budh Nagar has the lowest mortality rate among all districts of the state,” he said.According to district magistrate Suhas LY, all measures are being taken to increase surveillance and minimise the fatality rate. “Due to continuous efforts of our doctors and paramedics, the district has one of the lowest case fatality rates (CFR), of 0.8%, in the country. Only about 15% of active cases are there in the district, while around 85% of the total positive cases have recovered. We are trying to give the best possible drugs and treatment to all patients irrespective of their financial position,” he said.“Plasma therapy has also been used successfully by GIMS and recently, a private plasma bank was set up in Noida, which will also provide free plasma to economically impoverished patients. We have sufficient physical infrastructure (such as beds) and human infrastructure (doctors and paramedics) to take care of our residents,” he added. The DM further said that in July, the testing rate in the district was among the best in the country. “We are testing more than 3,000 samples per day, which translates to 1,500 per million per day. Previously, when the infection rate had gone up, we had reached a positivity rate of up to 15% or more. But now, due to extensive containment, testing and isolation, it has reduced to around 5%, which is a significant reduction,” he said.Suhas also said that infection has been on a receding trend in the recent past. “On Friday, testing camps were held in sectors 41, 75, 93, 121 and 134, and a total of 677 antigen tests were conducted, of which there were no positive cases. This does not mean that the city is free from the pandemic. But it definitely indicates that we can control the infection’s curve and reduce the positivity rate, if we follow measures of containment and basic protocols properly,” the DM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-since-may-covid-deaths-per-month-have-increased-but-fatality-rate-has-gone-down/story-MJ0POiSI02BBQFDJmKFupO.html
27-07-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown effect: Metro-7, 2A and MTHL work delayed||The outbreak of Covid-19 has delayed the city administration’s plans for a smoother commute by around six months, as a result of the lockdown which has disrupted work on the Metro and the Mumbai trans-harbour link (MTHL). According to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s (MMRDA) revised estimate, trial runs for Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar East -Andheri East) is likely to be in December 2020 and the lines may be operational by May 2021. The two Metro routes, which are part of the 337-kilometre (km) master plan for the Metro, were initially expected to be operational by December this year, with trial runs being conducted in September. MTHL, a 22km long sea bridge connecting Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, may also see a delay of six months. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said the delay is largely due to the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. BG Pawar, joint metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “The timelines are still being worked out. It might be completed before time, if we get adequate workforce.” Owing to the lockdown, the authority is also facing a shortage of workers, many of whom returned to their villages in other parts of the country. The supply chain of material and machinery has also been severely affected. For instance, in case of MTHL, while more than 5,000 workers were available at the site prior to lockdown, there are 2,247 workers at the project site in July. “The manufacture and transportation of steel spans that were required from foreign countries has been affected. Till June, around 27% work on all packages had been completed,” an official from MMRDA said on condition of anonymity. The Metro work has been divided into three packages. For Metro-2A, or the yellow line, MMRDA has completed 85% of the civil works. For Metro-7, or the red line, 79% of the civil works have been completed. Track laying for both corridors have commenced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-effect-metro-7-2a-and-mthl-work-delayed/story-JPpnoFjj4GpS935OLDPQcL.html
27-07-2020||City||Heavy rains predicted in next three days||Noida The city and its adjoining areas are likely to receive heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday, officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday. The national capital region (NCR) saw moderate to heavy rainfall on the first few days of last week. However, due to the weather conditions the region has turned dry since Friday last week. Weather analysts have asserted that the monsoon line of trough – a low-pressure line that oscillates around Delhi and brings rains to the region – which is currently over northern foothills will move back towards Delhi-NCR by Tuesday night. This will lead to moderate to heavy rains across NCR, including Noida and Ghaziabad, they said. “Tuesday may see light rains across several pockets of the region, including Noida and Ghaziabad. However, as the monsoon trough line will oscillate around Delhi-NCR from Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, we can expect heavy rainfall on July 29 and 30. The region may see an overall moderate rainfall for next three to four days at least,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. The rainfall below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5mm is moderate and above 64.5mm is heavy. The Gautam Budh Nagar district has seen deficit rainfall of 91%, and has received only 17mm rainfall since June 1 against expected 197.3 mm. The neighbouring Ghaziabad too saw a rainfall deficit of 69% and has received 60.7mm rainfall against expected 197.3mm. The weather department predicts temperature to fall as well due to the rains. “The temperatures may also fall by at least three to four degrees from July 29 onwards,” Srivastava said. On Monday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 37.6 degrees Celsius, three notches above the season’s average, against 36.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The minimum temperature was recorded at 28.2 degrees Celsius, same as a day earlier, IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heavy-rains-predicted-in-next-three-days/story-ErNs1j2YAsAdblJMk4GdmO.html
27-07-2020||City||Ex-NTPC official points extortion finger at trio held for murder||Three men who had been arrested by Kasna police nearly ten days ago have now been accused of extorting nearly Rs 35 lakh from a retired NTPC official and a second case has been registered against them at Beta 2 police station. The Bhati brothers — Devesh and Pankaj Bhati— and their accomplice Sunny had been arrested by the Kasna police in connection with the murder of 22-year-old Aditya Soni who had gone missing from the Site 5 industrial area on July 5. Aditya’s mother had filed a missing person’s complaint, which was later converted to a murder case. His body had been found in Mathura on July 11 after which the suspects had been nabbed. Police officials had said that Sunny was friends with the suspect and had had a drunken argument that turned ugly . The Bhati brothers were nabbed on July 13 while Sunny was nabbed on July 23.A day before Sunny’s arrest, the second victim, retired NTPC official Chhotan lal Sahay (61), had approached police.  “I retired from a managerial post in NTPC in April, 2019, after which I started property consulting for a few friends and acquaintances in Delta 1. The Bhati brothers and Sunny were also working as property dealers and that is how we came in contact. One day in September, they took me in their car on the pretext of showing me a property,” said Sahay. He said that the trio held him at gunpoint and threatened his family and demanded that he give them whatever cash he had in his account. “However, I told them that my account was joint with my wife’s and giving cash would not be possible. They took three post dated cheques from me worth Rs 16.2 lakh. Then they dropped me and warned me against reporting the incident to anyone,” said the victim. Eventually, the suspects, took nearly Rs 35 lakh from the victim, in various instalments. Sahay said that he was too scared to approach police and it was only after the arrest of the brothers was he was able to seek legal help. “His complaint came to us only a day before Sunny’s arrest. Soafter Sunny was nabbed, we were able to question him and he confessed to the whole thing. If it becomes necessary, we will take them on remand for more questioning,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 3. He said that the money had been traced and a probe in the matter is underway.The suspects were booked at the Beta 2 police station under section 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ex-ntpc-official-points-extortion-finger-at-trio-held-for-murder/story-uCUZkSsFrTmsMANXndS6EK.html
27-07-2020||Noida||Noida: Covid patient molested by doctor recovering in same room, FIR registered||A 20-year-old woman, recovering from Covid, was allegedly molested by a doctor at the facility who was also a patient and was sharing her twin-bed room. The alleged incident took place on Monday morning at Jaypee Hospital in Sector 128.The woman, a graduate student of Delhi University, has filed a complaint with the Expressway police station after narrating her ordeal to her family members in the afternoon.“She was admitted to the hospital on July 21 and was to be discharged today. Just as her discharge papers were being processed, another patient was moved to her twin sharing room. We were against it, but because he was a doctor of the same hospital, we figured that it would be alright,” said the woman’s brother.In her complaint, it is stated that some time after settling in the room, the suspect allegedly started engaging her in a conversation.“He then started telling me about post Covid symptoms and spoke about various clots that one tends to have in various parts of the body. He then walked towards me and asked me to lie down. He then started touching me inappropriately,” said the woman in her complaint.Based on her complaint, a case was registered against the doctor at the Expressway police station under section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code.“We have filed a case and a probe in the matter is underway. The suspect is himself a Covid patient and cannot be questioned immediately, but we are keeping tab on the situation,” said Yogesh Malik, station house officer, Expressway police station.Officials from the Jaypee Hospital said that the doctor worked with them part-time.“We are fully co-operating with the authorities regarding the investigation. He works here part-time and is currently undergoing treatment here.

27-07-2020||Delhi||Gang that cheated people by promising to arrange large loans busted||The Delhi Police on Monday said they had busted a gang of cheats who posed as high-profile persons, with links to senior politicians, and cheated businessmen and professionals in the guise of helping them get large loans. Five men, including the gang’s kingpin and an alleged employee of the All India Congress Committee’s (AICC) headquarters in central Delhi, have been arrested for cheating a businessman and a doctor of ₹50 lakh after offering to help them secure loans amounting to ₹50 crore and ₹25 crore respectively, senior police officers associated with the operation said. The racket’s mastermind Ritesh Tiwari impersonated a highly placed government servant and claimed to have access to the personal secretary to the Union home minister, the deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rajesh Deo said. “Tiwari deceived his potential targets by showing off his lavish lifestyle. He would call them to a farmhouse in south Delhi, which he had rented, and pretend that some high-risk category VVIPs stayed there. Apart from parking high-end cars, the men had employed bodyguards. He would travel in a convoy with two Gypsies as pilot and escort vehicles for his Fortuner SUV ,” said DCP Deo. The police said that Tiwari would pay ₹5 lakh per month as rent for the farmhouse and ₹1,200 to each bodyguard per day. The vehicles parked in the farmhouse were rented, they said. The other arrested members of the gang were identified as Ajay Jain,50, Bhim Pandit,54, whom the police claimed worked at the AICC headquarters, Bhaskar Nath,25, and Aman Kashyap,53, whose father had also worked in the AICC office for sometime a few years ago. Pandit allegedly helped the other members of the gang access the AICC headquarters. The Fortuner, two Gypsies, and mobile phones used in the crime were seized by the crime branch team, the police said. When contacted regarding the arrest of Bhim Pandit, Manish Chatrath, secretary, AICC, said, “The person concerned is not employed at the AICC office. However, I will verify this once again on Tuesday.” DCP Deo said that two separate cheating and forgery cases were registered on the complaints of two persons who were cheated of ₹50 lakh by the gang members. During the probe, the DCP said, the suspects were identified and their modus operandi unearthed. The key players – Ritesh Tiwari and Ajay Jain – would look for potential victims who needed large loans and meet them at luxury hotels, clubs and even the offices of political parties, said Deo. “The suspects would convince the victims that they were highly connected and would get their work done easily. The victims were called to the farmhouse where they were searched and frisked before being allowed inside. Their phones and wallets were also taken. Further, the requisite documents were collected from the victims and they were asked to wait for a confirmation call,” said an investigator, who did not want to be named. A few days later, the officer said, the loan-seeker would get a call to convey that his loan had been sanctioned. The gang members would trick the loan-seekers into paying ‘stamp duty’. “After the payment, the cheats would start avoiding the victims,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gang-that-cheated-people-by-promising-to-arrange-large-loans-busted/story-49jxjUkaBBnJE5Vec8l5gM.html
27-07-2020||Mumbai||Thackeray’s 60th birthday low-key affair; PM sends wishes||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who had decided to not celebrate his birthday on Monday due to Covid-19 crises, spent a low-key birthday amid official engagements. The Shiv Sena chief received birthday wishes from various leaders from across party lines. He also received a letter from Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and a phone call from President Ram Nath Kovind.Thackeray, who turned 60 on Monday, had appealed to his followers and party workers to not celebrate his birthday. Party workers had, instead, set up blood and plasma donation camps at several places in Mumbai to mark the day. In an appeal last week, Thackeray had asked not to put up hoardings and spend money on garlands, and instead urged workers to contribute to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund on the occasion.In a letter tweeted by the chief minister’s office (CMO), PM Modi was quoted wishing Thackeray saying, “Birthdays are a time to reflect on the past and an opportunity to shape the future.” Thanking the PM, Thackeray said the PM’s “inspirational words” will guide him personally and Maharashtra towards a “brighter future”.The gesture and the choice of words by Modi suggested that the ties between the two leaders, who were once allies, are still cordial. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, “Indeed, Modiji and Uddhavji share a good personal relationship. Sometimes in politics, certain decisions have to be taken as per the situation, but Maharashtra has shown that nobody should work with personal enmity in their minds in politics.”Raut also said the Sena chief should concentrate on national politics as well. “Uddhav Thackeray has ability for national leadership; I’ve seen this for many years now.”NCP chief Sharad Pawar; former CM Devendra Fadnavis; Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Ram Vilas Paswan, Prakash Javadekar, and Rajnath Singh; Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Chouhan; West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee; NCP leader Supriya Sule were among others who wished the CM through social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thackeray-s-60th-birthday-low-key-affair-pm-sends-wishes/story-zo5mw3OoG43S2jSluFKtjK.html
27-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Woman’s body found stuffed inside suitcase||Ghaziabad The police on Monday morning recovered the body of an unidentified woman, which was stuffed inside a suitcase, from New Hindon Vihar adjacent to GT Road. According to the police, the hands and legs of the deceased were tied with a dupatta. The woman appeared to be married and in the age group of 24 to 25 years, they said.“There were no external injury marks on her body, but her face had turned blackish which probably suggests that she died of suffocation. However, the exact cause of her death will be known only after the post mortem report comes in. It seems that she was murdered due to some family dispute,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).“We have formed several teams to investigate the case. Information has also been sought from nearby districts about any missing person and also to ascertain her identity,” Mishra added.The woman was wearing a yellow coloured kurta with Mehandi in her hands and legs, the police said.The area from where the suitcase was recovered comes under the jurisdiction of Sahibabad police station. According to the police, they are scanning CCTV footage from nearby areas as they found marks of tyres of a car and a bike from near the place where the suitcase was found. The cops said that the murder probably took place on Sunday night and the suitcase was dumped at the spot during the early hours of Monday. The police received the information from locals around 7am on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-woman-s-body-found-stuffed-inside-suitcase/story-pR7MZrEl4TaxVZ26KkuUXP.html
27-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad proposes ‘extended containment exercise’ in areas bordering Delhi||Ghaziabad/New Delhi: In order to control spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, the Ghaziabad district administration has proposed a concept of ‘extended containment exercise’ in Ghaziabad as well as in adjoining areas falling under the jurisdiction of the National Capital. On Monday, officials of the Delhi government, led by the Capital’s chief secretary, discussed measures with those from Uttar Pradesh in order to speed up control measures.Officials said the meeting was in line with a previous one held on July 17, when Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul had visited Ghaziabad for a review of measures and strategies taken up by UP districts falling under the National Capital Region (NCR) to deal with the pandemic. Earlier, on June 18, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had held a video conference with UP and NCR officials and had called for a unified approach in all of NCR, including Delhi and Ghaziabad, to deal with the outbreak. “During the video conference held with Delhi officials Monday, we proposed that an extended containment exercise should come up in bordering areas of Ghaziabad and Delhi. It is so because the spread of infection is not restricted by geographical boundaries. Under this concept, if there is a containment zone in Ghaziabad near Delhi border, the Delhi authorities should also take up containment exercises in their areas to check the spread of the virus,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate.Anita C Meshram, divisional commissioner (Meerut), was also present in the meeting. “We have areas of Loni, Khoda and other localities in the trans-Hindon areas, which are close to the Delhi border. We already have a number of cases which have resulted due to cross border travel between Ghaziabad and Delhi. Earlier, we had enforced strict containment exercises in Loni, Khoda and Vaishali. As a result, there is a decline in the number of cases there. So, if there is a simultaneous containment exercise in Ghaziabad and adjoining areas of Delhi, both the cities will benefit,” Pandey added. He also raised a point for reserving beds in super specialty hospitals in Delhi for high risk patients from Ghaziabad. “Delhi officials said hospitals in Delhi are accessible for patients coming from Ghaziabad. They were very positive about the issues we raised during the meeting. Similar points were raised before Dr VK Paul when he and his team had come to Ghaziabad on July 17,” Pandey added. At present, Ghaziabad has had a total of 4,639 Covid-19 cases so far, which includes 64 deaths and 947 active cases. Pandey had last week announced another round of containment exercise in 21 areas which have 10 or more active Covid-19 cases. A special door-to-door survey was also directed by the UP government from July 2 to July 12 to trace cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI).According to officials, Ghaziabad on July 27 has about 275 containment zones and the number of category-2 zones (having more than one case or in cluster), about 189, have exceeded the category-1 zones (having one case), of about 86. On the other hand, senior Delhi officials who attended the meeting said the Covid-19 response strategy for NCR is flowing out of the comprehensive approach of the Niti Aayog for the region. “It is already well synchronised and considers the containment zones in totality. The existing strategy ensures that the containment of infection is achieved fully and totally. In the same spirit, the adjoining districts of Delhi were directed to ensure that containment zones in the border areas are envisaged and enforced in close coordination with their counterpart in UP. The Delhi administration hopes that this would be strictly enforced and followed by the UP administrations as well,” a senior official of the Delhi government said on condition of anonymity. On the issue of Ghaziabad’s demand of reserving beds in Delhi for their high-risk patients, a second senior official said that Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has already ordered that all health facilities in Delhi are open to all the citizens of the country. “In compliance of the orders, all medical care institutions of Delhi have been treating Covid patients from different parts of the country, including UP and other neighbouring states,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-proposes-extended-containment-exercise-in-areas-bordering-delhi/story-jUGyqzjQsV8IHWEC9ssm7O.html
27-07-2020||Mumbai||Man stabs woman for rejecting his proposal||A 24-year-old man stabbed a 19-year-old woman with a knife, hit her with a hammer, and tried to kill himself by jumping off from the terrace of four-storey building at Khar (West) on Sunday afternoon. The accused, Mohammed Jahangir Faruk, attacked Prema Gabriel Dungdung after she refused his proposal for marriage. According to Khar police, both of them worked as house helps in the same society in Khar. “Faruk had proposed the woman a few months back but she had refused.

27-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: New govt policy, home isolation speed up discharge rate||The Uttar Pradesh government’s order on discharge of Covid patients and allowing home isolation for asymptomatic ones has come as a breather for officials who were scampering to open new L1 category hospitals to keep pace with the rise in the number of virus cases.The order over a period of seven days has also led to a drastic reduction in the number of beds being occupied at L1 category hospitals.The L1, L2 and L3 category hospitals were special dedicated Covid facilities that were opened by the state government in order to treat asymptomatic/mild, moderate and critical patients, respectively.According to official records till Monday morning, about 81% beds of 776 available in three L1 Covid hospitals in the district were vacant. The home isolation policy was allowed by the UP government on July 20, with the state administration a day later also issuing revised discharge guidelines, which helped more asymptomatic Covid-19 patients in going home, thereby freeing up beds in three L1 hospitals. At one point of time on July 17, the number of active patients in Ghaziabad had peaked tat 1,560 — the district’s all time high so far.“The number of active cases is coming down as more patients are getting discharged from L1 hospitals due to revised discharge policy. Earlier, the asymptomatic patients were getting discharged 10 days after their date of admission. Now, the asymptomatic patients are getting discharged patients on tenth day from the date of sampling. So, the new policy has benefitted as we have early discharge of 2-3 days as per the revised rules,” said an official from the health department. As a result of more discharges, the three L1 hospitals of ESIC Sahibabad (76 beds), Divyajyoti Hospital (350 beds) in Niwari and SRM College (350 beds) in Modinagar had only 54, 12 and 78 active cases, respectively, till Monday morning. The three hospitals at present have a combined discharge rate of about 80.76%, with total discharge of 1,404 patients out of the 1,715 admitted so far. The Divyajyoti and SRM Hospitals were opened only about a month ago. Prior to these, the CHC at Muradnagar and St Joseph Hospital at Nandgram were also admitting L1 patients, but were subsequently closed down. According to official figures, the three operational hospitals have referred a total of 176 patients to L2 and L3 hospitals so far. As a result of the revised discharge policy in place, the Ghaziabad officials in past five days (July 22 to July 26) have discharged 843 patients overall. The government’s nod for home isolation policy has also impacted in freeing up L1 Covid beds, as asymptomatic patients can now stay at home without having to get mandatorily admitted to L1 Covid hospitals. “The home isolation is slowly picking up. During the last three days we received about 99 requests from patients for home isolation and our response teams got in touch with them to ascertain their condition and also check the norms under which they can be home isolated. So far, we have about 81 asymptomatic patients who were found eligible for home isolation while the rest of the applications are getting processed,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The list of 81 patients in home isolation include 18 under jurisdiction of Kavi Nagar police station area, 15 under Sihani Gate, nine each under Indirapuram and Kushambi police stations, 11 under Sahibabad and seven under Kotwali police station area, among others. After the two new rules were brought in, the district’s rate has shot up to an all time high of 78.43% out of 4619 total cases till July 26. The rate stood at 76.39% till May 31 (total 305 cases) and dropped to 45.69% till June 30 (1,615 total cases). At present, Ghaziabad district has 932 active cases (till July 26), a majority of which are in city areas. According to the records of the health department, the residential segment of Raj Nagar — comprising colonies like Raj Nagar, Sanjay Nagar, New Friends Colony, Govindpuram, Kamla Nehru Nagar, Panchsheel Primrose, Guldhar and Bhatta Number 5 — contain in them the highest number — 109 — of active cases till July 26. The second highest number of active cases, 93, are under the residential segment of Karhera-2, which has localities like Indirapuram, Kanwani and Makanpur. The Sahibabad-2 segment is at third spot in terms and has total of 76 active cases till July 26. The segment includes colonies like Raj Bagh, Shalimar Garden, Shyam Park, Rajendra Nagar, Lajpat Nagar and Shalimar Garden Extension etc. “With active cases now on the decline, we do not need to open more L1 hospitals but we will continue for some more time with the existing L1 category hospitals. The ESIC Hospital is on way to getting converted to an L2 category hospital,” Pandey added. ”If we need to open more L1 hospitals, we have several facilities having total of 800 L1 beds which can be opened up in a day,” he added. Box1: ESIC Hospital at Sahibabad: Total patients: 645; Discharged: 521 ; Referred: 70; Active cases: 54 Divyajyoti Hospital at Niwari: Total patients: 623; Discharged: 570; Referred: 41; Active cases: 12 SRM College at Modinagar: Total patients: 447; Discharged: 313; Referred: 56; Active cases: 78 Box2: Top three residential segments having highest active cases 1.

The survey was conducted after the ministry of human resource development on July 17 directed education secretaries of all states and UTs to gather feedback from parents on when would they want the schools to reopen and what changes they expect to be introduced. About 1.53 lakh respondents from all 22 Haryana districts took part in the online survey between July 19 and July 21, 30.1% of whom wanted schools to be reopened in the current scenario. While 57.1% said the schools should remain closed, remaining 12.8% were of the view that schools should be open partially. According to the survey, 35.9% of the respondents were students, 34.8% parents, 23% teachers and 6.3% government and private school organisers, officials from the education department and others. 50.1% of the respondents belonged to urban areas and 49.9% were from rural areas of Haryana. About 39% respondents wanted schools to be opened for Classes 10 and 12 in August, 15% in September, 14.7% in October and 31.1% sought more time. While 17.3% of the respondents said Classes 6 to 8 should be resumed in August, 14.5% wanted it to happen in September, 18.6% in October and 49.7% opted for a later period. For primary classes, 11.4% of respondents wanted schools to be reopened in August, 9.1% in September, 14.9% in October and 64.5% post-October. Meanwhile, 10.3% of the respondents showed willingness towards resumption of classes for nursery and kindergarten students in August, 6.2% in September, 10.7% in October and 72.8% later. Schools in Haryana are shut since the lockdown came into effect in the last week of March. Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal Gurjar said most of the parents, whose children studied in government schools, agreed upon reopening of schools. “It’s easier to ensure compliance with social distancing norms in government schools of rural areas. It’s harder in the urban areas as children opt for buses, vans and auto-rickshaws as their means of transport.

27-07-2020||Mumbai||RTE quota students can’t seek transfer to unaided schools: HC||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday held that students admitted under the 25℅ quota under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education or Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009 cannot seek transfer to some unaided school as a matter of right, and dismissed petition filed by parents of 23 students from Nagpur seeking admission to an unaided school.The bench of justice RK Deshpande and justice Anil Kilor said section 5 of the RTE Act confers a right on children to seek transfer to some other school, if they are not able to complete elementary education in their existing school for whatever reason. The right, however, comes with a rider that the school where transfer is sought should not be a special school or an unaided school not receiving any grant to meet its expenses from the government or the local authority, the bench added.It dismissed the petition noting that the school, where the parents sought admission for their wards in fifth standard, was an unaided school, and therefore the petitioners could not seek transfer to the school as a matter of right.The parents had moved HC after the school where their children are enrolled shut down from the academic year 2020-21. They had invoked provisions of the RTE Act to secure admissions for their wards in a school run by JK Education Society at Koradi in Nagpur.It was argued on their behalf that the children had cleared Class 4 from a school run by JK Education Society, and therefore in natural course they should be admitted in the school at Koradi. They also argued that denial of admission to the Koradi school was in breach of the right of children under RTE Act.The education society, however, maintained that the closed down school and the school at Koradi were legally different entities though run by the same management, and since the school at Koradi was unaided, the wards of the petitioners could not be admitted there.HC accepted the argument advanced on behalf of the management and dismissed the petitions also in view of the fact that the education officer had given 25 different options to the petitioners for admitting their wards in Class 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rte-quota-students-can-t-seek-transfer-to-unaided-schools-hc/story-dnkh0F0Py146FRi1LCCYyH.html

The baby was later handed over to Shil-Daighar police due to jurisdiction and an investigation was initiated. The baby is said to be healthy and have been sent to a children’s home in Vashi.Assistant police commissioner of Dombivli region RD More said, “The baby girl was found crying in mudflats near the creek at Riverwood Park, Desai Gao, Shilphata. Manpada police officers immediately searched nearby areas to find out who all were pregnant. During the search, we found a 15-year-old girl who said it was her baby.”According to officers, the girl was in a relationship with Roshan Chaudhary, 25, who got her pregnant. Manpada police officers said, “We have registered a case against the accused and arrested him for rape under sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. As their relationship and the crime took place in our jurisdiction, we have registered the case.”Shil-Daighar police, who filed a separate case for abandonment of the baby, are yet to arrest the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/25-year-old-arrested-for-rape-a-week-after-one-day-old-baby-found-in-creek/story-z6knWAT9m0cF7cmK1wxugL.html

Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in Bandra on June 14. State home minister Anil Deshmukh had, tweeted on June 15, the police were investigating “clinical depression owing to professional rivalry”.According to Bandra police officials, Bhatt was called to the Santacruz police station, and questioned for close to two-and-a-half hours. On Sunday, Deshmukh had said that Bhatt would be questioned in the case. Before Bhatt, police had called filmmaker and chairman of Yash Raj Films Aditya Chopra at Versova police station to record his statement. Police have recorded statements of 45 people, including Rajput’s cook, Neeraj Singh, house help Keshav Bachner, manager Deepesh Sawant, creative manager Siddharth Ramnathmurti Pithani, sisters Neetu and Meetu Singh, father KK Singh, television actor Mahesh Shetty, casting director Mukesh Chhabra, business manager Shruti Modi, PR manager Ankita Tehlani, actor Rhea Chakraborty, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, employees of Yash Raj Films, among others.Deshmukh had last week said there was no need for a CBI probe into the case.

27-07-2020||City||DU mock test: Fewer glitches but students not convinced||New Delhi:  The second mock open-book examination (OBE) conducted by Delhi University for its final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students on Monday faced fewer glitches than the first one conducted by the university on July 4, students and teachers said. Concerns over the feasibility of the university’s first-ever open-book exams are, however, far from over.Naman Biyani, a final-year undergraduate student from Shri Ram College of Commerce, said, “Though there were fewer glitches this time, it can be attributed to fewer students taking the test. Additionally, there is a course-wise timetable for students to appear for the mock tests in different slots. Server load today was distributed slot-wise but that won’t happen in our exams so we don’t really know how it might work out.”Despite calls and messages, Dean (Exams) Vinay Gupta was unavailable for a comment.“There can be several reasons behind the glitches such as internet connectivity, file format, or poor speed. However, students will get multiple chances to upload the documents,” said a senior DU official, requesting anonymity. The university had on July 15 announced that it would conduct the first phase of mock tests, beginning Monday, in three sessions on all three days according to a course-wise timetable.This was after the first mock OBE, conducted on July 4, was marred by several glitches such as trouble uploading or downloading documents and server error on the website.Saloni Singh of Gargi College,  who faced issues with the timer, which did not show the correct stipulated time of three hours on Monday, said, “The question paper was simple and generic. While we understand that this mock exam was to test the upload and download facilities, it would have benefitted more if we had actual sample question papers. The real mock test will be conducted only a week before the final exams, leaving us with little time to practice writing answers for a completely new pattern of the question paper.”Between August 1 and 4, the university is set to hold another round of mock exams based on “real-time and single paper of each program of the final semester or year.” The open book exams are scheduled for August 10-31.Students said that since Monday’s test was conducted more than three weeks after the July 4 practice exams, the portal could have been more functional by providing sample question papers instead of generic questions.Charu Sharma, a final-year student at Rajdhani College, was among those students. “I faced errors in downloading the question paper and later I couldn’t upload my answer sheets despite rebooting my phone several times. I had to give my login ID password to my friend who stays in another part of the city to upload the PDF file from my account. This won’t be possible during the final exams. Though the varsity has made arrangements at respective colleges, how can I take the risk of travelling in public transport during a pandemic?” she asked. The Rama Vihar resident, whose college is nearly 20 km from her home, said the university’s proposal to conduct offline exams later gives an undue advantage to those students who have internet facilities and can hence appear for OBE in August.The Delhi University Teachers Association, which has been demanding scrapping of the exams, said several students faced similar problems during Monday’s tests. DUTA treasurer Abha Dev Habib, who teaches at Miranda House, said, “We haven’t seen as many complaints [as July 4 mock test]. This might be because students have been demoralised as they have been writing letters to various agencies and approached courts since May. Along with Covid-19, floods in Bihar and Assam are also an issue for students from that region. It is unfortunate that the focus is now on exams instead of teaching-learning during a pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-mock-test-fewer-glitches-but-students-not-convinced/story-uaSOQdwk9XlXzMM6zj3NxL.html

Thackeray also launched Kharghar Heaven Hills project which comprises villas, resort, a naturopathy centre, etc. spread across a 250-acre plot.Cidco’s Kharghar Heaven Hills project will be designed by keeping nearly 39% open space and is expected to attract foreign visitors as it is around 20 minutes from the proposed Navi Mumbai international airport, a note from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said.The state government, through Cidco, is also planning a corporate park in Navi Mumbai on a 350-acre plot, which will also have a football stadium.The housing scheme for police personnel will be available for applicants in the economically weaker section (EWS) and lower income group (LIG). The houses will be built in Taloja, Kharghar, Kalamboli, Ghansoli and Dronagiri areas of Navi Mumbai and will be reserved for police personnel stationed in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).Thackeray also oversaw the distribution of allotment letters to over 3,600 families who have successfully got affordable homes in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai. “This is an unexpected gift for me that common people are getting the homes of their dreams on my birthday.

27-07-2020||Chandigarh||HC upholds promotion of nearly 30 Haryana Police inspectors||The Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld the promotion orders of 30 odd inspectors from the post of sub-inspectors, effected by the government in 2009. The petition challenging these promotions initially came in 2009, when some direct recruit sub-inspectors (SIs) challenged promotions of their colleagues to the post of inspectors from amongst those who got promoted from assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) posts.They rued that though they were appointed as SI prior to the respondents and are senior to them on the basis of length of service, they have been ignored while making promotions to the posts of inspector. The high court found that promotion rules lay down eight-year experience, out of which five years have to be as SI. But it does not mandate that the rest of three-year service has to be on the same post. Hence, those who got promoted from the rank of ASI can be considered for promotion on completion of five years of service as SI.“The discharge of this sovereign function of the state requires different capabilities, training and skill which certainly is acquired over a period of time. The legislature in its wisdom has prescribed possession of eight years experience as upper subordinate for acquiring eligibility for promotion to the higher post of inspector, considering the specific requirements for the post and the same cannot be substituted by the court with its own view,” it said, while dismissing the plea.It added that the law abhors mini-classifications on any preferential treatment on the basis of higher education or experience keeping into consideration the administrative efficiency and other relevant circumstances.In these proceedings, the high court had recently stayed the government’s move to consider the names of inspectors for the promotion as deputy superintendent of police (DSP) due to this dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-upholds-promotion-of-nearly-30-haryana-police-inspectors/story-OIxwzgNy1J4GdSSBgiNR6L.html
27-07-2020||Chandigarh||Serological survey begins in a week to measure immunity level in state||With per day case count increasing rapidly in Punjab for the past two weeks, the state health authorities have decided to conduct ‘serological survey’ to check exposure of people of the state to the disease and the level of immunity they may have developed.Serological survey helps in measuring the exposure of a community to a disease (Covid-19 in this case) and detecting how many individuals developed antibodies to fight the virus after getting infected. A similar survey that covered 21,387 people in Delhi recently pointed to exposure of nearly 25% of the population to the virus already.As per the plan, Punjab will cover more people as compared to Delhi to make the survey widespread and more accurate.As per state’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, arrangements are being made to start a rapid sero survey in a week’s time.“Special kits are being procured to carry out the tests for the survey as per the ICMR guidelines. The outcome of this survey will prove helpful in policy making to tackle the virus by getting an idea about herd immunity,” said the nodal officer.As per health experts, herd immunity is a stage of a pandemic when people get protected from the infection because majority of those around them have already developed immunity against the infection.As most of the patients hit by the virus remain asymptomatic, experts feel, in absence of testing, the virus may have already contracted many more without making any changes in their health because they have strong immunity.As per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR’s) guidelines sent to states to conduct these surveys, the tests for the sero survey are conducted through an enzyme linked assay (EIA) using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) testing kits.The ICMR has already permitted sampling of patients who are ailing from other diseases, individuals in containment zones, essential services providers, migrants, prisoners and people living in compact slums for the sero survey.As per the nodal officer, in a previous such survey in the state in May recorded mere 0.34% positive cases.Jalandhar lab to conduct antibody testThe health department has already permitted a private lab in Jalandhar to conduct antibody ELISA test. However, the testing has been stopped for time being because of confusion over outcome of the tests.“When this antibody testing shows positive, it means that a particular person has already been exposed to the virus. However, due to lack of knowledge on the issue, in some instances, the subjects were marked as Covid positive because their antibody tests came out to be positive. Because of this, we stopped the testing for the time being to avoid unnecessary confusion,” state’s nodal officer said.HERD RESISTANCE A similar survey in Delhi covering 21,387 random individuals recently pointed to 25% of them having developed antibodies against the virus; Punjab has plan for a bigger survey||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/serological-survey-begins-in-a-week-to-measure-immunity-level-in-state/story-Z99w5NRWYDPn8Q8UP4fJBP.html
27-07-2020||Delhi||Monday madness on city roads as road repairs hamper traffic||Commuters were stuck in serpentine traffic snarls in central Delhi on Monday. Delhi traffic police said that the repair work on a portion of Bhairon Marg that had caved in, along with the construction of an underpass from Nizamuddin railway bridge to Ashram intersection on Mathura Road, resulted in vehicles crawling at snail’s pace especially during the peak hours of morning and evening.On July 22, a portion of central Delhi’s Bhairon Marg had caved in after a heavy downpour. The traffic police said that the Public Works Department (PWD) is yet to complete the repair work, which is adding to traffic jams in the area.“The area was already a mess due to PWD’s work on an integrated project around Pragati Maidan. With the cave-in, traffic management has become a bigger problem, especially with the high volume of vehicles here,” said a senior traffic police officer.A senior PWD official said that the repair work at Bhairon Marg was completed late Monday night and traffic would be normalised on the stretch from Tuesday.“We have placed crash barriers along the affected area, so that such an incident would not reoccur even if it rains in the coming days,” the official said.The traffic was also made worse by the ongoing construction of a 750-metre underpass connecting Nizamuddin railway bridge and the Ashram intersection. The department has already put a traffic diversion plan in place to accommodate the increased load, but the unforeseen increase due to the Bhairon Marg cave-in led to spillovers.Sumer Ahluwalia, a resident of Sukhdev Vihar, said that it took her an hour to reach her client’s office in Connaught Place. The journey usually takes 30 minutes in the morning.“There are several traffic diversions and I am sure if I had walked instead, I would have reached earlier,” said Ahluwalia.Along with areas around Pragati Maidan, IP Estate, Meerut Expressway, Barapullah flyover, DND Flyway, Noida Link Road, Vikas Marg, ITO crossing, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg, Minto Road, the Connaught Place roundabout and India Gate roundabout were also clogged.Traffic snarls were also witnessed in east Delhi. Alerts from the traffic police stated that there was heavy traffic from Surya Nagar to Dilshad Garden because of the underpass repair work near Surya Nagar.“Traffic to remain heavy in the carriageway from Surya Nagar towards Dilshad Garden due to ongoing repair work of underpass by DJB and PWD. Motorists are advised to use flyover while going towards Dilshad Garden,” an alert issued by the Delhi traffic police at 1pm on Monday read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/monday-madness-on-city-roads-as-road-repairs-hamper-traffic/story-YTAqPnloq0BjBqUeeR6bbP.html
27-07-2020||City||Immigration racket busted, Bangladeshi national held||New Delhi: The tenant and servant verification drive being carried out by Delhi Police in view of the approaching Independence Day celebrations has led to the busting of an immigration (‘kabootarbaazi’) racket being run by an alleged Bangladeshi national living illegally in India, police said on Monday.Apart from the Bangladeshi citizen, the police have arrested two men from Haryana who were a part of the racket. The gang used to illegally send people to European countries and Canada with forged passports. They mostly targeted job-seeking people from Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Nepal. Eight passports of three different countries, fake Aadhaar cards and other incriminating documents were recovered from them, deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said.DCP Purohit said a drive was launched recently to verify tenants living in the west district. On July 23, a joint team of the Rajouri Garden police station and Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) was carrying out a raid in Subhash Nagar.During the drive, the police found a 37-year-old Bangladeshi national, Mohammad Raqibul Hasan, living in rented accommodation and in possession of a fake Aadhaar Card. His original Bangladeshi passport was seized. A case was registered against Hasan after it was found he had come to India in 2018 on a tourist visa that expired in November the same year but continued staying illegally in the country. Hasan was arrested, he said.Purohit said the antecedents of the arrested Bangladeshi was verified and it transpired he was part of an organised syndicate involved in trafficking of people primarily from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal. “Hasan’s interrogation led to the arrest of his two associates, Ankit Kumar,20, and Rajesh,26, both from Haryana,” the DCP said.A senior police officer said the gang used to charge between R10 and R15 lakh from each person who aspired to be sent to Canada or European countries. “The gang members used to prepare fake passports, visa and other required documents. They claimed to have sent many people to these countries using forged documents. We are verifying it,” said the officer.“Hasan said his associates import security press grade paper from Thailand and Malaysia and made fake visa at their set-up in Kolkata, West Bengal. These facts are being verified and investigation is on,” the DCP said.Of the eight fake passports seized from the arrested persons, three are of Nepali citizens and one of a Bangladeshi nationals. The remaining are of Indian citizens, the police said.Senior police officers said verification of nearly eight thousand tenants and servants are being done every day as part of the verification drive. Officials said data on the number of verifications is being compiled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/immigration-racket-busted-bangladeshi-national-held/story-pJt71u3AaIX1JaCsZpVf5H.html
27-07-2020||City||High court restrains cops from circulating info on Pinjra Tod member till trial begins||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Monday restrained police from circulating information on allegations against Devangana Kalita, a member of Pinjra Tod and an accused in the north-east Delhi riots, till trial begins, while stating “human dignity is a constitutional value and any action that unnecessarily denudes a person of his dignity would have a debilitating effect on the rights guaranteed under the Indian Constitution”. Kalita, a PhD student from JNU, through her counsel Adit S Pujari, sought directions to stop police from making selective media leaks while contending it would prejudice to the rights of a free and fair trial due to such acts. She has been arrested in four cases related to the communal riots in north-east Delhi in February this year and has been charged with the stringent UAPA for her alleged role in hatching a conspiracy, along with other accused. The violence claimed 53 lives and left several others injured. Justice Vibhu Bakhru on Monday said the police authorities “are not the adjudicators of guilt or innocence of any person” and it cannot pronounce on the guilt or innocence of any person. It refused to accept the contention of police that the media note was issued in view of the campaign being run on social media and said the reason is “not persuasive”. Deciding the matter, the court said “it is not necessary to name accused in media reports”. Citing the rules laid down by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the court restrained the police to publish anything with respect to Kalita. “The cases concerning communal riots are undoubtedly sensitive cases. This court is informed that FIRs filed in such cases are not being publicly disclosed. In the circumstances, this court considers it apposite to direct the respondent (city police) not to issue any further communication naming any accused or any witness till the charges, if any, are framed and the trial is commenced,” the judge said in a 33-page judgment. The court, however, refused to set aside the media note in question and said there was nothing incriminating in it. “The question whether media reporting or disclosing of information by the investigation agency has the propensity to prejudicially affect fair trial would depend on the facts of each case...Concededly, there cannot be any blanket order proscribing city police Delhi Police from disclosing any information regarding pending cases,” the court said. The single-judge bench said selective disclosure of information calculated to sway the public opinion to believe that an accused is guilty of the alleged offence; to use electronic or other media to run a campaign to besmirch the reputation or credibility of the person concerned; and to make questionable claims of solving cases and apprehending the guilty while the investigations are at a nascent stage, would clearly be impermissible. “This is not only because such actions may prejudicially affect a fair trial but also because it may, in some cases, have the effect of stripping the person involved of his/her dignity or subjecting him/or her to avoidable ignominy. It is trite that “the right to live includes the right to live with human dignity”. The Delhi Police refused to comment on the developments, citing the Delhi High Court’s order in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-court-restrains-cops-from-circulating-info-on-pinjra-tod-member-till-trial-begins/story-NxO4cPF4jjNN0WV9Ydb7PJ.html
27-07-2020||City||Delhi riots: Court rejects Tahir Hussain’s plea against police report||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Monday dismissed a plea by Tahir Hussain, arrested for his alleged role in the north-east Delhi riots, who had sought court’s help in taking action against police officials for filing “false, fabricated and manipulated report” about number of FIRs pending against him. Chief metropolitan Magistrate Purshottam Pathak rejected the plea stating that there was no merit in the application. During the hearing, advocate Javed Ali, appearing for Hussain, told the court that initially, Hussain had filed an application in March, seeking necessary directions to the police to provide copies of FIRs in which he has been alleged to have been booked along with the status report. The police had informed in its report filed before the court on March 19, that Hussain was booked under five cases, said Ali. Thereafter he was arrested in another FIR which was registered in February but the details were not provided in their March 19 report, Hussain’s lawyer further said, adding that this created doubt and showed that the sixth FIR was “ante dated, forged and fabricated” or the report dated March 19 was “manipulated”. Police told the court that there was absolutely no intent to furnish wrong information before the court as alleged and the Station House Officer may have inadvertently missed out on mentioning the sixth FIR. The court noted that “non-disclosure of accused in the sixth FIR was not deliberate and there was no point assuming that the DCP-North East and DCP-Crime/SHO concerned have deliberately withheld the information and that too for causing any harm to Hussain... It seems that not providing the information is a bonafide mistake on the part of investigating agency”. Police have arrested Hussain for his alleged role in instigating the riots in north-east Delhi. Police have said that Hussain was one of the main conspirators, a charge his lawyers denied in court while calling it a political conspiracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-court-rejects-tahir-hussain-s-plea-against-police-report/story-mETN5H4GmeDX4AlfdGa6wN.html
27-07-2020||City||Multani disappearance case: Two former Chandigarh cops booked for fabricating evidence||Mohali: The Kharar police on Monday registered a case against two retired inspectors of Chandigarh police — Anokh Singh and Jagir Singh — for fabricating evidence in the Multani disappearance case. The move comes after the said cops had filed a complaint with director generals of police (DGPs) of Punjab and Chandigarh on July 9 against dismissed Punjab Police cop Gurmeet Singh “Pinki”, alleging that they were lured by Pinki to give statement against former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in the 32-year-old disappearance case of CITCO employee Balwant Singh Multani. The cops were booked under Section 195-A (fabricating evidence) on the complaint of Kharar (Sadar) station house officer, Sukhvir Singh. A senior police officer of Mohali, who wished not be named confirmed the development. On July 9, the two cops in their complaint cited audio recordings to prove that they were lured by dismissed Punjab Police cop Gurmeet Singh “Pinki” at the behest of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s political adviser Bharat Inder Singh Chahal to give statement against Saini. In their complaint, Anokh and Jagir claimed that they were invited by Pinki to his farmhouse near Landran on June 3 and 6 where he offered to appoint their children as sub-inspectors in Punjab Police with the help of Chahal. Pinki, a dismissed inspector of Punjab Police who was once close to Saini, is the second witness in the case registered at the Mataur police station in Mohali on May 6. IN an interview to a private TV channel in 2015 he claimed that he had seen Saini torturing Multani, which also finds a mention in the FIR registered against the ex-DGP and eight retired officials of Chandigarh Police. The case pertains to kidnapping of Multani, son of an ex-IAS officer, who was allegedly tortured in police custody before he allegedly escaped from the custody of Qadian police. Chandigarh Police reportedly had picked Multani after a terrorist attack on Saini in 1991 when he was the Chandigarh SSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/multani-disappearance-case-two-former-chandigarh-cops-booked-for-fabricating-evidence/story-1TpaikLbYLqNkAJaJwOsbJ.html

27-07-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana private schools to charge fees on Punjab lines||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday disposed of a clutch of petitions on Haryana schools’ fee issue, ordering that schools will charge fees on the lines of their Punjab counterparts. It was on June 30 that the high court (HC) had allowed private schools in Punjab to collect tuition fees even for the period during which the state was under lockdown. The schools were also permitted to collect admission fees. The Haryana government’s series of notifications put out in the view of Covid-19 outbreak, which restrained schools from collection of fees and other funds besides increasing fees, have been challenged in different petitions before the HC since May. The HC bench of Justice Ramendra Jain on Monday said all these petitions have been disposed of in terms of the order passed by a coordinate bench in the Punjab’s case, government as well as petitioners’ lawyers said.A detailed order from the court is yet to be released.In Punjab’s case, the HC had restrained schools from increasing the fee for the year 2020-21 and the schools were also barred from depriving students of attending school and online classes if the fee was not paid. Parents facing hardships were told to approach school, which can decide the application. In case of dissatisfaction with schools’ decision, parents can approach the fee regulatory body. The schools too, which are facing financial hardships, were told to approach district education officer along with the relevant proofs. The school managements were told to work out the actual expenditure incurred under the annual charges for the period the school remained closed and recover only such expenditure incurred by them, including actual transport charges and actual building charges. These charges can’t be recovered for the period for any activity or facility towards which no expenditure is incurred. The HC order in Punjab’s case was subsequently challenged by the state government and parents, and is pending before a division bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-private-schools-to-charge-fees-on-punjab-lines/story-tJxbV1JaIP9yv7vCAfZ3BL.html

27-07-2020||Mumbai||City, suburbs record over 100mm rainfall||The city and suburbs witnessed continuous intense rain spells with loud claps of thunder between Sunday night and Monday morning.The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 100.7 mm (heavy rain) between 8.30am Sunday and 8.30am Monday, of which 94.3 mm was recorded between 11.30pm Sunday and 8.30am Monday. Through the day, on Monday (8.30am to 5.30pm), rain intensity reduced with 16mm rain.Heavy overnight rain led to waterlogging, especially across south-central Mumbai and isolated areas in the suburbs. Location-wise maximum rain over 24-hours was recorded across Santacruz, followed by Dadar at 89.4mm, Worli 86.4mm, Vidyavihar 70.8mm, and Navi Mumbai 52.8mm.The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 60.4mm rain between 8.30am Sunday and 8.30am Monday, of which 54.6mm was recorded between 11.30pm Sunday and 8.30am Monday. However, intense rain spells were recorded on Monday morning with 50.8mm rain within a span of nine hours (8.30am to 5.30pm).Mumbai suburbs have so far recorded 82% of its seasonal average rain, while south Mumbai recorded 77.4% of its seasonal target between June 1 to July 27, 5.30pm. However, major lakes located in Thane and Nashik supplying water to Mumbai recorded 1mm rain each, over the past 24 hours, while both Tulsi and Vihar recorded 15mm rain each. Only 32% of the required water stock for Mumbai has been achieved from June 1 to July 27. It was 70% by this time last year. The weather bureau had not issued a heavy rain alert for Sunday night or Monday and only revised its forecast on Monday morning. “Owing to a cloud patch over the Arabian Sea extending over Mumbai and surrounding areas, intense showers were recorded more over the suburbs than south Mumbai, and by early morning extended towards southern parts of the city. These cloud patches are highly localised due to the influence of westerly winds during monsoon, and their intensity is not easily detectable. However, Nowcast and impact-based warnings were issued on early Monday morning itself,” said a senior India Meteorological Department official.While a yellow alert was issued for the rest of the day on Monday afternoon, the impact-based warning issued at 7.30am, hours after intense rain had already begun, said that intense convective clouds had the potential to cause intense rain spells to the tune of 30-50mm per hour over three hours. The impact expected was localised flooding and traffic may need to be regulated.Meanwhile, persistent showers allowed a drop in maximum temperatures on Monday falling below the normal mark. South Mumbai recorded 28 degrees Celsius, almost 2 degrees Celsius below normal while the suburbs recorded 29.7 degrees Celsius, 0.4 degree Celsius below normal.With intermittent sunshine on Monday afternoon and early evening, the weather bureau has predicted light to moderate rain for the city and suburbs for Tuesday to Friday. The weather bureau had revised its forecast thrice last week for heavy rain expected on Saturday but it remained a miss. AUGUST FIRST WEEK MAY BE A HEAVY RAIN PERIODThe Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) on Monday said with the formation of a weather system over the Bay of Bengal, an increase in rain intensity is expected around August 4-5 onwards for the west coast, including Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-suburbs-record-over-100mm-rainfall/story-byvOWVVgFrWXRp5or3pv8N.html
27-07-2020||City||14-year-old raped, bludgeoned to death||Raigad police on Monday arrested a labourer for raping and killing a 14-year-old girl in Roha. The accused, in his early twenties, took her near the valley, where he allegedly bludgeoned her with a stone and then raped her.According to police, the victim was a resident of Tamdi village. On Sunday, at around 5.45 pm, the girl’s father, 40, who works in the village panchayat, sent her to Tamshet, around three kilometres away, to fetch her grandfather.The accused who was walking towards Tamshet, asked the victim for a lift on her scooter. The victim however declined. “The accused is a labourer from Tamshet village. He knew the girl, but it is not yet clear if she knew him. There was an argument between the two when she refused to give him the lift. He then attacked her,” said Anil Paraskar, Raigad superintendent of police.“He attacked her and dragged her by her hair into the valley, around 200 to 250 feet deep. There, he repeatedly hit her on the head with a stone and after she was defenceless, he raped her,” said another senior officer.He left her body on a large boulder in the bushes and fled. After the girl did not return home, the local villagers formed a search team. Around 9.30pm, they found a scooter on the side of the road, but found no sign of the girl. They then went deep into the valley where they found her body on the boulder.“We found at least two impact wounds on her head,” said Kirankumar Suryawanshi, deputy superintendent of police, Roha.The police had formed eight teams to crack the case. The police got their lead when they suspected the role of a villager from Tamshet. The only residential area ahead of the route is Tamshet village and it was unlikely for someone with no knowledge of the route to be involved.“Following inquiry, we arrested the accused within 12 hours from his house. He has confessed to the crime. It appears he committed the crime alone, but we are still investigating to find out if a second person was involved,” said Sachin Gunjal, additional superintendent, Raigad.The girl’s body was sent to JJ Hospital in Mumbai for an autopsy. The accused was arrested from his house on Monday morning. He will be produced before a local court on Tuesday. He has a six-month-old daughter.The police are also probing if the rape and murder was a targeted attack, but no concrete leads have been found to support that, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/14-year-old-raped-bludgeoned-to-death/story-eorr77DBbfeeczHvFwlJxL.html
27-07-2020||Mumbai||SC to hold hearing on Maratha reservation on September 1||The Supreme Court on Monday posted the next hearing on the petitions challenging the validity of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) that grants 16% reservation to the Maratha community on September 1. The three-judge bench will also be holding another hearing on August 25 on the plea that the matter should be heard by a five-judge bench.The apex court, however, refrained from granting an interim stay on reservation benefits to the postgraduate medical students in admission for this academic year. The state government told the court that they have already decided not to make any recruitments owing to the coronavirus outbreak. The erstwhile BJP-led state government had granted 16% reservation to the Maratha community by enacting the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, in government jobs and education, on November 2018.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who is representing the state, said that the state has already issued a government resolution to this effect on May 4. The statement was made when the apex court asked the state about the recruitment process.The three-judge bench led by Justice L Nageswara Rao heard a clutch of petitions, including one challenging reservation benefits to postgraduate medical students from the Maratha community for this academic year.The state government has recently supported the demand made by one of the petitioners Vinod Patil that matter be heard before the five-judge bench. “We are satisfied with the progress as the apex court has refused to grant a stay on admission on reservation benefits to postgraduate medical students from the Maratha community. The state government has already issued an order on May 4 directing over no recruitment will be made thus the court has given no stay on it as well,” said Ashok Chavan, PWD minister, who is heading cabinet sub-committee formed to review progress on legal matters on the reservation and take necessary decisions.“Though, a bit late the demand made by us on five-judge demand was supported by the state government. The court has agreed to take hearing on the plea on August 25,” Patil said.The erstwhile BJP-led state government had granted 16% reservation to the Maratha community by enacting the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, in government jobs and education, on November 2018. The Act was upheld by the Bombay high court in June 2019, but it said that the quantum of 16% was not justifiable, and should be reduced to 12%-13%, as recommended by the State Backward Classes Commission in its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sc-to-hold-hearing-on-maratha-reservation-on-september-1/story-MLBLlcEpt3osaSgQ2CXEyO.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said since steps taken by the city government were adequate, there was no further need to monitor a plea it had initiated itself on the management of helpline numbers and the increasing number of cases in the city. The court, while disposing of a plea, directed the Delhi government to ensure that the official orders and directions issued by it and the court with regard to real-time update of data of availability of beds and ventilators, and conducting tests, are followed by hospitals. It also directed that ambulance services for Covid and non-Covid patients and the helplines should continue to operate and the nodal officers appointed by the Delhi government in its hospitals should keep in mind the difficulties of the people. The court had initiated the public interest litigation (PIL) on the basis of a video clip of a man who had to run from pillar to post to get his mother hospitalised after she tested positive for Covid-19, and another similar petition filed by a private individual. Standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra and additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal told the court that the number of ambulances had been increased to 602 and the helplines augmented to reduce response time.

A copy of the letter has also been forwarded to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Punjab chief secretary, Vini Mahajan, deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma and president of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee Sunil Jakhar. In the letter, Kaur alleged that her husband Jarnail Singh Shimlapuri had even contacted Bharat Bhushan, mayor Balkar Sandhu and nodal officer of the area Varinder Pathak, but to no avail. Kaur stated that she had provided a list of 1,500 residents to the administration since lockdown was announced in the state, but “the administration has failed to deliver even a single kit, due to which the residents of the area are suffering”.“This lackadaisical approach would also taint the image of the Congress party in the south constituency. No kits were provided for my ward. Cabinet minister Ashu should look into the matter and the kits should be delivered at the earliest,” said Kaur.Nodal officer for distribution of ration kits in Ludhiana south constituency, Varinder Pathak said, “The department had received a demand from the deputy mayor and kits were also supplied in the past. However, the department receives limited kits and those have to be allocated to different wards. There is some pendency but the area of deputy mayor has not been ignored.”Local Congress leaders refute claimsLocal Congress leaders from south constituency including Sunil Shukla, Dr Deepak Mannan, Dinesh Rai, Harpal Singh Saini among others refuted the claims of Sarbjeet Kaur. A video went viral on social media on Monday wherein the leaders stated that ration has been distributed to over 1,500 families in ward number 35 due to the efforts of Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Ankit Bansal, officer on special duty (OSD) to CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-deputy-mayor-alleges-discrimination-in-relief-distribution-writes-to-cm/story-Q9zWS937XnEI3TvEcm8xxH.html

Exporters and officials of the agriculture department are optimistic that basmati will fetch a good prices with demand on exporting countries on the rise, as these want to stock up. Basmati has been transplanted on 2.6 lakh hectare this year and 2.2 lakh hectare in 2019.“Farmers hope to get remunerative prices this year as the exports to Iran, which is the largest importer of India’s branded and un-branded aromatic rice, are back on track after initially facing roadblocks as US had imposed trade sanctions,” said Kisan Sangharsh Committee (KSC)’s state convener Kawalpreet Singh Pannu.Last year, farmers had fetched between Rs 2,500 and 2,800 per quintal; most say, this year they expected between Rs 4,000 and Rs 5,000 per quintal.Agriculture department official claim they had encouraged farmers to increase the area under basmati, as the crop consumes lower water than under varieties. In Amritsar, the area under basmati has dipped 7% from 1.4 lakh hectare in 2019 to 1.3 lakh hectare this year. Besides Majha, the basmati varieties, 1121 and 1509, is also cultivated in some parts of Hoshiarpur, Muktsar and Fazilka. In Haryana, basmati is largely grown in Karnal and its adjoining districts. Punjab and Haryana collectively contribute to 75% of the exports to various countries including Iran, Saudi Arab, Iraq, Kuwait etc.Pannu added, “The government should fix the minimum support price (MSP) for the basmati to encourage farmers more. Without MSP, farmers have been fetching only between Rs 2,500 and Rs 2,600 per quintal. This does not even cover the cultivation expenses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/majha-farmers-up-area-under-basmati-by-20-in-hope-for-better-prices/story-bezvlS5rTDAdMMmlaTmvPK.html

27-07-2020||City||Demand for bringing all Sikhs, Hindus from Afghanistan||Chandigarh Religious bodies are demanding that all Sikhs and Hindu families living in Afghanistan be brought to India at the earliest. The reaction came a day after 11 members of the Sikh and Hindu minorities in Afghanistan, including a community leader who was recently abducted by terrorists, arrived in New Delhi on Sunday after the Indian embassy in Kabul facilitated their travel. “Why in small groups, bring all of them in one go,” said Gurpreet Singh, who heads Chandigarh-based Global Sikh Council. Nidan Singh Sachdeva, who was kidnapped from Paktia province last month and was released on July 18, was among part the 11 Afghan nationals who arrived in New Delhi on Sunday. As per data with the Indian authorities, there are at least 575 Sikhs and Hindus living in Afghanistan of which 350 have valid Afghan passports and majority of them have the Indian visa. Concerns among Afghanistan’s dwindling Sikh minority have increased after a terror attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul in March that left 25 people dead and many others injured. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State, though Indian and Afghan security officials believe the assault was planned and executed by Pakistan-based Haqqani Network and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). “Today I met the officers in the ministry of external affairs and have requested them to bring all of them (Sikhs and Hindus) to India. Those who don’t have passports, Indian consulate in Kabul should help them in procuring valid travel documents,” said Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa. In the next batch, 70 Sikhs and Hindus are expected to reach Delhi in the first week of August. Sirsa said he had offered the Indian government that DSGMC would pay for the travel expenses of all those coming from Afghanistan. “We will also provide them lodging and food during their initial days and gradually help them find work to earn a livelihood.” According to reports in the Afghan media, there were some 2.2 lakh Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Their numbers dwindled to 15,000 when the Taliban took control. Now, as per an estimate, the number of Sikh and Hindu population is less than 600.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/demand-for-bringing-all-sikhs-hindus-from-afghanistan/story-l7B6AHpPPmRuGwsyGOw9DL.html

The ‘bir’ was stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village gurdwara on June 1, 2015. An FIR was registered the next day at the Bajakhana police station. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of the ‘bir’ were found scattered in front of a gurdwara in the adjoining Bargari village, resulting in state-wide protests and the killing of two Sikh protesters in firing.On Monday, the court of duty magistrate Suresh Kumar allowed the bail applications of Nishan Singh and Ranjit Singh, alias, Bhola, both of Kotkapura; Baljit Singh of Sikhanwala village, Randeep Singh, alias Neela, and Narinder Sharma, both of Faridkot, and ordered their release. They were lodged in Bathinda jail under judicial custody.Dera followers’ counsel Vinod Monga argued that there was not even an iota of evidence to connect the accused with the alleged crime. He added that none of the accused was named in the FIR and investigation was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). District attorney Rajnish Goyal opposed the bail application of the accused on the grounds that arrest of other co-accused namely Harsh Dhuri, Sandeep Bareta and Pardeep Kler is pending. The court, however, allowed the bail applications. The court also stated in the order that as far as contentions of the defence counsel that parallel investigation with the investigation of the CBI by the SIT is wrong is concerned, the same shall be decided by the court on merits as a separate application in this regard is pending in court for August 3.The SIT, led by DIG Ranbir Singh Khatra, on July 4, had arrested seven dera followers in Faridkot district.

27-07-2020||City||With passengers scarce, transporters unwilling to ply buses||Jalandhar Even as the government order on allowing only limited passengers in buses, including minibuses, was lifted a month ago, the bus transport business is yet to get back on its feet. From the local bus stand, over 1,600 time slots operated to Delhi, Jammu, Haryana, Amritsar and others; the figure has now come down to 160. The primary reason remains low footfall of passengers due to covid-19, while increasing fuel prices are making it difficult for operators to manage expenses. Former minister Avtar Henry, owner of Kartar Buses, said he had not resumed services, amid the high rate of diesel and taxes. “Lack of passengers is another reason. Both the Centre and the state governments have ignored the plight of state transporters. We have requested the state government to waive toll tax and the bus stand fee to help us manage at least some expenses. Successive governments have taken no decision.”General manager roadways, depot-1 Navraj Batish said, “Buses are plying on major routes only. There are 160 routes including on 50 times, when private operators are plying buses per day. Minibus service is yet to resume, even as the government has granted them permission.”A private bus conductor Surinder Singh said passengers were scarce and this discouraged big transporters or operating at low capacity. Roadways bus stand inspector Shinderpal Singh, who looks after plying schedule, said, “Buses that are plying are facing huge losses due to the low occupancy.” He said after the two-month suspension, due to covid-19 pandemic, a fleet of around 150 Punjab roadways/PRTC was started on May 18, with even the restrictions on number of passengers lifted on June 28. He added that buses were now running on 55 main routes, such as Patiala, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Pathankot and others across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-passengers-scarce-transporters-unwilling-to-ply-buses/story-lhyfl2cqAxeRHXxcxWTNYL.html

27-07-2020||Chandigarh||Govt depriving poor of higher education: Bhagwant Mann||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s Punjab unit president MP Bhagwant Mann and state core committee chairman Principal Budhram on Monday said the policies and decisions of the state government led by Captain Amarinder Singh had deprived the poor and Dalit students of a chance to study in professional colleges and universities. They alleged that the successive SAD-BJP and Congress governments had a hidden agenda to target the poor and ‘Dalits’. Mann claimed that if those lording over the state and the Centre from time to time had been sensitive to the plight of the poor and ‘Dalits’, 25% enrolment would have been ensured for them in all private and government schools under the Right to Education Act and a large number of qualified and unemployed teachers would not have been left to take the road route to bag jobs. Principal Budhram alleged that Rs. 2,000 crore had been pending under the Centre’s Under-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme for Dalit Students for the past five years and had it been released, private colleges would not have to withheld the students’ degrees. He added that the government did not release a single penny under the scholarship scheme to any public or private institution in the state for the last three years, and thus ruined the careers of millions of students. This laid bare the “anti-Dalit face” of the Captain government, he said. Principal Budhram said if the government could offer a rebate of Rs 1,000 crore to liquor, sand and gravel traders under the guise of the pandemic, why couldn’t it refund the examination fee of over Rs 80 crore taken from government school students, even as their exams did not take place. Mann said that if the AAP succeeded in forming the government in 2022, it would strive to make education accessible to all and offer equal opportunities for higher education in Punjab, on the lines of the Kejriwal government in Delhi, by bringing changes in the existing setup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/govt-depriving-poor-of-higher-education-bhagwant-mann/story-1PeZJJfLyOQbJnDcEPFKxN.html

27-07-2020||City||Stop terrorising Sikh youths with UAPA: Akal Takht to govts||Slamming the central and state governments for arresting Sikh youths on charges of reviving terrorism, Akal Takht’s acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Monday said the use of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) to victimise Sikhs needs to stop.The statement came after Bholath MLA and Punjabi Ekta Party (PEP) chief Sukhpal Singh Khaira, along with rebel AAP legislators and families of the arrested youth, met the jathedar, seeking his intervention in the matter. They handed over a memorandum stating that it was a “well-designed conspiracy” by central agencies and Punjab police to implicate innocent Sikh/Dalit youths. The memorandum added that police are specifically targeting poor and innocent people, who are unable to raise their voice against such oppressive measures.The jathedar said, “The affected families shared their sorrows, which I found very tragic. The youths are being booked under UAPA and put behind bars without any reason or for minor offences. I think this is an attempt to create an atmosphere to terrorise Sikh youths. The youths may have committed some mistakes but it does not mean that their lives are completely ruined.”The head of the highest Sikh temporal seat added, “Today, Sikh youths are living in fear. We would like to ask the Centre and Punjab government to stop terrorising people. We have asked the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to help those booked under UAPA and provide them legal assistance.”“Most youths who were booked belong to poor Dalit families. They were breadwinners of their families. One of them has committed suicide. There must be an impartial judicial probe into the suicide. Besides, an overall judicial probe must also be conducted to verify if these youths deserved to be booked under UAPA,” he added.The memorandum also demanded that a monthly pension of Rs 5,000 should be provided to aggrieved families.‘Allow Sikhs stuck abroad to return their motherland’Speaking about Sikhs languishing in jails, the jathedar said, “During the 550th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak, the Centre had promised to release Sikh prisoners in various jails of the country. However, only a few prisoners were released. I urge the Centre to release the remaining Sikh prisoners too.”He further said, “Many Sikhs were booked on various charges when things were not good in Punjab, and they got stuck abroad. Such youths should be allowed to return to their motherland. They are not being allowed to return for the last 30-35 years. The cases registered against them should be quashed. They should be allowed to return to their country so that they can pay obeisance at Sri Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple) and Takht Sahiban (Sikh temporal seats) and be part of the celebrations of the 400th Parkash Utsav of 9th Sikh master Guru Teg Bahadar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stop-terrorising-sikh-youths-under-uapa-akal-takht-to-govts/story-3w2fUKuge0mTQ9OSxQ8TpL.html
27-07-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal govt asks for public opinion on reimposing lockdown; orchardists, industrialists not keen||With a spike in Covid-19 cases in the state, the Himachal Pradesh government has started an online poll to ask people whether lockdown should be reimposed. An online poll has been started on himachal.mygov.in in which government asked the people to vote for complete lockdown and weekend lockdown. People can vote on this portal till August 1, after which the state government will take further decision about the lockdown.So far, 86% people have voted in favour of complete lockdown while 14% people are against the decision. As many as 68% people have voted in favour of weekend lockdown while 32% people have voted against it.INDUSTRIALISTS, ORCHARDS NOT KEEN Orchardists and industrialists are not keen about the idea of a lockdown. They are concerned as their income depends on their sale of fruits and the apple season has just begun in the state. The apple season will continue through August, September, and October. Himachal fruit vegetables and flower growing association president Harish Chauhan said, “If lockdown is reimposed the apple economy will bear the brunt of it. The government should remember that apple contributes Rs 4,500 crore to the state economy and orchardists have no other source of income. Orchardists have already suffered huge losses due to heavy rain, hailstorms and the last lockdown.”He said ensuring the health and safety of people was also important and as such if the government decides to reimpose lockdown, fruit markets and apple transportation should be allowed. “The state government should make proper arrangements for apple growers or ask companies to come and purchase the produce directly from the orchardists at their doorstep,” he added.Puneet Rajta, an orchardist from Kotkhai, said, “Did the government seek public opinion when it allowed tourists to enter Himachal or when the CM promoted Himachal as a quarantine destination? What plans does the government have for apple growers and what will growers do now that the apple season has begun?” Himachal Pradesh Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has also requested the state government to follow a consultative approach and avoid halting industrial activities before announcing any lockdown.  Himachal CII chairperson Col Shailesh Pathak said industries in the state had suffered losses as industrial activities were permitted very late and that too with a lot of restrictions as compared to neighbouring states. “All stakeholders, including the industry, demonstrated a great sense of responsibility as well as camaraderie to combat Covid-19 in the state.” Industries are once again poised to suffer huge production-linked losses, which will have a ripple effect. Industrial activity has not been stopped in any part of the country where short duration lockdowns have been announced, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-govt-asks-for-public-opinion-on-reimposing-lockdown-orchardists-industrialists-not-keen/story-iaZIO2WV2otNyZn9zExoSP.html
27-07-2020||City||Himachal govt contemplating to open Sanskrit varsity: CM||The Himachal Pradesh government has accorded the status of second language to Sanskrit since it is rich in vocabulary, literature, thoughts and ideas, meanings and values, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said on Monday. He was presiding over the first meeting of Himachal Pradesh Sanskrit Academy through video conferencing.The CM said the state government is also contemplating to open a Sanskrit University for which land was being identified. He said Sanskrit scholars and Sanskrit Academy should come forward with suggestions to make this language accessible to common man so that students could be motivated to study it.The CM said Sanskrit, whatever be its antiquity, was more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than both of these. “Sanskrit was the oldest and most used language in the world. It is still taught in some schools in India and at a few places in the West,” he said. “With India playing an important part on the world stage, there has been a corresponding growth of interest in Sanskrit. In this era of unprecedented change and uncertainty, it can be a valuable tool to assess and look afresh at the society,” the CM said, adding that steps taken by the state government to popularise Sanskrit has been appreciated at various levels and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the decision to accord the status of second language to Sanskrit. He said efforts will be made to make Sanskrit more simple and practical to make it popular among the masses.State education minister and vice-chairman of Sanskrit Academy Suresh Bhardwaj said Himachal Pradesh is the second state after Uttarakhand to give Sanskrit the status of a second language. He said the state government will ensure that school children willing to opt for Sanskrit have adequate opportunities at various levels.CM launches home delivery of prasad of Chintpurni templeThe CM launched the ‘Online Prasad Chhinmastika Bhog’ of Chintpurni temple in Una district through video conferencing on Monday.He said the pandemic has forced the state government to close all temples and religious shrines to avoid social gathering and spread of virus. The CM said although most shrines were providing online ‘Darshan’ facility to the devotees but it was for the first time that the facility of providing ‘Prasad’ to the devotees has been launched with cooperation of the postal department.He appreciated the efforts of the Una administration for providing home delivery of ‘Prasad-Bhog’ to the devotees. He also thanked the Indian Postal Department for its cooperation in online home delivery of the ‘Prasad’. People will now be able to get ‘Prasad’ of this holy shrine at their door steps by applying online for ‘Darshan and Prasad’. He said with this, Himachal Pradesh is among the few states after Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board and Baba Kashi Vishwanath, Banaras, to have home delivery of ‘Prasad’.The CM said the state government is committed to develop Himachal as the best destination for religious tourism. “All major temples and shrines are being developed and maintained to attract devotees and religious tourists.

The artistes who in the pre-Covid world performed street plays with a strong political or social message have fallen on hard times.25-year-old Balwinder Changaliwala, who is associated with the People’s Theatre, Lehragaga led by Punjabi actor Samuel John, has sought work under the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). In the paddy season he had also undertaken grunt work in the fields. “We used to perform plays in villages and schools. Our plays had strong and pertinent messages for society. I found my job very rewarding. The flexible hours allowed me time to study,” says Balwinder, who is pursuing a master in arts degree in Punjabi at SUS Government College, Sunam.Satpal Bangan, who runs People’s Art, a Patiala-based theatre group of 10 -12 members, says that the lockdown and the Covid-19 pandemic had forced his team members to take up odd jobs despite being well-qualified. “Most of our members hold bachelor of education (BEd), teacher eligibility test, and master of philosophy (MPhil) degrees,” says Bangan. ARTISTES MENTAL HEALTH AFFECTED“Our group often performed in rural areas of Patiala, Sangrur, Mansa, Bathinda and Fatehgarh Sahib. We would also sell books during the event. However, we are struggling to stay afloat. Most of our team members, despite their degrees, are working as labourers, while one of them is selling vegetables. The Covid-19 crisis has not just affected our finances but has also taken a toll on our mental health,” he said. Actor and theatre artiste Samuel John says, “Street plays are directly linked to the people. However, when an artiste has to stay away from his audience, the gap affects performers psychologically.”“The Covid-19 pandemic has created a huge gap between the public and artistes. Sometimes the livelihood of performers depends on plays. The pandemic has affected artistes economically and psychologically,” said John.SOCIETY RISES TO ARTISTES AID Bangan said, “We used to perform an average three plays a day. When we fell on hard times, locals offered us wheat and money but it wasn’t enough to survive. These days I sell books online through social media.” Harwinder Diwana, who runs the Chetna Kala Kender Barnala theatre group, said members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union had held some gatherings in the past week where his team had performed. “Undoubtedly, some members of my team are going through a financial crisis. However, when an artiste works for the society, people come forward to help them. I, too, was offered help during the pandemic,” said Diwana.While the Punjab government has permitted shooting of films and music videos amid the Covid-19 crisis, with the caveat that they follow safety guidelines, those involved in producing street plays are waiting for the situation to improve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/street-theatre-hit-amid-ban-on-public-gatherings-artistes-take-up-odd-jobs-to-eke-out-a-living/story-YFb5oOgSX5YBuHIQi6ub6I.html
27-07-2020||Pune||Pune lockdown sees fall in vehicle theft cases||The number of vehicle thefts reported in Pune city as well as Pimpri-Chinchwad reduced in the first half of 2020. Officials attribute the decline in vehicle thefts to the lockdown necessitated to contain the spread of the Covid-19 infection.In Pune, the number of vehicle thefts has gone down by more than half as compared to the same period last year. A total of 397 cases were reported between January 1 and July 17 in the current year while during the same period last year, 1,011 cases were registered.Of the 397 cases, 92 were recorded in January, 100 in February and 60 in March, the number came down to 8 in April and 19 in May. As soon as the lockdown was lifted, the cases rose to 63 in June and 45 until July 17. In Pimpri-Chinchwad, the number of cases reduced by around half as compared to last year. A total of 357 cases of vehicle thefts were reported in the first six months this year in Pimpri-Chinchwad. During the corresponding months last year, 681 cases were reported.The reason for the reduced number can be attributed to the lockdown and preventive action taken by the police, according to officials of both the forces.“Vehicle thefts generally happen in public spaces like bus stops, railway stations and markets. Since these were shut, we witnessed reduced cases. Additionally, there were good detections by the police which led to reduced criminals on the streets,” said Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Pune.The security provided by secured parkings in societies and residential areas leads to reduced vehicle theft, he believes. “We have had good detections. Of course, lockdown is also one of the major reasons. But we have also taken enough preventive measures to ensure that the cases remain low,” said Sudhir Hiremath, deputy commissioner of police, Pimpri-Chinchwad police.The recorded cases of vehicle thefts have been reported from industrial as well as residential areas in Pimpri-Chinchwad.In Chakan, a company worker’s vehicle was stolen from near the gates of his workplace located in Mhalunge on July 23 while he was at work. It was a Bajaj Pulsar worth Rs 45,000.A worker at a company in Nighoj used his Splendor motorbike worth Rs 7,000 to come to the bus stop in Sagurdi, located 75-80km away, to board the company bus. When he got back from work, the motorbike was missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-lockdown-sees-fall-in-vehicle-theft-cases/story-pbkAxn1GOzXns0GP30iO7K.html
27-07-2020||Pune||Overflowing Ambil Odha in one-hour rainfall brings back tragic memories of 2019 flash floods in Pune||Fears of flooding were back among residents of Dandekar bridge and adjoining settlements as Ambil Odha, an upstream, overflowed again with heavy rainfall in the city on Saturday. According to the India Meteorological Department, the Shivajinagar centre recorded a rainfall of 36 mm during Saturday evening. Heavy rainfall led to the flooding of low lying areas of Bibvewadi, Sahakarnagar, Katraj, Dandekar bridge area from where Ambil Odha traverses. The administration had to stop traffic flow on Shaneshwar Temple bridge for some time as the nullah was overflowing with rainwater, eyewitnesses said.Heavy rains lashed the city on Saturday and post lockdown many residents who stepped out for shopping were caught unaware in the hour of rain which led to flooding in several parts of the city. According to Bibvewadi-Sahakarnagar ward office, residents living in the adjoining area of Ambil Odha were shocked to see the nullah overflowing in just a span of one hour. Nitin Kadam, area resident and NCP president of Parvati constituency said, “We have been warning the residents and PMC about the impending floods for a long time. The PMC has not completed the fencing wall work and it is one of the main reasons that the low lying areas get inundated during heavy rains. Yesterday, the nullah overflowed and water was quite rough. We appeal to the PMC to install flood sensors and warning sensors for the citizens on a permanent basis.” Due to waterlogging, the ward officials, staffers and local residents stopped traffic flow at different spots as a precautionary move to prevent commuters from being washed away.Kanhaiylal Harilal Lakhani, ward officer, Dhankawadi- Sahakar nagar ward office said, “We had cleaned Ambil Odha pre-monsoon which led to the smooth flow of rainwater. The construction of the retaining wall work will be taken after monsoon season as per the policy decision. However, with heavy rains there are strong chances of flooding and commuters must be cautious while crossing the bridge.”Another resident Pradeep Raote from Parvati said, “Heavy rain for an hour created a flood-like situation here. This rekindled last year’s flood memories among locals.”The PMC had appointed a private agency PriMove which identified 77 illegal constructions along the Ambil Odha (stream), which caused the flash floods on September 25, 2019 wherein 26 people died in the floods. The Pune-based firm was given the task to carry out the survey of Ambil Odha and the reports were submitted to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) The PMC later issued notices to all the owners of these encroachments. According to PMC officials, PriMove has considered 20 metres as the width of the stream while conducting the survey. According to the city’s development plan of 1987, the width of the Ambil Odha was fixed at 18 metres and permission of construction was given accordingly. The PMC Engineers department later demolished some illegal settlement but it was described as eyewash by citizen activists. A section of area residents also claimed that they had legal documents to prove property ownership and the PMC action was aimed at spreading fear amongst the poor slum dwellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/overflowing-ambil-odha-in-one-hour-rainfall-brings-back-tragic-memories-of-2019-flash-flood-in-pune/story-tluXHBxWuOtzvPlrwWEcUJ.html
27-07-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers take out tractor march in Punjab against three farm reform ordinances passed by Centre||Chandigarh: A dozen farmer organisations took out a tractor march across Punjab on Monday, demanding the repeal of the three ordinances and the Electricity Act brought by the Centre besides a rollback of the fuel price hike. In a release, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordinating Committee Punjab convener Darshanpal said that members of 10 organisations, including Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakonda), Kirti Kisan Union, Krantikari Kisan Union-Punjab, Punjab Kisan Union, Jamhuri Kisan Sabha, Kul Hind Kisan Sabha-Punjab, Kisan Sangharsh Committee Punjab, BKU (Ugrahan) and BKU (Krantikari), took part in the protest. The farmer leaders said that the three ordinances, namely the Farmer Product Trade and Commerce (Promotions and Assistants) Ordinance 2020, Price Guarantee and Farmer Services (Empowerment and Protection) Ordinance 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) were aimed at handing over procurement of crops to corporate hands. “Just as these three ordinances pave the way for the marketing of crops to be handed over to corporate houses, the government will abolish the minimum support price,” Darshanpal claimed, rejecting the Centre’s assurances. The farmers protested outside the residences and offices of Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP MPs and MLAs, including SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, and senior party leaders Adesh Pratap Singh Kairon, Sikandar Singh Maluka and Surjit Singh Rakhra. The farmer union spokesperson said that Sukhbir was misleading farmers to save the seat of his wife Harsimrat in the Union cabinet. He said that by supporting the decisions of the BJP, the Badals had exposed their anti-Punjab and anti-farmer stand. The leaders also criticised the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab for “saving the Narendra Modi government from the wrath of the farmers by banning rallies under the guise of coronavirus”. COVID GUIDELINES FLOUTED IN MALWABATHINDA: Violating Covid guidelines on social distancing, farmers, including women, held protests in south Malwa on Tuesday. Riding on tractors, several of the protesters, gathered in large numbers, were seen without covering masks.However, their plan to gheroa the residence and offices of senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Muktsar, Mansa and other districts were foiled by the police. Protesters were stopped near Kheowali village. Organisations took out protests in Bathinda city, with traffic remaining blocked for three hours in Mansa.

27-07-2020||Chandigarh||Unfruitful year for Himachal: After extreme weather and Covid-19, it’s apple scab||The re-emergence of the deadly fungal scab after four decades poses a serious threat to Himachal’s ₹4500 crore apple economy, already hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak and vagaries of the weather. Heavy hailstorms and rain in the blooming season of March and April hit the apple crop , and labour problems and fertiliser shortage during the Covid-19 lockdown added to the damage.The scab outbreak has partially affected crops in the main apple growing areas of Shimla, Mandi and Kullu districts.A common disease, apple scab affects the foliage, blossoms, and fruits of trees, which develop dark lesions and can prematurely drop off or be deformed. The plant also faces increased risk of secondary infection.Top politicians are also likely to suffer. Mandi, the home district of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, himself an apple grower from Tandi village in Thunag, is the most affected. Horticulture minister Mahender Singh Thakur, also from the district, has an apple orchard in Karsog . Survey reveals extent of spreadA horticulture department survey reveals that scab has impacted Ani and Dalash areas of Kullu districts, Janjehli, Thunag and Karsog in Mandi district and Narkanda, Rohru, Kharapathar, Kotkhai, Jubbal and Chirgaon in Shimla district. Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti districts have reportedly been left unscathed.Apple is most important fruit crop which constitutes about 49% of the total area under fruit cultivation and 74% of total fruit production in Himachal Pradesh . Widespread scab attacks had been reported in the state in 1984 and again in 1986, impacting apple, HP’s most important fruit crop now covering about 49% of the total area under fruit cultivation, making up 74% of the total fruit production. However, farmers in the state were supported by the government to tackle the problem and eradicate it by 1998.Identification has been a problemExperts point to prolonged spells of rain and extended spring this year as the main reasons for the scab spread, with other factors. “Apple scab has affected almost 60% of the orchards,” says Dr Onkar Shad, a former botanist and now a farmer and leader of the state’s Kisan Sabha. “All farmers, particularly the youngsters, were unaware of the symptoms of the disease. The fungal disease resurfaced in the many areas of Kullu and Mandi district last year too, but this time it’s an epidemic.”The new generation of farmers was unaware of the disease and could not identify it when it started to infect the orchards, says professor Vijay Singh Thakur, former vice-chancellor of the Dr Yashwant Singh Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Nauni. “Earlier, as the epidemic was reported in the 1980s, many of the youngsters were not even born then. Timely detection of disease could have minimised losses for farmers,” Thakur adds.Orchards neglected, no spraying doneAfter the Himachal Pradesh high court’s order in December 2018 to the state government to remove all forest encroachments, special teams were formed and apple trees on the forest land were partially chopped. “Scab has reared its ugly head mainly due to the removal of encroachments, where half-cut trees were left by the department after the court’s order. As pesticides were also not sprayed on the trees, there was a spread of scab, and sap sucking insects such as scale and woolly aphids, fuelled by erratic and wet weather conditions,” says Lokinder Singh Bisht, president of Progressive Growers Association.“Due to the lockdown and unavailability of labour too many orchards have been neglected and no maintenance and sprays have been carried out. Himachal apple growers are largely dependent on labourers from Nepal, but they could not enter because of Covid-19 restrictions,” adds Bisht. Outbreak under control, says governmentExperts advise that in the affected orchards, new infections can be reduced by removing leaf litter and trimmings and incinerating infected tissue. This will reduce the amount of new ascospores (spores in an ascus or sac in which fungi develop) released in the spring. JP Sharma, joint director, department of horticulture, says that although the situation is under control scab has spread in most parts of the apple-growing belts, including Shimla, Kullu and Mandi districts. “ We suggest orchardists to follow the spray schedule to prevent the disease. Teams of our scientists are also visiting and monitoring the scab-affected areas,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unfruitful-year-for-hp-after-extreme-weather-covid-19-it-s-apple-scab/story-TYtYwBYDCFS8T9sT95tbsK.html
27-07-2020||Pune||Lack of exercise, check-ups, stress during lockdown resulted in spike in sugar levels, say Pune doctors||During lockdown diabetic patients have reported an unusual spike in blood sugar levels, say city doctors.The primary reason for the spike is faulty lifestyle including lack of exercise, and irregular blood sugar level checkups, unhealthy food choices while sitting at home and fear and stress due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, say doctors.Dr Sanjay Ingle, zonal pathologist, Apollo Diagnostics, said, “Since people are advised to stay at home; it is the need of the hour to keep a tab on the sugar levels. People with high or unmanaged blood sugar levels tend to have less than normal blood flow, owing to which the body finds it difficult to harness nutrients and heal.”“Due to the weakened immune system, people suffering from diabetes are prone to develop infections, and may take a longer time to get back on track,” he said.He further added, “It is vital to keep your blood sugar levels in your target range to prevent serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.”Dr Milind Patil, associated with Sahyadri hospital, said, “It is true that we are witnessing a spike in the number of such cases. Some patients have also complained of lack of access to their regular medicines.”“Along with blood sugar spike, weight gain and complications due to diabetes like foot infections and urine infections are also rising. People can opt for either online consultations or glucometer to check their sugar levels at home,” said Dr Patil.Dr Reema Kashiva, an endocrinologist at Noble Hospital, said, “Due to the lockdown, people are ignoring healthy lifestyle and food choices. In addition, fear and stress due to multiple factors primarily Covid-19, economic loss, job loss, domestic violence, the stress in the family all causes for the stress levels to go up which causes the sugar levels to spike up too.”“Patients, especially senior citizens could not attend regular OPD’s and also get their regular medicines which caused the spike drastically when they came for their checkups a few months later,” said Dr Kashiva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/lack-of-exercise-check-ups-stress-during-lockdown-resulted-in-spike-in-sugar-levels-say-pune-doctors/story-lSMrAugK377grAxOsm8MJO.html

27-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: High Court allows two petitioners to withdraw pleas||The Delhi High Court, while hearing several petitions related to the northeast Delhi violence in February this year, on Monday allowed two petitioners to withdraw their pleas with the liberty to approach trial courts.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan allowed petitioners Harsh Mandar and Brinda Karat, who were represented by senior lawyer Kapil Sibal and advocate Adit Pujari respectively, to withdraw their petitions.The petitioners, who withdrew their petition, had sought registration of FIRs under provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in the northeast Delhi violence matter.The High Court also adjourned the matter for next Monday noting that some of the rejoinders and counter-affidavits were not on-record.The court, while hearing the submission in the matter, showed displeasure with one of the petitioners -- Ajay Gautam -- and said, “don’t make political speeches here in court”. Gautam while making his submissions had said that one community intentionally making attempts to destabilise the peace of the country.Earlier, the High Court had granted the last opportunity to file rejoinders and affidavits by the concerned parties on several petitions filed over the northeast Delhi violence in February this year.The Delhi Police, in its affidavit on the pleas, had submitted that the police authorities acted promptly, vigilantly, and effectively without any fear or favour as a result of which violence could be contained in few days and to a limited area.“Speeches of political leaders including Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra, Pravesh Verma, Waris Pathan, and others are being examined by the Delhi Police and necessary action in this regard will be taken in due course of time if it is found on the evidence that their speech had any nexus with the riots,” the affidavit said.In the affidavit, the Delhi Police said that the petitions raising questions on the investigation is nothing but a blatant and brazen misuse of the public interest litigation.Around 53 people lost their lives in the violence that erupted in northeast Delhi after clashes erupted between two opposing factions over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-high-court-allows-two-petitioners-to-withdraw-pleas/story-lp237zkOJbw4K4MhO3t1XK.html

Instead, the Congress has limited itself to getting publicity. On the other hand, the ruling BJP instead of coming clean by ordering a probe into the main charges is indirectly admitting the scam,” Kumaraswamy said on Sunday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“By washing dirty linen in public, both the Congress and the BJP are playing a cruel joke on people instead of protecting their lives,” he said.Hitting out at the BJP, he asked, “Why is it that the BJP is not ordering an investigation into the Rs 2,000 crore Covid 19 corruption charges levelled against the government by the Congress? Why is the government keeping quiet on the corruption charges?”He said, “Is this the leadership provided by Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa? There could be political pressure on seeking resignation of his Ministers. But why has no action been initiated against any officers? Is there any effort to destroy the evidence by retaining officers in their existing postings?” “Hunger for publicity is evident when we look at the press conference by five Ministers at a time,” he said.The government has countered the charges of the Congress but backtracked on ordering an investigation, he said.“Would this not give rise to suspicion that the government is involved in the scam?” he asked.He also asked why Congress leaders have not filed a complaint before any investigating agency despite “possessing documents to prove the charges”.“Are the Congress leaders trying to get publicity or are they concerned about the welfare of the people? The Congress Legislative Party leader is seeking an account (Lekka Kodi) while the BJP president is seeking answers (Uttara Kodi). Is it enough to give such questions and answers?”Is there a concrete legal plan to deal with the irregularities? he asked.“Looking at the way the Congress leaders have addressed media conferences and taken to social media campaigns, it appears that they are trying to get publicity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/kumaraswamy-slams-bjp-congress-over-alleged-covid-19-equipment-purchase-irregularities/story-E3x35kNoGiHOje2JRDGSNN.html

27-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Jama Masjid, these days||The gigantic courtyard is empty. So empty that even the customary pigeons are not there — remember how they would always be seen flying from the courtyard to the central dome, and back?The iconic Jama Masjid monument in Old Delhi is feeling absolutely surreal these days. Like most monuments, and most places of worship, it was closed for months due to the coronavirus. The pandemic is still raging on but the Mughal-era mosque has re-opened. On this late morning, it is so quiet here that you could hear your own breathing.Tomorrow’s historians might look back upon these times as a defining moment that altered the course of the world. But the 17th century Jama Masjid has withstood more than one transformative event: the 1857 uprising, when the victorious British turned it into a camp for soldiers, as well as the Partition in 1947, when freedom fighter Maulana Abul Kalam Azad made a memorable speech against it on the steps of the great mosque. The pandemic too is now leaving its mark in the red sandstone monument. At first glance, the prayer hall looks the same, its giant chandelier as imposing. But then you notice alternating red and green marks on the tiled floor, indicating the percepts of physical distancing the devotees have to follow. The sight of these symbols — as if checked right and wrong by a teacher on an exam sheet — imprinted in such a historic place reflects how deeply the pandemic has embedded itself into the texture of our material world.At this moment only two people are inside the prayer hall, sitting at a distance.The vast courtyard has a vazu pool at the center where worshippers would wash themselves before prayer. It is dry. Suddenly a woman appears in a black burqa and stands at the other end of the pool. She seems to be sobbing, her body shaking. She recollects herself after a few minutes and walks towards the east-facing gateway.In the courtyard outside, monsoon sky is pressing in like an unexpected guest in a family gathering. Indeed, the small puffs of dark clouds floating above seem so close to the mosque’s upper limits that they feel like a ghostly extension of its architectural elements.Perhaps the most eye-catching, if not the most attractive, object here is a red plastic bin placed at the center of the courtyard. It’s looking so out of place in this edifice of immaculate aesthetics that one can’t help but keep turning to look at it, much the way one’s tongue inadvertently keep going back to feel the aching tooth.The long balcony beside the mosque’s gate no. 1 is usually always teeming with people. Today it is crowded —with three men. One of them is sleeping. Now a fourth man in white kurta pajama enters the mosque and purposefully heads towards this balcony. He sits with his back against the stone railing and stays still, looking like a figure in a Mughal miniature.Further ahead is the ticket booth to the mosque’s tower. The sign board is in a series of foreign languages. The four instructions to the tower’s visitors are only in English though; the last one says that “unaccompanied woman and child are not allowed to visit the tower.” (The tower hasn’t opened to visitors yet).Outside the gate 1, the staircase overlooking the chaotic Matia Mahal Bazar would always be packed with locals, sightseers, hawkers, beggars, and cats. It is empty.Hopefully these difficult days too will pass over, and Jama Masjid, like all timeless monuments, will once again transcend its present and regain its former life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-jama-masjid-these-days/story-jobLR6eorAdOT2opt2m3uI.html

Having received the first dose (0.5ml) of the vaccine at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, on July 17, he is waiting for the second dose to be administered on July 31. “I had once appeared for the Army recruitment drive but couldn’t pass it but this is my chance to do my bit in saving lives, the way the men on the border do. Doctors say that if this vaccine passes the test and we (volunteers) don’t develop any adverse effects, it could save crores of lives,” he says. The sense of service comes to him from his family, he says. “I belong to a family of blood donors and my entire family is into social service. We organise blood donation camps, eye donation camps etc.” Ask him how he found out about the trials, he says, “I read in a newspaper that PGIMS was looking for volunteers for human trials. After discussing it with my father, I called PGIMS and appeared for the tests on July 14 and was selected for the trial.” He adds that he is fit and has so far not developed any side effects. He adds that he was able to travel to Madhya Pradesh just two days after the trial and is now back to normal routine. The 26-year-old adds that a team of doctors from PGIMS calls him about three to four times a day to check up on his health. “I am eagerly waiting for July 31 when I will get the second dose of the vaccine, which is very important for the trial,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covaxin-human-trials-at-pgims-wanted-to-play-my-part-in-saving-lives-says-volunteer/story-nRYq7GxmM4naaKZl8zLyuM.html

As many as 43,293 private school students have moved to government schools during the 2020-21 academic session across the state, revealed the figures provided by the Haryana school education department.A total of 3,434 private school students have shifted to government institutions in Hisar, 2,876 in Karnal, 2,604 in Fatehabad, 2,502 in Sonepat, 2,453 in Gurugram, 2,369 in Sirsa, 2,301 in Panipat, 2,299 in Yamunanagar, 2,249 in Kaithal, 2,132 in Jind, 2,122 in Rewari, 2,074 in Faridabad, 1,950 in Bhiwani, 1,840 in Kurukshetra, 1,655 in Ambala, 1,555 in Rohtak, 1,502 in Jhajjar, 1,400 in Panchkula, 1,290 in Palwal, 1,206 in Mahendergarh, 929 in Nuh and 546 in Charkhi Dadri.An official, who wished not to be named, said more than 87,000 students, who had last year studied in private schools, have applied for admission in government schools this year.“Admission of these students will be confirmed on our website after they deposit their school leaving certificates. Most of the private schools are not issuing these certificates over fee issues. 21.49 lakh students have been enrolled in government schools against last year’s 20.97 lakh,” the official added.On private schools not issuing transfer certificates and other documents to students, the official said a school has no authority to deny documents to a student when he/she wants to move to another school. “If any legitimate claim is pending, the school has to move court for realising the same, but the future of children cannot be affected,” he added.Haryana elementary education department director Pradeep Dagar said students were shifting to government schools from private ones due to improvement in education standards and infrastructure, apart from Covid-19 crisis.“Income of people has declined during the pandemic and they have realised that good education can be achieved in government schools too. This year, both the toppers in Haryana board’s Class 12 exams are from government schools. We have started online classes on Edusat and local cable TV channels free of cost. Class-12 board results show that government schools have given a tough competition to private ones as the difference in their pass percentage was less than 1.5%,” Dagar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-43-000-students-switched-over-to-govt-schools-in-haryana-during-pandemic/story-HPXSBoKHf32yRnpluhI2qL.html

27-07-2020||Dehradun||Pillars erected by Nepalese citizens in no-man’s land at India-Nepal border not yet removed||Pillars erected by Nepalese men for fencing a no-man’s land at the India-Nepal border have not been removed despite assurances by Nepal authorities to their Indian counterparts, officials said on Sunday. Some Nepalese people erected concrete and wooden pillars on Wednesday on the no-man’s land and in about 10 metres of the area into the Indian side near Tanakpur town in Uttarakhand’s Champawat district, the officials said. Following the development, Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) officials deployed at the border held a meeting with Nepal’s Armed Police Force (APF) after asking the Nepalese locals to remove the pillars. During the meeting, APF officials had assured the SSB officials that the pillars would be removed soon. “ APF officials had assured us that the pillars would soon be removed but nothing has happened so far. In fact, the locals have now put fencing on the pillars erected by them,” said an SSB officer on the condition of anonymity. “The locals had erected 23 pillars in the area in India’s territory. After erecting the fencing, they have now planted some saplings there to further consolidate their claim on the disputed area.” SSB officials suspect a ‘bigger conspiracy’ behind the act of Nepalese locals. They said patrolling has been stepped up in the area. “This is certainly done with the backing of their administration and police. Without that, they will never dare carry out such an act. We have also got inputs that the Nepalese locals got funds from their administration for the fencing. This was also corroborated by a Nepalese local present on Thursday who was involved in erecting the pillars,” the SSB officer said. Another local administration official too corroborated the SSB official’s claim. “Nepalese authorities seem not to be serious about removing the encroachment. This was also evident from the fact that on Thursday during the heated argument with the Nepalese locals, they were putting fencing in front of APF personnel,” the official said. “Many of the Nepalese locals were also in an inebriated condition and abusing Indian officials during the meeting while raising anti-India slogans before the APF personnel. This shows that the APF and Nepal local administration are hands in glove with them,” said the official. He also informed that the dispute over the no-man’s land is prevailing because there is no clear demarcation of the India-Nepal border. “The demarcation would be done after a joint survey of the border by the Survey of India (SoI) and Survey of Nepal (SoN). A team of SoI had even come here last year for the survey and stayed for about two months. But the survey was not done because SoN officials didn’t show any interest and kept on dilly-dallying on the matter for some reason or the other. There seems to be a lack of sincerity on the part of SoN on completing the survey work of the border,” he said. Meanwhile, there were some media reports that the ongoing border tension escalated after some Nepalese locals hurled stones at a patrolling team of SSB near the border. However, the SSB officers denied any such incident. RK Tripathi, SSB commandant, said, “No such incident has happened at the border. The reports are absolutely rubbish.” “Talks are already on between the two sides on the removal of the encroachment which we hope will soon be removed as per the assurances of Nepalese authorities,” he said. Meanwhile district magistrate(DM) of Champawat Surendra Narayan Pandey registered a ‘strong’ protest on the issue before chief district officer (equivalent to DM) of Nepal’s Kanchanpur district which adjoins Champawat across the border. He also apprised the Indian Embassy in Nepal of the issue.“Taking up the matter I wrote a letter to Kanchanpur’s CDO and spoke to him over phone to register a strong protest on the act by Nepalese people on Saturday. I have asked him to remove the encroachments from the disputed area and follow the international border protocol,” said Pandey.He informed that following his protest, the Kanchanpur CDO and superintendent of police on Sunday visited the disputed area on their side. “While speaking to the CDO, I also requested him for a meeting at district administration level on which he said that he would reply on Monday after Sunday’s visit. I have also apprised our Embassy officials in Nepal about the issue on July 24 and the Uttarakhand state government to take up the matter with the Home Ministry,” said Pandey. He said that he has also urged his Nepalese counterpart to initiate a survey process of the border and restore the missing border pillar number 811/3 due to which the ‘demarcation of the border is not done yet.’“This issue has to be resolved at administration level because if it is left to the public then it may turn into an ugly episode in coming days,” said Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/pillars-erected-by-nepalese-citizens-in-no-man-s-land-at-india-nepal-border-not-yet-removed/story-3FiAr14141HB3Ina3olK1K.html

27-07-2020||City||Eight Panipat healthcare facilities found flouting biomedical waste norms||Eight hospitals in Panipat, including the district Red Cross Society’s healthcare facility and ESI’s dispensary, were found flouting Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules. Taking a serious note of the violation, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has issued notices to these hospitals under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act.These facilities did not even apply for authorisation under the BMW Rules, officials said. As per the regional officer of HSPCB, the board has directed them to immediately apply for the authorisation else action will be initiated as per the Environment (Protection) Act.Interestingly, HSPCB had earlier this year issued notices to 35 hospitals and nursing homes in Panipat for not obtaining valid authorisation since May 2019, but the managements of these hospitals did not take the warning seriously. Officials monitoring the implementation of the BMW Rules said many healthcare facilities were yet to obtain authorisation due to lack of awareness on the subject. Authorisation is an online process requiring minimal documentation without any fees.HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan said, “They (healthcare facilities) have to strictly comply with the norms as per the law. If they don’t obtain authorisation, they will face closure.”“It’s clear that no relaxation will be given to any hospital and all such facilities will have to strictly follow the directions for managing waste. Regular inspections are being conducted by HSPCB teams as per our policy and complaints we receive,” he added. The state pollution control board has conducted several workshops and camps on both district and state level in coordination with the health department and Indian Medical Association (IMA), but it was found that some healthcare facilities were not complying with the norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/eight-panipat-healthcare-facilities-found-flouting-biomedical-waste-norms/story-33ZtanPXY36mejMk71BrvJ.html

Soon after the nod, as many as four critically ill Covid-19 patients at GMC Amritsar and two at GMC Faridkot were given plasma therapy and all of them successfully recovered from the disease. But despite the 100% results, not many recovered patients have come forward to donate plasma for critical patients. As per the state’s Covid-19 bulletin on July 24, a total of 12,216 people in Punjab have tested positive for the virus, out of which 8,096 have already recovered.GMC Amritsar’s nodal officer for plasma therapy, Dr Avtar Singh Dhanju, said, “Despite our best efforts, we could persuade only four donors to give plasma for the treatment of others. The donated plasma was given to four patients and the results were 100% successful. We have a list of other eligible donors and their tests are being done and soon we will treat more patients through this.”GMC Faridkot principal Dr Deepak Bhatti, said, “We don’t have many plasma donors in Faridkot as people fear that the donation might make them weak. We could get only two donors so far and two patients benefitted from this. We are calling donors regularly and hopefully we will get more donors soon.”“Searching for a plasma donor is a rigid process as it is not possible to harvest plasma from patients while they are undergoing treatment. It has to be done about two weeks after recovery, at which stage people are reluctant to come back to hospitals. Also only people above the age of 18 can donate plasma and only those women, who have not given birth to babies, can be donors. Also, ICMR has now made antibody tests of donors compulsory and not many donors then remain eligible. Also, the donors are tested for other fatal diseases, such as HIV, before making donations. ICMR stipulates that plasma of only those who had been critically-ill before recovering can be used,” said GMC Patiala principal Dr Harjinder Singh.He added, “We got 15 plasma donors and only six of them became eligible for the donation. Arrangements are being made to give plasma to the first patient in GMC Patiala.”State medical research and education minister, OP Soni, said, “After GMC Patiala, nod has been given to GMC Amritsar and GMC Faridkot to establish plasma banks. We have also roped in hospital counsellors to persuade recovered patients for donations as they can help other critical patients in their recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plasma-therapies-successful-but-finding-donors-still-a-challenge-in-punjab/story-74E14kobNErzp9jrV0mTbK.html

In the three-minute conversation which was aired on Mann Ki Baat programme on Sunday, the Prime Minister (PM) congratulated Kritika on her performance and asked about her aim, source of inspiration and success mantra.When Kritika told PM Modi that she wanted to become a doctor, he briefed her about the challenges in life of a doctor, especially in the prevailing situation. Kritika, however, said she could not share her ‘Mann Ki Baat’ with the PM during their conversation. “I could not tell him about the financial problems we are facing. I want to become a doctor, but it seems very challenging for my widow mother as we have limited source of income.”Kritika’s father Vinod had died of brain haemorrhage 18 months ago and now, her mother Saroj is struggling to fulfil the dreams of her two children. Kritika is currently preparing for NEET, which has been postponed to September. “After losing my father, I decided to become a doctor without even giving a thought to our financial condition,” she added.KRITIKA’S MOTHER SEEKS MORE SUPPORT FOR GIRLS“My daughter wants to become a doctor and I am working hard to fulfil her dreams, but there is a very tough journey ahead,” said Saroj, who draws widow pension of ₹2,250 per month and stitches clothes for additional income. She said Kritika’s school played a major role in her success as the management did not charge any fees and even provided free bus facility to her daughter. “We want the government to extend more support to girls because they have potential,” Saroj added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mann-ki-baat-panipat-class-12-topper-tells-pm-she-wants-to-be-a-doc/story-9iLkuNRHtVFPTjUn0kvgzO.html

The people of our area (Deshwali) have their own pride and they cannot bend before the government. The BJP government did not build a single school in this constituency and chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has never visited the Baroda constituency after assuming office in 2014 except during elections. The BJP will try to divide people on the basis of caste in the elections but all the communities are united to teach a lesson to this arrogant government,” he said.INLD leader Arjun Chautala has started ‘Khaat Yatra’ on Sunday and he will visit eight villages every day in Baroda assembly to canvass for his party.Arjun said that this constituency has remained a stronghold of their party and people will elect their candidate as they have strong bonds with his family.Digvijay Chautala said that the BJP-JJP nominee will win this seat and people are waiting to teach a lesson to Hooda family in the upcoming election as “they did nothing for them except, grabbing their votes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/battle-for-baroda-social-distancing-go-for-toss-during-canvassing/story-xAjPyxLRCpgZCiyA4ZxcXM.html

27-07-2020||City||Ludhiana needs better facilities for critical Covid patients: MP Bittu||Two days after a patient referred from DMCH died at the civil hospital, member of Parliament (MP) Ravneet Singh Bittu said he will urge the chief minister to augment the medical facilities in Ludhiana for serious Covid-19 patients.During his visit to the civil hospital on Sunday, he checked the facilities being provided to patients and thanked the doctors and paramedical staff for serving courageously amid the pandemic. Expressing regret over the death of the 49-year-old patient on Friday, Bittu said Ludhiana had turned into a hotbed of the virus.He said he will urge chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to provide facilities for treatment of level-3 patients. “We do not have enough facilities for level-3 patients, who require ventilator. Critical patients are either rushed to DMCH, CMCH or another private hospital where the treatment crosses over Rs 7 to 8 lakh. Else the patients are rushed to Government Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, or PGIMER, Chandigarh. We need to upgrade the health infrastructure to tackle the problem,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-needs-better-facilities-for-critical-covid-patients-mp-bittu/story-vF7LQFnVltvhFXKtvGSeMP.html
27-07-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University mulling course in physiotherapy||Panjab University is considering introducing a bachelor’s course in physiotherapy and has started working on its modalities. The proposal is at the inception stage and a panel has already been constituted to deliberate upon its various aspects. A meeting of the panel was conducted earlier this month. The syllabus for the course had already been framed by the committee but it will be reviewed again. Jagat Bhushan, chairman of the panel, said, “The course is at the inception stage. Further aspects will be discussed once the syllabus is approved.” Further deliberations on the syllabus will be held in consultation with external physiotherapy experts as there are none at PU. It will then be cleared by the board of studies in medicine. “The introduction of this course will be of societal benefit as it is not run by many institutions here,” said Bhushan. Gurmeet Singh, chairperson, department of physical education, said, “Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU), Amritsar, and Punjabi University, Patiala, have a physiotherapy department each. PU should also introduce it. Physiotherapy is a part of sports training and without it one cannot produce a good athlete.” The committee also suggested that the course be run in collaboration with a health institution. A professor at the varsity said, “It will be better if the university ties up with some hospital to run the course. The recruitment of teachers is also a concern because many times courses are run without recruitment of permanent faculty.” The course is currently only being run at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-mulling-course-in-physiotherapy/story-R01DCalaDKrIhtuOOsnzSO.html

27-07-2020||Gurugram||Guidelines for limiting timings of online classes evoke mixed responses from schools||Aaryav Shukla, a four-year-old nursery student in a city-based school, attends online classes four days a week. The classes are two-hour-long with a small break in between. Aaryav’s mother, Sonu Singh, sits by his side throughout the class, coaxing the four-year-old to sit still and focus on the lessons being taught.“Getting a three or four-year-old to pay attention to online classes for two hours is a tough task. None of the children in his class are able to concentrate for so long. Uninterrupted screen usage makes them restless and cranky. There is a small break in between classes but that doesn’t mean that the screen goes off. Teachers and students continue to remain logged in,” said Singh, who is among the scores of parents who are struggling to limit their children’s excessive exposure to digital devices during the Covid-19 pandemic.What government guidelines say In response to the concerns, the ministry of human resources recently released guidelines meant to limit the time students spend in front of screens. The ministry has recommended a cap on the screen time for students. As per the guidelines released in the second week of July, online classes for pre-primary students should not be for more than 30 minutes. It further mentions that two online sessions of up to 30-45 minutes each should be conducted for classes 1 to 8 and four sessions for classes 9 to 12. Most parents, however, said that schools were to yet to adopt the guidelines and were continuing with classes as before. “The guidelines say that online classes for nursery should not take place beyond 30 minutes but schools are following their own schedules. Since the guidelines are not mandatory, schools do not have an incentive to abide by them,” said Singh.Schools, however, insist that children will get used to attending the classes with time. “Teachers tell us that children will adjust eventually like they do in physical classes. However, people fail to understand that there is a marked difference in the way a child perceives a physical class as compared to an online one,” said Singh.Tripti Singh, whose children study in two different private schools in the city, said that back-to-back online classes were tiring for children. Her son, a Class-5 student, used to attend classes from 9am to 3pm until recently when the school reduced the timings by two hours. “It becomes tiresome for children to sit on the computer in the same position for hours at a stretch. My son used to have long duration classes which were recently readjusted after the school took cognisance of the guidelines,” said Singh.Beyond the classes, children were also spending additional time in the completion of assignments and other school work, she said. “Anywhere between seven to eight hours on a daily basis go into classes and the resulting work assignments. Sometimes, I see my daughter working on collaborative art projects until 9 -10 at night. While it is educational, all activities take place via digital screens,” said Singh, adding that schools needed to revise their timings while taking cognizance of the new lived realities. “Nowadays, screen time for children is already high. Even during the break, children are catching up with friends through these devices. With long-duration online classes, exposure to digital screens is further increased. Schools need to understand that,” said Singh.Mixed reactions from schoolsThe guidelines seeking a reduction in online learning hours have elicited mixed reactions from private schools in the city. While some schools said that the guidelines would ensure that learning continues to take place as per a schedule, others said that restricting online classes without understanding the effect on learning continuity will have an adverse impact on students’ development in the long term.Manit Jain, co-founder of Heritage Schools, said that while most of the guidelines were relevant, it was important to make a distinction between good and bad screen time. “Policymakers must recognise that productive screen time is not only desirable but is necessary in such times,” said Jain, adding that there would be a potential loss if learning were to remain interrupted for months in the current circumstances. “People are often casual about the need for learning and think that children can go without classes for some time. While screen time such as gaming or violent television is not healthy, online classes cannot be considered as bad screen time. It has to be seen as mentoring and teaching. Without 3-4 hours of instruction in the senior classes, children will not be able to handle independent tasks since they are not in the habit of doing so,” said Jain.He also said that the government will have to recognise the fact there were many countries that continue to run their timetable as they did when they were running in the physical environment and international boards may not cut the syllabus in line with specific countries. “The IB and IGSCE are yet to modify the syllabus. International boards might not cut substantial portions of the syllabus. The government needs to think about this as well,” said Jain.Aditi Misra, principal, Delhi Public School, Sector 45, said that the school had been following a pattern similar to the one advised by the human resources ministry since March itself. “We have been adopting a similar model for classes since the beginning. We routinely take surveys to factor in the concerns of students and parents and all stakeholders seem happy with the arrangement,” said Misra.She said that concerns about completion of syllabus had been addressed by the CBSE, which had reduced the syllabus for children in the senior classes and underlined that completing a certain number of teachers’ hours and other formalities would be taken care of keeping in view the unprecedented circumstances. Schools need to have a minimum of 200 working days for classes one to five and 220 working days for upper primary classes in an academic year, as mandated by Section 19 of the Right To Education Act, 2009.“The burden of syllabus has reduced somewhat. As far as other classes are concerned, we need to understand that everything has gone topsy-turvy and this is not a normal school year. CBSE is also reworking the syllabus. Things are bound to change,” said Misra.Some schools fall in lineKunal Bhadoo, director of Kunskapsskolan Schools, said that the school had introduced changes in its online class schedule based on feedback from parents and teachers. The school is trying to replicate the physical classes that used to take place in the school in a manner whereby the classes are a blend of screen time and self-directed learning.“Parents were concerned about the fatigue that sets in during online sessions. After feedback, we planned and implemented the lessons in such a way that the effective screen time is curtailed. While the teacher shows the whiteboard or the screen for some time, children get the chance to put away the screen and complete the work in sheets or notebooks in a self-directed manner. Teachers are always available to solve the queries of students,” said Bhadoo. He added that the guidelines were more relevant to schools where teachers are relying on recorded videos that require students to stay glued in for long durations.Aparna Erry, principal, DAV Public School, Sector 14, said that the guidelines were not binding and most schools were planning schedules keeping in mind the challenges of online classes. “Most schools are largely adopting schedules of a similar duration. At our school, the duration of sessions varies for students in different classes. For senior classes, we have classes for three to four hours but the schedule keeps changing in view of the syllabus,” said Erry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/guidelines-for-limiting-timings-of-online-classes-evoke-mixed-responses-from-schools/story-nx3xuBCEaUzURms3ixx2DP.html
27-07-2020||Gurugram||Govt college holds webinar on body shaming, self-esteem among girls||A webinar was organised by the women empowerment cell of Government Girl College, Sector 14, on the issue of body image on Sunday afternoon for an hour.Over 150 students took part in the webinar, which discussed the various issues pertaining to body shaming and how individuals should be more accepting of being different from others. The discussion also touched upon the issue of peer pressure on social media.Vageesha Rao, a certified counsellor, held the webinar and discussed at length issues regarding young individuals, questions of personality, handling societal pressure and other peer issues.Rao said that young girls and boys often slip into depression and, in many cases, have ended their lives, when they fail to cope up with peer pressure. “During the session, students were made aware of how there is a vicious cycle between body image, mental health, and self-esteem. Students were given examples of people who stood up to body shaming time and again. The aim of the session was to promote the idea that loving one’s own body should not mean hating someone else’s” she said.Dr Vijay Adlakha, principal, Government Girls College, Sector 14, said that students could relate to what was being discussed and found the session to be very informative and interesting. “Body shaming is something that concerns every young mind while growing up and the issue needs to be addressed by both parents and teachers. Otherwise, it can leave a deep impact on young minds,” he said.Rao said, while men too can face body shaming, but the level of shaming being faced by women is much more. “Try to avoid negative people. I have discussed and given a presentation of a few exercises to do daily regarding self-esteem. Have asked the students to write the five positive points about themselves daily at bedtime and to think why we love our family and friends — is it due to physical appearance or their virtues?,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-govt-college-holds-webinar-on-body-shaming-self-esteem-among-girls/story-pAcinz2HbMz3T97bB9I9AK.html
27-07-2020||Mumbai||‘42.5% decline in Mumbai’s urban green cover over 30 years’||The city’s development over the past three decades has come at a cost – 42.5% decline in urban green cover, according to a study published last week in peer-reviewed journal Springer Nature. Of Mumbai’s total area of 63,035hectares (ha), the green cover was 29,260ha in 1988, which fell to 20,481ha in 1998, 17,331ha in 2008, and 16,814ha in 2018, which means an overall decline of 42.5% over 30 years. The green cover lost is 12,446ha, more than the size of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (10,300ha). Researchers from Manipal Academy, Karnataka, Delhi School of Economics, Kazi Nazrul University, Asansol, West Bengal, and East China Normal University, Shanghai, used Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 multi-temporal satellite images provided by United States Geological Survey to assess land use land cover (LULC) changes, land surface temperature (LST), proportion of vegetation, and other parameters for Mumbai during spring (March-April) over 30 years. The study identified a three-fold increase in land surface temperature (LST), which is negatively affected by loss of green spaces, as a reason for micro-climate changes in Mumbai, due to increase in built-up areas and subsequent latent heat. “LULC changes have subsequently altered the micro-climate of the city’s urban ecosystem. Surface temperature variation and changes in rainfall distribution are a direct indicator of this,” said Selim Jahangir, corresponding author from Manipal Academy of Higher Education. “Preserving urban green spaces is extremely important in the context of climate change as they influence rainfall and temperature, and determine the micro climate of a city.” Satellite maps indicated that 43% area under dense and 20% sparse vegetation steadily decreased from 1988 to 2018. Major affected areas that witnessed changes in dense vegetation include SGNP, Aarey Colony in Goregaon, Mulund, Bhandup, Gorai, Malad and Versova creek areas. Sparse vegetation reduction was witnessed across the central suburbs and isolated zones in south Mumbai, including Bandra, Khar, Malabar Hill, Pedder Road, Dadar, Lower Parel, Mazgaon, Colaba and Cuffe Parade, said researchers. “If the same trend continues for the next 10 years, it will not only adversely affect biodiversity, but also human health, by increasing urban heat island and air pollution,” said Jahangir. The ratio of green spaces to total area fell from 46.7% in 1988 to 26.67% in 2018, with most significant changes observed during 1988-1998, when around 14% of green spaces had transformed due to development activities. Areas of LST higher than 30.5 degrees Celsius dramatically increased from 5,232ha in 1988 to 14,339ha in 2018. Conversely, a drastic decline was recorded (32.28%) in green spaces having less than 25.5 degrees Celsius from 11,858ha in 1988 to 7,979ha in 2018. “Increasing LST intensity would lead to an increase in urban heat island effect, bringing about adverse change in fundamental environmental indicators such as rise in atmospheric greenhouse gases, heat waves and air quality, and declining biodiversity,” said Jahangir. The study called for requirement of policy implications at a location-specific level to harness the depleting green cover. “There is a need for the government to notice such changes, and bring in stringent regulation on arbitrary tree cutting for developmental projects,” said Jahangir. “Additionally, citizens can adopt green roof methods and balcony garden techniques similar to Singapore and Brisbane, Australia. This would increase the cooling effect and also improve air quality.” Pankaj Kumar, author and assistant professor, Delhi School of Economics, said, “District authorities need to establish policy mitigation measures, encouraging social forestry, urban green belts, and declare more protected areas. Implications of this are not confined just to Mumbai, but the entire region.” Mumbai’s tree census completed in 2018 identified 29.75 lakh trees, over 10 lakh more from 2008. “Tree census data is false as the same data is repeated every year. The findings of the latest study are a grim reminder that the city’s environment has remained largely ignored,” said activist Zoru Bhathena. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said they were maintaining 1044 plots, 254 gardens, 319 playgrounds and 432 recreation grounds. “Lack of space is a constraint, but tree cover has increased. Combined with Miyawaki plantation (dense mini urban forests) across 100 plots, spaces under flyovers converted into green zones, and more green buildings, the situation has improved from what it was five years ago,” said an official from BMC’s garden department. BMC has issued notices for removal of 6,382 trees from January to July 26, 2020. In 2019, notices were issued for felling of 14,518 trees and 8,775 trees in 2018. The data was compiled from BMC advertisements by Bhathena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/42-5-decline-in-mumbai-s-urban-green-cover/story-1uHglIrejP2nUOWEA9YFTP.html
27-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt data shows Covid-19 deaths down 44% from June||The number of deaths reported in Delhi from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reduced from 1,089 between June 1 and June 12 to 605 recorded between July 1 and July 12, a drop of 44.50%, data shared by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office showed on Sunday.The analysis, which was conducted by the Delhi health department, showed that in the July period, the deaths recorded within 24 hours of hospital admission dropped to 15%, down from the 34% figure in the June period. The data also showed that the percentage of deaths recorded within four days of admission to hospitals witnessed a drop from 67% to 35% in the two periods.An official in the CM’s office said they were still to analyse the data on deaths beyond July 12. This is why the comparison was made with the first 12 days of the previous month, the official said. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier asked the Delhi health department to take stock of all Covid-19 deaths recorded in the months of June and July and sought reports based on their analysis. The final report was submitted to the CM’s office on Sunday, when Delhi recorded 21 deaths, taking the toll to 3,827.“The committee formed under the health department to analyse hospital-wise death numbers in June and July attributed the decrease in death figures to widespread tests, distribution of pulse oximeters to patients in home isolation, reduction in response time for the ambulance system, a system developed to check the real-time availability of Covid beds and focus on scaling up ICU beds from around 500 in early-June to more than 2,200 in early-July,” Kejriwal said in a statement.The data also showed that Covid-19 deaths in the two periods reduced by 58% at Delhi government hospitals, by 55% at central government hospitals and by 25% at private hospitals in the city.The Delhi and central governments have five Covid-19-dedicated hospitals each. There are about 115 private hospitals in the city with Covid-19-dedicated wards at different scales.Hospital-wise analysis of the data showed that total deaths vis-à-vis total admissions in the central government’s RML Hospital dropped from 81% in June to 58% in July. At Safdarjung Hospital – another central government facility – the number of deaths vis-a-vis total admissions dropped from 40% in June to 31% in July. In Lok Nayak Hospital — Delhi government’s largest Covid hospital — the figure dropped from 28% in early June to 16% in early July, the analysis showed. At the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, the figure was 6% in early June and 7% in early July.“The CM’s efforts and direct monitoring have rebuilt public confidence in Delhi government hospitals, which have been at the forefront of this turnaround. The chief minister has directed the best performing and worst forming hospitals to analyse their system and suggest specific interventions if needed,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said.Jain said increased testing in the city has ensured that suspected Covid-19 patients can access testing facilities easily without losing time or developing severe symptoms. “This is a reason why fewer people died within 24 hours and four days of being admitted in a hospital.“The Covid mobile application further ensured patients could easily find a bed in a hospital of their liking – be it private or government – without running around multiple hospitals and losing precious time in the process,” said Jain, adding that in the Corresponding periods, the total Covid-19 beds in Delhi hospitals increased from 3,700 to 15,000.On Sunday, Delhi reported 1,075 Covid-19 cases, taking the city’s cases so far to 130,606. “Today, Delhi reaches 10th position. People are recovering and No of active cases are steadily going down,” the CM tweeted, sharing a list of the states with the number of active Covid-19 cases.Dr Jacob John, former professor of virology at the Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore, said: “Other states should follow Delhi’s example in the areas of increased tests, distribution of pulse oximeters, focusing on ambulance fleet, ICU beds and developing an interface for Covid bed availability. Delhi, however, could have done better in terms of saving more lives if it had taken the same measures at least two months in advance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-data-shows-covid-deaths-down-44-from-june/story-pphZA58OP22JyP6yLCPkiO.html
27-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra FYJC Admissions 2020: State to launch app for admission, fee payment to be conducted online||The state education department on Sunday said it will launch a mobile application to facilitate the admission process for first-year junior college (FYJC) students in the coming days, amid the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown. The colleges will also grant provisional admissions to students and the fee payment procedure would be online, to prevent students and parents from gathering at the colleges. Students from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) can fill part 1 of the admission form from August 1 and get details of admissions on https://mumbai.11thadmission.org.in. While the state education department is yet to declare the dates for Class 10, they are expected to be out by the end of the month. “This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, students cannot visit colleges, and hence we decided to conduct the admission process online, ensuring there is zero contact. Students can easily fill out their forms online and also upload their documents on the portal online,” said Rajendra Ahire, deputy director, Mumbai region. The information booklet, which helps students with the admission process, will also be made available online. The department also allowed students to fill out mock forms as a practice exercise before they fill out the actual forms. Around 1.25 lakh students filled out the mock forms until Saturday – the last day to fill the forms. Students who apply for admissions under the various quotas can seek help from their respective schools over the phone where help desks would be set up to guide them with the procedure. Those from other boards or from other parts of the state or country can also get their doubts solved online and upload documents from home.They can upload copies of their documents online and get them verified. The entire process will be online,” added Ahire.For academic year 2020-21, around 3.19 lakh seats will be up for grabs across 819 colleges in MMR. What will the process look like this year? - From August 1, students can fill part 1 of the online form with their basic details such as name, address etc. - Once the results are declared, students can fill part 2 of the form with details of their marks and college preferences. - Merit lists will be declared online and details of allotted colleges will be sent to the schools. Students will also get SMS alerts on registered phone numbers. - Students can confirm admissions to the colleges allotted and pay the fees online. - Colleges will grant provisional admissions to students. The physical verification of documents would take place after the colleges reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-to-launch-app-for-fyjc-admission-fee-payment-to-be-conducted-online/story-fxHMyuW6g4P1qesYjEzp9J.html
27-07-2020||Delhi||Eight-year-old girl abducted, raped in north Delhi slum||An eight-year-old girl sleeping next to her grandmother outside their home in north Delhi was kidnapped and raped in the early hours of Friday, the Delhi Police said on Sunday after using the survivor’s description of the suspect to nab a street vendor. The suspect had allegedly gone to visit the crime spot on Saturday morning to observe the nature of the probe when the police team noticed him and nabbed him.“The survivor had given us an accurate description of his beard colour, hair style and age which helped us catch him after 16 hours of investigation,” said a senior police investigator who didn’t want to be identified. The suspect, 40-year-old Sudama, allegedly told the police that he “lost control of his senses” after getting drunk that night. “We are investigating whether he targeted more children, although no other case has come up so far,” said the officer. The girl lives with her grandmother and uncle in a slum in north Delhi. “Around 2 am on Friday, she was sleeping with her grandmother on a cot outside their house when Sudama gagged her and took her away behind a religious place in the neighbourhood,” said the officer. He left the crime scene after allegedly raping her even as the girl’s family woke up to find her missing. They had just begun their search when they found her walking back.“They didn’t think too much of her disappearance at that time, but in the morning her grandmother found her bleeding,” said the officer. The child was taken to Sucheta Kripalani Hospital where the doctors noticed sexually assault and alerted the police. “The child could only speak Marathi. So, we sought help from another girl in the neighbourhood to get a description of the suspect,” the officer said.The child described the suspect as a man with a salt and pepper coloured beard, long hair with middle parting. “We rounded up about 70 suspects, but the survivor did not confirm the photographs of any of them,” said the officer. But local enquiry revealed that a man of that description would frequently visit a tea shop in the neighbourhood. But the suspect allegedly turned up near the crime spot where a police team was carrying out the probe on Saturday morning. “One of our officers noticed him and found his appearance similar to that of the description provided by the survivor,” said the officer. Seeing the police approach him, the suspect allege began to run, but was chased and caught.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/8-year-old-girl-abducted-raped-in-north-delhi-slum/story-b8KXQnoBr3b9kVvxyDKHTJ.html
27-07-2020||Delhi||18 newborns in Delhi tested positive for Covid-19 since March||At least 18 babies born to mothers suffering from coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in three Delhi hospitals since the first case was detected in March tested positive for the infection within a few hours to five days after birth. However, doctors ruled out that it was a case of transmission in the womb or vertical transmission.Although, mother to child transmission in newborns could not be established, the doctors said this shows that the babies can get the infection soon after birth from the environment. Doctors said all but one of the Covid-infected babies was asymptomatic and one of the babies born at RML hospital, who had other conditions, died.The highest number of deliveries – 86 cesarean sections and 124 normal deliveries – were handled at the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, the city’s biggest dedicated Covid-19 treatment facility, according to the medical director of the hospital Dr Suresh Kumar.“All babies born to Covid-19 positive mothers are tested for the infection soon after their birth and on day five. So far, five babies have tested positive for the infection. Of these five, three were found positive on the day of their birth. Although this is suggestive of the baby getting the infection in-utero before birth, there is no evidence of vertical transmission from anywhere in the world. Globally, 0.5 to 1% of newborns have been found to have the infection,” said Dr Sangeeta Gupta, professor of gynaecology at Lok Nayak hospital.Doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, however, said they couldn’t rule out vertical transmission in one of the three babies testing positive there.“The baby tested positive within 16 hours of birth. There had been no contact with the positive mother after delivery and the baby had been taken to the nursery soon after. We could not send samples of the placenta, amniotic fluids, or cord blood for testing. The second way of confirmation was to test the baby for IgM antibodies. However, since the tests are not yet standardised, the baby tested negative,” said Dr Aarti Maria, head of the department of neonatology at RML hospital.The highest number of positive babies were born at Safdarjung hospital, where over 100 Covid-19 positive mothers have delivered.“So far, ten babies have tested positive for the infection after birth. However, none of the babies tested positive within first few hours of life, ruling out the possibility of vertical transmission,” said Dr Sheeba Marwah, assistant professor and nodal Covid-19 officer for gynaecology department in Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung hospital.Dr Sushma Nangia, head of the department of neonatology at Lady Hardinge Medical College, said “Fortunately, the babies seem to get very mild or no symptoms at all and recover soon.”An observational study of 120 newborns in New York, recently published in the journal Lancet Chile and Adolescent Health Journal, shows that none of the babies got the infection during childbirth or after two weeks of breastfeeding and skin to skin contact. Breastfeeding is recommended by the WHO as well as most professional bodies of gynaecology and neonatology, according to the doctors.“Evidence shows that there is minimal risk of contracting Covid-19 during breastfeeding and thus breastfeeding should be promoted irrespective of the Covid-19 status of the mother,” said Dr Maria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/18-newborns-ve-right-after-birth-doctors-rule-out-vertical-transmission-of-virus/story-tb1N7BYGiL9ipJvR8FUmzH.html
27-07-2020||Delhi||Many Covid-19 care centres in Delhi empty, as most patients stay at home||At a Delhi government Covid Care Centre in Narela, one of the first such facilities in the Capital, close to 1,200 people are quarantined, but none of them are positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). These are, instead, people who have returned from abroad on flights under the Centre’s Vande Bharat repatriation mission.“We have not got any Covid-19 positive patients since July 10. Till last month, we were getting 150-200 Covid-19 patients daily,” said Dr Ishrat Kafeel, the chief minister’s representative at the 1,370 bed Narela facility.A similar picture has persisted in some other such facilities across the national capital. Care Centres can house patients with mild symptoms who are unable to isolate in their homes. However, with a large number of patients in home isolation — 6,976 as on Sunday, and the number of new daily cases showing a downward trend, the occupancy at these centres has seen a steady fall. Of the 11,904 active cases (patients still infected with Covid-19) in the city on Sunday, only 853 (around 7%) are in these centres.This has made the Delhi government rethink its use of these centres.Like Narela, other Covid Care facilities have very few positive cases admitted currently. Of the 18 state-run quarantine centres started by the Delhi government, at least seven have had no patients for weeks now. These include the YMCA Tourist hostel, Badarpur (specify), Birla Mandir Dharamshala, DDU Marg facility and PTS Dwarka. Two facilities in southeast Delhi that were turned Covid facilities have been returned to the Railways.“Some of the facilities were used to keep members of Tablighi Jammat who were evacuated from Nizamuddin Markaz. Then when the number of cases increased, especially in densely populated areas such as Jahangirpuri, asymptomatic and those with mild symptoms are sent to these centres,” said a senior government official.Additionally, with the government opening two major Covid care centres — the 10,000-bed Sardar Patel centre in Chhatarpur and a 500-bed centre in the Commonwealth Games village, there has been a steady decline in the number of Covid-19 positive cases being sent to these centres.Admissions to the city’s care centres have been on an upward trend since June 2, when 648 positive patients were admitted to the various facilities, with the total number on that day hitting 1,370. The number peaked at 2,304 on July 17. However, the number has mostly dropped since then, falling to 1,522 as on July 24, then further to 904 the day after that.Delhi government divisional commissioner Sanjeev Khirwar said, “We are recalibrating our resources, especially at big facilities at Narela and Sultanpuri, for optimal utilisation. We have some large facilities like the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre, and we are sending new cases to these facilities. Wherever possible, we are shifting patients from other centres to these facilities.”However, occupancy rates at the two flagship centres are quite low, with around 250 patients in the Chhatarpur facility, and around 200 in the CWG one.The Delhi government spokesperson didn’t respond, despite multiple attempts for comment.In some centres, the government has withdrawn the staff and deputed them elsewhere, while at others, it is in the process of handing over the centres, at least partially, to the authority that owns the premises.At Police Training School in Dwarka for instance, medical and support staff has been withdrawn. “But the infrastructure is in place and if need be it can be restarted in no time,” a Delhi government official said.At northeast Delhi’s Mandoli Jail Complex, which has a capacity of 750 beds, Delhi government authorities are in the process of handing over five of the 12 towers to jail authorities for their use. The facility, which was packed to capacity in May and June, has only 32 Covid-19 patients now, according to a senior official in-charge of the facility.Delhi director general of prisons Sandeep Goel confirmed that the prison department had written to the state government, requesting the Mandoli police complex be turned into a temporary prison. Goel said, “The police complex could accommodate at least 2,000 prisoners.”As per the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin, as on Saturday, 3,202 beds in care centres are occupied by persons under quarantine, including travellers who returned on Vande Bharat mission and bubble flights.At Bakkarwala facility with over 500-beds, there are close to 380 people, who have come from abroad, in quarantine. Sunny Kheda, the CM’s representative at the facility said, “For the past 10 days, we have not got any Covid-19 positive case.”A senior official from west Delhi district said, “We are sending a majority of the patients to the Sardar Patel facility. But those who want to stay in the district are kept at the care facility in Tilak Nagar. The Bakkarwala facility is being used to house those coming from abroad.”Similarly, the northwest district is sending new Covid-19 cases to the Shakur Basti facility that is operating from train coaches, instead of the 1,032-bed Sultanpuri Covid Care Centre. However, Delhi government officials said they sought to remain cautious and while some of the centres are not in use right now, they may be made operational immediately if necessary.Khirwar said, “In case, there is a surge in cases, we will use these centres to keep Covid patients. We are not closing these centres.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/many-covid-care-centres-in-delhi-empty-as-most-patients-stay-at-home/story-xvCrHGNloXU91SqSBCoCNO.html
27-07-2020||Delhi||Off-duty Delhi police officer stops to clear traffic jam, run over by truck||A 54-year-old assistant commissioner of police (ACP) of Delhi Traffic Police was killed after an allegedly speeding mini truck hit and dragged him for nearly 50 metres on a service lane near the Rajokri flyover in southwest Delhi where he was busy clearing a traffic jam on Saturday night.The mishap took place around 8pm. The errant truck driver fled the accident spot, leaving the critically injured police officer lying unconscious on the road. The injured ACP, Sanket Kaushik, was rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre, where he was declared brought dead, deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Devender Arya said.DCP Arya said Kaushik was posted in Dwarka traffic circle and was returning from office in his official vehicle along with his driver and operator (person who handles wireless) when they found a traffic jam on the service lane near the Rajokri flyover. ACP Kaushik, along with his staff, went to clear the traffic jam. While his driver and operator were busy removing a Santro car, ACP Kaushik walked ahead on the road.“A mini truck hit him from behind and dragged him for nearly 50 metres under it before hitting concrete barriers placed on the road. The ACP suffered multiple injuries and was declared brought dead in the hospital. A case of rash and negligent driving causing death under Sections 279 and 304A of Indian Penal Code has been registered against the unknown driver,” said Arya, adding that the ACP was not in uniform.The police are also probing the case from a conspiracy angle. Since the ACP was posted in the traffic unit, police officials have not ruled out the role of a transporter or “syndicates”, including those from Mewat region involved in various illegal activities such as cattle lifting or smuggling of illegal goods.Six teams of the southwest district police have been working on the case and they have scanned footage from more than 30 CCTV cameras installed near the accident spot and the probable routes that the truck may have taken to flee after the mishap. The police are yet to identify the truck. Officers said the registration number of the vehicle is not visible in the CCTV footage because of the glare of its head lamps.“It’s a hit-and-run case. Initially, we did not know what vehicle was involved in the mishap. We found two motor mechanics who told us that they had seen a Tata 407 mini-truck hitting the concrete barriers on the road where the injured ACP was lying unconscious. We scanned the CCTV cameras and found the images of the truck in three-four cameras. However, its registration number is not visible,” said an officer associated with one of the investigating teams.Officials said that a list of mini trucks registered in Delhi-NCR is being prepared. Also, all the motor workshops in Delhi-NCR are also being told to inform the police if any mini truck comes for repair.“The task is tough but it will certainly help us identify the truck and its driver involved in the accident. We have solved some blind road mishap cases through similar exercise in the past. Meanwhile, more CCTV cameras are being scanned,” said another investigator.Kaushik had joined the Delhi Police as a sub-inspector in 1989. His initial posting was in the southwest district and was promoted as an Inspector in 2006. He was promoted to the rank of an ACP in May 2017 and was serving in the traffic unit since June 2019. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. His family lives in Basant Gaon in south Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traffic-acp-hit-by-mini-truck-dragged-for-50-metres-while-clearing-a-jam-dies/story-jcys2MuOh2CshEGc6TkgdL.html
27-07-2020||Delhi||Rethink policy on containment zones, Jain asks Centre||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said the Centre should reconsider its policy on containment zones.Currently, the guidelines of the Union health ministry ask states to implement sealing of areas that record a cluster of Covid-19 cases, and containment efforts can be scaled down only after no fresh case is recorded in the sealed area for at least 21 consecutive days, irrespective of the time when the concerned area is notified as a containment zone.“I feel the Centre needs to review its containment zone policy. The latest sero survey showed around 24% people of Delhi may have already contracted the virus and recovered. It’s already been a month since that survey. In the next survey (scheduled between August 1 and 5), it may touch 35-40%,” he said, suggesting the Centre explore the possibility of allowing scaling down containment measures after 15 days of notifying a containment zone.“It is difficult to implement a uniform policy across the country. That is what the central government should re-consider... Separate sets of containment policies should be drafted for states and cities, with due consideration to factors such as results of sero survey, prevalence rate, average daily cases and deaths,” said Jain, citing examples of pockets and lanes in the city that have been such zones for over three months.“The health ministry has given states the right to tweak containment zones based on the situation on the ground, as long as they adhere to broader guidelines,” said a central government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/satyendar-jain-asks-centre-to-rethink-containment-zone-strategy/story-LMocQydYFR3OYS5agLMOKK.html

27-07-2020||Delhi||Jesus & Mary college alumni, students raise Rs 2 lakh for on-campus Bhelpuri seller||“I knew that they loved my bhelpuri. But it’s so overwhelming to know that they didn’t forget us in such a situation,” said an emotional Mitlesh Jha, who has been selling the savoury snack from a stall outside Delhi University’s Jesus and Mary College (JMC) since 1991. The 48-year-old has been out-of-work ever since the college closed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic in March. Jha had since been struggling to provide for his family of four --- wife and three children. “Our family was completely dependent on the snack cart that i operated. I have seen generations pass out of this college. I still remember having served bhelpuri to Priyanka Gandhi, Neha Dhupia and other celebrities when they were students here. The college has given me so much love and respect in the last 30 years. But, then Covid came and was forced to sit at home for months without any work,” he said.However, things started to change for Jha in the last few days after two alumni of the college initiated an online fundraiser and collected Rs 2 lakh for their beloved “Bhelpuri wale bhaiya”. “Last week I visited the Alaknanda market in an attempt to sell some of my snack. There, I met a college student and she asked me what I was doing there. I told her that I was trying to restart my business. I requested her to spread the word that I was operating out of the Alaknanda market in case somebody wanted some bhelpuri. Back then I was barely getting 3-4 customers a day. The girl put out a message on a Whatsapp group right there,” Jha said.The text message was forwarded multiple times and finally landed up in the inbox of Aishwarya Mehra, 25, who graduated from JMC in 2016. Mehra, an entrepreneur living in Vasant Kunj, along with her former classmate Vedika Mehta launched an online fundraising campaign for Jha on July 22. “We were really sad to know about him. He had been one of the most memorable parts of our college lives. We wanted to do something for him too. We decided to launch an online fundraising campaign for him and within 48 hours over 225 people, mostly alumni and students, contributed Rs 2,09,567 for him,” Mehra said.“The support was overwhelming. We have a lot of contributions from our alumni living abroad. The entire money will be transferred to his account by next Friday,” she added.Overwhelmed by the support, Jha said that he will not have to struggle to provide for his family for the next few months. “My daughter is now in class 12 and she has to attend online classes. We were even struggling to get her a regular internet package. Now, with this support I will be able to help her in her studies as well,” he said.Teachers also appreciated the collective efforts of JMC alumni and students. Richa Raj, assistant professor at the college, said, “We are so proud of our alumni and students for helping Jha. It’s very important to help people in need in times like these.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jesus-mary-college-alumni-students-raise-rs-2-lakh-for-on-campus-bhelpuri-seller/story-hlhJMNTlTcCy1P0oQmuQZK.html
27-07-2020||Noida||Noida: Man robbed of valuables on pretext of lift||Four unidentified men allegedly robbed a 43-year-old Agra-based man of his valuables on the pretext of offering him a lift on Saturday.The victim, Kishan Datt Sharma, was in town to visit his brother in Salarpur, and was waiting for a bus near Sector 37 to return to Agra Saturday morning when the alleged incident took place. The victim said the suspects assaulted him and threatened him with a knife.“It was sometime after 7am when a white Dzire car came and stopped near me. There were two people inside it, and it seemed to be a shared cab. After I got in, two more people came and claimed that they wanted to go to Agra too. When we reached Pari chowk, I pointed out that the driver had missed a turn. He said he had some work in Alpha 1 sector,” said Sharma.The victim said that near the Alpha 1 commercial belt, the two men sitting with him in the back-seat held a knife against him and took his wallet and phone. “They assaulted me when I tried to resist and dropped me off near the Alpha 1 Metro station. My wallet had ₹2,000 and ATM cards. After a while, I received messages of two transactions from my card worth of ₹10,000 and ₹1,900,” said Sharma.A case against the four suspects has been registered. The victim, however, alleged delay on the police’s part in filing an FIR.He said that he first went to Pari chowk police post, then to Beta 2 police station (both in Greater Noida) and was then made to go the Sector 37 police post in Noida (which is managed by the Sector 39 police station) where a policemen allegedly asked him to go back to Agra. He said that it was later when he shared his ordeal on social media when he was contacted by the local police to register a complaint.Based on his complaint, a case was registered Saturday night against the unidentified persons at Sector 39 police station under section 392 (punishment for robbery) of the Indian Penal Code.Police officers said that the delay in filing the FIR was only due to the victim first going to a different police station which didn’t have jurisdiction over the case.“We filed a case as soon as the complaint came to us. A probe in the matter is underway and we are working on identifying the vehicle used in the crime,” said Azad Tomar, station house officer, Sector 39 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-man-robbed-of-valuables-on-pretext-of-lift/story-pWzy6OOZIxHGlNUXriSnGJ.html
27-07-2020||Noida||Noida: Homebuyers’ association to take over, finish delayed flats||For the first time, a homebuyers’ association of a residential highrise will takeover and complete the project their developer failed to deliver.Jaiprakash Associate Limited’s (JAL’s) Kalypso Court in sector 128, along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, was launched in 2007 and was to have 1,140 residential units. However, the developer missed its deadline 2010-2011, forcing the homebuyers’ association to approach the Uttar Pradesh real estate regulatory authority (UP-Rera) in 2019.Last week, the authority offered the buyers’ association -- progressive welfare society -- the job of completing it, invoking the UP-Rera Act.“As per the sections 7 and 8 of the Act, we have the option to deregister the project and invite the buyers’ associations to take over the stuck project and deliver the same,” said Balvinder Kumar, member, UP-Rera. “JAL gave its consent and we allowed the buyers’ association to take control.”Interestingly, the association decided to hire JAL as the contractor for the work, which includes completing the remaining 304 residential units.While JAL refused to comment, Jayesh Patel, the president of the association, said, “UP-Rera allowed us to hire JAL as a contractor. We did not have any issue with the quality of JAL’s work, only the delay. We hired JAL because they constructed the entire project so they can do a better job. Funding is also not a problem for us. We hope the construction work will be started in a week’s time and complete in 12 months.”This is not the first time that the UP-Rera has used these sections of the law.Earlier, the authority had offered to give a housing project in sector 119 to its buyers. But the promoter went to the national company law tribunal and the takeover never happened.Last week, along with Kalypso Court, two other projects -- Bhasin Group’s Festival City in sector 143 and PSA Impex’s Sampda Livia in Greater Noida -- were offered to their respective buyers’s associations. The Festival City is spread over 25 acres and has space for shops, offices and residential villas. It was launched in 2012 and supposed to be delivered by 2016, but the developer could only construct the civil structure .“We do not have any technical experience and also lack funds to finish such a big project. Therefore we have decided to not accept the RERA’s offer,” said Festival City welfare association president Rajiv Nijhawan.Satendar Singh Bhasin, its promoter, said that buyers could not take over the project in any case as there is an ongoingcase in Allahabad High Court against the Noida authority that had allegedly not allotted the land properly. “Until the land issue is decided in the high court, the buyers’ taking over is not possible,” said Bhasin.Similarly the Sampada Livia buyers are not too keen to take over the project. PSA Impex, which was to develop it, could only construct 10% of the ₹220 crore project of around 750 units that was to be delivered in 2012-13.“An association lacks the required strength to finish and deliver such a project. During this time no bank will fund such a project then how can we be deliver it,” said Kapil Chauhan, a member of the association.PSA Impex was not available for comment.“If the associations refuse the offer then we invite proposals from a new developer who may be interested in delivering the same,” Kumar UP-Rera.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-homebuyers-association-to-take-over-finish-delayed-flats/story-HfVNlO6eajAmCqxrJTUziO.html
27-07-2020||Noida||Noida expedites work on infrastructure projects||The Noida authority is racing against the time to finish ongoing infrastructure projects following the UP government directive that no project should miss the respective deadlines. The authority’s chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari has directed the staff to expedite the work on several projects such as the 4.5-km Bhangel road being built above Dadri road, 5.5-km Chilla elevated road, sector 71/51 underpass, an alternative route to Dadri road, cleaning of vacant plots and other works. “We have conducted a site inspection for many ongoing projects to ensure delivery within stipulated deadline. We have completed the piling work of 63 pillars on Bhangel elevated road and alternative route to Dadri road will be ready in a week’s time for the motorists,” said Rajeev Tyagi chief engineer of the Noida authority. As per the authority’s plan, the ₹468 crore Bhangel elevated is to be completed by December 2021. While the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown did affect the project, work is now at full swing at the site. Due to the construction work on this project, traffic snarls at Dadri road is common. To mitigate this, the authority decided to build two alternative routes in a week’s time- a 1.250-km link sector 110 to sector 107 T-point and 680-m connection from Gheja village to Bhangel village. “The tenders on these two roads were already done and the work has been expedited. Besides, we are desilting drains along these two roads to address water logging issues,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-expedites-work-on-infrastructure-projects/story-RIlIxZ5OP1k8GLoeHZ35CK.html
27-07-2020||Lifestyle||Covid-19: Animal lovers come together to save strays from accidents, make reflective collars at home||A group of animal lovers in Dehradun has come together to save strays from road accidents at night by pooling in money and making reflective collars at home to be put on stray animals. The group has also been supplying these collars to different parts of the country after taking orders through social media platforms. The initiative, a brainchild of Mugdha Khatri, a 21-year-old girl thought about making the reflective collars at home during lockdown after seeing stray animals getting injured in road accidents at night. An animal lover since childhood, she lost her job amid the pandemic and at present has been dedicating her time to rescue injured stray animals and taking care of them across the city. “As an animal lover, I have been rescuing stray animals or taking care of them by giving them food and medicines. This is when I observed that many stray animals get injured in road accidents at night as commuters are unable to see them while driving. It was then I thought about putting reflective collars on their neck so that the drivers could spot them from a distance and don’t hit them which might also lead to human loss of life or injury sometimes,” said Mugdha. She discussed the idea with her friend and fellow animal lover, Iram Naaz, who now helps her by stitching the collars at her home. “We both thought of buying the collars from the market but we found them costlier in comparison to the quality of the product. My friends suggested that we should make these at home. Once we researched more on how to make these collars at home, we bought the material initially from our own pocket. As we both are not earning at present, we decided to seek financial aid from others on social media. Mayank Maithani, Inderjit and Vidhi, the others in our group, came forward and helped us financially,” she said. Mugdha used the funds to buy reflective tapes, buckles and collars and started making the reflective collars at home. “It has been about a month since we started this initiative. We have made reflective collars for dogs, mules and cows on roads,” she said. Her group member and fellow animal lover Mayank said that they are also selling the home-made collars to animal lovers in all parts of the country. “Ours is not a business model but an initiative to help the strays. Hence we are selling the collars at Rs 50 against the cost of Rs 40. The profit earned is being used by us in buying medicines, food and other things for taking care of the stray animals,” said Mayank. “We have started selling the collars after taking the orders on social media. In the last two days we have got orders from Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Coimbatore, Indore, and other cities. We will continue this noble initiative and take care of the stray animals,” he adds.

27-07-2020||Pune||BJP, allies to milk producers’ demands with state-wide agitation||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), along with its allies, the Rayat Kranti Party (RKP), the Republican Party (Athawale faction), the Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP) and Shiv Sangram, will stage a state-wide agitation on August 1 to press for higher rates for milk producers. The decision was taken in Sunday’s “Mahayuti’ alliance meeting, according to BJP state general secretary Sujit Singh Thakur. The meeting was attended by BJP state president Chandrakant Patil, leader of opposition in the assembly Devendra Fadnavis, Mahadev Jankar, Sadabhau Khot, Vinayak Mete, Avinash Mahatekar, BJP Kisan Morcha state president Anil Bonde and others.Earlier, the party and allies agitated on July 21 to draw attention to the various demands of milk producers. However, the BJP leader said that since the state government has not accepted demands, they are planning to intensify the agitation from August 1. According to Thakur, due to the declining demand during the lockdown, milk producers are facing a huge crisis. The price of milk has fallen by Rs 16 as hotels and other businesses have stopped making purchases. “There is a situation where even the cost of production is not recovered due to the decline in demand. The state government had announced that milk will be purchased at Rs 25 per litre. However, government milk is being procured only from certain milk unions,” Thakur claimed. “Injustice is being done to other milk producers across the state. In such a situation a subsidy of Rs 10 per litre should be directly credited in the bank accounts of milk-producing farmers. A further subsidy of Rs 50 per kg for export of milk powder should be given, so also a procurement price of Rs. 30 per litre for cow’s milk,” said Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bjp-allies-to-milk-producers-demands-with-state-wide-agitation/story-bkkCQVceUpZsU8cdtNabNJ.html

The facility has oxygen cylinder, pulse oximeter, thermal gun, bed, bedding, food arrangement and others.“There will be obstacles, but with hard work, and working towards a healthy atmosphere among the members, there are no limits,” said SB Dhonde, chairman, Vedanta Co-operative housing society.“While setting up the in-house isolation facility we also have to take care that the other members of the society are safe,” said Dhonde.Committee members have procured and distributed masks, gloves and face shields for all the society guards, house-keeping staff and other support staff to ensure that they stay safe while they continue to provide services.The support staff consists of 12 security guards and 12 housekeeping personnel who were paid a bonus of Rs 1,200 each during the recent lockdown.“We requested members who have vacant flats if they could allow them to be used for isolation of patients,” said Dhonde.Swaraj Kalate is one of the investors in the society, who came forward and extended his support by giving two of his vacant flats to be turned into the quarantined centre, while the other society members take turns to serve meals to the patients and family members.“One of the key requirements from a medical readiness perspective was to have an oxygen cylinder available in case of emergency. We approached the builder Vinod Chandwani who supported by providing three oxygen cylinders for emergencies while a doctor within the society is on stand by when required,” added Dhonde.One of the patients at the society who tested positive for the virus said, “I tested positive along with my parents who are senior citizens, while my wife and my two children, six-month-old and 6six-year-old old tested negative. There was no one at home to take care of my wife during the lockdown, when society came forward to provide her meals, with each society member taking turns to offer us cooked meals even now.”Dr Sunita Engineer, senior medical incharge, Thergaon Hospital (D and G Ward), said, “This is a good initiative taken by the housing society. We are always there to guide such initiatives. Every housing society must provide such facility which will give timely help to asymptomatic patients and help the civic body which is struggling with a shortage of beds.”Dr Prasad Jawak, a resident of Vedanta Society, said, “I am a general practitioner and have a clinic at Rahatne. I am on stand by in case of emergencies at the quarantine unit, although all the patients are on a regular video conference with their respective doctors form Jehangir and Sahaydri hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/housing-society-in-wakad-sets-up-in-house-quarantine-facility/story-BW9Ah0xBkbTRhaXsUc1tjP.html

Yesterday, they threatened to terminate our service and said that we will force you to resign.”“Also, there are some of us who wanted to leave due to personal issues and had resigned, but their resignations have not been accepted,” she said.“The nurses have been left in the lurch by the hospital management which is denying them the benefits of higher pay and better facilities as required by the law. During Covid crisis, the nurses are being forced to work for hours at a stretch without any breaks,” said Marathe.“They have not been given Covid allowance and their current salary ranges between Rs 12,000- Rs 15,000. Each of the nurses is looking after as many as 15 patients,” said Marathe.According to him, the nurses wanted to air their grievances but management has flatly refused.“During the strike, the nurses have ensured that none of the emergency services of the hospital has been affected. They held the protest by adhering to all social distancing rules and directives of the health department,” he said.When contacted, Jehangir Hospital public relations officer Aarti Irani said, “Due to the current pandemic, the hospital currently is in no position to give any salary increments. Hospital is regular in giving monthly salary on time without any salary reduction or deferment across the hospital. All the hospitals across the state and country are going through the same hardships and Pune being the current epicentre of the disease, the load on the hospital is very.”“Currently, the hospital is managing around 120 Covid-19 positive patients, 70 other category patients and 120 home quarantine Covid-19 patients. “Jehangir Hospital is committed to offering the best care in this fight of Covid-19 pandemic,” said the management of the hospital.Zahir Shaikh, a male nurse, who hails from Karnataka and is working at the ICU for past one year said, “There are 22 patients in the ICU and the nursing staff is not enough which makes the task difficult. During the current ongoing Covid-19 crisis we are working tirelessly without any appreciation or motivation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/300-nursing-staff-stage-protest-at-jehangir-hospital-for-better-working-conditions-pay/story-DDnYgcsTB2XLqvzKeVnX7N.html

With just one electric crematorium bearing the burden of coronavirus deaths in the district, families are being forced to wait for up to three days to cremate their loved ones. The body of Covid-19 patient Sanjeev Nagpal, 49, who died due to non-availability of a ventilator bed on Friday, will be kept in the mortuary for three days before it will be consigned to flames. Manjeet Nagpal, brother of Sanjeev, alleged, “My brother died after the DMCH authorities informed us that there was no ventilator bed available in the hospital. We had decided to perform the cremation on Saturday, but when we reached the crematorium, we were told to wait till Monday.” “There are nearly 12 Covid-19 victims who are yet to be cremated,” said Ranjodh Singh, president of Ramgarhia Educational Trust, that is managing the crematorium located opposite to military complex at Dholewal. The cremation ground is dedicated to cremate bodies of coronavirus victims. “As per the Covid protocol, we can perform a maximum of four cremations a day. The authorities have shared a list of 12 victims, both from the district as well as outside the district, who have succumbed to the virus in the last couple of days. This has forced families to wait for up to three days to cremate their loved ones,” said Ranjodh. He said that neighbouring districts of Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Sangrur and Faridkot were also diverting cremations to the Ramgarhia crematorium. He said that the trust had so far cremated 69 Covid-19 victims. It was in April when Ranjodh had offered to cremate a Covid-19 victim after his kin had refused to perform the last rites.The Ramgarhia Educational Trust had spared one LPG crematorium for this purpose. “As the number of deaths is on the rise, we are planning to open another LPG operated chamber to speed up the cremation process,” said Ranjodh.Covid-19 fear driving people awaySince the crematorium is bearing the burden of coronavirus deaths, residents have stopped bringing bodies of their loved ones who died in accidents or due to any ailment.Some priests performing the last rites have been staying away from their families to keep them safe. “I am avoiding to visit home ever since I started performing the last rites. Sadly, the administration is not paying heed to our plight. We have not been provided prophylactic (preventive) treatment or an insurance cover,” said Pankaj, one of the priests here. Ranjodh said he had requested the authorities to provide an insurance cover to his four employees.Victims’ families refuse to collect ashes after last ritesRanjodh said that families of some coronavirus victims had not returned to the crematorium after the final rites to collect the ashes of their loved ones. “The ashes of 40 patients have not been collected by their families,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cremation-of-covid-19-victims-takes-a-hit-in-ludhiana-as-waiting-list-swells/story-5rIG49nDZ5iahzalTnWcZI.html

The panel will advise him on the pandemic.“Covid-19 has changed our world,” he told reporters from WHO’s Geneva headquarters on Monday. “It has brought people, communities and nations together — and driven them apart.”He cited some factors that have proven effective in some countries, including political leadership, education, increased testing and hygiene and physical distancing measures.“We are not prisoners of the pandemic. Every single one of us can make a difference,” Tedros said. “The future is in our hands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-accelerating-cases-doubled-over-past-6-weeks-who-chief/story-cvBYdhDhp2Vr2nlBgaIXwI.html

The first lady also hosted a state dinner for Australia in the garden last year.Plans described by the first lady include returning the Rose Garden to its original 1962 footprint with improved infrastructure and drainage and a better environment for the plants and flowers.The renovation also includes making the space more accessible for people with disabilities, and improvements for audiovisual and broadcasting needs, she said.“The very act of planting a garden involves hard work and hope in the possibility of a bright future,” said Mrs. Trump, who adds the garden project to a list of other White House renovations, including refurbishing the Red and Blue Rooms and building a tennis pavilion on the South Lawn.“Preserving the history and beauty of the White House and its grounds is a testament to our nation’s commitment to the care of this landscape and our dedication to American ideals, safeguarding them for our children and their children for generations to come,” she said.The renovation plan has been approved by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, an advisory committee. The project is also supported by the National Park Service, which cares for the White House grounds, and will be paid for using private donations, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-lady-melania-trump-announces-rose-garden-renewal-project/story-sl61fBmgm5lLW7aPYlPa4M.html
27-07-2020||World||Pilgrims arrive in Mecca for downsized hajj amid pandemic||Muslim pilgrims have started arriving in Mecca for a drastically scaled-down hajj, as Saudi authorities balance the kingdom’s oversight of one of Islam’s key pillars and the safety of visitors in the face of a global pandemic.The hajj, which begins on Wednesday, normally draws around 2.5 million people for five intense days of worship in one of the world’s largest gatherings of people from around the world.This year, Saudi Arabia’s Hajj Ministry has said between 1,000 and 10,000 people already residing in the kingdom will be allowed to perform the pilgrimage. Two-thirds of those pilgrims will be from among foreign residents in Saudi Arabia and one-third will be Saudi citizens.The kingdom has one of the Mideast’s largest outbreaks of the coronavirus, with nearly 269,000 reported infections, including 2,760 deaths.Fatin Daud, a 25-year-old Malaysian who is studying Arabic in Saudi Arabia, was among the select few whose application for hajj was approved. After her selection, Saudi Health Ministry officials came to her home and tested her for the COVID-19 virus. She was then given an electronic bracelet that monitors her movements, and told to quarantine for several days at home.After that, Daud was moved to a hotel in Mecca, where she remains in self-isolation, still wearing the electronic wristband. A large box of food is delivered to her hotel room three times a day as she prepares to begin the hajj.“It was unbelievable. It felt surreal because I was not expecting to get it,” she said of her excitement when she found out she was selected. Daud said she’s praying for the end of Covid-19 and for unity among Muslims around the world.“I am confident that safety measures are being taken and that the only thing that we need to do as pilgrims is follow instructions, and try our best to support each other,” she said.While self-isolating has been emotionally challenging, Daud said she is part of a group of about 10 Malaysian and Singaporean pilgrims connecting online and sharing tips and religious exercises to keep busy.The Saudi government is covering the expenses of all pilgrims this year, providing them with meals, hotel accommodation, transportation and health care. Normally, the hajj can cost thousands of dollars for pilgrims who save for a lifetime for the journey. It also generates billions of dollars in revenue each year for Saudi Arabia.Saudi kings have for generations assumed titles as custodians of Islam’s holiest sites, and their oversight of the hajj is a source of prestige and influence among Muslims globally. Saudi Arabia has never canceled the hajj in the nearly 90 years since the country was founded.King Salman, who typically oversees the hajj from Mecca, underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder at a hospital in the capital, Riyadh, the royal court said last week. The 84-year-old monarch was to remain at the hospital to recover and be observed by doctors.For the first time in Saudi history, no pilgrims from abroad were permitted to take part in the hajj due to concerns about the coronavirus and overcrowding. It’s a stark departure from previous years, when some 2 million pilgrims from more than 160 countries flocked to Mecca for the spiritual rituals, mostly from across Asia and Africa.Although the hajj often draws all age groups, pilgrims this year were required to be between the ages of 20 and 50, and in good health.The physically demanding rituals of the hajj offer a profound experience for Muslims, with the faithful often weeping, their palms stretched toward the sky, in prayer and repentance. The hajj is required of all able-bodied Muslims once in a lifetime.This year, international media were not given permission to cover the hajj from Mecca.Also this year, pilgrims must wear face masks and will only be able to drink holy water from the Zamzam well in Mecca that has been prepackaged in plastic bottles. Pebbles for casting away evil that are usually picked up by pilgrims along hajj routes will be sterilized and bagged before being distributed to the pilgrims.Pilgrims are also bringing their own prayer rugs and will be required to pray at a distance from one another, rather than packed shoulder-to-shoulder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilgrims-arrive-in-mecca-for-downsized-hajj-amid-pandemic/story-aaHovs2V6Sir8NKe7wEWoI.html

Incidentally, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is currently conducting a live-fire drill with “powerful ammunition” in the southern Guangdong province’s Leizhou peninsula, considered to be at the doorstep to the South China Sea (SCS).The week-long drills will include anti-ship and anti-aircraft exercises by the PLA air force with the PLA’s navy and rocket forces joining in.Writing for the SCSPI website on Monday, Wang Shicun, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies (NISCSS), said: “It (the US) has conducted six Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) so far this year, compared with four times in 2017, six times in 2018 and eight times in 2019. In addition, the U.S. military has conducted nearly 2,000 close-in reconnaissance operations on China from the air this year.”According to the think tank, US air force E-8C surveillance planes have come within 185km or less of the southeast coast of Guangdong province on four separate occasions in the past week.“At the moment the US military is sending three to five reconnaissance aircraft each day to the South China Sea,” the think tank said, adding the US military planes have come unusually close to mainland airspace several times since April.In this context, Wang from NISCSS wrote that chances were “…growing for an accidentally triggered incident between China and the U.S. As the US intensifies its military operation in the South China Sea, China will adopt corresponding countermeasures, such as tracking and monitoring as well as warning and expulsion. The more intensifying US military operations, the more chances for accidentally triggered incidents.”US warplanes flying close to China coincided with a tense week between the two countries in the backdrop of Washington and Beijing ordering the closure of consulates in Houston and Chengdu.The US consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu officially shut down on Monday morning within 72 hours of Beijing ordering its closure as a tit-for-tat shutting of its Houston consulate amid worsening ties between the two largest economies of the world.The SCSPI says on its website that it is an “international research network and not affiliated with any institution, mainly funded by social donation and non-profit investment.”The think tank’s director, Hu Bo, however, is also the director of the Centre for Maritime Strategy Studies and Research Professor at the Institute of Ocean Research, Peking University in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warplane-flew-less-than-100-km-from-shanghai-says-china-think-tank/story-1jwPu9806CzIiKHmW0K5oK.html
27-07-2020||World||European tourism faces turbulence only weeks after restart||Europe’s tourism revival is running into turbulence only weeks after countries reopened their borders, with rising infections in Spain and other nations causing increasing concern among health authorities over people bringing the coronavirus home from their summer vacations.European countries started opening up to each other’s tourists in mid-June, but recent events have shown that the new freedom to travel is subject to setbacks. Over the weekend, Britain imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from Spain, Norway ordered a 10-day quarantine for people returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France urged its citizens not to visit Spain’s Catalonia region.In Austria, the lakeside resort town of St. Wolfgang shortened bar opening hours after an outbreak was detected on Friday. By Monday, 53 people had tested positive, including many people working in the tourism industry.In Germany, officials decided last week to set up testing stations at airports to encourage people arriving from a long list of countries deemed high-risk — including popular destinations such as Turkey — to get tested. They will also allow people to get tested elsewhere for free within three days of arrival.Bavaria’s governor, Markus Soeder, said he is worried about travelers returning from vacation. Referring to the Austrian ski resort that was an early European hot spot in March, he said: “My worry is not that there will be one big Ischgl, but that there will be many mini-Ischgls.”Soeder called for tests of returning vacationers from risky areas to be made obligatory, something the federal government is considering.“Mostly it is the considerate people who have behaved very cautiously on vacation anyway who take up the voluntary offers, while those who are more careless don’t take a voluntary test,” Chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told RBB Inforadio.New infections in Germany have been creeping higher from a low level.The tourism industry employs 2.6 million people in Spain and generates 12% of the country’s economic activity.Juan Molas, the head of a national association of tourism companies, Mesa del Turismo, said Spain’s tourism sector has on average lost 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) a week since March.Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto said the Spanish government is trying to persuade Britain to exempt the Balearic Islands, which have a low infection rate, from the quarantine rule.“We’re living alongside the virus. That doesn’t mean we can’t travel. We can, if we are careful,” Maroto said.The Catalonia and Aragón regions have Spain’s most worrying virus clusters, prompting authorities to tighten restrictions in Barcelona, in a rural area around Lleida and in Zaragoza that were relaxed only a month ago.Catalonia is facing “the 10 most decisive days of this summer,” regional leader Quim Torra said, warning that it is in everyone’s hands to prevent a “critical situation” from worsening.Elsewhere in Europe, authorities in Belgium said COVID-19 cases are growing at an alarming rate amid a surge of infections in Antwerp. Greek authorities said they are likely to extend the mandatory use of masks at churches and shopping malls.And in North Africa, Morocco banned most travel to and from some major cities — including Tangier, Casablanca and Marrakech, usually a popular tourist destination — to stem a small spike in cases.In the Asia-Pacific region, many countries are still essentially banning foreign travelers or, if they do allow them to enter, requiring them to submit to tests and strict quarantine. That includes Australia, where the premier of Victoria state, Daniel Andrews, said the biggest driver in the region’s outbreak is people continuing to go to work after showing symptoms.The crossing of borders was linked to other outbreaks in Asia. South Korea said 16 of the 25 new cases it confirmed Monday were tied to people arriving from abroad. Over the past few days, the country reported dozens of cases among crew members of a Russia-flagged cargo ship and hundreds of South Korean construction workers airlifted from Iraq.A tally by Johns Hopkins University shows about 16.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and around 650,000 deaths. The actual numbers are thought to be much higher because of limits on testing and the many minor cases that have gone unreported.The World Health Organization said the pandemic continues to accelerate, with a doubling of cases over the past six weeks.The U.N. health agency’s emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, stressed the need to “keep pressure on the virus.”“Every single country where pressure has been lifted on the virus, where virus is still at community level, there’s been a jump back in cases,” he said.___Kurtenbach reported from Mito, Japan.

27-07-2020||World||China flood: Yangtze river in the throes of third flood peak, 45 million impacted||Torrential rain triggered the third flood peak of the Yangtze river on Sunday, putting the Three Gorges Dam under severe pressure as China grapples to mitigate the impact of the deluge that has already impacted more than 45 million people and resulted in losses worth billions of dollars.Authorities have issued warnings of possible new flood peaks in the near future, requiring the Three Gorges Dam to reserve enough space for possible floods.Warning against a new peak that may appear later, China’s water resources ministry said, “The flood control and flood fighting situation is severe.”The volume of water inflow that has entered the reservoir has reached 50,000 cubic meters per second, state media reports said, adding that the reservoir will see inflow volume of 60,000 cubic meters per second around Tuesday.By last week, China’s ministry of emergency had said that since June 1 the latest round of floods – possibly the worst since 1998 – had affected 45.52 million in 30 Chinese provinces including specific cities and counties.The situation remains grim the sprawling municipality of Chongqing located along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, was hit on Monday by the most severe flooding since the flood season started this year.“Residents living along the river have been urged to evacuate and stay away from the riverbank… a landslide has blocked a river in southwest China’s Chongqing City, forming a barrier lake that threatens nearby townships and a power station,” local authorities told state media.State media reports have said that massive flooding along the Yangtze river, which is the longest river in Asia, has displaced over 2 million people.The current round of flood in the Yangtze river is stronger than the first two rounds, as was the second round compared to the first.The first flood this year arrived at the dam on July 2 with a peak flow rate of 53,000 cubic meters while the second one, in the third week of the month, was at 55,000 cubic meters per second.Ahead of the second round of flood, water resources authorities was quoted by the state media as saying following continuous downpours in the upper reach of the Yangtze River, the “…Three Gorges Dam is being tested by the second floods this year in the Asia’s longest watercourse.”The dam’s maximum capacity is 175 meters. As of Monday, the reservoir level was at 159.46 meters, slightly lower than 164.18 meters from a week ago, reported news agency Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-flood-yangtze-river-in-the-throes-of-third-flood-peak-45-million-impacted/story-OSsPDfRJhpGLZQfQjGmYJN.html

Health officials reiterated their advice to wash hands regularly, including before and after contact with animals.All available evidence suggests that the cat contracted the coronavirus from its owners who had previously tested positive for Covid-19. The cat and its owners have since made a full recovery and there was no transmission to other animals or people in the household.Chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said: “This is a very rare event with infected animals detected to date only showing mild clinical signs and recovering within in a few days. There is no evidence to suggest that pets directly transmit the virus to humans”.Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England added: “This is the first case of a domestic cat testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK but should not be a cause for alarm. The investigation into this case suggest that the infection was spread from humans to animal, and not the other way round.Officials said the pet cat was initially diagnosed by a private vet with feline herpes virus, a common cat respiratory infection, but the sample was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 as part of a research programme.Follow-up samples tested at the laboratory confirmed the cat was also co-infected with SARS-CoV2 which is the virus known to cause Covid-19 in humans. There have been a very small number of confirmed cases in pets in other countries in Europe, North America and Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-uk-case-of-covid-19-in-pet-cat-detected/story-6oWYXSyJCSlMYhU5HGSzOJ.html
27-07-2020||World||Danish prince undergoes brain surgery in southern France||Prince Joachim, the youngest son of Queen Margrethe of Denmark, has undergone emergency surgery for a blood clot in his brain, the royal palace said.The 51-year-old prince, who had been on vacation in France, was admitted to the Toulouse University Hospital late on Friday and was immediately operated on. The palace said he is in a stable condition and that his French-born wife is by his side.Joachim married Marie Cavallier, with whom he has two children, in 2008, and she became Princess Marie. He also has two children from his first marriage to Hong-Kong born Alexandra Manley, who became Countess of Frederiksborg after their divorce in 2005, the first split in nearly 160 years in Europe’s oldest monarchy.Earlier this month, he was all smiles at the Danish queen’s summer residence in France, Chateau de Cayx, when he posed for a photo in connection with his oldest son’s 18th birthday.Joachim is sixth in the line to Denmark’s throne after his elder brother, Crown Prince Frederik, and his brother’s four children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/danish-prince-undergoes-brain-surgery-in-southern-france/story-2ozuLaQIDkljeoRjBtSL8M.html
27-07-2020||World||Trade, technology and security at risk in US-China feud||They have the largest economies in the world. They spend more than anyone else on their militaries. From high-tech chips to control of the high seas, their interests are closely intertwined.The ongoing sharp deterioration in U.S.-China ties poses risks to both countries and the rest of the world. In the latest escalation, a U.S. consulate in Chengdu in southwestern China shuttered Monday, ordered by China to close in retaliation for the U.S. shutting down its consulate in Houston last week.With the U.S. presidential campaign heating up, all bets are that relations with China will only get worse. A look at what’s at stake:TRADEBoth countries already have suffered heavy losses in a tariff war that erupted in 2018 over Beijing’s technology ambitions and trade surplus. If talks on ending the dispute fail, the world could face downward pressure on trade at a time when the global economy is already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.The United States is China’s biggest single-country export market, even after President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. And China is the No. 3 market for American exporters, as well as a huge market for goods and services produced in China by U.S. companies ranging from General Motors Co. to Burger King.Chinese purchases of American farm goods, semiconductors and other goods declined 11.4% last year but still exceeded $100 billion. Exports to China support just under 1 million American jobs, according to the U.S.-China Business Council, though that was down 10% from 2017’s peak.China is the biggest export market for Iowa and other American farm states, which were slammed when Beijing suspended imports of soybeans and raised tariffs on pork and other goods.That briefly boosted sales for soybean exporters in Brazil and Argentina, though China resumed buying lower-priced American beans under the “Phase 1” trade truce signed in January.But if the two can’t resolve broader differences on trade, it will be a blow not only to their exporters but also to other Asian economies that supply China’s factories with raw materials and components.___TECHNOLOGYU.S. and Chinese producers of telecom, computer, medical and other technology and their markets are tightly interwoven. Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and others rely on Chinese factories to assemble most of their smartphones, computers and other consumer electronics. Those factories need processor chips and other components from the United States, Japan, Taiwan and Europe.The disruption caused by moves including the Trump administration’s curbs on Chinese tech giant Huawei’s access to U.S. components and technology threatens to disrupt those flows and cost suppliers, including Silicon Valley companies, billions of dollars in lost revenue.China is also a top market for Apple and other U.S. tech brands, and is increasingly becoming a technology competitor with its own brands in smartphones, medical equipment and other fields.The United States often is the top market for China’s highest-value-added goods. Beijing has been urging exporters to find other markets, but many say Asian and even European markets won’t buy such high-value goods.___SECURITYWhile the U.S. has long been the predominant military power in the Pacific, China now has two operational aircraft carriers and an arsenal of missiles seen as a threat to U.S. vessels and bases in the region.Military tensions have largely focused on the South China Sea, a crucial waterway that is the subject of overlapping territorial claims by China and several smaller Asian nations.In 2018, a Chinese destroyer came perilously close to colliding with a U.S. destroyer, the USS Decatur, while executing what the Navy called an “unsafe and unprofessional maneuver” in the South China Sea.A Chinese fighter jet collided with a U.S. Navy surveillance plane in international airspace over the South China Sea in 2001, leading to major diplomatic incident after the U.S. plane made an emergency landing on a Chinese island.Taiwan is another potential flashpoint. China claims the self-governing island as its territory, to be taken by force if necessary. The U.S. is bound by its own law to ensure the island has a credible defense and has approved military sales to Taiwan under Trump.Taiwan’s foreign minister said last week that Chinese military flights near the island have been taking place on a near-daily basis, more frequently than previously reported.Washington upped the ante earlier this month by declaring that it did not recognize most of China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea, a break with its previous policy of not taking a stance on the sovereignty disputes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trade-technology-and-security-at-risk-in-us-china-feud/story-kJOnew8zpFL8B5rEutKadP.html
27-07-2020||World||World’s biggest Covid-19 vaccine study begins, a US trial that will include 30,000 people to see if shots really work||The world’s biggest Covid-19 vaccine study got underway Monday with the first of 30,000 planned volunteers helping to test shots created by the U.S. government -- one of several candidates in the final stretch of the global vaccine race.There’s still no guarantee that the experimental vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., will really protect.The needed proof: Volunteers won’t know if they’re getting the real shot or a dummy version. After two doses, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus still is spreading unchecked.“Unfortunately for the United States of America, we have plenty of infections right now” to get that answer, NIH’s Dr. Anthony Fauci recently told The Associated Press.Several other vaccines made by China and by Britain’s Oxford University earlier this month began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries.But the U.S. requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country and has set a high bar: Every month through fall, the government-funded Covid-19 Prevention Network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate -- each one with 30,000 newly recruited volunteers.The massive studies aren’t just to test if the shots work — they’re needed to check each potential vaccine’s safety. And following the same study rules will let scientists eventually compare all the shots.Next up in August, the final study of the Oxford shot begins, followed by plans to test a candidate from Johnson & Johnson in September and Novavax in October -- if all goes according to schedule. Pfizer Inc. plans its own 30,000-person study this summer.That’s a stunning number of people needed to roll up their sleeves for science. But in recent weeks, more than 150,000 Americans filled out an online registry signaling interest, said Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute in Seattle, who helps oversee the study sites.“These trials need to be multigenerational, they need to be multiethnic, they need to reflect the diversity of the United States population,” Corey told a vaccine meeting last week. He stressed that it’s especially important to ensure enough Black and Hispanic participants as those populations are hard-hit by Covid-19.It normally takes years to create a new vaccine from scratch, but scientists are setting speed records this time around, spurred by knowledge that vaccination is the world’s best hope against the pandemic. The coronavirus wasn’t even known to exist before late December, and vaccine makers sprang into action Jan. 10 when China shared the virus’ genetic sequence.Just 65 days later in March, the NIH-made vaccine was tested in people. The first recipient is encouraging others to volunteer now.“We all feel so helpless right now. There’s very little that we can do to combat this virus. And being able to participate in this trial has given me a sense of, that I’m doing something,” Jennifer Haller of Seattle told the AP. “Be prepared for a lot of questions from your friends and family about how it’s going, and a lot of thank-you’s.”That first-stage study that included Haller and 44 others showed the shots revved up volunteers’ immune systems in ways scientists expect will be protective, with some minor side effects such as a brief fever, chills and pain at the injection site. Early testing of other leading candidates have had similarly encouraging results.If everything goes right with the final studies, it still will take months for the first data to trickle in from the Moderna test, followed by the Oxford one.Governments around the world are trying to stockpile millions of doses of those leading candidates so if and when regulators approve one or more vaccines, immunizations can begin immediately. But the first available doses will be rationed, presumably reserved for people at highest risk from the virus.“We’re optimistic, cautiously optimistic” that the vaccine will work and that “toward the end of the year” there will be data to prove it, Dr. Stephen Hoge, president of Massachusetts-based Moderna, told a House subcommittee last week.Until then, Haller, the volunteer vaccinated back in March, wears a mask in public and takes the same distancing precautions advised for everyone -- while hoping that one of the shots in the pipeline pans out.“I don’t know what the chances are that this is the exact right vaccine. But thank goodness that there are so many others out there battling this right now,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-s-biggest-covid-19-vaccine-study-begins-a-us-trial-that-will-include-30-000-people-to-see-if-shots-really-work/story-aUibdMzwCTsRFZ1lnU0mlI.html

The number of fatalities rose by 57 to 4,838 as more hotspots emerged, making it the highest tally among Southeast Asian nations.The number of infections has almost quadrupled since the end of May as more cities and provinces, including the capital Jakarta and Indonesia’s second-largest city Surabaya, began easing curbs in early June.The pandemic threatens to send Indonesia’s economy into its first recession since the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, battering small and big businesses alike, according to Widodo. The outbreak has rendered millions of people jobless, and may plunge many more into poverty.Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, told his cabinet on Monday to expedite the spending of 695 trillion rupiah ($48 billion) in fiscal stimulus to revive the economy which is forecast to contract 4.3% in the second quarter. He also instructed health officials to focus on eight provinces, including capital Jakarta, which collectively account for about three-quarters of the nation’s total infections.The government has insisted in further opening Southeast Asia’s largest economy despite the rising caseload. Bali, Indonesia’s most popular holiday destination, is pressing ahead with a plan to welcome back foreign and domestic visitors even as the resort island reports a surge in new virus cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-coronavirus-cases-top-100-000-as-more-hotspots-emerge/story-0PB1ed79mm0rD9VxTPhlBN.html
27-07-2020||World||UN says Afghan civilian casualties down by 13% this year||Afghanistan saw a 13% drop in the number of civilians killed and wounded in violence across the country in the first six months of this year, compared to the same period last year, according to a UN report released Monday.The report credited the drop in casualties in part to the reduction of operations by international forces — which now only act when called upon and in support of the Afghan forces — and also to a decrease in the number of attacks by the Islamic State group.However, the report underscores the still heavy toll the conflict continues to inflict on the civilian population — and sends a harsh message to both the Taliban and the Afghan government forces, saying civilian casualties caused by the warring sides in the conflict continue to be high.The report comes against the backdrop of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal signed at the end of February and touted as the best hope for peace in Afghanistan after decades of war. While the US and NATO have already begun reducing their troop strength, the second phase of the deal — which calls for negotiations between the Taliban and the Kabul government — has been delayed. Much of the delays have been as a result of Kabul’s reluctance to free some Taliban prisoners identified for release as part of the agreement.The UN report said 1,282 people were killed in violence in the first six months of 2020 in Afghanistan and 2,176 were wounded. That represents an overall 13% decrease from the same period in 2019. The report said the U.N. had recorded 17 attacks by IS causing civilians casualties during the first six months of 2020, down from 97 attacks in the same period last year.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected the report, describing it as propaganda aimed at defaming the Taliban. He blamed airstrikes and heavy artillery by government forces and their allies, saying they are “responsible for the majority of civilian casualties.”The Afghan government, meanwhile, said the UN reports underscores the government’s own findings that the Taliban are responsible for the vast majority of the civilian casualties. The statement added that the recent increase in Taliban attacks comes despite the insurgents’ commitments under the US-Taliban deal.“At a time when the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban have a historic opportunity to come together at the negotiating table for peace talks, the tragic reality is that the fighting continues, inflicting terrible harm to civilians every day,” said Deborah Lyons, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Civilian casualties from airstrikes carried out by Afghan forces tripled in the first six months of the year, compared to the same time period last year. Afghan forces were responsible for 23% of the civilian casualties, while the Taliban were responsible for 43%, the report said.“I urge the parties to pause, to reflect on the chilling incidents and the harm that they are causing to the Afghan people as documented in this report, and to take decisive action to stop the carnage and get to the negotiating table,” said Lyons.Women and children continue to be disproportionately affected by the direct and indirect impacts of the armed conflict, comprising more than 40% of the total civilian casualties, meaning both the killed and the wounded, the report said.The report noted that children in Afghanistan are especially vulnerable to abuse by both sides, including being recruited for combat.Last week, a government airstrike killed at least 14 people in western Herat province, many of them women and children. Hundreds of people had gathered in the province’s Adraskan district to welcome home a former Taliban fighter freed from jail, when aircraft reportedly pounded the gathering.The government said the strike was being investigated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-afghan-civilian-casualties-down-by-13-this-year/story-iY2j8uWD4dhkTfeaMzBeZP.html
27-07-2020||World||‘I was too fat’: PM Boris Johnson launches UK fitness drive||Citing his own obesity – “I was too fat” – Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday launched a strategy to encourage Britons to exercise and be fit as new evidence showed that overweight people being infected by coronavirus are more likely to die or develop severe illness.The drive includes doctors prescribing cycling or running to patients, dedicated cycle lanes and pedestrianisation of more areas in cities across the UK, ban on junk food adverts on television and online before 9 pm, and cigarette pack-like calorie warnings on food items.Downing Street released a short video of Johnson on a walk with his dog on the grounds of the prime minister’s country residence, Chequers in Buckinghamshire, exhorting Britons to take fitness seriously and cut down on an unhealthy lifestyle.Recalling his near-death experience after being infected by the virus earlier this year, he said: “I always wanted to lose weight for ages and ages. Like many people I struggled with my weight”.“Since I recovered from coronavirus I’ve been steadily building up my fitness. I am at least a stone down. But when I went into ICU, when I was really ill, I was way overweight. I was too fat. I (now) start the day by going for a run with the dog”.Official figures show that nearly two-thirds (63%) of adults in England are overweight or living with obesity – and 1 in 3 children leave primary school overweight or obese, with obesity-related illnesses costing the National Health Service £6 billion a year.The urgency of tackling the obesity time bomb has been prompted by evidence of the link to an increased risk from the virus, with officials calling it a ‘wake-up call’. Nearly 8% of critically ill patients with the virus in intensive care units have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% of the general population.Johnson said: “Losing weight is hard but with some small changes we can all feel fitter and healthier. If we all do our bit, we can reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus – as well as taking pressure off the NHS”.Health secretary Matt Hancock added: “Everyone knows how hard losing weight can be so we are taking bold action to help everyone who needs it. When you’re shopping for your family or out with friends, it’s only fair that you are given the right information about the food you’re eating to help people to make good decisions”.“To help support people we need to reduce unhelpful influences like promotions and adverts that affect what you buy and what you eat. Taken together, supported by an inspiring campaign and new smart tools, will get the country eating healthily and losing the pounds”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-was-too-fat-pm-boris-johnson-launches-uk-fitness-drive/story-MT9FWl8Tl7qUHdGUioC4kO.html
27-07-2020||World||Australia’s consumer watchdog accuses Google of privacy breaches||Australia’s consumer watchdog launched court action against Google on Monday alleging the technology giant misled account holders about its use of their personal data.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s action in the Federal Court is the latest litigation Google has faced around the world over allegations of privacy breaches.The commission alleges the California-based company misled millions of Australians to obtain their consent and expand the scope of personal information that Google collects about users’ internet activity to target advertising.The allegations arise from Google’s move in 2016 to start combining users’ personal information in their Google accounts with information from the same users’ activity on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display ads.“We allege that Google did not obtain explicit consent from customers to take this step,” the commission’s chair, Rod Sims, said in a statement.“The ACCC considers that consumers effectively pay for Google’s services with their data, so this change introduced by Google increased the ‘price’ of Google’s services, without consumers’ knowledge,” Sims added.Google said it had cooperated with the watchdog in its investigation and that its account holders had been asked to “consent via prominent and easy-to-understand notifications.”“We strongly disagree with their allegations and intend to defend our position,” a Google statement said.Google has also been closely involved with the watchdog in recent months over the Australian government’s plan to make global digital platforms including Facebook pay for content siphoned from news media.The commission this week will release draft rules for the platforms to pay fair compensation for journalistic content after the coronavirus pandemic slashed advertising revenue for legacy media.British regulators want new rules to foster competition in digital advertising markets and rein in the industry’s dominant players, Google and Facebook.The Competition and Markets Authority have taken aim at the US tech giants in a report that recommends the British government adopt a new regulatory approach to governing big digital platforms making money from online ads.Google announced last month that it was tweaking its privacy settings to keep less data on new users by default, automatically and continuously deleting web and app activity as well as location history after 18 months.France’s highest administrative court last month upheld a fine of 50 million euros ($56 million) Google was ordered to pay for not being “sufficiently clear and transparent” with Android users about their data protection options.In Canada, Google abandoned its smart-city development in Toronto after more than two years of controversy over privacy concerns and amid economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.In the United States, New Mexico’s attorney general has filed a lawsuit in the District Court over allegations that Google illegally collected personal data generated by children in violation of federal and state laws.In Australia, it is not clear what penalty Google might face if the watchdog’s lawsuit succeeds. The commission has made multiple allegations of consumer law breaches, each carrying a potential maximum fine of 1.1 million Australian dollars ($780 million).Australia substantially beefed up penalties for such offences in 2018, but Google will be judged by the rules that applied in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-consumer-watchdog-accuses-google-of-privacy-breaches/story-LEwkikvDCS3Wq6OhRVB40O.html
27-07-2020||World||Hospitalised coronavirus patients have low risk of stroke: Report||Patients hospitalised with Covid-19 may have a lower risk of stroke, according to a study that found majority of afflicted patients had existing risk factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. The study, published in the journal Stroke, contradicts initial reports that suggested a significant risk of stroke in patients hospitalised with Covid-19. “While there was initial concern for a high number of strokes related to Covid-19, that has not been born out,” said Brett Cucchiara, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the US. “Importantly, while the risk for stroke in Covid-19 patients is low, it’s mostly tied to pre-existing conditions -- so physicians who do see stroke in hospitalised Covid-19 patients must understand the virus is not the only factor, and it’s necessary to follow through with normal diagnostic testing,” Cucchiara said. However, he said, there are still many unknowns and researchers need to continue investigating the linkage between stroke and Covid-19, particularly considering the racial disparities surrounding the disease. To evaluate the risk and incidence of stroke in Covid-19 hospitalized patients, the researchers analyzed data from 844 Covid-19 patients admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, and Pennsylvania Hospital, in the US, between March and May. The team also analysed the data for cases of intracranial hemorrhage or bleeding in the brain. Researchers found that 2.4 per cent of patients hospitalised for Covid-19 had an ischemic stroke -- the most common type of stroke, typically caused by a blood clot in the brain. They said the majority of these stroke patients had existing risk factors, such as high blood pressure (95 per cent) and a history of diabetes (60 per cent), and traditional stroke mechanisms, such as heart failure. Also, over one-third had a history of a previous stroke, according to the researchers. The results suggest that these cerebrovascular events in hospitalised Covid-19 patients are likely tied to existing conditions, and not the sole consequence of the virus, they said. However, the researchers said, other factors could be at play and require continued research. While the precise mechanisms linking cerebrovascular events to Covid-19 remain uncertain at this time, it has recently been reported that infection with Sars-CoV-2 causes inflammation and excessive blood clotting -- both could be potential mechanisms leading to stroke, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hospitalised-coronavirus-patients-have-low-risk-of-stroke-report/story-bEcafHT2VOZUn4G5j4hSeM.html

27-07-2020||World||China shuts down US mission in Chengdu city, US flag lowered at dawn||The US consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu officially shut down on Monday morning within 72 hours of Beijing ordering its closure as a tit-for-tat shutting of its Houston consulate amid worsening ties between the two largest economies of the world.The US flag at the consulate was lowered at dawn, a video published by the national broadcaster CCTV showed.A large number of police personnel were deployed around the mission with the roads leading to it cordoned off.The Chinese foreign ministry announced the closure of the mission in a short statement, saying the Chengdu consulate had closed at 10 am.“China’s competent authorities then entered through the front entrance and took over the premises,” the ministry said in the statement in English published on its website and circulated among the media through social media.The shutting of the US Chengdu consulate was in retaliation against Washington’s unexpected closure of China’s consulate in Houston, Texas, claiming the mission had been involved in espionage efforts.Announcing the closure of the Chengdu mission on Friday, China had given the Americans the same timeframe of 72 hours to shut it down as Beijing had been given in Houston, where last Tuesday, Washington told a livid China to “cease all operations and events”.The US’s Chengdu consulate was the nearest to the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).The shutting of it will now make it more difficult for the US to monitor the situation in TAR where the entry of diplomats and foreign journalists is banned.Opened in 1985, the US Chengdu consular district’s jurisdiction, according to the consulate website is “…made up of the Provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, as well as the Tibet Autonomous Region and Chongqing City Municipality.”On Saturday, the Chinese foreign ministry had expressed “strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition” to US law enforcement officers’ forced entry into the Chinese consulate general in Houston.US law enforcement officers on Friday forcibly entered the premises of the Chinese consulate general in Houston, the official news agency, Xinhua had reported.In response, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the premises of the Chinese consulate general in Houston are diplomatic and consular premises as well as China’s national property.Last week, Beijing had called the US’s decision to close the Chinese consulate in Houston an “unprecedented escalation” in Washington’s recent actions against China and warned of “legitimate and necessary” response against the decision.The tit-for-tat closing of consulates is sure to further sour the rapidly deteriorating bilateral ties with the two countries already at loggerheads over South China Sea disputes, the Hong Kong security bill, US arms-sales to Taiwan, the condition of minorities in Xinjiang, and the origin of the coronavirus besides an ongoing trade war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-shuts-down-us-mission-in-chengdu-city-us-flag-lowered-at-dawn/story-lXcaysdMaEJiMyKcOBZ3ZK.html
27-07-2020||World||US envoy to Seoul shaves off controversial moustache||The most controversial moustache in South Korea has fallen victim to the razor’s blade, with US ambassador Harry Harris visiting a traditional barbershop months after his facial hair became the object of unusual criticism.Seoul and Washington are security allies and the US stations 28,500 troops in the country.But their relationship has been strained in recent years by differences in their approaches to North Korea and over cost-sharing responsibilities.Harris has several times been the object of controversy in the South, and accused of high-handedness. Even his facial hair became an issue of debate.The envoy’s mother was Japanese and, with Koreans still bitterly resentful of Tokyo’s 1910-45 colonisation of the peninsula, commentators claimed the moustache alluded to the fashions of imperial governors-general from the period.In January Harris retorted that his grooming was a matter of personal choice, and that his critics were “cherry picking history”.But over the weekend he uploaded a video to social media of him getting the moustache shaved off at a traditional Korean barbershop, saying he did so to keep cool in the Seoul summer, while wearing a mask to fight the coronavirus pandemic.“Glad I did this,” the envoy said in a tweet. 잘한 결정이라고 생각합니다. 콧수염을 기르고 마스크까지 착용하기엔 서울의 여름은 매우 덥고 습합니다. 코로나 지침이 중요하니 마스크는 필수죠! 오 사장님을 뵙게 되어 반가웠고 #한미동맹 을 중요하게 생각해주셔서 매우 감사했습니다. https://t.co/pqfIQshM2g“For me it was either keep the ‘stache or lose the mask. Summer in Seoul is way too hot & humid for both. #COVID guidelines matter & I’m a masked man!”Seoul and Tokyo are both major US allies, democracies and market economies faced with an overbearing China and nuclear-armed North Korea, but are locked in bitter disputes over historical issues.Earlier this year Harris said: “I understand the historical animosity that exists between both of the countries but I’m not the Japanese American ambassador in Korea, I’m the American ambassador to Korea.“And to take that history and put it on me simply because an accident of birth I think is a mistake.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-to-seoul-shaves-off-controversial-moustache/story-uA1sl4Hc7KQRYW8IBuuCgI.html

27-07-2020||World||Saudi Arabia gears up for downsized hajj amid Covid-19 pandemic||Saudi Arabia on Wednesday begins hosting the annual hajj pilgrimage, dramatically downscaled due to the coronavirus pandemic that has barred millions of international pilgrims for the first time in modern history.Up to 10,000 people residing in the kingdom will participate in the Muslim ritual, a tiny fraction of the 2.5 million that attended last year, after what many saw as an opaque selection process that left a wave of applicants rejected.The foreign press are barred from this year’s hajj, usually a huge global media event, as the government tightens access to the holy city of Mecca and puts in place strict health restrictions to prevent a virus outbreak during the five-day pilgrimage -- a key pillar of Islam.Saudi Arabia has recorded more than 260,000 cases of the novel coronavirus, while the number of declared global infections exceeded 16 million on Sunday. Mask-clad pilgrims began trickling into Mecca over the weekend and were subject to temperature checks and placed in quarantine, authorities said.They were given elaborate amenity kits that include sterilised pebbles for a stoning ritual, disinfectants, masks, a prayer rug and the ihram, a seamless white garment worn by pilgrims, according to a hajj ministry programme document.Pilgrims are required to be tested for coronavirus before arriving in Mecca and will also have to quarantine after the pilgrimage. The ministry said it has set up multiple health facilities, mobile clinics and ambulances to cater to the pilgrims, who will be required to observe social distancing.‘Golden ticket’ Saudi authorities initially said only around 1,000 pilgrims residing in the kingdom would be permitted for hajj but local media reports say as many as 10,000 will be allowed.The hajj ministry has fielded a deluge of anguished queries on Twitter from rejected applicants.But Hajj Minister Mohammad Benten insisted the process was transparent, telling the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya television that “health determinants” formed the basis of selection.The ministry said non-Saudi residents of the kingdom from around 160 countries competed in the online selection process.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt said foreign residents would make up 70 percent of all selected pilgrims.But it did not explain how many applied, and some disappointed pilgrims have complained that the government-run lottery was not clearly outlined and say no reason was given for their rejection.Among the chosen few is Nasser, a Riyadh-based Nigerian expatriate, euphoric at winning what he called the “golden ticket” to hajj.“This feeling cannot be described,” he told AFP before his arrival in Mecca.The ministry has said the Saudi pilgrims were selected from a pool of health practitioners and military personnel who have recovered from Covid-19.To be among the chosen ones adds an aura of religious prestige to this year’s pilgrimage, applicants say.Despite the pandemic, many pilgrims consider it is safer to participate in this year’s ritual without the usual colossal crowds cramming into tiny religious sites, which make it a logistical nightmare and a health hazard.Even in a regular year, the hajj leaves pilgrims exposed to a host of viral illnesses.‘Substantial cost’ The government scaled back the pilgrimage as it could be a major source of contagion, but the move will deepen the kingdom’s economic slump, analysts say. It comes as Saudi Arabia faces a sharp downturn in oil prices due to a collapse in global demand driven by national lockdowns, which triggered austerity measures including the tripling of a value added tax and cuts to civil servants’ allowances.The virus has also battered pilgrimage-reliant businesses that support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Mecca, from travel agents to street barbers and souvenir shops.Many have reported sweeping layoffs, pay cuts or delayed salaries.Mecca has seen a construction boom in recent years that added shopping malls, apartments and luxury hotels, some offering spectacular views of the sacred Kaaba, a cube-shaped structure in the Grand Mosque towards which Muslims around the world pray. But most premises have lain empty since the pandemic reached the kingdom.Saudi authorities had already in March suspended the umrah pilgrimage, which can be performed at any time.The pilgrimages together rake in some $12 billion (10.3 billion euros) annually, keeping the economy humming in Mecca.“Limiting this year’s hajj to Saudi residents comes at a substantial but surmountable cost to the economy,” the Eurasia Group’s Sofia Meranto told AFP.“Against the backdrop of daily infection rates still (remaining) high, the government is prioritising healthcare... over short-term economic costs, hoping to recoup lost revenue by next hajj season or by resuming umrah earlier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-gears-up-for-downsized-hajj/story-IbAMwEIoigGy6P1eGfOTHL.html

Should Douglas do so, it will be only the third storm in modern history, the last two being Hurricane Dot in 1959 and Hurricane Iniki in 1992.Earlier Sunday, Hurricane Hanna was downgraded to a tropical storm after lashing coronavirus-hit Texas.A hurricane warning was in effect for Maui county, although local media reported that skies began clearing over the island by mid-afternoon. Maui mayor Mike Victorino said there were no reports of serious damage.Hurricane warnings were also in effect for Kauai county, as well as Oahu -- the island on which Honolulu, a city of just under 350,000 -- is located.“Gradual weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, but Douglas is expected to remain a hurricane as it moves through the islands,” the National Hurricane Center said earlier Sunday.The NHC said the storm was expected to bring life-threatening and potentially destructive surf and rainfall of up to 15 inches on higher terrain.In Honolulu, Mayor Kirk Caldwell opened evacuation centers with space for 1,600 people -- but warned they should be used as a “last option” and that those needing shelter would need to have a mask or face covering, have their temperature taken and comply with social distancing requirements, local media reported.“If you are sheltering away from home today, please remember that #Covid19 is not taking a break for the storm. Please continue to wear a mask and physically distance as much as is practical,” Caldwell tweeted Sunday evening.Roads flooded in Texas Storm Hanna, meanwhile, was downgraded to a tropical depression Sunday.It was still packing winds of around 35 miles (55 kilometers) an hour as of 4:00 pm (2100 GMT), after crossing from the Lone Star state over northeastern Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said, adding it should dissipate by Monday.There were no immediate reports of casualties or widespread damage, and both Mexico and Texas had lifted all coastal storm warnings by afternoon.Damage appeared limited in the immediate aftermath of Hanna’s arrival on Padre Island, a 110-mile-long barrier island off the Texas coast, around 5:00 pm (2200 GMT) Saturday. Images captured by CBS showed roads and a caravan park in the Texas coastal city of Corpus Christi strewn with debris and downed trees.Some motorists even braved flooded roads, while one hardy storm-watcher was seen calmly taking pictures of the beach from a wind-swept promenade.Local authorities were readying for the possibility of tornadoes into the evening in southern Texas, as the American Red Cross opened three shelters across the state in preparation.Images shared by the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi showed water lapping at the city’s bayfront Art Museum of South Texas. The Texas State Aquarium said it would be closed following some storm damage. Hanna hit as Texas faces a huge surge in Covid-19 infections, with officials instituting a state-wide mask mandate to curb the spread of the disease.The US is the hardest-hit country in the coronavirus pandemic, with some 4.2 million cases, and authorities will have to figure out how to safely shelter residents forced out of their homes by future hurricanes this season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-douglas-threatens-hawaii-as-hanna-downgrades-to-tropical-storm/story-hLmi7iZ7ggH1k11LmHv5MM.html

The rover will seek signs of ancient life and collect rock and soil samples for possible return to Earth, the US space agency said. “We’re going back to Mars! @NASAPersevere will be launching soon for its seven-month journey to the Red Planet. And it’s bringing along a friend: a helicopter named Ingenuity!” NASA tweeted on Sunday.The rover is expected to launch on July 30 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and is expected to land at Mar’s Jezero Crater in February 2021. The crater is a giant basin which is believed to have once contained water. The rover will be landing in a place with high potential for finding signs of past microbial life. “Perseverance will also be collecting important data about Mars’ geology and climate,” NASA said in a press release.Also read: NASA’s summertime on Saturn image amazes peopleWe’re going back to Mars! @NASAPersevere will be launching soon for its seven-month journey to the Red Planet.

US and European lawmakers have recently stepped up their focus on how tech companies treat user data due to privacy concerns.“We are taking this action because we consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.The regulator alleges Google used the combined data to boost targeted advertising - a key source of income - and that it did not make clear to consumers about changes in its privacy policy.The regulator did not say what it wanted the court to do, adding that it has filed the claim on a “confidential basis pending claims by Google.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-regulator-sues-google-over-expanded-personal-data-use/story-yQk6qgfbNFZDPTm25iQMZO.html

The protest was led by Canadians with ancestral roots from mainland China, Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, India and Philippines. The protestors stood in opposition to China’s treatment of people in Hong Kong and Tibet. They urged the international communities to intervene to get two Canadians, Michael Korvig and Michael Spavor, released who have been held hostage by the Chinese government The protest rally received an overwhelming response similar to a previous demonstration which was carried out earlier this month.

Due to Covid-19 pandemic, each group was allowed to bring a maximum of 50 people only. This comes just a week after a massive protest took place in Toronto against the Chinese communist regime for its expansionist policies. The protest saw over a hundred people participate in the rally wherein the speakers urged the Chinese communist party to free Tibet and Hong Kong, opposed Chinese aggression in Ladakh and raised the issue of human rights violations against Uyghurs.Ties between Canada and China have been strenuous since 2018 when Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the Chief Financial Officer of Huawei, under the US warrant. After Meng was detained, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovri, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, on charges of espionage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-protest-held-in-vancouver-against-china-s-communist-regime/story-5FuktJILrka3mTNhnkRNSJ.html

To a certain extent, we can say that it is for the sake of China. Getting a gun is not as easy as signing an invoice after receiving a weapon.”“They say that the work on delivering these weapons is quite complicated. While China has to send personnel for training, Russia also needs to send a lot of technical personnel to put the weapons into service,” Sohu said.Post-Russia’s announcement, China has reportedly said that Moscow was forced to make such a decision as it “is worried that the delivery of S-400 missiles at this time will affect the anti-pandemic actions of the People’s Liberation Army and does not want to cause trouble to China.”Also Watch | ‘Closing more Chinese consulates in US always possible’: Donald Trump In 2018, China received the first batch of S-400 missile, a military diplomatic source told Russia’s TASS news agency.The S-400 air defence missile system is considered the most advanced of its kind in Russia, capable of destroying targets at a distance of up to 400 kilometres and a height of up to 30 kilometres.Russia’s suspension of S-400 missiles to China comes after Moscow had earlier accused Beijing of spying, despite the two countries enjoying considerably good relations over the years.Russian authorities have found Valery Mitko, president of its St Petersburg Arctic Social Sciences Academy, guilty of handing over ‘classified materials to the Chinese intelligence,’ TASS reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-another-setback-to-china-russia-suspends-deliveries-of-s-400-missiles-report/story-BjFvo3A1cMlJq4jWRfODhL.html
27-07-2020||World||China pressurises Vietnam to cancel, compensate offshore firms operating in South China Sea||Amid the growing Chinese movement in the South China Sea, Vietnam has agreed to pay around a billion dollars to two international companies after cancelling their drill operations following pressure from Beijing, The Diplomat reported.To maintain its presence in the South China Sea region, China, for several years, continued its efforts to prevent the Vietnam-based companies developing oil and gas resources in the area.Citing a well-placed oil industry source, Bill Hayton, author of the article, said, “Vietnam’s state-owned energy company PetroVietnam will pay the money to Repsol of Spain and Mubadala of the United Arab Emirates in ‘termination’ and ‘compensation’ arrangements.”Meanwhile, Russian energy company Rosneft has been forced to suspend its plans for drilling offshore even as China Coast Guard vessels continue operating in the area where the drilling was supposed to place.In another instance, a drilling rig standing in the Vietnamese port of Vung Tau for two months has been stood down. “Its owners, Noble Corporation, noted that the contract “includes a termination payment. This is likely to cost Vietnam several million dollars more,” the author said.Similarly, Repsol, once one of the largest players in Vietnam’s offshore industry and owning rights in 13 blocks of the seabed, had to cancel its planned exploration drill in July 2017 and again on March 2018.Hayton said, “With minimal interests in China, Repsol appeared ready to withstand political pressure from Beijing. Two of its best development prospects were particularly bold: located at the far edge of Vietnam’s claimed exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and well within the U-shaped, nine-dashed line drawn on Chinese maps since 1948...”Repsol executives were reportedly informed that the cancellations were a political decision, ordered by top Vietnamese leadership, following extreme pressure from China, Hayton said.The author said, “China had assembled a flotilla of 40 naval ships off the coast of Hainan Island, about two days’ sailing from the drill site, and it appeared to be ready for confrontation.”As compensation for the investments made by Repsol and Mudabala, Vietnam is paying USD 800 million for their rights in the blocks and a further USD 200 million, Hayton quoted a regional oil industry source with knowledge of the settlement as saying.“This will be a billion dollars that PetroVietnam would otherwise have paid into the Vietnamese government’s budget.”As China’s pressure on Vietnam continues, recently, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said, “The United States rejects any PRC maritime claim in the waters surrounding Vanguard Bank (off Vietnam), Luconia Shoals (off Malaysia), waters in Brunei’s EEZ, and Natuna Besar (off Indonesia). Any PRC action to harass other states’ fishing or hydrocarbon development in these waters - or to carry out such activities unilaterally - is unlawful.”Extending help to Vietnam on the matter, he said, “America stands with our South-East Asian allies and partners in protecting their sovereign rights to offshore resources, consistent with their rights and obligations under international law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pressurises-vietnam-to-cancel-compensate-offshore-firms-operating-in-south-china-sea/story-VrhQwQUo9nFY92vfz3TrSO.html

27-07-2020||World||UK plans to fight obesity with ad bans, more calorie labels||The UK imposed strict new limits on junk food advertising as ministers seek to control the country’s growing obesity problem, which has also been identified as a factor in coronavirus deaths.Plans include banning the advertising of foods high in fat, sugar or salt on television and online before 9pm, the country’s health and social care department said Monday. The government will also end buy-one-get-one-free promotions on sugary treats and require calorie labels on more products in stores as well as in restaurants. It’s starting a consultation on putting calorie counts on alcoholic beverages.“Losing weight is hard, but with some small changes we can all feel fitter and healthier,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. “If we all do our bit, we can reduce our health risks.”The curbs pile more pressure on food, retail, advertising and media industries already suffering from the economic lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus pandemic, with thousands of jobs under threat. They’re also a change of tack for Johnson, who’s previously complained about “nanny state” meddling in the lives of ordinary people. But the pandemic and his own brush with death in April persuaded him of the need to act on obesity.Almost two-thirds of British adults are overweight and one in three children leave primary school weighing too much, the health department said. Being too heavy also puts people at greater risk from coronavirus and places additional strain on the National Health Service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plans-to-fight-obesity-with-ad-bans-more-calorie-labels/story-Y3Uxos6WTV2tm4cdcags8K.html

27-07-2020||World||New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern’s ratings sky high ahead of election||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s party raced ahead of rivals in the latest opinion poll, putting the charismatic 40-year-old leader on track for a comfortable victory in the elections in September.A Newshub-Reid Research Poll released late on Sunday showed the popularity of Ardern’s Labour Party rose to 60.9%, the highest it has been in the poll’s history.The popularity of the main opposition National Party, which has been embroiled in a series of scandals and leadership changes, plunged to 25.1%.According to the survey the Labour Party, which is now in a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, would win 77 of 120 seats in parliament. This means Labour would be able to govern without a coalition partner.Ardern’s own popularity as preferred prime minister was sky high at 62%, while the National Party’s newly elected 61-year-old leader Judith Collins stood at just 14.6%.Ardern has consistently polled ahead of her rivals and her popularity has risen further this year as she won global praise for her leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic.The country of 5 million people has had just 1,206 Covid-19 cases so far, and 22 deaths.Ardern’s stratospheric rise in 2017 to become New Zealand’s youngest prime minister and third woman to hold the office has been dubbed “Jacinda-mania” by some.“I would like to think the message we can take from this is the general support for the government’sCovid-19 recovery and response plan,” Ardern told Newshub on Monday in response to the survey.National Party campaign chairman Gerry Brownlee said the poll is a “rogue”.Collins told Reuters last week that she was confident her party would form the next government.Ardern, who turned 40 on Sunday, told Newshub she celebrated with her partner and her two-year-old daughter doing normal things like going to the beach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-s-ratings-sky-high-ahead-of-election/story-CkUvWGAbdMnVdxqKR99MtL.html
27-07-2020||World||Over 60 killed in renewed violence in Sudan’s Darfur: UN||A new bout of violence in Sudan’s war-torn Darfur region has left more than 60 people dead, the United Nations said Sunday. The clashes threaten to derail a fragile transition to democracy more than a year after the military’s ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Sudan said about 500 armed men on Saturday attacked the village of Masteri, located 48 kilometers (30 miles) south of Genena, the provincial capital of West Darfur province. The clashes between the Masalit and other Arab tribes in the area started earlier Saturday and lasted until late Sunday, state-run SUNA news agency reported, citing unnamed sources. Local authorities asked for military reinforcements to halt the clashes, the report said. The SUNA report did not provide a death toll, but said dozens of people were killed or wounded, and more than 60 wounded were taken by helicopter to Genena for treatment. An unconfirmed number of houses were looted and burned in the village, along with half the local market, OCHA said. The village borders Chad. The attack prompted around 500 people to start a protest camp in front of the Masalit Sultan House, a settlement hosting about 4,200 internally displaced persons in Masteri, the UN agency said. The protesters called for authorities to protect them from attacks. Sudan is on a fragile path to democracy after a popular uprising led the military to overthrow al-Bashir in April 2019. A military-civilian government now rules the country until elections, possibly in late 2022. Such clashes pose a challenge to government efforts to end decades-long rebellions in areas like Darfur, where most people live in camps for the displaced and refugees. Al-Bashir faces international charges of genocide and crimes against humanity over a scorched-earth campaign against rebels in Darfur in the 2000s.Saturday’s attack was the latest in a series of attacks in the area. OCHA documented at least seven from July 19-26 which left dozens dead or wounded. Last week, local authorities in West Darfur declared a 24-hour curfew in Genena, compromising access to nutrition, water and sanitation, education, health and other critical services, OCHA said. The clashes have come in the middle of the agricultural season, increasing humanitarian needs in the region. About 2.8 million people in the Darfur region are estimated to be severely food insecure from June to September, more than 545,000 of them in West Darfur alone, OCHA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-60-killed-in-renewed-violence-in-sudan-s-darfur-un/story-uioxPu8MoJo1FseKrNyEyO.html

27-07-2020||India||5 sites ready in India for final phase of human trials of Oxford Covid-19 vaccine: Govt||Five sites across the country are ready for the third and final phase of human trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, Department of Biotechnology (DBT) Secretary Renu Swarup said on Monday.This is an essential step because it is necessary to have data within the country before the vaccine is administered to Indians, Swarup told PTI.The Serum Institute of India, the largest vaccine maker in the world, has been chosen by Oxford and its partner AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine once it is ready. Trials results for the first two phases were published earlier this month. According to Swaroop, the DBT is part of any Covid-19 vaccine effort in India “… whether it is funding, whether it is facilitating the regulatory clearances or whether it is giving them access to different networks which exist within the country”.“The DBT is now setting up Phase 3 clinical sites. We have already started working on them and five sites are now ready to be available for Phase 3 trials,” Swarup told PTI in a telephonic interview.The Pune-based SII has also sought permission from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for conducting Phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials of the potential vaccine. It had said earlier it will start manufacturing the vaccine even before the final nod so it is ready with sizable volumes once the vaccine gets all permissions.“DBT is closely working with every manufacturer and Phase 3 trial of Serum (institute) is important because if the vaccine has to be successful and it has to be given to the Indian population we need to have the data within the country. “For that a Phase 3 trial has been proposed. Five sites are ready. Within some more weeks, they should be ready for manufacturers to take them up for clinical trial studies,” the DBT secretary said. On July 20, scientists announced that the coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University appears safe and induces a strong immune response within the body after the first phase of “promising” human trials against the deadly disease that has infected over 1.45 crore people across the world and claimed more than six lakh lives. Doses of the vaccine were given to 1,077 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 in five UK hospitals in April and May as part of the Phase 1 clinical trial and results, published in The Lancet medical journal. The results show they induced strong antibody and T-cell immune responses for up to 56 days after they were given. T-cells are crucial for maintaining protection against the virus for years. The findings are seen as promising, but experts feel it is too soon to know if this is enough to offer protection as larger trials get underway. Scientists behind the trials found the response could be even greater after a second dose.In Phase 1 of human trials, a vaccine is given to a small number of people to test safety. It is also given to check if it stimulates the immune system.In the second phase, it is administered to hundreds of people split into groups such as children and the elderly to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. The two phases focus on safety and immunogenicity in humans.In the third phase, the vaccine is administered to thousands of people. In India, two indigenous vaccines – one by Zydus Cadila and the other by Bharat Biotech – have reached the stage of phase one of human trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-sites-ready-in-india-for-final-phase-of-human-trials-of-oxford-covid-19-vaccine/story-2C2p5NyqUtUiAxBZChJezO.html
27-07-2020||India||Is female nudity obscenity? Plea asks Supreme Court to decide||A plea in the Supreme Court has sought examination on whether female nudity would per se constitute obscenity necessitating invocation of penal provisions by authorities under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Information Technology Act (IT Act)The petition, an anticipatory bail plea, has been filed by Fathima AS, an activist from Kerala, who is apprehending arrest for offences under POCSO Act and IT Act after she uploaded a video on social media of her two minor children painting her naked body.“The petitioner, while being semi-nude, has allowed her body to be used a canvas for her children to paint on and there can probably be nobody, except a pervert, who would be aroused to sexual desire by seeing the nature of the work,” the petition drawn by advocate Renjith Marar said.A case was registered against Fathima after she uploaded the video on social media in June which later went to stir furore for offences of child pornography under POCSO Act for publishing such content which is an offence under the IT Act.The Kerala high court had rejected her anticipatory bail plea on July 24.“The petitioner feels that, she should teach sex education to her children. For that purpose, she asks her children to paint on her naked body and then uploading the same in social media. I am not in a position to agree with the petitioner that she should teach sex education to her children in this manner”, the high court had said in its order.Fathima contended that female nudity per se will not constitute obscenity and children painting on their mother’s body cannot be construed as child abuse.Moreover, the message accompanying the uploaded edited video makes it clear that she intended to normalize the female form for her children and not allow distorted ideas of sexualisation to pervade their mind, Fathima submitted.She also cited two Supreme Court judgments in this regard to make a case for her argument. First was the 2014 judgment in Aveek Sarkar v. State of West Bengal in which the top court held that a photo taken by a father of his semi-nude daughter and nude son-in-law who were black and white respectively was intended to convey an anti-apartheid message and cannot be dubbed obscene.The second judgment referred to was the famous case of Bobby Art International v. Om Pal famously known as the Bandit queen case. In this case, the movie which depicted the life of bandit turned politician late Phoolan Devi, had nude scenes. The court, however, held that nudity in the movie was not intended to arouse base desires but should be considered in the context of the story and the situation in the movie.“Goddesses in Kerala are frequently depicted in idols and murals with bare breasts. When one prays at the temple, the feeling is not of sexual arousal but one of divinity. The body painting of men is part of pulikali (a folk dance in which men dance with their bodies painted with tigers and leopard prints). It cannot suddenly become obscene when the same is done on a woman”, the plea claimed. Fathima had earlier attracted controversy when she attempted to enter Sabarimala temple in 2018 after the Supreme Court had struck down a law prohibiting entry of women in the hill top shrine in Kerala. She had to abandon her journey in the wake of massive protests by a violent mob of around 200 persons who had blocked her path after she reached the shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-female-nudity-obscenity-plea-asks-supreme-court-to-decide/story-oL8eYVY8rtSMzm5QyfGsZL.html
27-07-2020||India||Dissent mars BJP’s first anniversary of returning to power in Karnataka||Even as the B S Yediyruappa led Bharatiya Janata Party government kick-started celebrations of its first anniversary of returning to power by releasing a booklet on its achievements, dissidence broke out among party legislators after the government released a list of names to head 24 different state-owned boards and corporations.Earlier in the day the government held an event at the majestic banquet hall of Vidhana Soudha in which Yediyurappa said, “The achievements in the first year despite the various constraints including financial and the virus pandemic has been stupendous. I promise that in the rest of the term we will provide a stable government and aim for even greater progress of the state.” The CM said amongst other measures that the government had implemented were land reforms and new industrial policy to boost growth in the state.The government also released a list of names of 24 legislators to head various state run corporations and boards. Several of the legislators nominated to head the various boards and corporations had been threatening to turn dissidents as they had not got a ‘share of power’ while defectors from Congress and the Janata Dal (S) had been made ministers.Thirthalli MLA, Araga Jnanendra was made the Chairman of Karnataka Housing Board, Hollalkere MLA M Chandrappa that of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, Raju Gowda of Surapur named as Karnataka state urban water supply and drainage board, Sagar MLA, H Halappa was to head Mysore Sales International Ltd apart from 20 other party legislators being given other nominations.However, within hours of the announcement, some of the legislators expressed unhappiness at the ‘minor’ and ‘non-lucrative’ boards and corporations they were given to head. Chitradurga MLA G H Thippa Reddy speaking to HT said “I have been a six term MLA and was a ministerial aspirant. Being made Chairman of merely the Backward Classes Development Corporation for a person like me who has been such a senior legislator is an insult. I don’t want to accept it and I am happier serving people as a mere legislator.”Analysts also pointed out that in the case of Lalaji Mendon the legislator from Kaup who was named as the Chairman of the backward classes commission was ineligible as he did not meet the criteria required to hold the post.Preetham Gowda the BJP MLA from Hassan who is seen as a rising star in the party was nominated as the Chairman of Forest, Housing and Resorts organization. But he didn’t seem keen.“Let them give the position to somebody more senior. I am not looking for any post,” he told reporters.Several other legislators too expressed unhappiness at being given ‘inconsequential boards and corporations’ despite their ‘seniority’ and ‘services rendered to the party.’Within hours of nominations, the state government withdrew four appointments. These include that of G H Thippa Reddy the Chitradurga MLA as the Chairman of Devraja Urs backward Classes Development Corporation, Paranna Eshwarappa Munavalli of Gangavati as head of Karnataka State Finance Corporation, Basvaraj Dhadesugur the Kanakgiri legislator who had been appointed as Chairman of Karnataka Social Welfare Board and Lalaji Menden of Kaup who was nominated to head the Backward Classes Commission.When asked about the unhappiness expressed by several of those nominated to head the boards and corporations, Deputy Chief Minister Ashwath Narayan said “It is natural to have ambition. If there are issues the Chief Minister will sort them out.”However both opposition parties, Congress and JDS attacked the ruling BJP for focusing on the government’s first anniversary celebrations, instead of responding to the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic distress. Former CM and JDS leader Kumaraswamy said “Due to coronavirus people are struggling to make ends meet but the government is more interested in celebrations and saving their chairs. BJP seems to believe that rewarding its legislators is more important now rather than addressing the problems faced by the common man.”KPCC President D K Shivakumar and Leader of Opposition Siddaramiah also hit out at the government. “Their achievement is zero. The only achievement done is massive corruption in the purchase of equipment to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. It is like celebrations at a funeral,” Shivakumar added.Political analyst Prof Harish Ramaswamy said “The move to appoint legislators as Chairman of various boards and corporations is to ensure dissidence doesn’t explode as loyalists have been unhappy at defectors from other parties being made ministers. The absence of central leaders in the celebrations including the likes of organization secretary B L Santosh who hails from the state is an indication that not everything is alright for Yediyurappa’s leadership as the party high command looks to eventually replace him. With some of the legislators rejecting the boards and corporations offered to them, all eyes will be on the ministerial expansion and reshuffle which is expected soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-mars-bjp-s-first-anniversary-of-returning-to-power-in-karnataka/story-NnNewGSc4EwFN5dDlJXq9H.html
27-07-2020||India||With biggest single-day spike of 258 Covid-19 cases, Goa’s tally past 5,000-mark||Goa recorded its biggest single-day spike in Covid-19 infections on Monday with 258 new cases as the state government claimed that the situation is ‘being well-handled’ during a half-day assembly session. The recorded positive cases took the state’s tally beyond the 5,000 mark - to 5,119 - while the death toll stands at 36. Speaking in the legislative assembly, health minister Vishwajit Rane said that “Goa couldn’t be insulated” when Covid-19 was spreading across the country since it was dependent on supplies from outside the state. However, he said that the situation was being well-handled. “We are sorry for the 35 deaths which have taken place. (The number increased to 36 later in the day). We have 4,686 positive cases recorded out of which 3,047 have recovered. So our recovery rate is as high as 65 per cent and Goa’s mortality rate is 0.75 percent which is lower than the national average,” Rane said.Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, too, pitched in saying that his government has not fallen short in the fight against the disease. He claimed that it was only those with comorbid conditions, or those who reach hospital late who have developed severe symptoms or have passed away. “We have had a one day old newborn baby who was found Covid positive being healed and allowed to go home. 90-year-olds, too, have recovered and gone home. But if a person waits at home with five days continuous fever and doesn’t get himself tested, then we cannot help him,” Sawant said adding that all people who behaved ‘responsibly’ and received treatment on time had no reason to be afraid of the virus. “I once again repeat, there is nothing to fear,” Sawant added.The state now has 1,673 active cases, as 3,410 people have been discharged and 36 have succumbed to the infection, news agency PTI reported quoting a state official.

27-07-2020||India||This 28-year-old Uttarakhand rapper fights casteism through his music||A 28-year-old youth hailing from Uttarakhand has garnered significant attention on social media with his rap song on casteism named ‘Jaat Kya Hai’ (What is caste), a soundtrack on ill practices which practice prejudice based on caste system in the society, was released two days ago. The song has garnered more than 17,000 views on YouTube. Rahul Negi, who goes by his stage name Madara, has been singing rap songs on various social issues like child labour, education and several campus-based issues such as those from national capital’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. Rahul’s past tracks have been widely appreciated across the board for touching issues which are not a common choice for artists from the same genre. In his recent track on casteism produced in collaboration with music production house Seven & Seven, he has received appreciation from Bollywood personalities like Swara Bhaskar and politicians like Jignesh Mewani among several others. Speaking about the track Jaat Kya Hai, Rahul says, “I chose to sing on casteism issue because I had seen it happening in my family and close surroundings while growing up in Uttarakhand. Later when I shifted to Delhi, I saw prevalence of casteism there as well, owing to which I grew frustrated. It helped because I always write my songs when I get frustrated with any issue.” Rahul said, “During childhood in Uttarakhand, my family members were indulged in this evil practice. They would point out towards the Dalits and say not so good things about them. As an inquisitive person from childhood, I used to ask them the reason behind it on which they told me that they do bad things. But after growing up I realised that it’s us who do bad things and they are the ones who clean them. Despite that, they face all the discrimination.” Rahul, who gained popularity with his latest track named ‘Tukde Tukde Gang’ based on JNU episode, claims that it is when he saw casteism in his close circle in an urban space like Delhi, he decided to make a song about it and began researching the subject. “I read books by Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Arundhuti Roy and others on the subject before penning down the song. As I keep myself updated on various current affairs and incidents happened in country, I mentioned many gruesome incidents of castiesm in my song including one in which an 8-month-old pregnant Dalit sanitary worker was beaten to death by an upper-caste family just because she touched their dustbin,” he said. Rahul says it took him a month to write the song and produce the final track which in his words is a ‘dark track with connotations of real incidents and pictures of incidents of atrocities against Dalit in the song’s video.’ Some of his lyrics in the songs include questions like, “Kyun Aaj Bhi Ek Jaat Mandir ki Thekedaar, Kyun Aaj Bhi Ek Jaat Karti Gutter Saaf,” and “Aaj Bhi Eklavya ke Angoothe Kat te Roz Hain.” “My music producer Nischay Sharma and I both hail from upper-caste but we produced this track because we have witnessed casteism happening in our close surroundings which is just sick and frustrating. After the track was released, we got a lot of appreciation from public and different personalities through call and on social media platforms,” Rahul says. On making more similar songs in the future, he said that his next song will be based on depression and will release in August.“It would be followed by 2-3 more songs which would be on some so-called social media influencers who use expletives and abuses in their videos under the garb of nationalism,” says Rahul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-28-year-old-uttarakhand-rapper-fights-casteism-through-his-music/story-sPPHgNaK9UmzOYYEIWdjCK.html
27-07-2020||India||China collecting DNA samples of millions, experts suspect developing tool for genetic surveillance||Chinese authorities have been collecting DNA samples from across the country to develop a massive genetic database, in a bid to create a new tool for their emerging high-tech surveillance state.In an opinion piece in the New York Times, Emile Dirks, a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Toronto, and James Leibold, an expert on ethnic issues in modern China, say dissent is a crime in China and police operations are a key part of the state’s apparatus of repression.They estimated that the authorities’ goal is to gather the DNA samples of 35 million to 70 million Chinese males.“Matched against official family records, surveillance footage or witness statements in police reports, these samples will become a powerful tool for the Chinese authorities to track down a man or boy -- or, failing that, a relative of his -- for whatever reason they deem fit,” they wrote.The Chinese government has denied the existence of any such program. The authors said that they have continued to uncover online scattered evidence revealing the program’s enormous scale, including government reports and official procurement orders for DNA kits and testing services.In a report published by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute last month, the authors said they had exposed the extent of the Chinese government’s program of genetic surveillance. “It no longer is limited to Xinjiang, Tibet and other areas mostly populated by ethnic minorities the government represses,” they wrote.DNA is being harvested across the country: in the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou; in central-southern Hunan; in Shandong and Jiangsu, in the east; and up north, in the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia.“We have continued to find photographic evidence that the police are collecting blood from children, pinpricking their fingers at school -- a clear violation of China’s responsibilities under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child,” they say.“And we have found fresh proof, including official documents, showing that DNA samples are also being gathered in major urban centers,” they add. The authors say that an officials report dated June 16 which is available on a website of the government of Sichuan province explains the creation of a DNA database by the Public Security Bureau of the city of Chengdu, the province’s capital, and seeks expert opinion on the creation of a “male ancestry investigation system.” The document explained how 17 public security offices have collected DNA samples from nearly 600,000 male residents across the city -- that’s about 7 percent of Chengdu’s male population (assuming that roughly half of the city’s total population of about 16.6 million is male).The Chengdu procurement report states that building a massive genetic database about local residents will help the police “maintain public order and stability as well as meet the needs of daily casework.” This is of no comfort.“In China, securing the public order essentially means maintaining the uncontested rule of the Communist Party. Dissent is a crime, and police operations are a key part of the state’s apparatus of repression,” the authors say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-collecting-dna-samples-of-millions-experts-suspect-developing-tool-for-genetic-surveillance/story-CYuXuwEEQ6MsgkvEKn4PgK.html
27-07-2020||India||Filmmaker in Hyderabad captures travails of Covid-19 warriors, contracts virus||Despite the stigma that has led to Covid-19 patients being ostracized even by their kin, Dulam Satyanarayana, an award-winning documentary filmmaker from Telangana, chose to sit and chat with them and capture their experiences on his camera. But it came with a cost with the 35-year old documentary filmmaker from Hyderabad, himself contracting the dreaded virus. He conquered the disease and is back in the business of documenting the success stories of Covid-19 patients. In the first week of June, Satyanarayana embarked on making a series of documentary films on frontline warriors of Covid-19 – starting with doctors, paramedical staff and other healthcare workers looking after patients at isolation centres and quarantine hospitals, police, sanitation workers of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and ambulance services. As part of his mission, he chose Gandhi Hospital at Secunderabad, a 100 per cent designated centre for Covid-19. “Thanks to the cooperation from the state medical and health department, I along with five of my team members, ventured into the hospital to document the travails of doctors, the frontline warriors to tackle the disease,” Satyanarayana said. He and his team members were fully equipped with personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and their cameras and other equipment were completely sanitised. “We have captured every moment of the doctors and their supporting staff, how they toil all through the day to provide the best medical care to the patients and how they infuse a lot of courage and confidence into the patients to overcome the mental trauma,” he said. Satyanarayana and his team also documented the stories of several Covid-19 patients and their experiences in the hospital. “My objective was to present a positive side of the Covid-19 story – how people can fight the virus with grit and determination and of course, with self-discipline,” he said. A week after completing his documentary film on Covid-19 warriors, Satyanarayana himself started developing symptoms of the viral disease. “I was a bit worried initially, but mustered courage. As suspected, I tested positive on June 22 and so did a couple of my team members. Since I was alone at my home in Hyderabad, I went into home quarantine for three weeks, duly following the treatment suggested by the doctors,” he said. By July 15, Satyanarayana conquered the virus and tested negative. “After taking rest for a few more days, I was back in action with my camera,” he said. Hailing from Mancherial district of Telangana, Satyanarayana ventured into documentary film making when he was barely 23. “I lost my father at the age of 5 and my mother brought me up by running a tea stall in Mancherial. I was dreaming of becoming an engineer from IIT, but ended up as a documentary film maker,” he said. He produced the most-acclaimed short films such as Moushini, which depicts the plight of a village that lacked electricity in Sunderbans in West Bengal until 2001 when it became the first village to use solar power; and Dreadful Fate, which exposed the agony of fluoride-affected people in Nalgonda district. He won a trophy of the best tourism film for producing Welcome Telangana, at IXth ART&TUR International Tourism Film Festival held in Portugal in 2016. He had received the prestigious United States Department of State’s CCIP Fellowship to study motion picture directing at Scottsdale School of Film and Theatre, Arizona. The short film Satyanarayana had made on Hyderabad during lockdown – capturing the silent streets and stunning visuals of the picturesque locations of the city – received rave reviews in the media. Satyanarayana has been a delegate and panelist of various international conferences and film festivals held in the USA, Canada, Pakistan, Iran and India. His projects included the culture and traditions of Telangana such as Bonam, Bathukamma, I am Satyabama and Balakka – Dancing with tradition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/filmmaker-in-hyderabad-captures-travails-of-covid-19-warriors-contracts-virus/story-9tKFoHpLo83k4gDyZCh48H.html

However, as soon after the ambulance reached the home of Praharaj who was also a diabetic and suffered from high blood pressure, the driver refused to take him to hospital suspecting him to be suffering from Covid-19.“I kept pleading with the ambulance driver to take my father to hospital as he was suffering from fever for the past couple of days. The ambulance driver instead asked us to call an ambulance (104) meant for coronavirus patients,” said Manas Praharaj, son of the deceased.After the ambulance left, the family members of Praharaj arranged an auto-rickshaw to take him to the hospital. But he died on the veranda of the house.A video of the minor son pleading helplessly with the ambulance driver to rush his father to hospital went viral on social media.Following the incident, Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrita Kulange said both 104 and 108 ambulances will henceforth carry all Covid suspects to hospitals.In a similar incident, a 55-year-old man in Berhampur town died early this month when the driver of an ambulance refused to carry him to hospital suspecting him to be infected with Covid-19.

The team, led by Israeli ambassador Ron Malka, reached the national capital in a special flight from Tel Aviv that also carried cutting-edge equipment contributed by Israel’s foreign ministry and private companies. The cargo included dozens of ventilators whose export is barred by Israel, and are being provided to India through “an exceptional approval”, Israeli officials said. The Israeli team has been working with Indian scientists led by K Vijayraghavan, principal scientific advisor to the prime minister, and experts from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to develop the rapid tests, which Israeli officials have said are expected to provide results in 30 seconds. Also read: India, Israel to deepen military cooperation amid border rowThe delegation will complete a series of tests and carry out the final stages of research in India to determine the effectiveness of advanced technologies for the rapid diagnosis of Covid-19, a statement from the Israeli foreign ministry said. “The unique cooperation between Israel and India will enable the delegation to collect tens of thousands of samples in only ten days, and to analyse them using computer systems based on artificial intelligence,” the statement said. “This massive sampling will shorten processes and advance the approval of effective technology. It should be noted that all the necessary Israeli and Indian approvals were acquired in preparation for this joint activity,” it added. The team includes 20 experts in different fields from the Directorate of Defense Research and Development, Israel Defense Forces, the health ministry and industries which partnered in the development of diagnostic solutions. Israeli foreign minister Gabi Ashkenazi spoke with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on Sunday and updated him on the flight and equipment on board. The two ministers discussed further cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus. Also read | ‘Indian govt helped a lot’: Israel praises India for evacuationsIsraeli officials earlier described the cooperation with India on diagnostic solutions as “unprecedented”. The merger of Israeli technology with Indian production capabilities will allow the swift resumption of normal life alongside the coronavirus, they said. The Israeli technologies can also be mass produced at a lower cost in India and be jointly exported to third countries, they added. Since the outbreak of the global pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu have spoken on phone three times and discussed cooperation in combating the Coronavirus through scientific collaboration between the two sides. Gilad Cohen, deputy director general for Asia in the Israeli foreign ministry, said the two countries had “successfully transformed this unprecedented global pandemic into an opportunity to assist one another and further enhance their relations”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israeli-team-in-india-for-research-on-rapid-tests-for-covid-19/story-svl0phpNrZf6DJNXBYmkfO.html

The Customs department was the first to question him before the NIA did once.A senior IAS officer, who was very close to the CM, he was suspended from service after his alleged association with Swapna Suresh, one of the accused in the gold smuggling case came to light.After Monday’s questioning in Kochi, Sivasankar’s counsel S Rajeev said an intense media trail was on and many reports emerging these days were far from truth. He said Sivasankar was cooperating fully with the probe team and had nothing to hide. The once powerful principal secretary became embroiled in the controversy after the seizure of 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an employee of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. Later the case was handed over to the NIA.After the seizure, there were reports that the CM’s office allegedly pressurized the Customs to release the consignment. Sivasankar reportedly told investigators that though he knew some of the accused he was not aware of their smuggling background. There are also reports that he was instrumental in appointing Swapna Suresh as the business development manager with the Kerala Information Technology Infrastructure Limited||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-grills-kerala-cm-s-former-secretary-for-9-hours-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-3opRkC8RMR4sg6i1vFjS3J.html

27-07-2020||India||‘Does not listen’: Top officer moved out after minister complains to Bihar CM||A top bureaucrat in the Bihar health ministry was moved out amid reports of growing differences between him and the state health minister even as the Covid-19 situation in the state is getting grimmer. Principal secretary (health) Uday Singh Kumawat has been replaced by Pratyaya Amrit, who is also the principal secretary of Energy and disaster management department. Kumawat is the second principal secretary to be removed from the health department in the last two months. Earlier on May 21, Sanjay Kumar was removed from the post and transferred to the tourism department. The number of positive cases reached 41111 on Monday in the state. A notification about Amrit’s posting to the health department was issued by the general administration department late Monday evening. Kumawat’s removal had become imminent after health minister Mangal Pandey lodged a complaint with chief minister Nitish Kumar in the presence of all other ministers after the cabinet meeting on Saturday. Pandey openly took on Kumawat and said, “The officer doesn’t listen to me and only does what he wants to.” The Bihar CM reprimanded Kumawat and said: “Every day at least 20,000 RT-PCR tests should be done else I will take action. If you cannot handle the department, please leave it. If Delhi can conduct 38,000 tests every day than why can’t Bihar?” CM Kumar, facing flak for his handling of the Covid situation, went on to say that he had never faced a situation like this in the past 14 years of his government. “I will soon review the health department working and will not spare the people who are indulging in wrong practices,” he said. Kumawat has been facing criticism ever since he joined the department. There were complaints against him that he would not pick calls from officials of the health department and not even meet anyone in his chamber. Other changesThe state government also effected some reshuffling in the administrative set up of some departments.

He said, “We have searched the literature, but such a big sharp knife ingestion has not been reported. We are searching for more literature.” He said there are reports of small needles and fish bones going into liver after perforating duodenum. The man, a daily wage worker from Palwal in Haryana, has a history of psychosis and had a habit of smoking cannabis. “He was not an addict but took cannabis quite often,” said the doctor. The man told the doctors that one-and-a-half-months ago, during the coronavirus lockdown when “he was in his kitchen, he felt like eating the knife. He tried to chew it and finally gulped it down with water”.He had no problems for a month. But subsequently, he developed issues like difficulty in eating, weight loss, fever, abdominal pain which soon became unbearable, the doctors said.He was taken to local hospitals and was referred to the Safdarjung hospital in Delhi.“An ultrasound and an X-ray of the abdomen revealed blade of a kitchen knife stuck in the liver. Anticipating the challenges involved in removing the object, doctors there referred the patient to the Gastrointestinal Surgery and Liver Transplant department at AIIMS,” Dr Dash said.The patient came to the emergency of the AIIMS on July 12. A COVID-19 test was done to rule out coronavirus infection. The reports came out negative. While the patient was admitted in the emergency, an ultrasound, CT scan and other investigations were carried out to know the exact position of the knife, its relation to the vital organs and the complications it had caused, the doctors said. “On CT scan, we found the blade of the knife was entirely inside the liver and the handle inside the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine.“The knife actually had perforated the duodenum and had gone into the liver. It had led to bleeding, infection, abscess formation in the liver and sepsis. His hemoglobin level was very low. A sepsis had set in, there was loss of weight and water had accumulated in his right chest,” Dr Dash elaborated.“An immediate surgery was not possible,” he said, adding removing the knife through endoscopy was ruled out as it was very risky and could have caused injuries to the organs.Doctors decided to first control the sepsis and gave him blood transfusion. He was put on high antibiotics and was under critical care. The doctors said under X-ray guidance, a tube was put inside the liver to drain the pus that sucked around 100 ml pus everyday for four to five days.Another tube was inserted to take out the water from the chest, Dr Dash explained.He said the man was given nutrition intravenously as he was not in a condition to take food orally. He was also being provided psychiatric counselling all throughout. After seven days, though his condition improved to a certain extent, the sepsis could not be controlled entirely.“It was then that we decided to take him for surgery. Challenges during the surgery were the possibility of heavy bleeding, injuring the liver, controlling bleeding after removing the knife and to do it as quickly as possible with minimum complications. “When a patient is septic and anemic, giving anesthesia for a longer period and conducting longer procedures could turn fatal,” Dr Dash said.In a challenging surgery lasting three hours, the knife was removed by opening the intestine on July 19, Dash said. A team of doctors from the department of Anaesthesia, Critical Care, Radiology and Gastroenterology besides the Gastrointestinal Surgery and Liver Transplant were also involved in the surgery and the knife was pulled out under ultrasound guidance.“The patient was in the ICU for seven days. He is out of danger now and out of ICU care,” Dr Dash said.“We had put a food pipe during the surgery in his abdomen and through that tube he is being given food. Very soon we will start giving him food orally. He is conscious and able to walk around. He is being given psychiatric counselling,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-doctors-remove-20-cm-knife-from-man-s-liver-after-rare-surgery/story-0pmNUVxzqnwPjBFC4gGuRJ.html

The ED case is based on a CBI First Information Report (FIR) registered earlier this month naming Bhandari, Samsung Engineering Co Ltd, UK-based company FosterWheeler Energy Ltd and unknown officials of the ONGC. It was alleged by CBI that Rs 22 crore ($5 million approx) bribe was paid to Sanjay Bhandari’s company Santech International FZC out of which 1.9 million pounds (around Rs 18 cr) was used to purchase a property - 12 Ellerton House, Brynston Square (London). The CBI FIR claimed that the deal for this property was stipulated to be completed on or before end of August 2009, just after Rs 22 crore ($5 million approx.) were transferred on June 13, 2009 in the Dubai account of Bhandari’s company Santech International FZC by Samsung Engineering Co Ltd (SECL).The ED has repeatedly claimed in the courts that this property belongs to Robert Vadra, a charge denied by him. Vadra is not named as an accused in the latest CBI or ED cases.The ED has powers to attach properties of accused persons under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-files-money-laundering-case-against-sanjay-bhandari/story-l1oLoYfchTlCoKIUKSXIEP.html
27-07-2020||India||IAF’s first 5 Rafales take off from France, to reach Ambala on July 29||Amid border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh, the Indian Air Force’s first five Rafale warplanes on Monday took off from Mérignac in France and will reach their home base in Ambala on July 29 after a one-day stopover at the Al Dhafra airbase near Abu Dhabi, the IAF said in a statement. The two-leg flight will involve the Rafales covering a distance of nearly 7,000 km. The five fighters landed safely at Al Dhafra after a seven-hour flight from France on Monday evening. The new fighters will significantly enhance the IAF’s offensive capabilities, senior IAF officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to plug gaps in the IAF’s capabilities. The delivery of 36 fighters will be completed by the end of next year.Also read: IAF may deploy Rafale fighters in Ladakh sector amid border rowFrance handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8 last year. Air and ground crews of the IAF have been in France for almost three years for the management of the Rafale programme. The French air force refuelled the Indian fighters --- three single-seater and two twin-seater aircraft --- using its Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft on their way to Al Dhafra. Aerial refuelling support will be provided by the IAF’s Russian Ilyushin-78 refuellers for the second leg of the journey from Al Dhafra to Ambala. The jets are being flown by pilots who have undergone comprehensive training on the aircraft, the IAF said. The Rafales will be a part of the IAF’s No. 17 Squadron, which is also known as the ‘Golden Arrows.’ The aircrew bringing the Rafales to India is headed by Group Captain Harkirat Singh, a decorated fighter pilot, who is the commanding officer of the No.17 squadron. It’s a magnificent achievement to get a fighter of this class decades after the IAF inducted the Mirage-2000s from France in the mid-1980s, said Air Chief Marshal Fali H Major (retd), a former IAF chief. Also read | Arrival of Rafale jets will send a clear message to India’s ‘adversaries’: Officials“The Rafales bring tremendous capabilities to the table. We should now wait and watch how the fighter evolves in the Indian environment. I am sure it will meet each and every qualitative requirement of the IAF,” Major added. India has taken a significant step in “strengthening its air power and defence preparedness” with the first five Rafale fighter jets, built by French aircraft maker Dassault Aviation, flying out from the Merignac airbase in Bordeaux, the Indian embassy in France said in a statement.“This also marks a new milestone in the strong and growing India-France defence cooperation,” it said. India’s Ambassador to France Jawed Ashraf was in Merignac to see off the aircrews bringing the Rafales to the country. He said that the “long-awaited and much-needed” two squadrons of Rafale jets would add “great strength” to the IAF and the country’s defence capabilities. The IAF could deploy its new Rafale fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, where Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a tense border confrontation and disengagement has turned out to be a challenging process. “In accordance with the contract, IAF pilots and supporting personnel have been provided full training on the aircraft and weapon systems by Dassault. Further batches of IAF personnel will continue the training over the next nine months,” the embassy statement said. “I am strongly impressed by the amazing efficiency and determination of the IAF and Indian Ministry of Defense, despite this unprecedented world health crisis, to master rapidly all aspects of the Rafale for Indian sovereignty and contributing to the protection and security of Indian people,” said Dassault Aviation chairman Eric Trappier. The IAF’s air and ground crews have undergone comprehensive training on the aircraft, including its highly-advanced weapons systems and are fully operational. Efforts will now focus on swift operationalisation of the aircraft. Acting on a special request by the IAF, France has accelerated the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India --- five jets are coming instead of four that were originally planned to be delivered in the first batch. According to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected by April-May 2022. However, all deliveries will be completed by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-s-first-5-rafales-take-off-from-france-to-reach-ambala-on-july-29/story-UF6SX5pPwf1jVBpg8KrS2I.html

27-07-2020||India||Union govt paid Rs 1.65 lakh crore GST compensation to states in FY20: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman||The Union government released Rs 1,65,302 crore as Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation to states in the previous financial year ended March 31, even as compensation cess collection fell by over 42% that year, a finance ministry statement said on Monday. “The Central government has recently released GST compensation of Rs 13,806 crore to states for March. Taking this amount into account, entire compensation up to 2019-20 has been released to states,” it said. The amount of cess collected in the financial year 2019-20 was Rs 95,444 crore, it added. The GST regime was launched on July 1, 2017, that introduced a uniform indirect tax structure across the country by merging various state and local-level levies. At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime, the GST law assured state governments a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years and the Centre committed to meet any shortfall in revenue through the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and other tobacco commodities. The finance ministry said the Union government utilised the balance cess amount of previous fiscal years to compensate states for their revenue losses in 2019-20, besides transferring some money from the Consolidated Fund of India. “To release the compensation for 2019-20, the balance cess amount collected during 2017-18 and 2018-19 was also utilised. In addition, the Centre had transferred Rs. 33,412 crore from Consolidated Fund of India to the Compensation Fund as a part of an exercise to apportion the balance of IGST [integrated GST] pertaining to 2017-18. Inter-state supply of goods or services attracts IGST,” it said. Inadequate collection of compensation cess has been a major issue. The cess collection is expected to drop even further in the current financial year (2020-21) because the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic saw a 68-day nationwide lockdown from March 25 to May 31. The matter was discussed in the last GST Council meeting on June 12, but it was deferred by a month. After the council’s meeting, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that on the request of members of the council, it would meet in July to discuss only “one-agenda item” that was paying compensation to states for their shortfall in GST revenue. “Compensation, which has to be given to states, and, if at all, it results in some kind of borrowing, how and who is going to pay for it,” she had said. Sitharaman is the chairperson of the apex federal body on indirect tax and finance ministers of states are its members. Usually, the council’s decisions are unanimous. Archit Gupta, founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of the financial technology platform ClearTax, said, “The compensation cess was designed to cover any losses that the states may incur due to the implementation of GST. Cess payments to states have been overdue for some time and are being gradually released to states. The state governments are struggling with a dip in revenue collections. “This release will come in handy for states and reduce their borrowing especially during this time of crisis due to the pandemic. More revenue collections for the past quarter are taking place in July, as the filing of GST returns has picked up. However, there may still be a shortfall and the Centre will have to look at its own fiscal situation closely in the coming months,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-govt-paid-rs-1-65-lakh-crore-gst-compensation-to-states-in-fy20-fin-min/story-oD6NVwyXUjxQvJNselvzJO.html

From May onwards, IndiGo had implemented pay cuts of up to 25 per cent for its senior employees. The “deeper” pay cuts came after the airline’s announcement on July 20 that it would lay off 10 per cent of its workforce due to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. In an e-mail on Monday, IndiGo CEO Ronojoy Dutta told employees, “I will increase my personal pay cut percentage to 35 per cent. I am asking all senior vice presidents and above to take a 30 per cent pay cut, all pilots will see their pay cut percentages increased to 28 per cent, all vice presidents will take a 25 per cent pay cut and associate vice presidents will take a 15 per cent pay cut.” These increased pay cuts will come into effect from September 1, he added.Also read | ‘It may take 18-24 months to recover from crisis’: IndiGo CEO The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic. All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave-without-pay and lay-offs in order to conserve cash. Before Monday’s announcement, IndiGo CEO Dutta took a 25 per cent cut in salaries. For senior vice presidents the pay cut was 20 per cent, for vice presidents it was 15 per cent and for associate vice presidents it was 10 per cent. In May, IndiGo had also cut the salaries of Band D employees and cabin crew members by 10 per cent, and of Band C employees by 5 per cent. Salaries of employees in Band B and Band A were not touched. Majority of the employees of the airline are in Band B and Band A. Dutta’s Monday announcement does not affect the cuts instituted in the salaries of Band D employees, Band C employees and cabin crew members in May. Moreover, no cuts were announced on Monday for Band B and Band A employees.Also read: IndiGo lays off 10% of their total employees, says impossible to keep flying without making ‘sacrifices’ IndiGo in May had also implemented a compulsory leave without pay (LWP) scheme for its employees for up to five days per month. In August it was increased to 10.5 days per month. Dutta said on Monday, “We are not making any changes for August LWP and from September each department will decide on the LWP for each month based on workloads and staffing levels.” “You can expect a direct communication from your department head on LWP each month. It is my earnest hope that the environment is conducive enough for us to add capacity back quickly and reduce LWP to zero,” he added. India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the airlines have been allowed to operate only a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights. Occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25.

27-07-2020||India||Farmer gifted tractor by Sonu Sood contested Andhra Assembly polls in 2009||A farmer from Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district who was gifted with a tractor by Bollywood actor Sonu Sood on Sunday had unsuccessfully contested the assembly elections in 2009 on behalf of a political party and has been a beneficiary of the government’s welfare schemes, enquiries by district officials revealed on Monday. Veerathallu Nageshwar Rao of Mahalrajulapalli village of K V Palli block came under the limelight, when Sonu Sood sent a tractor to his residence on Sunday evening after a video of Rao’s two teenage daughters – Vennela and Chandana, tilling the land by pulling the plough went viral on social media. Officials of the K V Palli block who visited the village on Monday morning came to know that Rao was a human rights activist and had contested the assembly elections on behalf of Lok Satta Party in 2009. His family had received benefits from the government under various schemes. “Last year, Rao had availed of financial assistance to the extent of Rs 13,500 under YSR Rythu Bharosa-PK Kisan scheme for groundnut cultivation. This year, too, he was given Rs 7,500 under the scheme in the first installment. “His younger daughter, a 10th standard student, got a benefit of Rs 15,000 under Jagananna Amma Vodi scheme, while his elder daughter has applied for financial assistance under Jagananna Thodu scheme,” an official from the chief minister’s office quoting the report of the K V Palli block officials said. The official said Rao had also received a bag of Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) fertiliser from Rythu Bharosa Kendra and used it for groundnut seed for cultivation. “Actually, he should sow the crop through seed drill machine, but since it came late, the two daughters along with parents started sowing,” the official said quoting the enquiry report. While the house where they have been staying in the village was sanctioned under Indiramma Housing Scheme, the parents have been receiving old-age pension. “The family also received financial aid of Rs 1,000 from the government during the pandemic,” the official said. Nageshwara Rao, a tea stall owner at Madanapalle town, told reporters that he had come to the village to take up farming in the two-acres of land because of the lockdown. He said he could not afford to hire oxen or tractor to till the land as he had no money. “My two daughters volunteered to help me in tilling the land because it was the right time for sowing. My two nephews also helped them. It was not done for fun or get publicity,” Rao said. He admitted that he had contested the elections from Madanapalle. “Actually, I was just a dummy candidate. I was working for a local doctor who was supposed to contest as the Lok Satta candidate. When he realised that he was not going to get many votes, he forced me to contest. I got a little over 1,000 votes,” Rao said, adding that he had no connections whatsoever with any political party. He also acknowledged receiving benefits from the government. “We have suffered badly because of the Covid-19 situation. But we did not beg anybody for assistance. We never expected that the video our daughters tilling the land would become viral and Sonu Sood sir would help us by sending a tractor,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-gifted-tractor-bysonu-sood-contested-andhra-assembly-polls-in-2009/story-jQelfaAVk7ikHXYN5M282M.html

And, we are lucky that now audience too give equal recognition to character artistes.” Daya was born and brought up in Mumbai but is a UPite to the core. “My village is Jaganpur Mishran in Bhadohi district. Even my wife is from Dhaukalganj in Varanasi. Every year I spend 3-4 months in my village. We live here but follow our roots, eat regional food and speak Awadhi at home. I am deeply connected to UP and it gives me energy!” He has even shot a film ‘Dharam’ in Varanasi and a few months back OTT series ‘Raktanchal’. Giving an insight into this journey, he says, “It all probably started with imitating actors after watching films on Doordarshan. So, in school and colleges I started acting in theatre. To make a career in film industry, I joined as assistant to cameraman Gyan Sahai and started doing small roles too. My noticeable role came with ‘Gulaam’.” His role Goli of ‘Lagaan’ was his turning point. “My work started getting recognition and then films like ‘Ganganjal’, ‘Swades’, ‘Rajneeti’ and ‘Chakravyuh’ came my way. I joined ‘Tarak Mehta Ka Ulta Chasma’ as creative consultant and my role of Inspector Chalu Pandey became very popular.” Daya’s lead role in TV serial ‘Mahima Shanidev Ki’ took his popularity to another level. “I did it for four years and it did lot of good to my spirituality and personality. I will say Shanidev himself chose me and I feel lucky and blessed that I did the role. Now, its re-run on TV is again benefitting me a lot.” Before lockdown he was shooting for ‘Hanseen Dilruba’ which stars Tapsee Pannu and Vikrant Massey. “Just 8-10 days of work is left to complete the shoot. I will be next shooting for Satyamev Jayatev-2, probably in August-September,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-have-taken-humiliation-in-my-stride-daya/story-hD1D2onfKsXucEmARTJziP.html
27-07-2020||India||Assam gas well fire likely to be doused this week, technical glitches delayed ops: OIL||The fire at an Oil India Limited’s (OIL) natural gas well in Assam’s Tinsukia district – that began to blaze two months ago - is likely to be plugged this week, a company spokesperson said on Monday.The natural gas well located at Baghjan in Tinsukia district witnessed a blow out - an uncontrolled release of gas or oil - during a work over operation to locate a new gas reservoir on May 27. On June 9, the well caught fire killing two firefighters and displaced thousands of residents from nearby areas. Since then, the fire continues to blaze with OIL authorities unable to plug it.Initially, OIL had said it would take a month to complete the task. Later the deadline was extended to July 7. But floods, which affected work for several days, and technical issues are adding to the delay while thousands of affected residents continue to reside in relief camps. “While all other logistical requirements have been completed, two jobs i.e. capping the well and killing it, remain. To cap the well, we need to install the blow out preventer (BOP) on top of the wellhead,” said Tridiv Hazarika, OIL spokesperson. The wellhead has a mechanical device called spool which is a fitting placed on BOP stack. It was while removing one such damaged spool on July 22 three foreign experts engaged by OIL sustained burn injuries. After the incident OIL had stated that work on plugging the well would be over within the next 2-3 days. “But while inspecting the second spool which was not damaged it was found that some studs, similar to nuts and bolts, were damaged. Without preparing the spool, removing the damaged studs and installing new studs, the BOP, which weighs around 3 tons, can’t be installed,” said Hazarika. Experts at the site spent considerable time in removing the damaged studs and new studs had to be fabricated at OIL’s Duliajan workshop.On Monday, an OIL statement informed that new studs have been transferred to the site to replace the damaged and deformed ones. “It is a precise operation and it needs to be done correctly as the spool will carry the weight of the BOP. If there is even the slightest fault, it will lead to severe problems. Hence, these tasks were done with extreme caution and they delayed our operation further,” said Hazarika. Once the BOP is installed, the process of killing the well would start. It would be done by injecting a ‘kill fluid’, a sludge-like specially prepared mud, into the well slowly to push the gas from the well back to the reservoir. “The length of the well is 3.5 km. So it could take around 36-40 hours to fill the well with sludge and kill the well. Once the BOP is in place within the next two days, the killing operation would begin and the entire exercise should be over by July 30,” he said. Since the Baghjan well is located close to Dibru Saikhowa National Park and the ecologically sensitive Maguri Motapung Wetland, there were fears of environmental damage to the area due to the blow out and fire. Several studies by different agencies are underway to measure the extent of damage. Last month, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered formation of an expert committee to probe the blow out and subsequent fire and assess the damage caused to human life, wildlife and environment because of it.

The day is also celebrated as police memorial day.Rai was speaking at the 82nd raising day of CRPF. Home minister Amit Shah was supposed to attend the event but he could not make it owing to some other meeting.“The CRPF has a rich history of valour and sacrifice...and on October 21, 1959, it showed that in Hot Springs in Ladakh when the Chinese attacked,” Rai said.“What a coincidence. Whenever China attacks, its strength is huge and ours is less...but China has always suffered the consequences,” he said. He added that 10 CRPF personnel sacrificed their lives in Hot Springs, and the Chinese army had to suffer a “big damage.”Rai, however, didn’t elaborate on the damage to PLA.Praising CRPF, he added that the force has defended the country at Sardar Post in Gujarat as well when a small team repulsed an attack by a 3,000-strong army contingent of Pakistan in 1965.“Pakistan would shake with fear whenever it would recall this incident,” Rai said.The minister praised the force for ensuring the security of the country as he said without security there can be no peace, no development and no unity.Rai added that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home Amit Shah terrorism and Naxalism were being wiped out in the country.In the last six months, 150 terrorists have been killed in Kashmir, he said.Rai said terrorists should know they will have to either change their ideology or will be wiped out by joint security forces like the CRPF, the army and the Jammu and Kashmir police.He also recalled the 2019 Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy in which 40 personnel were killed, and said the Prime Minister then had declared this sacrifice of the troops will not go in vain.“The force went into Pakistan and killed the terrorists and Pakistan just kept watching. India did what it wanted to do,” the minister said in a reference to IAF’s air strikes in Balakot after the Pulwama attack.During the course of his speech, the minister made an apparent error while referring to the history of the CRPF.He said the country’s first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel gave the flag or colours to the force on this day (July 27) in recognition of the good work done by it in aligning all the princely states with India post independence.However, an official pointed out that the CRPF was given the President’s colours by Sardar Patel on March 19, 1950.The importance of July 27 is due to the raising of CRPF’s first battalion on this day in 1939 in the Neemuch town of Madhya Pradesh.In 1939, the force was raised as the Crown Representatives Police under the British and was re-named CRPF in 1949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mos-home-salutes-crpf-s-valour-against-chinese-troops-in-ladakh-s-hot-springs-in-1959/story-tFCReyUEyMvqAGlUdiKAaJ.html

The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting headed by chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.The affected cities are Raipur, Durg, Bilaspur, Rajnanadgaon and others.Agriculture minister Ravindra Choubey, briefing the media after the cabinet meeting, said that since there is a rise in cases in cities like Raipur, Durg and Bilaspur, the decision has been taken to extend the weeklong lockdown enforced last week till August 6.“The government has given instructions to the district collectors to ensure strict compliance to the lockdown rules in areas where the infection rate is high and all steps should be taken to contain the spread of virus,” Chaubey said.The cabinet also took stock of Covid beds for patients in the cities where most of the cases are concentrated, he said.Chhattisgarh, where the infection has spread in all the 28 districts, has reported 7,623 Covid-19 cases till Sunday night. Out of them, 2,626 were active cases and 4,944 patients were discharged while 43 others have died of the infection.As per the health department data, the state has recorded over 5,000 cases in the last one month. With a total of 2,187 cases so far, Raipur district tops the tally in the state.Earlier, the lockdown was also imposed in several coronavirus-hit urban areas of various districts, including Bilaspur, Korba, Ambikapur, Durg and Rajnandgaon last week for different periods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-extends-lockdown-in-major-cities-till-aug-6-cites-rise-in-cases/story-h3N4FwOBs8zYDyEmfj4U3N.html
27-07-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee urges PM Modi to release funds to help state fight Covid-19||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to release Rs 53,000 crore, which the Centre owes to the state for various social security schemes and other funds amounting to thousands of crores to help the state’s fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. She said that the Centre is yet to release the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation worth Rs 4,135 crore for April and May and urged the Modi government to withdraw all conditions imposed on the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, in a bid to give full advantage to the states to utilise the funds. “The state had requested the Centre to release Rs 35,000 crore after cyclone Amphan had hit Bengal. You had surveyed the areas with your team. But, only Rs 1,000 crore has been released to date,” she reminded the PM. The CM made this remark while attending a virtual programme in which the PM launched high throughput Covid-19 testing facilities at the Indian Council for Medical Research’s (ICMR) national institutes in Mumbai, Kolkata, and Noida in Uttar Pradesh (UP). Union health minister, CMs of UP, and Maharashtra; Harshvardhan, Yogi Adityanath and Uddhav Thackeray, respectively, also attended the virtual programme. The CM said that even though the state is being asked to utilise the money from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to fight the Covid-19 crisis, it could not be done as those funds have to be kept aside to tide over natural calamities such as cyclones and floods, which Bengal is prone to. This is not the first time that the Banerjee has requested the Centre to release its pending dues of Rs 53,000 crore. She also requested the PM that states are allowed to take independent decisions on the issue of holding of final-year university examinations because of the threat posed by the pandemic. She also lodged a complaint against Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, but stopped short of naming him. “Some people are using their constitutional positions to harass the state government every day,” she added as a comment in passing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-urges-pm-to-release-funds-to-help-state-fight-covid-19/story-slgWaLyYJoVclmwo1ituUP.html
27-07-2020||India||‘A great fall’: VHP on CM Thackeray’s video link offer for Ram temple event||The Vishva Hindu Parishad on Monday slammed Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for suggesting that the bhumi poojan or the ground breaking ceremony for the Ram temple construction in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya could have been performed through video conferencing. Alok Kumar, the international working president of the VHP, said Thackeray’s statement is a “sign of the great fall of a once great Hindutva party.”In an interview to party publication Saamana, the Maharashtra CM had questioned the decision to organise a ground breaking ceremony on August 5, which is scheduled to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and also by a host of RSS and BJP leaders. All chief ministers have also been extended an invitation to be part of the ceremony.“Bhoomi Poojan is an essential and sacred ritual before starting any construction work, we worship Mother Earth, seek Her permission to dig and construct structures and obtain Her blessings for the mission. Obviously, this cannot be done by e-conference. The country is going through its normal activities with all precautions relating to Covid-19. The Supreme Court permitted the symbolic taking out of Sri Jagannath Rath yatra. Rituals of Shri Amarnath yatra have also been performed though the yatra is not permitted this year,” Kumar said.An affiliate of the RSS, the VHP was at the forefront of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.Commenting on the concerns about maintaining the necessary protocols during the ongoing Corona pandemic, Kumar said the VHP has always made it clear that the bhumi poojan will be done by restricting participation to 200 people and complying with all health and security advisories. “In this situation, the concerns about the public health expressed by Shri Thackeray are only pretensions,” he said.Earlier NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had also criticised the decision to hold a public ceremony to mark the beginning of the construction of the temple amid the pandemic.In March, Thackeray had visited Ayodhya to mark the completion of 100 days of his government and had also announced a contribution of Rs One crore for the construction of a grand temple. He had also said that while his party has parted ways with the BJP, it remains committed to Hindutva and that the BJP and Hindutva are separate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-great-fall-vhp-on-cm-thackeray-s-video-link-offer-for-ram-temple-event/story-xBKAUpyWqBNVjA8ld76fwJ.html
27-07-2020||India||VHP to transport soil, water from holy places in Bengal for Ram temple event||The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) has collected soil from famous temples and places of pilgrimage spread across West Bengal as well as water from several rivers for the bhoomi pujan to be performed at the site of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on August 5 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone. Though the Trinamool Congress government has clamped biweekly lockdown across the state and full or partial lockdown is in force in parts of several districts in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases, VHP workers have been travelling across the state to collect the holy soil and water. “We maintained social distancing norms during the exercise. Because of the pandemic only one man from Bengal will travel to Ayodhya with the soil and river water,” said Sourish Mukherjee, head of the VHP’s media cell in Bengal. VHP workers have collected soil from a large number of sites such as the Madan Mohan temple at Cooch Behar district in north Bengal, the temple of Kapil Muni at Sagar Island in the Bay of Bengal, Dakshineswar temple near Kolkata where Ramkrishna Paramhans was a priest and Kalighat temple located near chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s residence. Similarly, water has been collected from the confluence of Saraswati, Kunti and Hooghly rivers at Triveni in Hooghly district, the Hooghly river near the Iskcon temple at Mayapur and several other places. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust on Saturday issued an appeal to all saints across the country to perform puja in their respective temples and Maths from 11.30 am to 12.30 pm on August 5. Champat Rai, general secretary of the Trust, requested people to watch the live telecast of Bhoomi Pujan on television and light earthen lamps at home in the evening.A similar call was issued by the VHP to saints and seers associated with the front. It said the Bhoomi Poojan day must be celebrated keeping in mind the guidelines issued by state administrations to contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.“We will follow the same rules in Bengal. People have been asked to stay at home and watch the ceremony on television. They will sing devotional songs and offer prayers at home,” said Mukherjee. Nabendu Kumar Bandopadhyay, a state leader of the Hindu Jagran Manch, said, “Our organisation too will celebrate the day through prayers at homes and temples. There will be no public gathering.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vhp-to-take-soil-water-from-holy-places-in-bengal-for-ram-temple-event/story-BJczhdl7w8GVsa9dCSiFwJ.html
27-07-2020||India||Three former Congress law ministers write to Rajasthan Governor asking him to convene assembly session||Three Congress leaders, who have served as Union law ministers in the past, wrote to Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra on Monday, asking him to convene an assembly session as per the advice of the state cabinet which, they claimed, would be the correct course of action as per the legal principles laid down by the Supreme Court (SC). Salman Khurshid, Ashwani Kumar, and Kapil Sibal, who are also senior advocates at the SC, said that the apex court judgments in Shamsher Singh v. Union of India (1974) and Nabam Rebia v. Deputy Speaker (2016) limits the powers of Governor, who is obliged to defer to the wisdom of an elected government. “Any deviation from the established constitutional position would be an avoidable negation of your oath of office and create a constitutional crisis,” they said. In the Shamsher Singh case, a seven-judge SC bench had held that a Governor has to exercise his powers as per the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers except in spheres, where he is required by the Constitution to exercise discretion. In the Nabam Rebia case, a five-judge SC bench had specifically dealt with the question of whether the Governor could use his discretion to summon or dissolve the state assembly. In that case, the then Arunachal Pradesh Governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa had initially summoned the assembly session on January 14, 2016. But, he later advanced the session to December 16, 2015, and also laid down the agenda for the House proceedings. The Supreme Court held that the Governor can summon or dissolve the House, only on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers and he cannot do so at his own discretion. “Having served as Union ministers for law and justice at different periods and as students of constitutional law, we are of the clear view that the established legal position obliges a Governor to call an assembly session in accordance with the advice of the state cabinet,” the Congress leaders stated in their letter to Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-former-congress-law-ministers-write-to-rajasthan-governor-asking-him-to-convene-assembly-session/story-c9kutzJ8UqJVkFGKD7fIhJ.html

However, Omar, a former union minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, made it clear he would continue to work for his party National Conference(NC) and people of Jammu and Kashmir. “I have been leader of the assembly of the state. In its time the most empowered assembly. I cannot and will not be a member of what is now one of the most disempowered assemblies in the country. It’s as simple as that,” Omar, 50, told PTI. “It is not a threat or blackmail, it’s not a display of me sulking. It’s just a simple acknowledgement that I won’t fight an election to lead the Union Territory assembly which is such a disempowered assembly.” Strongly critical of the dilution of Article 370 of the Constitution, Omar said many reasons had been given to justify abrogation of the provision that granted special status, and claimed that none of those stand any scrutiny. Omar, who is the vice president of the NC, was critical of what had been done to Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 last year, and said his party would oppose it in the Supreme Court. “We believe in democracy and peaceful opposition.” The abrogation of Article 370 was supposed to end terrorism but the government had been telling Supreme Court that violence in Jammu and Kashmir was increasing, he said. Similarly, arguments touted such as lack of development and investment due to Article 370 belie facts, he added. Asked whether his decision not to contest the assembly polls has been discussed with the leadership of his party, Omar replied, “it’s my view and it’s my decision. No one can be forced to fight an election against their will”. On the delimitation exercise being carried out by the administration of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar said, “NC is and will continue to explore all legal options to deal with the developments and decisions post August 5 last year.” The elections are likely to be held only after the delimitation exercise is completed in the union territory, which came into existence on October 31 last year. The erstwhile state was split into two union territories--Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-contest-j-k-elections-till-full-statehood-is-restored-omar-abdullah/story-6mhcIPyNQcYwBIgCzf55BP.html

A team of French personnel who are experts in inter-hospital transfers by military means is also being sent to India. France acquired expertise in this field as it organised numerous transfers between hospitals. A French Air Force aircraft will fly in the equipment and personnel on Tuesday. The Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft is equipped with a “Morpheus” kit that enables the transport of critically ill patients. The donation of the medical equipment and provision of technical expertise is in line with a recent announcement by President Emmanuel Macron, the French embassy said in a statement. Also read | Coronavirus: France to grant special aid for most vulnerable in India, says MacronThe medical assistance package includes 50 Osiris-3 ventilators, which are portable and easy to use, and 70 Yuwell 830 ventilators with “bilevel positive airway pressure” (BiPAP mode), which are non-invasive hospital ventilators for mild Covid-19 patients. The Osiris ventilators are useful for emergency transport, intra-hospital transfer and recovery, and have different modes, including non-invasive ventilation. The Yuwell 830 ventilators use BiPAP to supply oxygen to lungs without intubation. France will also donate 50,000 high-quality serological IgG/IgM test kits and 50,000 nose and throat swabs and modes of medical transport. “As longstanding strategic partners, France and India are working together closely on the international response to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as providing reciprocal assistance according to the needs of the two countries,” the statement said. In a letter dated July 24, Macron thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for India’s support to France with medical supplies earlier this year. Macron wrote: “When France was going through a critical phase of this public health crisis earlier this spring, India was by our side. It played a very important role with regard to medicines. I wish to thank you once again for having authorised the export of medicines essential for the treatment of critically ill patients. This gesture reflected the exceptional nature of the partnership between our two countries.” Also read: In Covid-19 crisis, France to aid India’s most vulnerable with 200 million eurosHe added, “India, in turn, is going through a difficult phase of the crisis. In these painful times for your nation, I desired France to stand fully by your side. To this end, I directed that we be able to respond to the needs identified by your administration by extending aid that is exceptional in its scope and modalities. “I believe that it is during tough times that historic ties are forged and strengthened between nations.” The announcement of the medical assistance coincided with the five Rafale jets leaving a French airbase for the 7,000-km journey to India with air-to-air refuelling and a stop en route in the United Arab Emirates. They are scheduled to reach India on July 29. France has completed the delivery of 10 jets on schedule, and five will stay back for a training mission. The delivery of all 36 jets will be completed by the end of 2021. French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain will hand over the medical equipment to RK Jain, secretary general of the Indian Red Cross Society, on Tuesday. France had earlier extended financial support of 200 million euros to India through the French Development Agency (AFD) to boost social welfare systems and protect vulnerable people. The credit financing agreement was signed on June 22, with the programme designed by the World Bank already being rolled out. French companies have contributed more than six million euros (Rs 48 crore) to India’s national relief funds as part of their Covid-19 crisis response. Several companies have also supplied essential medical equipment and others are providing help to vulnerable sections of society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-france-to-provide-india-120-ventilators-50-000-test-kits/story-wNbqE0416EIcSHpIJThKcP.html

27-07-2020||India||RBI governor Shaktikanta Das highlights 5 positive shifts in economy||Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday said five dynamic shifts have the potential to shape the future of the country’s economy -- fortunes shifting in favour of the farm sector, changing energy mix in favour of renewable, leveraging information and communication technology (ICT) and start-ups, strengthening supply and value chains, and focusing on infrastructure as a growth multiplier. “They [the five factors] may escape our attention in this all-consuming engrossment with the [coronavirus disease, or Covid-19] pandemic, but they could be nursing the potential to repair, to rebuild and renew our tryst with developmental aspirations. These dynamic shifts have been taking place incipiently for some time,” he said at an event, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and held via video-conference.ALSO WATCH | ‘Big push to Infrastructure projects can re-ignite the economy’: RBI governorCommenting on the infrastructure as a growth driver, he said the infrastructure gap still remains large and there is a need for diversifying financing options. “On financing options for infrastructure, we are recovering from the consequences of excessive exposure of banks to infrastructure projects. Non-performing assets (NPAs) relating to infrastructure lending by banks has remained at elevated levels,” he said. Also read | ‘Covid-19 biggest test of robustness, resilience of our economic system’: RBI Governor“Promotion of the corporate bond market, securitisation to enhance market-based solutions to the problem of stressed assets, and appropriate pricing and collection of user charges should continue to receive priority in policy attention,” he added. He proposed a big push to certain targeted mega infrastructure projects that can reignite the economy. “This could begin in the form of a north-south and east-west expressway together with high-speed rail corridors, both of which would generate large forward and backward linkages for several other sectors of the economy and regions around the rail/road networks,” he said. On agricultural transformation, Das suggested a change in agriculture policy focus from minimum support price (MSP). “Hitherto, the main instrument has been minimum support prices, but the experience has been that price incentives have been costly, inefficient, and even distortive,” he said. He hoped that an efficient domestic supply chain will facilitate “domestic free trade” in agriculture that is triggered by three key policy changes -- the amendment of the Essential Commodities Act (ECA), 1955; the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020; and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020. Also read | ‘Financial landscape has deteriorated but light shines through,’ says RBI Governor: 10 pointsWith this enabling legislative framework, the focus must turn to crop diversification, food processing, agricultural exports, and public and private capital formation in the farm sector, he said. A similar opportunity space exists in the energy sector, especially renewable, he said adding that India has emerged a power surplus country, exporting electricity to neighbouring countries. Das said the shift to greener energy would reduce the coal import bill, create employment opportunities, ensure a sustained inflow of new investments, and promote ecologically sustainable growth. He, however, said that reforming retail distribution of electricity while reducing commercial, technical and transmission losses remained a key challenge. According to Das, ICT, and start-ups are one of the key growth drivers. “The ICT revolution has placed India on the global map as a competent, reliable, and low-cost supplier of knowledge-based solutions,” he said. He said Covid-19 has impacted the outlook for start-ups, particularly the availability of funding due to an all-pervasive atmosphere of risk aversion. Besides, globally, regulatory uncertainty relating to work permits and immigration policies could also amplify challenges. The sector has to also deal with concerns relating to data privacy and data security, he added. “Promoting young firms and start-ups will be critical for greater employment generation and higher productivity-led economic growth in India ... Innovation and the ability to nurture ideas into actualisation would be the key challenge. In this context, private enterprise and investment have a game-changing role,” he said. He said this is the time to strengthen the domestic and global supply chain. “Investment in sectors with strong forward and backward linkages in the supply chain can generate higher production, income, and employment. Consequently, identification of such sectors becomes critical for strategic policy interventions,” he said. Global shifts in value chains in response to Covid-19 and other developments would create opportunities for India, he said. “Besides focusing on diversifying sources of imports, it may also be necessary to focus on greater strategic trade integration, including in the form of early completion of bilateral free trade agreements with the US (United States), the EU (European Union), and the UK (United Kingdom),” he added. DK Srivastava, the chief policy advisor at consultancy firm EY India, said the RBI Governor has invited India’s corporate sector to invest heavily in these five sectors that define an ongoing economic shift in the economy. “First, in agriculture, the government’s new regulatory initiatives including the creation of a genuine pan-India market in agricultural products, will make returns to investment in agriculture more remunerative. Second, in the case of renewables, there is clear scope for taking advantage of progressive cost reductions and substituting imports of solar panels from China by creating domestic capacity. Third, in the case of information and communication technology, the government’s initiatives for curbing Chinese technologies and applications open up competitive space for Indian initiatives. Fourth, global supply chains are bound to be realigned in favour of the country and the private sector should invest extensively and take advantage of the space that is being opened up,” he said. According to Srivastava, in the case of infrastructure, the private sector already has a specific role in financing the Rs 100-lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP). “The current and next years are critical for the NIP since the proposed schedule provides for peaking of infrastructure investment in these years, particularly in the construction sector. Financing of infrastructure investment in the current and subsequent years will be key to the recovery of India’s growth and pushing it towards its potential,” he said. “The RBI Governor acknowledges the role of both the public and private sectors for infrastructure financing. In the first case, greater flexibility in setting the fiscal deficit limits for the central and state governments may be needed and in the second case, innovative market solutions may be called for,” he added. Srivastava proposed another round of fiscal stimulus. “To finance public investment in infrastructure, the government may consider another round of fiscal stimulus focused mainly on increasing its capital expenditure on infrastructure,” he said. The state governments may also be persuaded to borrow up to the enhanced limit of 5% of their respective gross state domestic product (GSDP). “The prerequisite conditions for availing of this increased limit may also be relaxed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-highlights-5-positive-shifts-in-economy/story-g5HxxlJxsYn6U3u44aZS5O.html

27-07-2020||India||IMD launches first weather app for general public||Now people can keep abreast of weather updates with Mausam, a mobile app that provides all current weather forecasts through the week and even radar-based forecasts updated every 10 minutes. This is the first app launched by the 145-year-old India Meteorological Department (IMD) that is meant for everyone. It already has another app, Meghdoot, meant only for farmers and those involved in agriculture. The ministry of earth sciences launched the app on Monday on the occasion of its foundation day. The app, which can be downloaded on Playstore and Appstore, is dedicated to the public and designed to provide weather information and forecasts in a lucid manner without technical jargon, the ministry said in a statement. Also read: Showers over past 4 days lower Delhi’s rain deficit to 16%Mausam offers fives services – current temperature, humidity, wind speed and wind direction for 200 cities and the information is updated eight times a day. There is information on sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset, three hourly warnings of local weather phenomena and their intensity issued for about 800 stations, and forecast of weather conditions for 450 cities for the past 24 hours and seven day. There are also alerts issued twice a day for all districts for the next five days in colour code (red, orange and yellow) to warn users of any intense weather phenomena, and station-wise radar forecasts updated every 10 minutes. The app was designed and developed jointly by ICRISAT’s Digital Agriculture and Youth team, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune, and IMD. “Meghdoot was meant only for farmers. This is for everyone. The now-cast feature of this app will tell you if there will be rain, thunder or any other severe weather in your area based on data from the nearest meteorological station. Otherwise, there will be city-based information and forecasts and even radar products,” said M Rajeevan, secretary in the ministry of earth sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-launches-first-weather-app-for-general-public/story-Gk7f80plbLgqMczqB24lEJ.html

Pay cut isn’t across board.We request you for urgent meeting so we may brief you on ground reality,” according to ANILast week, senior pilots in Air India had expressed discontent over the differences in pay cuts announced by the national carrier for pilots and senior management. They claimed that the salaries of top AI officials have been reduced by a smaller percentage compared to their pay cuts.In a letter to the civil aviation minister last week, Air India’s executive pilots committee had also said that the pay cuts and compulsory leave without pay scheme could have potentially disastrous psychological impact and lead to “desperate and extreme acts”.Air India had defended its decision saying wages would later be reviewed in accordance with the airline’s improved financial condition.The national carrier has also started the process of identification for redundant or surplus employees in the company to be sent on compulsory leave without pay for a period from six months up to five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-discontent-in-air-india-over-pay-cuts-pilots-body-seeks-meet-with-minister/story-ItFem6QJ74IJQwOyvXhovK.html

The monsoon session, which was curtailed to a single day in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, took a stormy turn no sooner the adjournment motion moved by the Opposition legislators was rejected by Speaker Rajesh Patnekar as “not being in order”, prompting the lawmakers to storm the well of the House amid sloganeering. They stopped after they were escorted out of the House by marshals.Later, the opposition legislators met Goa Governor Satya Pal Malik to impress upon him the “murder of democracy” under the Sawant government’s watch. “Today, the Goa government has murdered democracy by rejecting a discussion on the Covid-19 pandemic and passing the state budget for 2020-21 without proper discussion in the legislative assembly. The government displayed its insensitive approach towards the health and well-being of the people of Goa by rejecting the adjournment motion moved by the opposition MLAs (members of the legislative assembly) demanding a discussion on the pandemic. The government has passed a record business in the shortest time, including 86 demands, 11 bills and passing of the Goa Appropriation Bill and supplementary demands for grants in 2020-21, without any discussion,” stated a letter by Digambar Kamat, leader of opposition in Goa assembly, to Governor Malik and signed by other opposition lawmakers. However, the government has defended its stance on the one-day assembly session and also the handling of the pandemic. “The opposition should come with constructive suggestions. It is easy to criticise. But the Covid-19 outbreak didn’t occur in a planned manner. It has taken everybody by surprise. The standard operating procedures (SOPs) put out by the state government is in the interest of the public. The state’s record is one of the best in the country as far as conducting tests per million population is concerned. The situation was different, when lockdown restrictions were in place because we had got time to put a mechanism in place,” stated state health minister Vishwajit Rane in the assembly. “We regret the state has reported 35 deaths to date. Our positivity, recovery, and the mortality rate is 8.11%, 65%, and 0.7%, respectively, all of which are much better than the national average,” he added. Earlier, opposition lawmakers had called the one-day assembly session “a farce”. “In a democracy, a discussion has to take place. Today, he (Rane) makes a statement that everything is fine. There is no transparency when it comes to Covid-19 and it is the only issue that should be discussed in the House. If we can’t do this then why have the House? Why do we need the House? Dissolve it,” said Vijai Sardesai, the leader of Goa Forward Party, a regional outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-passes-budget-in-hurried-session-opposition-walks-out-meets-governor/story-mWkLkCe3OHVLRc6H5Cll5N.html

27-07-2020||India||Ajit Pawar’s birthday wish for Uddhav Thackeray comes with a veiled message||Hours after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that he is in firm control of the “steering wheel” of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), a coalition government comprising the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, his deputy Ajit Pawar of the NCP sent him wishes for his 60th birthday on Twitter with a picture of the two leaders with Pawar on the driver’s seat. At the stroke of midnight on Sunday, Pawar tweeted the picture of him at the wheel of a golf cart and CM Thackeray in the passenger’s seat. Pawar, who was among the first to wish CM Thackeray, caused a flutter in Maharashtra’s political circles with the naughty picture. “Best wishes to the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena party president and MVA leader, Uddhav Thackerayji. Wish you a healthy & long life!.” Pawar tweeted. Also read: Amid talks of rift, Uddhav Thackeray meets Ajit PawarThackeray, in an interview to the Rajya Sabha member and Saamana executive editor Sanjay Raut, published on Sunday had said, “The future of my government is not in the hands of the opposition ... It is a strong government and I am at the steering wheel with two other partners. A three-wheeler (rickshaw) is a vehicle of poor people.” Political observers say the silent power struggle could continue between the two top leaders in the government. Observers said that this is a display of the silent tussle between the two leaders. Surendra Jondhale, a political analyst called it “political indecency” on Pawar’s part. “There is some amount of restlessness to show who is more decisive and assertive, as the two leaders have different styles of functioning. It is unfortunate that (Ajit) Pawar chose to put out such a picture. There should be some kind of political decency. One should not take it lightly, as it is impolite and indecent,” he said. Also read: Ministers unhappy with ‘interference’ of NCP’s Ajit PawarEarlier in July, Thackeray made sure he got back five Sena corporators, who had defected to the NCP in the presence of Pawar, back into his party fold. His deputy had presided over the entry of Sena corporators into the NCP, which did not go down well with Thackeray, as he made his displeasure known to Pawar. “There must be some friction due to that [episode] too, but (Ajit) Pawar should not forget that Thackeray has direct access to Sharad Pawar. He (Ajit Pawar) has never hidden his vaulting political ambition, but this is not the opportune moment to bare such thoughts amid the pandemic,” Jondhale added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajit-pawar-s-birthday-wish-for-uddhav-thackeray-comes-with-a-veiled-message/story-aWp29qtdqv8mCGPT3TMbPL.html
27-07-2020||India||‘Once successful, Covid-19 vaccine doses will be distributed by govt’: Serum Institute||Serum Institute of India (SII) on Monday said that the distribution of Covid-19 vaccine vials in India will be through a government network rather than private entities. The firm, known to be the largest vaccine manufacturer by volume across the world, said everyone will get the dose. The clarification came a day after CEO Adar Poonawalla tweeted saying the company would “keep more than enough” doses of the Covid-19 vaccine for the Parsis, the community he belongs to. “It was just a casual and friendly conversation between two Parsi’s. Once the vaccine is made, everyone will be getting it. It is very early to talk about this,” the SII said in a written statement. SII has been chosen by the Oxford and its partner AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine once it gets ready. On the distribution part, SII said people will not have to purchase it in the market since the government will be distributing it. “On distribution - once the vaccine trials are done and successful, it will be procured and distributed by the government so that people don’t have to buy it directly,” said the Pune-based firm. Also read: India’s coronavirus epidemic is now the world’s fastest growingEarlier on Sunday, Poonawalla was responding to a tweet from entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala in which the latter had proposed to have a “special quota” for Parsis, albeit on a “lighter note”. “Yes, @RonnieScrewvala, we will keep more than enough for the community. Our production capacity of just one day will be enough to cover every Parsi on the planet... given the size of our community!,” Poonawalla tweeted. In his tweet, Srewvala had said, “On a lighter note, Since Parsi’s are to be an extinct race (Though average age of Parsi’s show otherwise) there is a lobby that as the vaccine does come in there will be a special quota under saving from extinction race..& why not if a Parsi is at the forefront of it.” On SII’s plan to start clinical trials in India for the vaccine for which it has partnered with AstraZeneca, the firm said, “On trials - we are hoping to start the Phase 3 clinical trials in August post regulatory approvals.” SII has already made an application seeking permission from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for conducting phase II/III human clinical trials in India. The company plans to conduct trials in Pune and Mumbai which have seen high prevalence of Covid-19 infections that will help SII test the efficacy of the vaccine. The SII in an earlier statement had said that by end of August, between 4,000 to 5,000 people in Pune and Mumbai will be injected with the vaccine as part of trials that are scheduled to last over two months. The steps by SII on seeking application from the DCGA came after Oxford University reported satisfactory progress from the vaccines test results last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/once-successful-covid-19-vaccine-doses-will-be-distributed-by-govt-serum-institute/story-ZnSewvSEYV9igvUWHDsTEK.html

Citing the coronavirus situation, the Governor had earlier said it would be difficult to call all the members of legislative assembly (MLAs) at a short notice.Governor Mishra, according to news agency ANI, had asked whether CM Ashok Gehlot wants a trust vote in the state assembly.“Do you want to move Motion of Confidence? It is not mentioned in the proposal but you have been speaking about it in the media,” the governor was quoted as saying by ANI.The Governor had earlier questioned the need for calling the session when the government already had the majority and the disqualification matter was pending in the Supreme Court. In another development, assembly Speaker CP Joshi withdrew his petition from the top court challenging a July 21 order of the high court directing him to defer disqualification proceedings against former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 Congress legislators backing him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-governor-kalraj-mishra-calls-for-state-assembly-session-denies-he-was-delaying-it/story-YFL3zk5K7MWKbJyxvCLImM.html

27-07-2020||India||UP leads in setting up compressed bio gas plants, followed by Maharashtra and Haryana||Uttar Pradesh leads states in setting up plants to produce compressed bio-gas (CBG) as part of efforts to reduce India’s dependence on imported energy and to check pollution from stubble burning that chokes the National Capital Region every winter. The state is followed by Maharashtra and Haryana, according to the petroleum ministry. Of the 515 letters of intent (LoI) issued to entrepreneurs for setting up CBG plants across the country, 126 projects are located in Uttar Pradesh, 75 in Maharashtra, 59 in Haryana, 35 in Andhra Pradesh, 24 in Punjab and seven in Delhi, the official data showed. Gujarat received the nod for setting up 32 plants, Karnataka 25, Madhya Pradesh 24, Chhattisgarh 22, Tamil Nadu 16, West Bengal 13, Bihar 11, Odisha, Uttarakhand and Telangana nine each, Jharkhand seven, Rajasthan five, and Goa, Jammu and Kashmir and Assam two each. The estimated cost of the 515 CBG plants is Rs 18,000 crore. A spokesperson of the petroleum ministry said, “The SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) scheme is expected to have 5,000 plants across the country by 2023 that can produce 15 million metric tonnes of CBG and proportionately reduce our dependence on energy imports.” Biomass sources such as agricultural residue, cattle dung, sugarcane press mud, municipal solid waste and waste from sewage treatment plants is used to produce bio-gas through the process of anaerobic decomposition. Bio-gas is purified to remove hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide and water vapour to produce and compress CBG, which has methane content of more than 90%, he said. “CBG has calorific value and other properties similar to compressed natural gas (CNG), and it can be used as green renewable automotive fuel. It can replace CNG in automotive, industrial and commercial areas,” the spokesperson added. The move will reduce pollution due to stubble burning. “Bio-mass surplus in India is about 150 million tonnes. From late September through October each year, farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, burn an estimated 35 million tonnes of crop waste as a low-cost straw-disposal practice. CBG plants can curb this practice by giving an additional income option to farmers,” he said. India imports nearly 83% of the crude oil its processes. About 50% of its natural gas requirement is also imported. The government has set a target to reduce this import dependence by 10% in the next two years. This is the first time an alternative to natural gas is being sold by oil marketing companies. Commercial sales of CBG from seven retail outlets of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) have already started. Two outlets are in Maharashtra – Pune and Kohlapur – and five are located in Tamil Nadu, including two in Salem and one each in Namakkal, Rasipuram and Puduchatram. While inaugurating one such plant at Namakkal last month, petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the government has been promoting bio-fuels, including CBG, to increase the green energy mix, reduce import dependence, create employment, especially in semi-urban and rural areas, and reduce pollution. “Usage of CBG shall assist in achieving climate change goals of India as per the Paris Agreement 2015,” he said, adding the project is in alignment with flagship schemes such as Swachh Bharat, Atmnirbhar Bharat and Make in India. The business is lucrative for entrepreneurs as state-run oil majors such as IOC and GAIL India take off-take guarantee to such plants. Besides, the government is considering according it a priority sector lending tag for easy and cheaper finance. The government gives subsidy for setting up new CBG projects, which could be availed up to 2020-21, the spokesperson said. According to Pradhan, the government is in the process of including bio-manure in the Fertilizer Control Order 1985 to make the project more lucrative. Bio-manure is a key by-product of CBG plants. The move will make it easier for such plants to market bio-manure and provide an opportunity for organic farming. According to the oil ministry, 5,000 CBG plants are expected to produce 50 million metric tonnes of bio-manure. The spokesperson said Western countries such as Germany, Italy, the UK, France and Switzerland too are promoting bio-gas. The number of bio-gas plants in Germany has doubled to nearly 9,000 plants from 4,136 plants in 2010. The total bio-gas production capacity of the plants is 8.98 billion cubic metres (BCM), which is equivalent to 6.6 million metric tonnes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-leads-in-setting-up-compressed-bio-gas-plants-followed-by-maharashtra-and-haryana/story-k9ykwFZn7iBFKuM5BehwJM.html

Stating that recent agriculture reforms have opened up new opportunities, the RBI Governor said the sector is emerging as a bright spot and “fortune is shifting in favour of the farm sector in the economy”.He noted that 1 per cent increase in global value chain participation can boost per capita income level of a country by more than 1 per cent.The central bank governor further said that it may be necessary to focus on greater strategic trade integration, including in the form of early completion of free trade agreements with the US, EU and the UK.With regard to forex rate, Das said the RBI has no fixed target for the rupee but will monitor undue volatility.The RBI Governor assured the industry that the central bank will not hesitate to take steps as and when required amid challenges and will remain extremely vigilant.He said that various liquidity measures taken by the central bank have revived the corporate bond market. Corporate bond issuance has touched Rs 1 lakh crore in the first quarter, much higher than the same period a year ago, Das said.The RBI Governor said he has advised banks to undertake a stress test and raise capital proactively to meet challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infrastructure-push-can-reignite-economic-growth-rbi-governor/story-YXYRnQjI7OWYoThRLl6CuM.html

The CM said he will also petition President Ram Nath Kovind and inform him about the situation in the state. “I spoke with the Prime Minister yesterday and told him about the behaviour of the Governor. I spoke with him regarding the letter I had written to him seven days back,” said Gehlot, adding that the Governor has sent them a six page ‘prem patr (Love letter)”.The Governor this morning sought clarifications from the state government as he returned the proposal by CM Gehlot for the convening of the assembly session from July 31. Citing the coronavirus situation, the Governor said it would be difficult to call all the members of legislative assembly (MLAs) at a short notice.Gehlot, who has been pressing for an assembly session to prove his majority on the floor of the House, has alleged that the Governor is under “pressure from the top”. The Governor denied the Congress’ charge, saying he will follow constitutional norms to convene the House.“As per established conventions of the Constitution, principles of parliamentary democracy, the relevant articles of the Constitution and authoritative pronouncements of the Supreme Court, the Governor is duty bound to act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers in the matter of convening the state assembly,” three former law ministers from Congress party wrote to the Governor.The Congress leaders drew upon the Supreme Court judgments in the Shamsher Singh case in 1974 and the more recently Nabam Rebia in 2016 on the role of the Governor. In the Nabam Rebia case, the top court held that a Governor cannot employ his “discretion” and should strictly abide by the “aid and advice of the of the cabinet” to summon the house. Last week, Gehlot had written to PM Modi regarding the attempts to destabilise the elected Congress government in the state and alleged poaching of Congress MLAs by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Gehlot had also named Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in his letter to the PM.Earlier, Gehlot had said he was ready to go to the Rashtrapati Bhawan, the President’s official residence at Delhi, and even the Prime Minister’s house to defeat the “BJP conspiracy”, exhorting his MLAs to stand firm like a rock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spoke-to-pm-about-rajasthan-governor-s-behaviour-will-petition-president-cm-ashok-gehlot/story-7WcxipvYI8Gr5KjGxhhsdP.html

The state government, however, is treading cautiously and may not ease curbs as liberally as other states or the Centre. Though Covid-19 cases in the state have risen by more than 9,000 cases a day over the past week, the Maharashtra government has resolved to gradually open up activities after the sixth phase of lockdown ends on July 31. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in an interview to Saamana, said the lockdown won’t be abruptly lifted as he doesn’t want a second wave of infections in Maharashtra, as has happened in some countries. The state plans a gradual rollout of relaxations. “The discussion on opening up activities has begun. The decision will be taken in the next few days and the notification will be issued by July 31,” said Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar. According to officials, inter-district and inter-state transport services won’t be allowed at this stage as Covid-19 cases are rapidly rising in rural areas of Maharashtra. A state government official said on condition of anonymity: “At the beginning of July, we were thinking of allowing more transport facilities and additional workforce in offices. But the spike in cases in Mumbai Metropolitan Region and cities like Pune and other districts derailed this plan. “There are demands for allowing gymnasiums and malls to reopen, but this is unlikely to be allowed immediately. Few more commercial and industrial activities that will not lead to too much crowding will be allowed.” Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The official added the strategy for allowing activities will be fine tuned after meetings with the Centre and by following its plans for relaxations. He said Maharashtra is taking into account upcoming festivals such as Bakri Eid (August 1) and the 11-day Ganeshotsav (beginning from August 22) while rolling out relaxations. Under the state’s “Mission Begin Again”, which was rolled out in June, Maharashtra allowed fitness activities in open spaces, while offices were permitted to function with 10% of their workforce. Shops were allowed to open on alternate days and salons were allowed to operate with strict protocols. It also allowed hotels, but not restaurants, to open from July 8. Maharashtra recorded 201,038 infections (or 53.50% of the state’s total tally) in July alone, taking the total to 375,799.

Click here for full Covid-19 coverageClarifying her remarks, Priyanka Gandhi said that the point she was trying to make seemed to have been “lost in translation”. “You’re absolutely right @omarabdullah. What I actually said was that leadership becomes evident during a crisis, and while the pandemic is on, the nation needs a leadership that works in the interest of its people,” she tweeted. “However, the BJP government has been busy trying to topple democratically-elected governments, revealing its true mindset and character. It seems my point got lost in translation,” she added. On Sunday, Abdullah took to Twitter to counter her remarks and tagged a news report headlined – ‘BJP Trying To Topple Governments Amid Pandemic’. “I don’t get the “during pandemic” argument. As though somehow toppling an elected government would be less reprehensible if we weren’t battling a health crisis. IMHO (In my humble opinion) it’s wrong regardless of Covid-19,” he tweeted. Participating in the party’s #SpeakUpForDemocracy online campaign on Sunday, Priyanka Gandhi had said, “Leadership is recognised in times of crisis. During coronavirus pandemic, the country needs a leadership that works in the public interest. But the BJP-led Central government has made its intention clear by trying to topple the governments elected by the people. The public will answer.” The nationwide online campaign was launched by the Congress in protest against the alleged attempts by the BJP to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led government in Rajasthan. Congress leaders and workers are also holding demonstrations in front of Raj Bhawans across the country, except for Jaipur, to protest against Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra’s alleged “delaying tactics” in convening the assembly session to enable CM Gehlot to prove his government’s majority on the floor of the House after his former deputy Sachin Pilot and 18 other legislators rebelled against the party over two weeks ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/point-got-lost-in-translation-priyanka-tells-omar-after-he-reacts-to-her-tweet-on-rajasthan-crisis/story-OSyA2RvPi71RYML2fkBJOK.html

27-07-2020||India||Rajasthan crisis: SC allows Speaker to withdraw appeal against HC order on rebel MLAs||Rajasthan Assembly Speaker CP Joshi on Monday withdrew his plea before the Supreme Court (SC) that had challenged the Rajasthan high court’s (HC) July 21 order of directing him to defer action on the disqualification notice against 19 dissident Congress lawmakers, including sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for Joshi told the three-judge bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra and also included Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, that the HC on July 24 had passed a detailed order staying action by Speaker Joshi against the dissident members of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs) and setting out legal issues, which it was proposing to consider. Consequently, the plea before the apex court against the July 21 order has become infructuous, he submitted. Also read: Among 2 questions to Ashok Gehlot, Rajasthan governor has a query about floor test“So, kindly permit us to withdraw this plea”, Sibal said.The bench allowed the prayer. Earlier on July 23, the SC had declined a stay on the HC proceedings while stating that it would examine the larger issue of whether or not HC has the jurisdiction to interfere with disqualification proceedings initiated by Speaker Joshi. Pilot and 18 Congress MLAs had moved the Rajasthan HC on July 15 challenging the disqualification notice issued to them by Speaker Joshi a day earlier. The plea also challenged the Constitutional validity of clause 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, which provides for disqualification of legislators for “voluntarily giving up” party membership. Joshi’s notice stated that the MLAs were being asked for show-cause under clause 2(1) (a) since their conduct, including speaking against the party leadership, showed their intention to leave the Congress. Also read| Rajasthan political crisis: What does BSP’s party whip mean?The Pilot camp, however, submitted before the HC that the Speaker’s notice was in violation of their freedom of expression and voicing dissent against party leadership or CM Ashok Gehlot cannot be construed as an intention to quit the party. Joshi had argued that as per the 1992 SC judgment in the Kihoto Hollohan case, the HC cannot interfere with the disqualification proceedings till he actually makes a decision, and as a result, Pilot’s petition was premature. The HC after hearing the case for three days reserved its verdict on July 21 asking Joshi not to take any action against dissident MLAs till it pronounces its verdict on July 24. Then, Joshi moved the SC on July 22 without waiting for the HC order. Joshi’s plea was heard by the SC the following day, but declined to stay the HC order or proceedings. The HC had pronounced its order on July 24 saying the issue involves Constitutional question, including the validity of clause 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule. Joshi maintained that the Speaker’s proceedings are immune from the challenge before courts till a decision on disqualification is arrived at by the Speaker. He also argued that interim challenge against Speaker’s actions is not permissible, as per the Kihoto Hollohan case. “It pains us that HCs are not following SC judgments,” Sibal told the apex court on Monday in his concluding remarks during the hearing of the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-crisis-sc-allows-speaker-to-withdraw-appeal-against-hc-order-on-rebel-mlas/story-whN2UC06OpZKgOxcNmq3DO.html
27-07-2020||India||Won’t lie about Chinese intrusions even if political career goes to hell: Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said those claiming Chinese forces haven’t occupied Indian territory in Ladakh are “not nationalistic and patriotic”, and he will continue to speak the truth about Beijing’s transgressions even if his “whole political career goes to hell”. Stepping up the attack on the government over the Chinese intrusions, Gandhi said the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) continues to occupy parts of Indian territory in Ladakh. “Now, it is pretty clear that the Chinese have entered our territory. This disturbs me. It makes frankly my blood boil. How can some other nation just come into our territory?” he said in a video message issued on Monday. Gandhi, who has been criticised by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) for his remarks on the border standoff, said “hiding the truth” and allowing China to occupy Indian territory is “anti-national”, and bringing it to people’s attention is “patriotic”. “I think the people who are lying about Chinese entering our country are the people that are not nationalistic. I think the people who are lying and who are saying the Chinese are not in India, they are the people who are not patriotic,” he said. Gandhi asserted he wouldn’t lie to the people of India on Chinese intrusions even if it costs him politically. “So frankly, I don’t care if it costs me politically. I don’t care if I have no political career at all after that. But, I am going to say the truth as far as Indian territory is concerned,” he said.

I simply will not do it. I don’t care if my whole career goes to hell. I’m not going to lie,” he added. Titled “Tough Questions on China”, the short video is the fourth in a series on the India-China face-off. Through the videos, Gandhi wants to share his thoughts on national issues. In the first video issued on July 17, he said India’s “troubled economy, foreign policy and neighbourhood” prompted China to take an aggressive stand against the country. The second video, titled “China’s Strategic Game Plan” and released on July 20, featured Gandhi talking about how the Chinese have triggered the border issue to pressure Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Also read: India twists the knife, will only cancel tenders that Chinese firm are set to winIn one of the sharpest attacks on Modi over the border standoff, he said the Chinese are attacking his image as “they understand that for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’ (56-inch)” and claimed that “if he allowed the Chinese to understand that they can manipulate him because of his image, the prime minister will no longer be worth anything for India”. In the third video titled “How should India respond to China?” released on July 23, Gandhi listed different measures to deal with the Chinese. “Psychologically you have to deal with the Chinese from a position of strength. If you deal with them from a position of strength, you can work with them, you can get what you need and it can be actually done. But if they sense weakness then you had it,” he said. “The first thing is you not going to take on China without a vision. And by that I don’t mean a national vision. I mean an international vision,” added Gandhi. In the latest video, Gandhi said as an Indian, his number one priority is the nation and its people. “How do you react to people who say your questions to the PM on China weaken India? Now if you as a politician want me to keep quiet and lie to my people, when I am absolutely convinced [when] I see the satellite photos. I speak to the ex-army people,” he added. Gandhi has repeatedly targeted Modi and his government over the Chinese transgressions and said the prime minister was not being transparent on the issue. The Congress has been demanding that status quo ante be restored at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and Chinese troops be pushed back to their side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-lie-about-chinese-intrusions-even-if-my-political-career-goes-to-hell-rahul-gandhi/story-M3jjKyMlz4BDdIWcczSDhP.html
27-07-2020||India||Rajasthan crisis: For BSP MLA Rajendra Gudha, it’s a rerun of 2008||New Delhi: Rajasthan legislator Rajendra Singh Gudha is one of the six MLAs that jumped from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) to the Congress in September last year but he’s not losing any sleep over the diktat that’s been issued by his party. Speaking to Hindustan Times from the Fairmont Hotel in Jaipur, he said, “This whip (order not to vote in support of Ashok Gehlot) isn’t worth the paper it’s issued on.’’Gudha’s blase attitude is partly because he’s done this many times before. It was 2008 assembly polls that he first fought on a BSP ticket from Udaipurwati. Just like in 2018, the BSP had that year as well won six seats, their best performance in the state. And again, just like post 2018, Gehlot had engineered all six MLAs to join the Congress party. In fact, Gudha and another MLA Murari Meena were the original BSP MLAs who are MLAs even now. What’s interesting about Gudha, however, is that while he was a Congress minister till 2013, he went back to the BSP ahead of the last polls because the Congress didn’t give him a ticket again.“You should ask the BSP why they again gave me a ticket,’’ he said. “As far as the anti-defection laws go, you have to have 2/3rd of the party but in this case, we had the entire party leaving for the Congress. So what’s the problem?’’ Gudha is also infamous for alleging in the assembly last year, that the BSP handed tickets to only those that paid. It was an allegation strongly rejected by the party at the time.His former BSP colleague Murari Meena however has a completely different point of view. That may also stem from the fact that Meena is with Team Sachin Pilot while Gudha supports Gehlot. Meena has been with the Congress since he switched from the BSP in 2008.“The BSP challenge is on a legally sound ground,’’ said Meena, “In 2008, the BSP merger challenge didn’t stand the scrutiny of the court because it was filed by an outsider. This time it has been challenged by an MLA.’’That MLA is the BJP’s Madan Dilawar but the Rajasthan High Court dismissed his petition today. BSP chief Mayawati’s move to challenge the merger came as a statement that it was only possible if the BSP had merged nationally with the Congress Party. The six MLAs are key to the Congress which has it took its tally from 99 to a comfortable majority of 105 without the help of supporting independents and other parties. “The merger took place months ago. It is surprising why the BSP central leadership has woken up and realised the merger was illegal. BSP is making this plea only after a BJP MLA - Madan Dilawar has filed a petition in the HC to disqualify the BSP MLAs. The BSP and Mr Dilawar are both wrong,’’ said Sunil Fernandes, a lawyer who is representing the Congress Party. “The X Schedule permits merger of legislative party also. The contention that BSP as a national party must merge with the INC for the BSP MLAs to merge with INC is misconceived. The parent party may not merge but members of a legislative party have the right to merge with some other party under the X Schedule (Anti - Defection Act) of the Constitution.’’Fernandes was countering the contention of BSP’s senior leader Satish Mishra who in a statement last night said that individual MLAs cannot merge unless there was a national level merger between the two parties.“Whip was issued as the MLAs had won elections on BSP tickets and they can’t get involved in Congress’ activities or vote for them. BSP chief decided this after a lot of deliberation. We’re working on her (Mayawati’s) directions,’’ said BSP’s Bhagwan Singh Baba.“It’s wrong to see this as cosying up to BJP,’’ said a BSP MP speaking on condition of anonymity, “Why should we sit quiet when the party which has repeatedly stabbed us in the back is now getting a taste of its own medicine?’’The BJP said that governor or the court should intervene. “A constitutional & legal situation has risen. Either the High Court should decide or the Governor should intervene in the matter,’’ said Satish Poonia, BJP incharge of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-crisis-what-does-bsp-s-party-whip-mean/story-wlZb2B5N1qxEbkGgPXEWlO.html

27-07-2020||India||Rajasthan crisis in Supreme Court again, hearing on speaker’s plea against HC order||The Supreme Court will on Monday hear Rajasthan assembly Speaker CP Joshi’s petition challenging a July 21 order of the high court directing him to defer disqualification proceedings against 18 Congress legislators led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.A three-judge bench will hear Joshi’s special leave petition (SLP) at 11am related to whether courts can interfere with disqualification proceedings initiated by an assembly speaker against lawmakers even before a decision has been taken.Pilot and 18 Congress MLAs moved the Rajasthan HC on July 16, challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by Joshi. The high court had on July 24 ordered status quo on the matter, admitted the writ petition by the Pilot camp and deferred its final verdict on the matter.Before that, on July 22, the speaker had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court.Monday hearing will be Joshi’s second attempt to get the high court’s stay order cancelled.Joshi had moved the top court complaining the high court had no jurisdiction to ask him to defer the disqualification proceedings. In his petition, Joshi called the court order “illegal, perverse and in derogation of the powers” of the speaker.The top court had last week refused to accept Joshi’s initial request to cancel the high court’s stay order, pointing that the two high court judges had already reserved their order to be pronounced on Friday.The high court, however, did not deliver its ruling on the case. It formally admitted Pilot’s petition against the disqualification notices on Friday, accepting the request to make the central government a party in the case and identified the legal points that it will take up during the hearings.“The Speaker’s lawyers will be making arguments before the Supreme Court on Monday though the possibility of withdrawing the petition has not been ruled out,” a Congress functionary had said earlier.Prateek Kasliwal, the speaker’s lawyer in Jaipur, said the decision regarding withdrawing the SLP will be taken by the legal team in Delhi.Pilot has also moved a caveat in the Supreme Court to ensure that no orders are passed on Joshi’s petition without hearing him and his supporting MLAs.Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who has represented the speaker in the high court, said his party wanted a floor test in the Rajasthan assembly and was “begging” for it, but the governor was not convening the House and “delaying” the trust vote allegedly at the behest of the Centre.The fresh proposal sent to the governor did not have any mention of floor test though.“Since no party has demanded a floor test, there is no need to mention that the House has to be convened for holding it. As already stated by the chief minister, the House will discuss Covid-19 situation and also conduct some important legislative business,” he said.On Monday, Governor Kalraj Mishra returned the file related to the convening of the assembly session to the state’s parliamentary affairs department and sought additional details from the government.Mishra has not taken any decision yet on calling the assembly session, people aware of the development added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-crisis-in-supreme-court-again-hearing-on-speaker-s-plea-against-hc-order/story-1VlRGcOpTfAX36TwwgPDCO.html

It is not mentioned in the proposal but you have been speaking about it in media,” the governor was quoted as saying by ANI.He also said it would be difficult to call all the members of legislative assembly (MLAs) at a short notice during the coronavirus pandemic.“Can you consider giving a 21-day notice over the convening of assembly session?” was his second poser, reported ANI. Mishra has not taken any decision yet on calling the assembly session, people aware of the development added.The Congress party has been demanding a special session amid the political crisis due to a rebellion by Sachin Pilot and a section of Congress legislators supporting the former deputy chief minister. The Gehlot camp, which is confident of its numbers and feels a floor test may be its best bet to end the political crisis, has said the governor is delaying convening a session due to pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government.Before this, Ashok Gehlot had requested Mishra to start a session of the state assembly to discuss bills, including one on the coronavirus pandemic, without mentioning a floor test.Also read: Mayawati springs a surprise, heads to court to reclaim her 6 MLAs from CongGehlot had in a reworked proposal asked him to start a session of the state assembly from July 31.Mishra has denied the Congress’ charge, saying he will follow constitutional norms to convene the House.The governor had turned down the earlier proposal sent by the Congress government and said that it did not mention a date or a reason.Meanwhile, Rajasthan assembly Speaker CP Joshi withdrew his plea before the Supreme Court which had challenged the Rajasthan high court order of July 21 directing him to defer action on disqualification notices against Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs.Also read: Rajasthan speaker drops Supreme Court plea against Sachin Pilot, rebel MLAsSenior counsel Kapil Sibal, who was representing Joshi, told the three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra that the high court, on July 24, passed a detailed order staying action by the speaker against the dissident MLAs and setting out legal issues which it was proposing to consider.Therefore, the plea before the Supreme Court against July 21 order has become infructuous, he submitted.“So kindly permit us to withdraw this plea”, Sibal said.The bench which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari allowed the prayer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-governor-returns-files-related-to-convening-of-assembly-session-seeks-additional-details-from-gehlot-govt/story-rSqthrBlf9A53J7MYcC9dL.html

According to a bulletin issued by Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), the five fresh deaths raised the flood-related toll in the state to 102. Besides deaths due to drowning, 26 more people have died across the state since May due to landslides caused by heavy rain, as per ASDMA. As on Sunday, nearly 2.5 million people in 2,265 villages in 23 of the state’s 33 districts were still affected by floods. Goalpara (4.70 lakh) was the worst affected district followed by Barpeta (3.95 lakh) and Morigaon (3.33 lakh). Nearly 46,000 people uprooted due to floods were taking in 457 relief camps in 16 affected districts.Union minister for development of north eastern region Jitendra Singh spoke to Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and assured him help from the Centre and the North Eastern Council to restore and repair the infrastructure damaged in floods.Meanwhile, the situation continued to deteriorate in Bihar, with the water level of the Ganga river breaching the danger mark at Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur and overflow from the Gandak flooding more areas on Sunday. According to the water resources department (WRD), the rise in water level of the Ganga in Patna and Munger has affected Diara and low-lying areas on its course. Rivers such as Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamla, Adhwara and Mahananda are also flowing above the danger level, putting pressure on embankments at different places. Champaran and Mithilanchal region are among the worst-hit areas, with National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force on standby for rescue operations.According to news agency PTI, a 25-year-old woman gave birth to a baby girl on board an NDRF rescue boat plying on the swollen Burhi Gandak river in flood-affected Bihar on Sunday, officials said.The woman was being rescued from her marooned house in Gobari village of East Champaran district when she developed severe labour pain and later delivered the baby around 1:40 pm, they said.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team was accompanied by an ASHA (accredited social health activist) worker who helped in the childbirth, an NDRF spokesperson said in Delhi.So far, about 1.50 million people residing in 625 panchayats of 86 blocks across 11 districts have been affected due to the recent spell of floods in north Bihar. WRD officials said that the situation might worsen as the meteorological department had predicted heavy rains in the Himalayan region in Nepal and planes of north Bihar in the next 72 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-flood-toll-crosses-100-ganga-breaches-the-danger-mark-in-bihar/story-K6DOoAGOl3BtCEXjn0LfII.html

In part, this is true, even today. Hundreds of poor illegally extract saleable materials and components, damaging their health and polluting the environment. There is no investment in making their lives safer, or better, although under new laws, this might be shifting slowly. On the other hand, too often, we forget about how our electronics are made. With Apple shifting to Chennai, India and Apple both have a great opportunity to re-make the future. Previously, Apple was called out for phones that were produced in pathetic conditions, with underpaid workers. In Chennai, all this should be a thing of the past. It must ensure it is the best possible job for a worker in this niche.Apple is setting up in the land of recycling and the Swachh Bharat Mission. It can offer both it’s brand and India so much more. For one, can the plant expand to dismantle and recycle most or all parts of the Apple products discarded? The new law anyway requires it to collect a percentage of e-waste generated, and recycle it. It will be the first to do this, perhaps use some recovered materials in manufacturing. It could let the public see the process first hand. We have to shift to circularity in the coming few years, and this factory is not only valuable in itself, but also for the potential it has to transform the global idea of circular economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apple-s-move-to-tamil-nadu-brings-hope-for-better-recycling-of-electronic-waste/story-BeD9JXmS9v2nEZxsyBoxRN.html

One official working in the finance ministry said that the government has so far identified 1,474 exporters and their refund claims were suspended. HT had reported on July 18 that the government had blocked refund claims worth Rs 1,875 crore involving 1,377 such exporters. “However, customs officials have been sensitized to expedite refunds to genuine exporters in these difficult Covid-19 days,” the official added. He said, so far integrated GST (IGST) refunds of more than ~1.37 lakh crore have been disbursed and only about ~ 2,026 crore is pending, which is being processed as per the law. The government is using data analytics to identify “risky” exporter entities that take input tax credit fraudulently and monetise it by paying IGST and claiming a refund on that. Imports of goods and services are treated as inter-state supplies and attract IGST. Another officials working at the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) said, “Feeling the heat, some fake and risky exporters are lobbying with some prominent trade associations to allege that genuine exporters are being harassed by being asked for over 1,500 documents each for conducting verification, but this is completely untrue” The officials said data analytics by CBIC’s Directorate General of Risk Management (DGARM), which is followed by field-level verification by the officers have found 1,474 ‘risky’ exporters including seven star exporters who tried to claim IGST refund of over ~ 2,020 crore were untraceable at their declared place of business and therefore their refund has been rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/risky-exporters-to-face-action-officials/story-Z0XLdYYUSBP7X6n1iv11qJ.html
27-07-2020||India||Participative governance must reach panchayat level, says Prasad||The central government’s e-governance feedback initiative, MyGov, is now likely to be extended right up to the panchayat level to help improve local participative governance. MyGov platform provides an opportunity to citizens and all stakeholders from across the world to share their views on key governance issues across all stages by directly engaging with the government departments, policy makers and implementers. Speaking at the eve of the completion of six years of MyGov, which was launched on July 26, 2014, information technology (IT) minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Sunday commended the efforts of the team involved with MyGov in improving participative governance across the country. “The MyGov movement must go forward,” Prasad said. “12 states have already joined it. It represents a model of participative governance that must reach the gram panchayat level.” He added that the intiative should act as a be catalyst for giving a platform to the most talented minds to share their ideas. MyGov also launched the Saathi Chatbot this April, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, that allows people to provide inputs and solutions to the government, thereby participate in policy-making. The chatbot also answers any queries people have with regard to the Covid-19 pandemic. MyGov also has state intiatives, which provides access to the e-governance initiative in local languages, 12 states. These include Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Officials in the ministry said that they are also ready to launch chapters in nine other states, once the chief ministers inaugurate the same. The next phase will include Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Puducherry, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Daman and Diu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/participative-governance-must-reach-panchayat-level-says-prasad/story-PnxEeazmQyHEYKHtslLn7K.html
27-07-2020||India||Mayawati’s BSP springs a surprise, heads to Rajasthan court to reclaim her 6 MLAs from Congress||Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party on Sunday evening dived headlong into the Ashok Gehlot versus Sachin Pilot playing out in Rajasthan, declaring that the party would also approach the high court to reclaim the party’s six lawmakers who merged the legislative party with the Congress last year.The six legislators had asked Speaker CP Joshi to consider the BSP legislative party to have merged into the Congress in September last year, a request that was promptly accepted by CP Joshi. The defection had riled BSP boss Mayawati who had launched sharp attacks at Gehlot for backstabbing the BSP though it had been supporting his government.This was the second time in a decade that chief minister Ashok Gehlot had lured Mayawati’s lawmakers to his party. In his previous term as chief minister, Gehlot had been able to similarly persuade all the six legislators from Mayawati’s party to join the Congress.Watch: BSP asks 6 MLAs to vote against Congress l What it means for Gehlot govt Last year’s induction of the six BSP lawmakers placed the Congress comfortably over the majority mark of 101. Gehlot also had the support of 12 out of 13 independent legislators and the 5 legislators from smaller parties.Gehlot appeared invincible. But Sachin Pilot, his deputy in the government and Rajasthan Congress chief till earlier this month, had other ideas. Pilot moved out of Jaipur early this month with his group of legislators amid buzz that he was, along with the BJP, trying to pull down the Gehlot government.The Congress moved fast, sacking Pilot from his positions in the party and the government and asking Speaker CP Joshi to start disqualification proceedings against him and 18 lawmakers backing him.The rebellion did deplete Gehlot government’s strength in the assembly; the Congress government had 125 members in the 200-member assembly till late last month. But by most accounts, he appeared to have a tenuous majority.Mayawati had tweeted her first statement on the Rajasthan standoff 9 days ago, pouring out her anger on Ashok Gehlot for stealing her lawmakers, tapping phones of rivals and demanding that the governor impose central rule on Rajasthan. And then, not a word.It was a BJP lawmaker Madan Dilawar who finally approached the high court last week challenging the merger. Dilawar’s petition also underlined that speaker CP Joshi, who had issued notices to Pilot and his team within hours of receipt of a complaint from the Congress, was yet to decide the BSP’s complaint filed last year that asked for disqualification proceedings against the 6 BSP legislators who joined the Congress.The BSP finally moved Sunday evening, announcing that the six MLAs - counted as Congress MLAs by the assembly - had been directed to vote against the Gehlot government in a no-confidence vote. The directive, issued by BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Misra, told the six legislators that speaker CP Joshi’s order merging the BSP legislative party into the Congress was illegal because there had been no such merger of the party.Mayawati’s party also said that the BSP would move the high court against the speaker’s order but indicated that it hadn’t made up its mind if it should file an application to become a party in the ongoing disqualification case or file a fresh petition.The BSP effort to wade into the political row came at a time when Ashok Gehlot has been particularly struggling to get governor Kalraj Mishra to convene the assembly so that the Congress government can face the trust vote. Gehlot has claimed the support of 102 lawmakers, just one seat over the majority mark of 101. Congress leaders are concerned that if Gehlot does not get to prove his majority soon, Pilot or the BJP could succeed in luring out a couple of lawmakers and reduce the government to a minority.This tenuous majority also leaves scope for the BSP to play a crucial role to give Gehlot sleepless nights, and if the high court eventually rules in its favour, even play the kingmaker in Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mayawati-springs-a-surprise-heads-to-court-to-get-6-mlas-back-from-congress/story-dH8nTGXf3szIlPRgsukzXO.html

27-07-2020||India||Virus threat not over, need to stay extra vigilant: Modi||India has been united in fighting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) epidemic and has performed better than many other countries, but people need to remain “extra vigilant” as the threat posed by the outbreak persists, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday. Addressing his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat, Modi said India’s recovery rate – the percentage of Covid-19 patients who have recovered from the viral illness – is higher than that of other countries and its fatalities lower, but the “hazards” of the outbreak “are far from over”. “Today, the recovery rate in our country is better compared to other countries; the mortality rate in the context of corona in our country is much less as well, compared to most countries,” Modi said, adding: “Of course, the loss of even one life is saddening, but India has also succeeded in saving the lives of millions of her people.” The Prime Minister also sounded caution, and said it was important to practise social distancing and wear masks to fight the virus. “At many places, it is spreading fast... We have to bear in mind that Corona is as fatal today as it was in the beginning – that’s why we have to be fully cautious,” he said. Till Sunday, India recorded a recovery rate of 63.9% -- higher than the hardest-hit nation, US (47.6%) – and a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than the global rate of 4%. These figures have been recorded even as infections have risen rapidly in the country, with more than 1.4 million overall cases and a total of 32, 811 deaths till the end of the day. The contagion, which had until recent weeks largely affected urban metropolises like Mumbai and Delhi – has begun spreading across states with most lockdown restrictions lifted.Maharashtra is the hardest-hit state in the number of infections, followed by Tamil Nadu and Delhi. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, Telangana, West Bengal and Odisha are among the states that are now adding hundreds of new cases daily. The PM also said that while the country continues to fight the coronavirus epidemic, there is also the need to scale up employment and help businesses. “On the one hand, we have to fight the battle against Corona with full awareness & vigilance; on the other, whatever our responsibilities, through sheer perseverance… business, jobs or studies… we have to lend pace to it, taking it to greater heights,” he said. India was among the countries to impose a strict lockdown, first enforced on March 25, to curb the spread of the disease. While most of the restrictions have now been eased, economic activities are stuttering to restart months after as the country continues to record thousands of new infections daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virus-threat-not-over-need-to-stay-extra-vigilant-modi/story-VyVUOa8K3YbxFSy4oeHXuN.html
27-07-2020||India||92% deliveries in hospitals, every third child born through a c-section||Findings of the latest survey on the state of India’s health conducted by the National Statistical Office in 2017-18 show a positive change: the proportion of women delivering a child in a hospital (or health care institution) has increased over the past two decades by nearly 73 percentage points in rural India and 37 percentage points in urban India. At least nine of every 10 pregnant women now deliver a child in a hospital and thereby avail better health care facilities. But nearly every third woman who delivers a child in a hospital undergoes a caesarean-section or C-section surgery, which is a rate twice of what the international health care community considers ideal, and almost the same it is in the US. Personal preferences and older mothers are part reason for this, as is, in some cases, profiteering , but another reason, experts say, is that health care workers do not have the time, patience, or inclination to wait. At 28.1%, the share of women delivering through a C-section has risen by nearly 25 percentage points in two decades from as low as 3.2% in 1995-96. The survey findings also show that it is the private sector hospitals that are largely responsible for the high rate of C-sections in India, as a result of which average Indians pays more for childbirth than they would have otherwise. (See Chart 1) !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Four rounds of the nationally-representative National Family Health Survey have also recorded rising C-section rates over time – from 9.5% of all hospital births in 1992-93 to 22.8% in 2015-16. According to the World Health Organisation, which considers the ideal rate for C-sections to be between 10% and 15%, these surgeries are effective in saving maternal and infant lives but only when they are required for medically indicated reasons. “There is no evidence showing the benefits of caesarean delivery for women or infants who do not require the procedure,” the organisation said in a statement on C-section rates published in 2015. “At population level, caesarean section rates higher than 10% are not associated with reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates.” To be sure, the C-section rate is high in many of the developed nations as well, for example nearly 32% of all institutional deliveries in the US are done through a Csection, while this figure is 33% for Australia, 28% for Canada and 35% for China, according to data compiled by the World Health Organisation.This means the C-section rate in India is twice the ideal rate. It is only in the government sector hospitals in rural India where less than 15% women give birth through surgery. The C-section rate in government hospitals in the urban sector is nearly double at 26%. But when it comes to private sector hospitals, a majority of births (54% in rural areas and 56% in urban areas) are conducted through a C-section, which is almost four times more than the ideal rate. To be sure, the C-section rates are even higher in charitable hospitals, but only about 1% births take place in such hospitals. (See Chart 2) !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();About 29% of institutional births in India take place in a private sector hospital, but these hospitals conduct nearly 63% of all C-sections in the country. Government hospitals conduct nearly 70% of all deliveries but only 35% of all C-sections. At 69%, Telangana has the highest overall rate of C-sections in the country, 52.8% in government hospitals, highest among all states, and 87% in private sector hospitals, second highest in the country. In many states where a large share of deliveries happen through a C-section, the rates are high in both government and private hospitals, but the rate in the latter is higher than that in the former in all states and union territories except Meghalaya and Dadra & Nagar Haveli. Among big states, the percentage point difference is the highest in Odisha where nearly 76% deliveries in private sector hospitals happen through a C-section compared to just 14% in government hospitals. (See Chart 3) !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();The higher rate of C-sections also means that Indians are spending more on child birth than they would otherwise. The average expenditure per child birth in case a mother undergoes C-section is nearly five times more than that in case of a normal delivery – around ~23,000 compared to ~4,700. The average expenditure in any case is six to seven times more in private hospitals compared to government ones . A normal delivery in a government hospital costs around ~2,100 on average compared to nearly ~15,000 in a private hospital. Similarly, in case of C-section delivery, the average expenditure in government hospitals is around ~5,500 compared to nearly ~33,000 in private ones.Professor Indranil Mukhopadhyay, who teaches public health at Jindal School of Government and Public Policy, said “pure commercial interest” is behind the high C-section rates in India, particularly in private sector hospitals. “There are alarming figures and I call it an induced epidemic of some sort. Because regulations aren’t enforced well, doctors get commissions for referring patients to diagnostic labs and similarly get paid more when they conduct a C-section.”Mukhopadhyay said that high C-section rates among more wealthier families is an indicator of the financial motive. According to the fourth National Family Health Survey conducted in 2015-16, the share of women in the poorest 20% households of India who delivered through a C-section was 4.4% compared to 35.9% among women in the wealthiest 20% families.Dr Sanghita Bhattacharyya, public health specialist at the Public Health Foundation of India, said commercial interests, rising age of childbearing and changing preferences of women are all partly responsible for the rising C-section rates. “There’s a push from private players for conducting more C-section deliveries especially as public insurance schemes have started to gain ground, but apart from this the rising age of childbearing and the fact that many women now personally prefer a C-section could also be contributing factors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/significant-rise-in-hospital-deliveries/story-kJBaAwYQo6Gc6rWz6RxZsM.html
27-07-2020||India||Rajasthan HC to hear today plea against BSP unit’s merger with Congress||A petition filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Madan Dilawar against the merger of all six Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs in the state with the Congress party last year will be heard by the Rajasthan high court on Monday.The petition was filed on Friday against the Speaker’s decision to allow the merger that increased the Congress’ strength in the house.The bench of Mahendra Kumar Goyal will hear the petition on Monday. The petitioner has questioned the inaction of the speaker on his complaint in March this year for disqualification of these six legislators under the 10th schedule of the Constitution (the anti-defection laws).The Ashok Gehlot camp in the Congress appears to have a tenuous majority in the Rajasthan assembly at the moment: it has 101 legislators (excluding the speaker and another lawmaker who is indisposed, but including allies); a rebel faction led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot has 22 lawmakers; the BJP-led grouping has 75. It’s easy to see what the disqualification of six legislators (of the 101) could do to the government’s majority.According to the petition, speaker CP Joshi declared the six BSP MLAs – Sandeep Yadav, (Tijara), Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kisangarh Bas), LakhanMeena (Karauli) and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati) – as having merged with the Congress on September 18, 2019. Dilawar,the MLA from Ramganj Mandi constituency in Kota district, has challenged the validity, legality and correctness of the Speaker’s order.Earlier, he moved a petition before the Speaker on March 16 under the 10th schedule praying for disqualification of these six MLAs. That remains undecided.Late on Sunday, the BSP issued a whip to the six MLAs to vote against the Gehlot government in any proceedings of the House. A signed communication by BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra said all six MLAs were elected on the election symbol of the BSP issued by its national president Mayawati and were bound by a party whip to vote against the Congress government .It also rejected the contention that they had duly merged their legislative party unit with the Congress. “All six MLAs have been issued separate notices wherein they have been informed that since BSP is a recognised national party as such there cannot be any merger under para (4) of the Xth Schedule at the state level at the instance of the six MLAs unless there is a merger of the entire BSP everywhere at the National Level …,” a statement from the party said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-hc-to-hear-today-plea-against-bsp-unit-s-merger-with-congress/story-NQGehpCgfdAfYPr2BN4qfI.html
27-07-2020||India||In China’s troop movements in Ladakh’s depth areas, a hint about its real plan||With the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) deploying close to 50,000 troops in Aksai Chin, the Indian Army for the first time has deployed a squadron (12) T-90 missile firing tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and a full troop brigade (4,000 men) at Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO) to prevent any Chinese aggression from the Shaksgam-Karakoram pass axis, according to top military commanders familiar with the matter. India’s last outpost at Daulet Beg Oldi DBO lies at a height of 16,000 feet just south of Karakoram pass and on banks of Chip-Chap river, north of the Galwan-Shyok confluence.As some bridges on the Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road cannot handle the weight of a 46 ton T-90 tank, the Indian Army commanders sent the T-90 tanks after the June 15 Galwan flare-up by fording the rivers and rivulets using specialized equipment. The armoured personnel carriers (APCs) or infantry combat vehicles , M 777 155mm howitzers, and 130 mm guns had already been sent to DBO after Chinese aggression at patrolling points 14, 15, 16 , 17 and the Pangong Tso finger features.Also Read: China tried to jab India with a new claim on Bhutan. Why it has boomerangedWhile India and China have decided to first totally disengage and then de-escalate from the area, the Indian Army is not only matching troop strength but also keenly watching the PLA deployment of tanks, air defence radars and surface to air missiles in Aksai Chin. The disengagement is work-in-progress with each side verifying the movements of the other, the commanders, who asked not to be identified said. While the Indian military has also decided to black-top the advance landing ground at DBO, the main reason for deploying tanks in the area is to prevent any sudden Chinese move from the north, they added. Also Read: ‘Gratuitous’: Indian official’s acerbic retort on China’s advice on foreign policyAlready China has built some 36 kilometres of road in the Shaksgam Valley (5163 square kilometres were illegally ceded by Pakistan to China in 1963), and Indian military planners fear that PLA will link the G-219 (Lhasa-Kashgar) highway to Karakoram pass through the Shaksgam pass. Even though this will require tunnelling under the permafrost of Shaksgam glacier, the Chinese have the technical ability to complete the job. Also Read: Twin naval exercises with US supercarriers signal QUAD has arrivedThe fear is that once the link is completed, the PLA will put pressure on DBO from the north as it needs a buffer to prevent the Indian Army from targeting the road.According to the military commanders, the main purpose of PLA aggression this summer was to clear all the friction points with the Indian Army along the 1147 km long line of actual control (LAC) in East Ladakh and impose the 1960 map claim. However, this attempt was forcefully repelled by the men of 16 Bihar who took on the 3 Mechanized Infantry of Xinjiang Military district on June 15 at Galwan.This plan dovetailed into a larger plan of linking the G219 highway to G314 (Kashgar-Islamabad Karakoram highway) via Karakoram-Shaksgam pass axis in order to save not only time but distance. A fruition of this plan would have made Indian army positions untenable not only at DBO but also at Siachen as the outpost is linked to Sansoma (crucial base on Nubra river before Siachen) via Saser la-Murgo axis. In many ways, Pervez Musharraf‘s plan to interdict Srinagar-Kargil highway and starve Indian positions at Siachen during the 1999 Kargil war between India and Pakistan has a parallel in China’s Xi Jinping’s attempt to interdict the DSDBO road to cut off DBO 21 years later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-moves-squadron-of-missile-firing-t-90-tanks-to-last-post-near-karakoram-pass/story-h4LtB6PZXtiYpMadupySlK.html
27-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India is now conducting in excess of 400,000 tests a day on average (the number tends to drop off over the weekend, but has been rising consistently). That’s still short of the million tests-a-day number that has become this column’s most popular refrain, but is way higher than what the country used to do even a month ago.The recent surge in testing is being helped by the increase in antigen tests. These are also called Rapid Antigen Tests because the results are usually available within the hour — unlike the molecular tests which take longer, a couple of days typically, but with backlogs up to five days sometimes. If it is any consolation, US media is full of horror stories of how some people have been waiting up to 10-12 days for results as a wave of infections sweeps across that country. Both the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test and the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) are examples of molecular tests.Also Read: Jumbo rapid antigen testing drive: 76 of 7,962 frontliners test positive in 2 daysSuch molecular tests are highly accurate in identifying current infections of the coronavirus disease. They are so accurate that they do not need to be confirmed using any other test. They are poor tools to help measure prevalence of the disease in the population, though, because they cannot identify past infections — and often, both public health and local administrative authorities need to know just how much of a population has been infected because this will influence other decisions, such as what to open up and when.There are some molecular tests that take much less time than the RT-PCR and NAAT ones but these are not in wide use.Also Read: Bihar, Andhra, W Bengal, Karnataka face risk of becoming Covid-19 hotspotsAntigen tests are in the news in India. They helped Delhi scale up testing rapidly, and with the number of daily new cases in the Capital declining sharply, health administrators want other states to start using them as well. Unlike RT-PCR and NAAT tests, which search for the virus’ genetic material, antigen tests look for proteins that are usually found on the surface of the virus. Like molecular tests, they are good indicators of current infections (and like them, they cannot measure past infections).There is a problem with such tests though — they are very accurate when it comes to what are called true positives, which means that if they show people to be infected, the subjects most probably are, but they are not so accurate when it comes to so-called true negatives, which means that at least some of the people they show to be uninfected are, in fact, infected. That’s the reason scientists recommend following up negative antigen tests with molecular tests, especially if the subjects being tested are symptomatic (but this does not account for the large proportion of people who remain asymptomatic despite being infected).Also Read: Rapid antigen kits key in scaling up Covid-19 testingIt’s important to understand that this does not mean antigen tests should not be used. There are times when it makes sense to use them — when infections are peaking, for instance, especially in one neighbourhood and the primary need is rapid testing — and how (preferably with a follow-up RT-PCR test for all those testing negative). In effect, they should be used to address the time constraint, not the testing-capacity one. They are also not good measures of whether it is safe for a person to return to work. I mention this specifically because at least some private testers are suggesting that they can be used for this purpose.In theory (and in theory alone), the only tests that can be used to define an individual’s eligibility to return to work are those that test for antibodies. Unlike the molecular and antigen tests that use throat swabs, these use blood. In general, they are faster than antigen tests, although a review of current research literature shows that their accuracy varies widely. They do not identify current infections but are good measures of past ones — and therefore, ideal to measure prevalence (or immunity). The results of such studies are open to interpretation, though. Our understanding of the coronavirus disease, and the strength and duration of the immunity provided by antibodies, is still evolving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-3dYzQ8QkVNOZ3Nc0jRqUkL.html

27-07-2020||India||IAS aspirant’s gang of 6 used explosives to open ATMs in Madhya Pradesh, caught: Cop||Six people, including a civil services aspirant, were arrested for robbing ATMs using explosives in Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh, police said on Sunday.Hemant Chauhan, superintendent of police, Damoh, said that the mastermind of the gang was 28-year-old civil services aspirant Devendra Patel and the gang, arrested by Damoh Police on Saturday, was looting ATMs by blowing them up using gelatin sticks since June last year. “The accused had formed a gang and started looting ATMs by blowing it up with the help of a detonator since June last year. Recently, they blew up an ATM in Simaria area in neighbouring Panna district on July 19 and looted cash worth Rs 23 lakh.” He added that Devendra had learnt the technique of looting ATMs on the internet.“Most of them are educated and have good knowledge of technology. Devendra Patel, who is a civil services aspirant, had learnt the technique of looting ATMs on the internet. They used to come on two bikes by covering their faces. Two people used to overpower an ATM gaurd and spray black paint on cameras, two used to connect the detonator with the bike battery and two used to collect the cash. They used to take only 14 minutes in committing the whole crime,” Chauhan said. However, the gang was busted following a robbery in Panna, thanks to a CCTV camera installed in a shop next to the ATM.“After committing crime in Panna, they followed the same modus operandi but didn’t pay attention to a CCTV camera installed in a shop just next to the ATM. Police got some important clues from the CCTV footage and arrested them from their native village,” Chauhan said.The other five members of the gang were identified as Jgeshwar Patel, Nitesh Patel, Jairam Patel, Rakesh Patel, and Param Lodhi, all residents of Khajri village of Damoh district.Police recovered Rs 25.57 lakh cash, two country made pistols, eight live cartridges, detonator, fake currency notes of Rs 3 lakh and a coloured printer from them. Police are also interrogating the gang to know whether they are involved in other crimes too as fake notes of Rs 500 denomination were also recovered from a house of Devendra Patel, said the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/civil-services-aspirant-among-6-arrested-for-looting-atms-in-mp/story-pUnXSu5YnRgELtxf0AOXEL.html
27-07-2020||India||India twists the knife, will only cancel tenders that Chinese firm are set to win||A bidding process already underway for an Indian government contract will not be scrapped merely because of a Chinese firm’s participation, two government officials said on Sunday, adding that this is being done to avoid unnecessary delays in the execution of key projects.On Thursday, the Centre said that companies from nations that share a border with India will be barred from bidding for government contracts for goods and services until they register with the industry department. It said the decision was taken to “strengthen the defence of India and national security”; the move is being seen as an effort to counter China amid a tense border stand-off with the neighbouring nation.The order, which did not name any country, is applicable for all prospective tenders, and also for the tenders that have already been invited but not yet awarded.The two government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an ongoing tender process will be scrapped only if one of the technically qualified bidders is a Chinese firm and it is also the lowest bidder.Tender evaluations often have two parts -- technical qualification and price bid. A company emerges as a shortlisted bidder only after it meets all technical qualifications. After that, price quotes of all shortlisted bidders are evaluated and the lowest price bidder gets the contract, the first official said.An order clarifying the move has already been circulated to all ministries, public sector units and state governments asking them not to scrap earlier tenders and initiate fresh tendering processes only because of the presence of a Chinese entity as one of the qualified bidders, the officials said.“In other words, the tender should not be scrapped if it is unlikely to be awarded to a Chinese company,” the first official added.The clarification was issued by the Union finance ministry on Friday after stakeholders raised concerns that retrospective implementation of the July 23 order would lead to scrapping of all tenders, resulting in a huge loss of valuable time, the second official said.There was some confusion related to a clause of the July 23 order about ongoing tenders, he said. The clause of the Thursday order read, “If the qualified bidders include bidders from such countries [read China], the entire process shall be scrapped and initiated de novo. The de novo process shall adhere to the conditions prescribed in this order.”The clarification issued on July 24 said “qualified bidder means only those bidders who would otherwise have been qualified for award of the tender after considering all factors including price”.“If bidders from such countries would not have qualified for award for reasons unconnected with the said order (for example they do not meet tender criteria or their price bid is higher... or any other reason) then there is no need to scrap the tender/start the process de novo.”India shares land borders with China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan. But the July 23 order exempts some of these countries to which India extends lines of credit or provides development assistance. The Thursday order takes into its ambit all public sector companies, autonomous bodies and public-private partnership (PPP) projects receiving financial support from the government. State governments and their undertakings have also been directed to follow suit.India and China have been locked in a months-long border stand-off, which resulted in a deadly clash last month that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. The two sides have lately failed to make a breakthrough in reducing the tensions despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels, and a disengagement process at some friction points has remained sluggish.CA Vijay Kumar Gupta, former Central Council Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) said: “The clarification has removed uncertainty about ongoing tenders. This will save significant time and prevent time and cost overrun.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-tenders-with-china-firms-participation-will-not-be-hit/story-DpJ4BBrFyOpHFkOaaKPrXN.html
27-07-2020||India||Battles fought inside nation too, pick your role: PM Modi||Battles are fought not just on borders but also within a country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, urging citizens to behave responsibly in order to boost the “morale and honour” of soldiers and asking countrymen to refrain from social media practices that could be “detrimental” to the nation.Everyone must decide his/her role in these battles that play out on many fronts simultaneously, Modi said in his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio address, reminding people that soldiers fight to protect the country under the “harshest conditions” while calling for a strong sense of national unity.In his address, which coincided with the 21st anniversary of the Kargil Vijay Diwas, Modi also accused Pakistan of trying to back-stab India by “nursing delusions of encroaching upon Indian soil” in 1999, when New Delhi was looking forward to mending its ties with Islamabad. Modi also said people bound by a common thread who put the country above everything else bolster the strength of soldiers.“At times, without paying heed to the essence, we encourage certain things on social media that are detrimental to the country. There are times when we keep forwarding things out of sheer curiosity. Despite knowing that it is wrong, we keep doing it. “These days, battles are fought not just on borders; they are fought within the country too, on many fronts simultaneously. And every countryman has to decide his or her role in that. We too should determine our roles, fully bearing in mind soldiers fighting on the borders under the harshest conditions,” Modi said.His comments came at a time when India and China are locked in a border dispute in eastern Ladakh with military and diplomatic officials of the neighbouring countries attempting to hammer out a disengagement plan.A violent clash on June 15 that killed 20 Indian Army soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troopers in Galwan valley and the subsequent tensions in bilateral relations have triggered an intense political debate, including on social media. Hitting out at Pakistan, Modi said India can never forget the circumstances under which the Kargil war took place. “Pakistan had embarked upon this misadventure, nursing delusions of encroaching upon Indian soil, to distract attention from the internal strife prevailing there. India was then in the process of making efforts to foster good relations with Pakistan,” Modi said.The war was declared over on July 26, 1999, after Indian soldiers pushed back Pakistani troops, a bulk of them drawn from the neighbouring country’s Northern Light Infantry, from the captured peaks in Kargil.Quoting a Sanskrit adage, Modi said, “…to the wicked, enmity with one and all for no reason comes naturally. People with such a disposition keep thinking of harming even their well-wishers…that is why when India extended a hand of friendship, Pakistan tried to respond, stabbing in the back. But after that, when our gallant army displayed deeds of valour, when India demonstrated her might the whole world watched it...”What former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said from the ramparts of the Red Fort after the Kargil war is still relevant, Modi added.“Atalji had then reminded the nation of a mantra of Gandhiji. Mahatma Gandhi’s mantra was…in the face of any dilemma, in order to decide what to do or what not to do, one must think of the poorest and the most helpless person of India. “One must assess whether one’s deed will result in benefitting that particular person or not. Going beyond Gandhiji’s thought, Atalji had said that the Kargil war has given us another mantra. And the mantra was: before taking any important decision, we should think whether our step, our endeavour is befitting to the honour of the soldier who laid down his life in those remote mountains,” Modi said.Modi urged the youth to visit a website highlighting the tales of bravery of armed forces and police personnel since Independence.“Today I call upon you to visit, the website, www.gallantryawards.gov.in, positively. There, you will come across an array of information on our brave warriors and tales of their valour. And when you discuss these with your friends, they will become a source of inspiration,” he said.Modi said he, too, got an opportunity to visit Kargil and witness the gallantry of the jawans. “That day is one of the most precious moments of my life,” he said.Criticising Modi’s address, Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said the government’s action and policy made it clear that the Prime Minister had failed to understand “Soldiers Ki Baat”. “Under his leadership, India has the lowest defence budget since 1962. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has frozen the dearness allowance of serving officers of army, navy and air force. The CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General of India) has pulled up the government for providing sub-standard gear to soldiers serving in Siachen...many more such examples show that BJP uses valour of our soldiers only for votes,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/battles-fought-inside-nation-too-pick-your-role-pm-modi/story-5W83KHYSvi9nRfpR1mXVSP.html
27-07-2020||India||India will send 10 locomotives to strengthen ties with B’desh||New Delhi India will hand over 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh on Monday, reflecting a renewed focus on the “neighbourhood first” policy to bolster economic ties and connectivity within the region amid the border standoff with China. The handover of the broad gauge diesel locomotives, part of grant assistance from the Indian side, is in line with a commitment by New Delhi during Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s visit last October, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. The locomotives will be handed over during a virtual event to be joined by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and railways minister Piyush Goyal and their Bangladeshi counterparts AK Abdul Momen and Mohammed Nurul Islam Sujon, as well as envoys of the two countries and senior officials. The handover will come close on the heels of the first cross-border container train reaching Bangladesh on Sunday with 50 containers of FMCG goods and fabrics. Last week, the two sides marked a notable achievement in maritime connectivity with the first shipment of container cargo from Kolkata to Agartala in the landlocked northeastern region via Bangladesh’s Chattogram port. The connectivity initiatives with Bangladesh coincide with other moves by India to shore up relations with key neighbours amid the standoff with China. In reject weeks, New Delhi has kept a wary eye on stepped up activities by Beijing in regional capitals such as Kathmandu, Male and Colombo. The people cited above believe China was behind Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s recent outreach to his Bangladeshi counterpart. On Saturday, India announced a $400-million currency swap facility for Sri Lanka under the Saarc framework, and Colombo’s request for a bilateral swap facility for $1.1 billion is also being considered by New Delhi. The Indian mission in Male, in a statement on Sunday to mark the Maldives’ Independence Day, said India had provided $400 million through an extended currency swap arrangement to tide over a liquidity shortage and will soon “announce another substantial financial assistance package” to help post-Covid-19 economic recovery. The people said India-Bangladesh railway cooperation is a vital element of efforts to promote trade and connectivity. Both sides are working to enhance rail connectivity by developing new projects and restoring old links. Currently, the four operational rail links between the two sides, all of which originate in West Bengal, are Petrapole-Benapole, Gede-Darshana, Singhabad-Rohanpur, and Radhikapur–Birol. The first container train that reached Bangladesh on Sunday left the Container Corporation of India Ltd’s (CONCOR) terminal at Majerhat near Kolkata on Friday and crossed over using the Benapole-Petrapole link. This container train will now be a regular service connecting CONCOR terminals in India to stations in Bangladesh such as Benapole, Jessore, Singia, Noapara and Bangabandhu Setu West, Indian officials said. The two sides signed an MoU for the service in April 2017 and a trial run was conducted in April 2018. There are also two passenger trains – Bandhan Express from Kolkata to Khulna and Maitree Express from Kolkata to Dhaka – though services are temporarily suspended due to the pandemic. Seventeen railway projects with a commitment of $2.44 billion were included in assistance extended by India to Bangladesh. India has offered lines of credit for these projects at a rate of interest of 1% a year, with repayment over 20 years with a moratorium for five years. Nine projects have been completed, including supply of wagons and equipment. The Kulaura-Shahbazpur line, being built at a cost of $78 million, is set to be completed by the end of this year, and the Khulna-Mongla line worth $389 million is set for completion by June 2021. A cross-border link of 12 km between Agartala and Akhaura is set to be completed by March 2021 and will enhance freight and passenger connectivity between the rest of India and the northeastern states. Experts believe the attention given to ties with Bangladesh is part of efforts to overcome the impact of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on bilateral relations. Bangladesh’s leadership was irked by reports that illegal migrants in states such as Assam would be deported to the neighbouring country. Maya Mirchandani, senior fellow at Observer Research Foundation and professor of media studies at Ashoka University, said: “We’ve neglected the neighbourhood for some time. Bangladesh has been upset since CAA was passed, and the perception it has created about ethnic Bengali Muslims in particular.” She added: “In the current context, with Chinese adventurism on India’s borders, it is imperative for Delhi to be less dismissive of neighbours falling into China’s ‘debt trap’ and be more pro-active about repairing ties that have been starved for attention.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-send-10-locomotives-to-strengthen-ties-with-b-desh/story-rJVXzRU50NniCE2GPiLLLN.html
27-07-2020||India||Displaying country of origin made mandatory for e-tailers||The Consumer Protection Act , 2019, which came into force from July 20, 2020, has brought in a new regulatory framework for e-commerce in the country, requiring online platforms to display the country of origin of items sold, apart from new rules that will enforce product liability for the first time. Rules framed under the Consumer Protection Act , 2019, covering aggregators, such as Amazon, or inventory-led models where retailers own and sell the stocks, are now required by law to specify the country where a product is made or assembled. According to the new rules, any seller, whether online or offline, will be subject to “product liability”. This means that a product manufacturer or seller will have to compensate for “any harm caused to a consumer” because of “defective products” manufactured or sold. Every online entity must also provide pre-purchase information related to return, refund, exchange, warranty and guarantee and delivery of shipments. “These rules are necessary for enabling the consumer to make an informed decision at the pre-purchase stage on an online platform,” said consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan . Paswan said the new law considerably increases “transparency and choices” to empower consumers. The e-commerce rules will apply to all electronic retailers offering goods and services, whether registered in India or abroad, Paswan said.E-commerce platforms have to acknowledge the receipt of any complaint from a consumer within 48 hours and redress the complaint within a month.Under this Act, the Central Consumer Protection Authority will be empowered to probe violations of consumer rights and institute complaint and order recall of unsafe goods and services. The new Act enables a consumer to file complaints electronically in consumer commissions, which can have videoconferencing for hearing.According to the Act, an Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism of Mediation will simplify the adjudication process. A complaint will be referred by a Consumer Commission for mediation when there is a scope for early settlement and if parties agree for it. Mediation will be held in mediation cells under consumer commissions. There will be no appeal against settlement through mediation.Sriram Panchu, a Chennai-based lawyer, who specialises in mediation, said the provision of mediation under the new law is fit for cases where damages are payable in monetary terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/displaying-country-of-origin-made-mandatory-for-e-tailers/story-ZwZPCYxXMWm9VrwDIVzG8K.html

27-07-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling accused funded terror activities: NIA||A multi-agency team probing the Kerala gold smuggling case has said one of the accused, K T Ramees, was the key link in diverting proceeds of smuggling to fund anti-national activities in south India.In its petition seeking the remand extension of Ramees, who is in customs custody, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said he seemed to be the kingpin and was in constant touch with some fringe elements working against the interests of the country.“He used to insist other accused to make use of the situation and bring maximum gold from the middle-east. He wants to weaken financial position of the country. He was also close to many who indulged in unlawful activities and he made frequent trips to abroad,” the NIA said in the custody report.Ramees was arrested by customs officials from his house in Malappuram after the NIA detained two other accused, Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair, from their hideout in Bengaluru on July 10, five days after 30kg gold was seized from a consignment that came in the name of an employee of the United Arab Emirates consulate in Thiruvananthapuram.“He made several trips to the UAE and other countries in five years. When asked about this, he said he runs a hotel in Dubai. But later we found that it was incorrect. We have information that a good portion of the smuggling proceeds was used to fund fringe elements,” said a senior official familiar with the probe.Customs officials said Ramees (28) was first booked in 2014 in connection with the smuggling of 15kg gold through cargo in Kozhikode. But he got away by paying fines. In 2016 the forest department had booked him for hunting a deer. But he was not convicted in that case. Another case was registered against him after he tried to smuggle six rifles through the Kochi airport.“We will also inquire how such a history- sheeter got away and who all helped him,” said the senior official cited above, adding he used to fund various political parties and was engaged in social activities to dodge suspicion. The multi-agency team headed by the NIA and assisted by customs, DRI, enforcement directorate and income tax department officials is also investigating a possible nexus involving hawala transactions and smuggling. Meanwhile, the NIA has summoned M Sivasankar, former principal secretary to the chief minister, for questioning in Kochi. He was earlier questioned by customs for nine hours and the NIA for four hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-accused-funded-terror-activities-nia/story-J0X7sNFmbHWWN8DVl05S6L.html
27-07-2020||India||Govt plans to build cold storage, supply chain for Covid-19 vaccines||As Covid-19 vaccine trials enter a defining stage worldwide, Indian authorities have started preliminary discussions on a wide range of issues, from logistics to ethical questions, to set the stage for a smooth supply and effective use of a vaccine when it is ready. Multiple ministries and authorities across India’s science and technology spectrum are involved in these discussions, said functionaries involved in the process, adding that the country’s Covid management team doesn’t expect a vaccine to be available before early next year. “At least two meetings have taken place on preparing the ground for the first vaccine. There will be more talks in the next few weeks. There are complex issues” said a government official involved in the discussions who asked not to be named.Also read: Rapid antigen kits key in scaling up Covid-19 testingThe authorities are carefully watching the development of at least nine vaccines—including two Chinese candidates— of which the brightest hope is the candidate of Oxford AstraZeneca. The Pune-based, Adar Poonawalla-led Serum Institute has partnered with AstraZeneca for manufacturing the vaccine in India. Human trials on this vaccine (combined phase2/3 trials) are to begin in India next month. “The internal discussions have started so that we are fully prepared and to avoid any last-moment glitches. One of the key issues is distribution in remote areas such as North East India and how we have to set up large-scale cold storage facilities in such areas,” added the official.Data, analysis of Covid cases across the country, and information technology and scientific inputs will go into these discussions that deals with a pandemic situation which has already seen more than 1.39 million cases in India. Discussions have also begun on how to distribute the vaccine -- whether it should only be given through government hospitals and public health care facilities at the district level, or if private hospitals should also be involved. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage While some countries, including the US have struck large deals with companies developing vaccines (the US has, for hundreds of millions of doses), India is yet to finalise any such agreements. The authorities are also clear that the entire production from Serum Institute can’t be consumed domestically. India, the largest of the SAARC countries, also has an obligation to see that its neighbours get a share of the most-coveted vaccine. “This again, brings us to helping neighbouring countries to set up logistics and infrastructure to distribute the vaccine.” Like many other countries, India too has allowed accelerated trials, especially in the animal toxicity tests—the stepping stone for human trials—for a faster development of vaccines that generally takes years to develop. Government functionaries are also debating the issue of who should be the beneficiaries for the first batch of vaccine—frontline health workers or the country’s aged population. Also read: Bihar, Andhra, Bengal, Karnataka face risk of becoming Covid-19 hotspots“This question has triggered a huge debate worldwide. We have to carefully make this sensitive decision,” said another functionary who asked not to be named, adding that no final decision has been arrived at. Talks of creating a central database of all those who are vaccinated across states are also going on. With the vaccine candidate of China’s Sinovac Biotech also reaching the third stage of human trials Indian officials are hoping the country doesn’t have to depend on China with whom relatons are at an all-time low right now. “We just hope such a situation doesn’t arrive when we have no other choice but to depend on the Chinese,” the first official said.

27-07-2020||India||Rapid antigen kits key in scaling up Covid-19 testing||With at least 400,000 tests conducted for the second day in a row till Sunday morning , India is clearly ramping up its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) testing, with the introduction of rapid antigen testing being the key behind the sudden sharp increase in testing -- from around 250,000 tests a day a month ago. Nearly one in four Covid-19 tests for diagnosing the viral disease conducted currently uses a rapid antigen test kit. An antigen is a protein (in this case present on the virus) that induces an immune response in the body in the form of production of antibodies against a disease, and detecting its presence through an antigen-based test determines a present infection. According to the Union health ministry data released on Sunday, 4,42,263 tests were done in the previous 24 hours across roughly 1300 approved laboratories across the country. Of this, nearly one lakh samples were tested using rapid antigen based testing kits to diagnose Covid-19. The rest were the fold standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.  India aims to increase its testing capacity to one million tests per day on average in coming weeks. “Antigen testing has also played its role in ramping up Covid-19 testing as it’s quicker, easier to perform and cheaper than RT-PCR,” said Harsh Vardhan, Union health minister. India has conducted almost 10.6 million tests since January 22. The antigen based kit largely being used currently, especially by governments, is Indian Council of Medical Research approved ‘Standard Q COVID-19 Ag detection kit’ developed by SD Biosensor, a South Korea based company that has its manufacturing unit in Manesar, Gurugram. Delhi was the first state to start antigen based Covid-19 testing last month, and other states that have deployed antigen testing in a significant way include Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and some north Eastern states. Experts say it is a good tool to perform mass testing. “Since positives results are confirmed positives, it will work in picking up cases, even if it is not able to pick up all cases. In areas where the viral load is very high it should work well, and that’s what we want -- that cases are tracked early. RT-PCR is a better test but can’t be deployed on mass scale as it’s not only cumbersome and expensive but also takes much longer. It’s ok to conduct confirmatory negative tests through RT-PCR,” said Dr Amita Jain, head, microbiology department, King George’s Medical University, Lucknow. According to health ministry, lower rate of Covid-19 deaths can also be attributed to aggressive testing along with improved hospital infrastructure by combining public and private sector efforts that enabled early identification of Covid-19 patients. India’s case fatality rate as on Sunday was 2.31%. Patients are also recovering in large numbers on a daily basis, and Saturday’s government data showed highest recoveries in a single day of 36,145 Covid-19 patients. The total number of recoveries has reached 8,85,576, with the current recovery rate of 63.92%. “Most positive cases do not require hospitalization, and those needing intensive care is actually a minuscule number. Most people who are in hospital have got moderate disease with good chances of recovery. The need is to take care of our old and vulnerable population, especially those with co-morbidities, who are at high risk of developing severe illness,” says Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant, department of internal medicine, Max Healthcare....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-antigen-kits-key-in-scaling-up-covid-testing/story-zxd2j2R6hRlxErfZrshHWO.html
27-07-2020||India||PM to launch three labs today to help ramp up testing||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch high throughput Covid-19 testing facilities in Noida, Mumbai and Kolkata on Monday to ramp up testing capacity and help strengthen early detection and treatment, the Prime Minister’s Office said.High throughput faculties allow experiments or screening that large scale or on higher volume.These centres will be able to test over 10,000 samples in a day, and reduce turnaround time and exposure of lab personnel to infectious clinical materials.“The three high throughput testing facilities have been set up strategically at ICMR institutions -- National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research in Noida, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health in Mumbai and National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases in Kolkata,” the PMO said in the statement.The virtual launch of these centres will be attended by union health minister Harsh Vardhan and Maharashtra CM, Uddhav Thackeray, West Bengal CM , Mamata Banerjee and Uttar Pradesh CM,Yogi Adityanath.“The labs are enabled to test diseases other than COVID-19 as well, and post the pandemic, will be able to test for Hepatitis B and C, HIV, mycobacterium tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, chlamydia, neisseria and dengue,” the statement said.On Sunday, the PM in his radio broadcast Mann KI Baat cautioned against letting the guard down and said people should refrain from taking off the masks during interaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-launch-three-labs-today-to-help-ramp-up-testing/story-tep2UL7Pb0g3JVpWjF2geI.html
27-07-2020||India||Javadekar says concerns over EIA are unfounded||Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday said concerns raised by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on the draft environment impact assessment notification 2020 were “unfounded” and based on “misrepresentation”.Ramesh, a former environment minister, is the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on science and technology, environment, forests and climate change. In a letter to Ramesh, Javadekar said, “Your observations are noted. There are 15 more days for suggestions. I will reply to you in detail. Government will finalise after considering various suggestions. Government decisions are always open for scrutiny...”Ramesh, in a letter dated July 25, said he wished to record his strongest objections to draft EIA 2020 notification on grounds that “it allows for post facto approvals which go against the very principle of assessment; It reduces public participation in all steps of environment clearance process; it does away with environment impact assessment altogether in many cases of expansion; increases validity of environmental clearances allowing projects to secure land for longer durations and it gives union government full powers to appoint state environment impact assessment authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/javadekar-says-concerns-over-eia-are-unfounded/story-9bruth6B0h3uh5mFdz8OzM.html
27-07-2020||India||Detainees may soon be released: Bukhari||Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor (LG) Girish Chandra Murmu has assured of releasing all political detainees, including Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti, detained in the aftermath of the nullification of Article 370 in the coming days, Apni Party leader Altaf Bukhari said on Sunday.When HT reached out for a response, Jagdish Singh, director, public relations, Raj Bhavan, said the LG was in Jammu and only he will be in a position to comment on the issue.A delegation of the fledgling Apni Party led by Bukhari, a former PDP leader, met Murmu on Tuesday.“I...discussed many things with him including the restoration of statehood and the polls. The lieutenant governor assured that in the coming days, all political leaders who are still detained, including former J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, will be released by the government,’’ Bukhari told HT over phone from Delhi. He said he expected that the leaders will be released on or before Eid.The government nullified Article 370, which accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir, on August 5, 2019, and also bifurcated the erstwhile state into two Union territories – Jammu and Kashmir with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one. The government has said it will work towards restoring J&K’s “special status” at an early opportunity.As protests erupted in the wake of the August 5 announcement, several political leaders and activists including former chief ministers were detained as a preventive measure. While prominent politicians such as ex-CMs Farooq and Omar Abdullah have been released, over 25 leaders, including Mufti, are still in detention.Last week, National Conference (NC) president and Srinagar parliamentarian Farooq Abdullah and his son, Omar Abdullah, filed a petition in the Jammu and Kashmir high court, challenging the detention of 16 senior NC leaders.‘’We are even hopeful that leaders will be released before Eid,” Bukhari, who formed the Apni Party in March, said.Bukhari said he wanted to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to know status of a memorandum, which he, along with other party leaders, had submitted to them in March. “I am in Delhi today and will seek an appointment with the PM and the home minister.’’Bukhari earlier met them on March 13, and demanded the restoration of statehood, protection of domicile rights and job reservation, besides the release of political leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/detainees-may-soon-be-released-bukhari/story-RG4UoAbtHD3pXB14i0UvGK.html
27-07-2020||India||Deficient rainfall in parts of country||Several north-eastern states are dealing with floods but many areas in the core monsoon zone that includes parts of central and eastern India and some regions in the north-west have recorded a high rate of rain deficiency in July, a period when the rains are normally dominant.Rajasthan has a deficiency of 33%; Madhya Pradesh 40%; Chhattisgarh 23%; Jharkhand 20% and Odisha 27% for the month July. Uttar Pradesh has a shortage of 14% but is not in the India Meteorological Department’s deficient category. This is mainly because of scanty rainfall in western Uttar Pradesh. For the entire monsoon period since June 1, these states are bordering the deficient category because they have recorded under 19% deficiency, considered to be in the “normal” range or they have a minor rain surplus.Delhi, after covering a deficiency of over 50% in four days, is back to “deficient” category with a shortage of 20% as on Sunday. For July, Delhi has a shortage of 8%. Himachal Pradesh has a deficiency of 33% and Kerala 27% for the June-July period.The rain deficiency in these states will increase as the monsoon over northwest and central India will remain subdued at least for the next 2-3 days, according to IMD scientists.“Rains may pick up over Punjab, Haryana, Delhi from July 28 for around two days. Monsoon trough was weak over the core monsoon zone. No low-pressure system or cyclonic circulation has developed over Bay of Bengal which can strengthen monsoon rains over the region. Monsoonal winds from Bay of Bengal are also very weak in July,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.“Under such a scenario, monsoon rainfall is likely to remain subdued over plains of Northwest and Central India during next 2-3 days. However, rainfall is likely to increase over northeastern parts of India with heavy to very heavy rainfall during July 28 to 30,” the IMD said in its Sunday bulletin.Overall, the country has recorded 5% excess rain between June 1 and June 25; 15% excess in east and northeast India; a 17% deficit over north-west India; 3% excess over central India and 16% excess over the south peninsula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deficient-rainfall-in-parts-of-country/story-FiJST6fcL5zccvzQuGMYWM.html
27-07-2020||India||BSP issues whip to 6 Rajasthan MLAs who merged with Congress, instructs to vote against Gehlot govt||In an interesting twist to the battle for power in Rajasthan, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has issued a whip to six Rajasthan assembly MLAs-- who had announced a merger with the ruling Congress party last year-- to vote against the Ashok Gehlot government in any proceedings of the house including the no confidence motion, according to news agency ANI.A signed communication by BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra on July 26 says that all the six Rajasthan MLAs that were elected on the election symbol of BSP issued by its national president Mayawati are bound by a party whip to vote against the Congress government in the state. It also rejects the contention that they had duly merged their legislative party unit with the Congress. Also Watch | BSP asks 6 MLAs to vote against Congress l What it means for Gehlot govt“All six MLAs have been issued separate notices wherein they have been informed that since BSP is a recognised national party as such there can not be any merger under para (4) of the Xth Schedule at the state level at the instance of the six MLAs unless there is a merger of the entire BSP everywhere at the National Level which admittedly has not been done in the present case and therefore they cannot claim any merger under any illegal and unconstitutional order of speaker which is against the Xth Schedule as well as against several judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court…,” the statement says.Rajendra Gudha, Lakhan Meena, Deepchand Kheria, Sandeep Yadav, JS Awana, and Wajib Ali had last year declared to have merged with the Congress after winning state polls as BSP candidates.The official communication from the BSP says that the above MLAs have been notified that they are bound to follow the whip of the BSP failing which they would invite disqualification from the assembly.The statement adds that the BSP also plans to join the proceedings in the High Court challenging the legality of the merger. Rajasthan BJP MLA Madan Dilawar had moved Rajasthan High Court on Friday to challenge the merger of six BSP MLAs with the Congress party in September last year.He had claimed that the assembly speaker had not acted on his complaint seeking disqualification of these six legislators under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution in March this year.According to his petition, speaker CP Joshi declared BSP MLAs – Sandeep Yadav, (Tijara), Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kisangarh Bas), Lakhan Meena (Karauli) and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati) – as having merged with the Congress on September 18, 2019.The bench of Justice Mahendra Kumar Goyal will hear the petition on Monday.The numbers are evenly poised in Rajasthan with Congress having support of 101 MLAs excluding the assembly speaker in the 200-member assembly. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has requested the governor to call a session of the assembly on July 31st, where he intends to prove his majority in the house. His government is also relying on the votes of the six MLAs BSP claims as its own||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsp-issues-whip-to-6-rajasthan-mlas-who-merged-with-congress-instructs-to-vote-against-gehlot-govt/story-lPJ3edfTlIwp6JnxolHi7L.html
27-07-2020||Editorials||What is driving China’s aggression?||There has been growing debate in recent times in India and other countries about China’s aggression. What’s driving Beijing to engage in contests on multiple fronts, be it Hong Kong, the near seas, or India, particularly amid a pandemic and economic weakness? Is it opportunism? Is it hubris? Is internal turmoil and insecurity leading to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) lashing out? Or are there structural factors that one must consider?Last week, the Chinese foreign ministry formally established a new research centre, the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. State media reported that the centre would be useful in distilling the paramount leader’s thoughts to “serve the construction of theory, system and mechanism, and capacity of the major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in a new era”. This development demonstrates three structural features of China’s approach to the world under President Xi Jinping. Each of these impinge on what, by all measures, appear to be strategically damaging choices that the Chinese leadership has made over the past seven months.First, the trend of top-level design dominating foreign policy has been firmly cemented. Much has already been written about Xi’s ascent as the core leader, his consolidation of power within the CCP, and control over the armed forces. His thoughts on diplomacy were adopted at the 2018 foreign affairs work conference. It called for prioritising “the centralised, unified leadership of the Party” when it came to foreign affairs. Unlike his predecessors, foreign policy decisions under Xi carry the distinct imprimatur of the core leader, at least that’s what the propaganda apparatus has told the world. For instance, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is seen as Xi’s legacy initiative. In 2017, the Central Party School’s publication Study Times reported that Xi “personally made decisions on building islands and consolidating the reefs” in the South China Sea (SCS). Not since Mao Zedong’s era has personality, instead of institutions, mattered so much in China’s approach to the world. This, in itself, limits policy discourse and innovation, heightening the risk of cloistered thinking. Of course, given that the leader enjoys overwhelming, if not absolute, control, there can also be 180-degree turns. After all, it was Mao who pivoted towards to the United States (US) in 1972. But such an outcome seems unlikely in the present scenario.Second, Xi’s ascent has also been accompanied by a return of ideology as a key driving force in Chinese politics. Over the years, Chinese leaders haven’t necessarily ignored ideology. It’s always been present in public rhetoric. But in practice, it was relegated to secondary place to economic performance and political pragmatism. In contrast, under Xi, the need for loyalty has come to dominate political discourse. A demonstration of this was evident earlier this month as the CCP and State institutions reported their efforts to uphold the “two safeguards,” which essentially refer to upholding Xi’s authority as core leader of the party. Days later, Qiushi, the party’s journal, published an article of excerpts from Xi’s speeches over the years, underscoring the centrality of the CPP. In it, Xi exhorts cadres to “maintain a high degree of ideological consciousness, political consciousness, and action consciousness”. This intensification of ideological consciousness bleeds into perceptions of and narratives about competition between systems and models. Long before we stood at the cusp of what now appears to be a Cold War-like contest between China and the US, Beijing was talking about the challenges of a Cold War mentality. The now infamous Document No 9, which was reportedly put out one month after Xi took over as president in 2013, had warned against the threat of infiltration by foreign ideas and universal values, calling for greater commitment to work in the ideological sphere. This, under Xi, has further been blended with a nationalistic narrative of historic humiliation at the hands of external powers and the meteoric rise under the Party’s command. Irrespective of China’s economic achievements, as ideological convictions deepen, they breed a sense of siege, constraining the scope for pragmatic compromise.Finally, Beijing views itself as a major power. It must, therefore, also act in accordance with that self-perception. This has meant the need for greater engagement with the world at large, as evident by repeated affirmations of sticking to the path of reform and opening up. Xi has publicly expressed the desire to actively engage in new forms of multilateralism and participate in global governance reform. This has meant setting up new institutions and structures while also expanding China’s stake in the existing system. Beijing clearly sees value in sustaining the global institutional architecture. Yet it understands that in geopolitics, power is the currency that matters. In multilateralism, this has resulted in Beijing’s efforts to assume leadership of United Nations agencies or establishing forums like the 17+1 model with Central and Eastern European countries and The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation with African states, or even China’s normative contestation to legitimise a particularistic conception of human rights. In bilateral relations, there’s greater transactionalism and coercion. After all, what worth is power that cannot be exercised? And is one truly powerful if one cannot shape favourable political outcomes? The answer to the first of these two questions is obvious. How Beijing responds to the logic of strategy following its recent assertion will help answer the second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/what-is-driving-china-s-aggression/story-1yNoifiXedP6QTHYkqjmwO.html
27-07-2020||Editorials||Online education is not a silver bullet||Since March, Covid-19 has disrupted normal life, including the closure of educational institutions. It has upended academic sessions, led to the scrapping of examinations, delayed admissions, and upset plans of those gearing up to join the workforce or go abroad for further studies. Covid-19 has impacted over 240 million schoolchildren and 9.5 million teachers. According to a report in this paper on Sunday, schools are unlikely to reopen during Unlock 3.0.The indefinite closure of schools created a learning vacuum for students. In a bid to ensure continuity in learning, many states began online classes. In May, the Centre launched “e-Vidya”, a campaign to unify digital/online/on-air education efforts. Private players also joined the effort. While online education is providing a critical service in these times, it is not a silver bullet. A blend of offline-online learning should be the path for the future. This is because the transition from brick-and-mortar schools to technology-based learning has its challenges: Unequal access to devices and Internet connection; inadequate space at home to do online schooling; teachers lacking the training in delivering online classes; customised online content in short supply, and the impact of continuous online exposure on health. These realities must be acknowledged. In a country as diverse as India, the delivery of tech-driven education cannot follow a one-size-fits-all approach, as the government mentions in its guidelines on online education. It is also important to remember that education is not only about tech; it is also about learning, interaction, and developing soft skills and social capital, which only brick-and-mortar schools can provide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/online-education-is-not-a-silver-bullet/story-X5TNlitpqHmCKospvtvX1H.html
