01-07-2020||News||Resisting Chinese encroachment | Opinion||On June 29, the minister for electronics and information technology and law and justice, Ravi Shankar Prasad, tweeted that “For safety, security, defence, sovereignty & integrity of India and to protect data & privacy of people of India the government has banned 59 mobile apps.” After the usual partisan bluster surrounding this move subsides, India must operationalise and strengthen this momentous decision. India, its people, and its territory that are now increasingly digital, must be protected from China’s encroachment and influence.This long-term response has to be shaped by three ideas. First, India must not contribute to the success, proliferation and performance of digital weapons that will be ranged against it. China’s tech must be recognised as one. Second, it must wean itself away from an iniquitous trade relationship that makes it dependent on a country that seeks to harm it. And, third, India needs to step out of the shadow that stunts its own economic growth, diminishes its political clout and limits its digital ambitions. The presence of China’s hardware and platforms in India’s digital ecosystem constitutes a long-term security threat. Arriving at this conclusion requires no strenuous leap of logic. A level-headed assessment of China’s stated intentions and observable actions is enough. China has manipulated democratic means to transmit its propaganda and advertised its way to ensure suitable reportage and headlines. It has leveraged WeChat to interfere in Canadian politics, and to intercept content beyond its jurisdiction, and adopted western social media platforms to target dissidents abroad, exacerbate racial tensions in the United States (US), interfere in Taiwan’s political processes and spread disinformation about the coronavirus. China has entrenched the influence of its tech platforms in key global institutions such as the United Nations in an attempt to redraw the rules of information flows and the ethical applications of emerging technologies like facial recognition systems. These are fundamental to China’s great power ambitions — they assist Beijing to expand its “discourse power”, develop indigenous technologies, create lock-ins through standards and infrastructure, weaponise its economic and technological interdependence, and emerge as a technology superpower. Relations with India are inconsequential to Beijing’s imagination of the world. India has to look out for itself. This new mindset to review engagement with China tech is a vital first step to protect itself. China will continue to gather information on Indians. More worrisome is the insidious ability of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to interfere in or influence India’s political and social spheres. During the Doklam stand-off, the security establishment discovered that the Chinese-owned UC Browser was filtering certain news on Android handsets in India to shape perceptions and outcomes — classic information warfare in the digital age. Recently, we have seen content critical of China being taken down on one of the banned apps and moderation of other incidents and images as well.This is not unique to Chinese platforms. But far-reaching national security legislations, and subservience to a one man-led party that is inimical to India, make their continuance untenable. Indian democracy, howsoever flawed, must steer clear of the digital “tea rooms” owned by the CPC.Will this Indian decision cause economic harm to Chinese platforms? In terms of revenues, clearly it will not. In terms of value, tremendously so. Platforms rely on network effects to scale — every additional user drives up valuations and the aggregate data that they produce feeds into other commercial and research and development activities and product development. Indian eyeballs and data should not fuel Chinese malfeasance directed against them. Similarly, India must bar China’s telecommunications infrastructure from its 5G networks. It is time to say “No way Huawei”. Countries such as Singapore, the US, Australia and others have already signalled different degrees of intent to manage the Dragon. New Delhi’s decision should strengthen this trend and encourage others. Political trust is increasingly going to shape the direction of technology flows. India must work with its allies and partners through new initiatives such as the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to compete with and contain China.India’s actions will invite consequences. China will respond using other aspects of the economic relationship. India’s dependence on electronics, pharmaceuticals and other industrial inputs are well-documented and easy pickings. China’s response could manifest itself along the Line of Actual Control or through cyber intrusions. China’s ability to impose costs must serve to motivate India.Bilateral trade is healthy when there is a balance. With China, it is a doubled-barrelled shotgun trained between India’s eyes. It is important that we fix this now as a three trillion dollar economy. Otherwise, all our future growth will only serve to strengthen the entity which seeks to weaken us. India’s decision has come at a time when economic activity is already under siege from the Wuhan virus and when major economies are also questioning their dependence on China. A reconfiguration of value chains is inevitable. Public opinion favours this and the short-term pain will be acceptable to many. As India restarts its pandemic-stalled economy, let us create value chains that are not of dubious origin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/resisting-chinese-encroachment/story-MyGUDes3yQpbYt3CVnT9EJ.html
01-07-2020||News||The double-speak of parties on foreign funding | Opinion||As India’s border stand-off with China continues, the latter’s aggressive manoeuvres raise difficult questions about India’s diplomatic options, foreign partnerships, and future defence requirements. But the latest crisis has also set off an unseemly round of finger-pointing between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its principal national rival, the Congress, with both sides accusing the other of cosying up to the communist regime.In response to Opposition barbs that the Narendra Modi government’s China policy has been tantamount to “appeasement”, the BJP unearthed evidence that Beijing had previously funnelled money into the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, a Congress-affiliated brain trust. Caught on the back foot, the Congress took the airwaves to argue that several politically-connected Chinese firms — from Huawei to Xiaomi — have donated millions of rupees to the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM-CARES).The ugly mud-slinging between the ruling party and its primary Opposition centres on three claims: that foreign adversaries are meddling in domestic affairs; that wayward foreign “donations” are shrouded in a veil of secrecy; and that independent, third party audits are needed to clear the air.What is left unsaid is that both the BJP and the Congress have worked — often hand-in-glove — to ensure that they themselves are absolved of precisely the kind of scrutiny that they are now demanding. When it comes to transparency, credible auditing, and protections against foreign influence, both parties chant in unison: Do as I say, not as I do.In a landmark 2013 judgment, the Central Information Commission (CIC) ruled that India’s political parties operate as “public entities,” rendering them subject to the provisions of the Right to Information Act. In response, the six national parties thumbed their nose at the CIC, disregarding the apex body’s verdict. The CIC, lacking an enforcement mechanism to bring the parties to heel, referred the matter to the Supreme Court, where it languishes till today. According to an Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) analysis, two-thirds of national parties’ declared income in 2018-2019 emanated from “unknown sources”. Interestingly, the ruling party’s unknown income was 1.5 times greater that of the other five national parties combined.Of course, these figures represent what parties determine acceptable to disclose. Despite the heated rhetoric about the need for the government or Opposition interests to submit to audits by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), political parties face no third-party scrutiny. Yes, one can readily find parties’ income tax returns online. But nowhere in this raft of documents will you find either the signature of a credible, independent auditor or a tight correlation with the reality of party finances.But it is in the realm of foreign contributions where the hypocrisy of political elites is the most apparent. In 2014, the Delhi high court found both the BJP and the Congress guilty of accepting donations from several foreign corporations. In 2016, these two rivals set aside their bitter differences to bail one another out by amending the 2010 Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to retroactively redefine what a “foreign source” was under the law. Rather than face the consequences, the two parties conspired to simply reclassify previously designated foreign companies as “Indian” with the stroke of a pen. The cynicism behind this measure was matched only by the legislative clumsiness on display; because several of the foreign donations pre-dated 2010, Parliament had to pass a second retrospective bill in 2018 —this one amending the original 1976 FCRA law.Having tackled the FCRA issue, the present government ushered in a trifecta of legislative changes — the introduction of anonymous electoral bonds, the elimination of the cap on corporate giving, and the scrapping of a provision that firms detail their political contributions on their annual profit and loss statements.Collectively, these alterations have not simply opened the door to possible foreign funding, they have flung it open and laid down a welcome mat. We now know from Nitin Sethi’s investigative reporting that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Election Commission of India (ECI) both expressed grave concerns about electoral bonds. When first presented with details of the scheme, RBI told the finance ministry that the new funding instrument was vulnerable to money laundering, opacity, and potential abuse. ECI, too, lamented that the new bonds would open the door to foreign influence via dodgy money routed through shell companies. These concerns fell on deaf ears.But, perhaps, the most damning reality is that no politician in India is losing sleep over this sordid state of affairs. Politicians are counting on political tribalism to dominate common sense, sending citizens scurrying to their respective social media corners. They are counting on the populace to imbibe the headlines, glossing over the fine print. And, most importantly, they are counting on voters to ignore concerns about probity when they show up at the ballot box. And, in the end, who can blame them? As evident in voting patterns, when it comes to integrity in Indian politics, politicians have the last laugh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-double-speak-of-parties-on-foreign-funding/story-dvZyIa7cgfrThlgPs8kJwK.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Final-year exams in Maharashtra: Centre still to take call on issue||Despite the state government clarifying its stand to the Centre that Maharashtra is in no position to conduct exams for professional courses due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, respective central examination councils which have to take a call on the issue, are still contemplating a final decision.“We’ve already held a meeting with vice-chancellors and senior officials of various technical institutes and universities across the country, and soon another meeting will be held to discuss the fate of examinations. We will share our views with the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) at the earliest,” said Anil Sahasrabuddhe, chairman, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).A decision taken by AICTE will apply to engineering, pharmacy, architecture, and management institutes across India.Last week, the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led government reached out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to direct governing bodies of all professional courses to cancel final-year exams.On June 19, state higher education minister Uday Samant announced that final-year exams for all non-professional courses will be optional, and students will have to submit a written undertaking to clarify their decision. However, a decision on ATKT (allowed to keep term) backlog of final-year students as well as the fate of professional courses were left pending.“We have clearly stated in the letter that we are not in a position to conduct examinations. Now, the decision has to come from the Centre,” said a senior official from the state higher and technical education department.Students, meanwhile, are worried, with many groups having approached the state government and Governor’s office, seeking clarity on the status of examinations. Many have also taken to social media to address the central government as well as the University Grants Commission (UGC).“Constant changes and lack of clarity are leaving students in a fix, especially those who are pursuing degrees from different cities or plan to pursue higher education or a take up a job in the future. Any more delay will have severe effects on the future of final-year students,” said Siddharth Ingle, president of Maharashtra Students Union (MASU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-exams-in-maharashtra-centre-still-to-take-call-on-issue/story-NDjWdRcCKEU46fsYoTTxrK.html
01-07-2020||Lucknow||UP govt to roll out red carpet for Microsoft to set up world-class hub in Greater Noida||The Uttar Pradesh government is preparing to roll out the red carpet for software giant Microsoft to set up a world-class technology hub in Greater Noida, UP foreign investment and export promotion minister Sidharth Nath Singh said on Wednesday. “The state will roll out the red carpet for Microsoft to make it easier for the company to do business,” said Singh, who has been holding virtual road shows with global industry players in order to convince them to invest in the state by offering incentives. Microsoft has said it wants to set up its North India campus in Greater Noida and the next step will be site inspection by the team both in Greater Noida and along the Yamuna Expressway. This will be followed by the company’s proposal which the state government will examine, he said. A virtual agreement by Microsoft India MD Rajiv Kumar was concluded during a discussion with Singh on Monday and it will soon be followed by a site visit by the global software major. Singh said the authorities have identified options for land for Microsoft in Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway. The government had earlier said it will make it simpler for investors willing to acquire land within 1 km distance on each side of the state’s expressways. Following the coronavirus pandemic, the state government has been trying to increase investment in the state and create additional employment opportunities, the minister said. He said that in the next three-four years, the campus strength would reach its maximum potential of 4,000, making it the second-largest tech hub of Microsoft in India. The company already has two hubs in Hyderabad and Bengaluru with a strength of 5,000 and 2,000, respectively. “With Microsoft coming into the fold, Noida and Greater Noida will become a major destination for electronics and IT in the country,” Singh said in the context of TCS also putting up a campus in the area. Tech giant Wipro already has a campus there. The Microsoft India Managing Director had evinced interest in setting up a tech hub in Noida in February. In a statement made at that time, he had said, “We are excited to tap into the engineering talent available in this part of the country to create a truly pioneering organisation that will build innovative solutions for global impact.” The UP government also plans to set up an electronic city near the upcoming Jewar International airport along the Yamuna Expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-to-roll-out-red-carpet-for-microsoft-to-set-up-world-class-hub-in-greater-noida/story-RzE18IdZarhP4dVOKSe2yI.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Thane, 25 cities adopt smart tech to combat coronavirus||From developing an app for emergency responses, and setting up a social media platform where experts can share their opinions, to creating a surveillance dashboard that monitors traffic and crowding, 25 smart cities in the country, including Thane and Pimpri-Chinchwad, have adopted innovative and smart techniques to combat the pandemic, states a Central government report.The report, ‘Smart Responses to Covid-19’ published by the Central government’s Smart Cities Mission, National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), and World Resources Institute (WRI) India was released on June 25. It lists measures taken by 25 smart cities across India in five key categories of action — tracking and monitoring, diagnostics, sanitisation, awareness and capacity building, and citizen support.Kunal Kumar, joint secretary and mission director (smart cities), ministry of housing and urban affairs, said, “By July 25, we will be releasing a report on all 100 smart cities and the measures adopted by the civic administrations. These are innovative techniques looking at information gathering, management, accurate predictions and communication that can be adopted by other cities too.”The report talks about measures taken in Agra, where the government has created a hyper-local AI-driven app that allows citizens to raise requests for emergency help across nine categories like food, medicine, medical help, etc. “Citizens can select the category of help needed and press the SOS icon. The help request will go to volunteers in a 300-metre radius,” the report states.The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) installed 298 ‘point-tilt-zoom’ surveillance cameras at 85 locations in the city for the civic body and police to monitor traffic and crowd movement. PCMC also created the ‘Smart Sarathi mobile application’ which includes a Covid-19 self-assessment test, list of containment zones, ‘Near Me’ services (showing nearby Covid hospitals, fever clinics, market places, food distribution centres, shelters, etc.), e-pass applications, and volunteering forms. An M-governance app created by the Greater Vishakapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) collects data from surveys conducted in containment areas and also connects the field team with a rapid response team of doctors for emergency cases.OP Agarwal, CEO, WRI India said, “The report serves two purposes – it acts as a compendium for other cities to look at innovative ways to tackle problems, and it also serves as an encouragement for the civic administrations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-25-cities-adopt-smart-tech-to-combat-coronavirus/story-9OU9dgwHPuKNJyjNmlI9tL.html

01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC bench denies bail to self-styled godman Rampal||The bail plea of self-styled godman Rampal was dismissed by a high court bench, while another bench sought affidavit from a senior police officer on security arrangements. Rampal had sought bail to attend the marriage ceremony of his granddaughter on July 22. The Satlok Ashram head has been convicted for life imprisonment without ‘remission’ by a Hisar trial court in murder cases registered against him in 2014. The FIRs were registered after large-scale violence was witnessed at his ashram in Hisar during a November 2014 operation launched by multiple agencies to nab him as he refused to appear before the high court. In the entire operation, six lives were lost and 110 police personnel and 70 civilians had sustained injuries. He was convicted in October 2018 in two cases. Dismissing the plea, the bench of Justice SN Satyanarayana and Justice Archana Puri observed that the bench was ‘shocked and surprised’ to see details of what transpired in 2014. “With such a background and also considering that there are four more cases registered against him... His antecedents would indicate that it would not be in the interest of the state to show any concession to the applicant/appellant until this matter is taken up and heard on merits,” the bench said while dismissing the plea. The bench also took note of the fact that his son has already been released on bail. Meanwhile, the bench of Justice S Muralidhar and Justice Avneesh Jhingan sought within two days an affidavit from the officer in charge of law and order in Hisar assuring the court that adequate security will be deployed at the wedding venue to ensure that there is no large gathering of people and that Covid-19 guidelines would be followed. Assurance has also been sought that Rampal will surrender peacefully after the bail. The court is to take up the matter again on July 6. Senior advocate Vinod Ghai, who appeared in both the petitions, said the bail was sought in two different FIRs. Hence, there was nothing wrong in filing two different petitions. However, ordinarily, these are listed before one bench, he said, adding that judges were intimated about this as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-hc-bench-denies-bail-to-self-styled-godman-rampal/story-XJtsUIgr9TjtNAMRuwmpHP.html

However, his situation deteriorated after returning home and he died in the afternoon, a family member said.The doctor, after being informed, visited the man’s apartment wearing a PPE. But he refused to issue a death certificate saying that it was a Covid-19 case and advised the family members to contact the Amherst Street police station, under which the area falls, he said.The police directed the family to contact the local councillor. “But there too we did not receive any help and we were asked to get in touch with the state health department,” he said. “We even made several calls to the helpline given to us by a person when we called up the health department but nobody responded,” another family member said. Unable to conduct the last rites, the desperate family members contacted a number of mortuaries but they too refused to keep the body after hearing of the circumstances of the man’s death. The family members then managed to procure a freezer to preserve the body till the last rites. “We made several calls to the local councillor and the state health department but no one helped us. Calls were not answered. That’s why decided to keep his body at home inside a freezer,” the family member said. The test results on Tuesday night confirmed Covid-19. “In fact even after getting the test reports we kept on calling the state health department but there was no response. On Wednesday morning, we got calls from the health department and told them everything,” he said. Within an hour, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) employees reached the apartment and took away the body for cremation, the family member said. “His body will be cremated as per the ICMR guidelines for Covid-19 deaths,” a senior KMC official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/man-dies-from-coronavirus-family-keeps-body-in-freezer-for-hours-as-officials-fail-to-respond/story-bntBkLJsTdbX8L6nd7viaM.html

Ab aap log hospital mat aana (Don’t come to the hospital anymore),” — these were inspector Sanjeev Yadav’s last words to his family on June 18, the day he was put on ventilator support at a private hospital in the city.The 48-year-old Delhi Police inspector, posted with the anti-terrorist squad (special cell), died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) early Wednesday — the 10th policeperson to succumb in the city to succumb to the infection. As of Wednesday evening, around 2,000 police personnel in the Capital have tested positive for Covid-19.Just weeks ago, the decorated and well-regarded police officer, who had in January 2020 been conferred the President’s police medal for gallantry, was instrumental in nabbing two key members of a gang in Punjab’s Zikarpur — his last major operation, his colleagues and friends said.Inspector Yadav had been posted in the special cell’s south-western range since March 2018, and was instrumental in arresting over 60 criminals in his time there, including those belonging to gangs led by jailed gangsters Jitender (known as Gogi) and his rival Sunil (known as Tillu), according to inspector Maan Singh, a close friend of Yadav’s and a member a colleague in the special cell.Yadav was awarded the gallantry medal for his work in cracking down on members of gang that had shot dead two employees of a cashvan while robbing it in Narela in 2018.During his two-year tenure in the special cell, Yadav came face-to-face with armed criminals on 13 occasions, each of which involved an exchange of fire.The officer was also a recipient of 25 Commendation Rolls, 13 Commendation Certificates and 26 Commendation Cards issued by the Delhi Police.His last rites were performed at Lodhi Colony crematorium around 11.30am on Wednesday, with several officers of the special cell in attendance.Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal offered their condolences on Twitter.“Extremely saddened at the death of Insp Sanjeev Kumar Yadav in the line of duty fighting COVID-19. A great warrior, recipient of Police Medal for gallantry, he brought laurels for @DelhiPolice. His untimely demise is irreplaceable loss for the organization. My deepest condolences!,” the L-G tweeted.Kejriwal tweeted, “My deepest condolences at the death of Insp Sanjeev Kumar Yadav who died of Covid-19. A very brave policeman and recipient of Police medal. His death is a great loss to @Delhi Police.”A life cut shortInspector Singh said he was the first one in the team to be tested positive for the virus — on May 31. “All 12-15 team members quarantined themselves and got themselves tested for the virus. However, their reports, including Yadav’s came negative. But Yadav developed symptoms after June 10,” he said.Yadav was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital on June 16, after complaining of breathlessness, fever and a sore throat, Yadav’s brother-in-law Devraj Yadav said.He was tested at the hospital the same day, the reports confirmed he was positive for the infection on June 17. When his oxygen levels dipped on June 17, he was shifted to Max Saket hospital, Devraj said. He was put on ventilator support a day later“His oxygen level never improved. I had texted him, asking if he was in the intensive care unit (ICU) or a ward. But he did not respond to that question, and instead asked me not to visit the hospital,” Devraj added.Police said the source of his infection was still unclear.Three days later, Yadav’s wife Kalpana tested positive for the virus, while their 16-year-old a son and 13-year-old daughter, and six other relatives tested negative.Kalpana was, on June 22, admitted to the same hospital as her husband.“She was discharged on June 26, but doctors advised her to quarantine at home for seven days home quarantine. Since Kalpana insisted, she was allowed to attend the funeral. She wore a PPE [personal protective equipment] kit and followed all protocols,” said Devraj, adding that Yadav’s mother and two siblings have reached Delhi after being informed about his death.Originally from Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh, Yadav had joined police in 1996 as a sub-inspector. He completed his schooling and higher education from Rajasthan. After being promoted to inspector rank in 2015, Yadav served in Tughlaq Road police station in New Delhi.Cases rising, preventive measuresSo far, 10 officers of the Delhi Police have succumbed to Covid-19. However, while 2,000 personnel have tested positive for the infection, more than 1,300 have recovered from the viral infection and resumed their duties so far, a Delhi Police spokesperson said.Head constable Dheer Singh, who was posted in the police control room (PCR) unit in north zone, died at Lady Hardinge Hospital on Tuesday afternoon, a day after he was tested positive and initially advised home quarantine.“The head constable’s health condition suddenly deteriorated and was admitted to the hospital where he died around noon on Tuesday. He is survived by his wife and two children, who live in Wazirabad,” said deputy commissioner of police (PCR) Sharat Sinha.The other dead personnel include two sub-inspectors, three assistant sub-inspectors and three head constables. From managing containment zones, ensuring social distancing, feeding the homeless and maintaining law and order, the city’s police force has been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. Officials said Delhi Police administration has taken several measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 outbreak among the personnel and their family members.Beds have been reserved for them in government and private hospitals and isolation centres have been set up for asymptomatic personnel, who are advised to home quarantine. A dedicated Covid-19 test centre for police personnel has also been set up at Shalimar Bagh, which can collect and test 50 samples a day.A circular has been issued on how to work amid the pandemic and avoid physical contact with colleagues and the public, senior officials said. For instance, most of the police team’s meetings are being done via video-conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/decorated-cop-is-delhi-police-s-10th-covid-casualty-2-000-personnel-infected/story-deUn4f50r6ghj5Nmz7TSTM.html

This is for your kind information and further necessary action,” read the order issued earlier by the assistant director (academic) on behalf of additional chief secretary (school education).Mahavir Singh, additional chief secretary, school education, said the educational institutions will be opened for students only after the approval from the Centre and issuance of the standard operating procedures (SoPs).SUMMER VACATIONS TILL JULY 26Minister Kanwar Pal said the schools will remain closed from July 1, 2020, to July 26, 2020, for summer vacations.“During the vacations, there is no need for teachers and non-academic staff to be present at the schools. The Union home ministry will issue necessary guidelines regarding the decision to permit students to attend schools as per the circumstances prevailing at that time,” he added.He said during the summer vacations, the Chief Minister’s Distance Education Programme will continue to function.Last month, the state government had asked the teaching staff of government and private schools to return to their offices to carry out urgent administrative works.

01-07-2020||City||Noida: Wife strangulates alcoholic husband to death, arrested||Noida: The police on Wednesday arrested a woman for allegedly killing her husband, whose body was found last week near their accommodation in Noida’s Sector 8 JJ cluster, officials said.According to the police, a complaint was filed by the nephew of victim, identified as Chunnu (32), a resident of Ghoswari village in Bakhtiarpur, Patna (Bihar), at the Sector 20 police station, alleging that his uncle had left for work on June 25 and the following day, his body was found near his accommodation at around 6am on June 26.Police said that prima facie, it had seemed that the victim was choked to death and an investigation was started.“On the morning of Friday, June 26 we received information about the body of a man at a shanty in Sector 8. Later, it was found that the body was of a daily wager named Chunnu who lived in the same area with his family. It seemed that the cause of death was strangulation. We sent the body for post mortem and started an investigation, which later revealed that it was his wife who killed him. We have arrested her and sent her to jail,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida.The investigation also revealed that the victim – an alleged regular drinker who would often beat his wife Gudiya – had another row with his wife on the night of Thursday, June 25. Police said following the fight, his wife allegedly tied his hands with a rope and choked him with a rolling pin, due to which Chunnu died. Police said in a statement that the accused has allegedly confessed. Police also recovered the rope and the rolling pin used in the murder.“It was revealed that the accused had killed her own husband after getting fed up with his conduct. Her husband was an alcoholic and would often beat her. Possibly they had to change their accommodation because of their fighting and the landlord would often object to the fighting. The overall impact of such circumstances moved her to tie her husband with a rope and strangulate him with a rolling pin on the night of June 25, when he reached home drunk again and started a fight,” said Singh.A case was registered at the Sector-20 police station under Sections 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-wife-strangulates-alcoholic-husband-to-death-arrested/story-hPYghNl9BiN8hJw7ydfxmN.html

On Monday, a couple — a 20-year-old married woman along with her husband — had approached Pappan, seeking help with some personal troubles that they believed were paranormal. The women later accused Pappan of having allegedly raped her. The incident was reported by the woman’s husband. The accused was on Wednesday afternoon arrested from outskirts of his village , police said.“We had arrested the suspect and post medical examination presented him in front of the district court, from where he was sent to jail. The man, an occult practitioner, was known locally and often offered to cure villagers from the influence of spirits. After the victim registered a complaint, we had launched a manhunt for him. He was finally nabbed today afternoon,” said Vineet Kumar, station house officer, Rabupura police station.He added that the man, though an occult practitioner, had no criminal history and this was the first time he had been booked.According to the victim’s husband, they had gotten married in February but started looking soon after their marriage. His wife, he claimed, often became very aggressive with little provocation. He also claimed that unexplained things had started happening in their home. The man then contacted Pappan for help, because he believed that his wife was under the influence of a spirit. The man has also claimed that the suspect had visited the family four days ago, taken Rs 5000 from them and had asked them to bring the woman to his village, a few kilometers away.“We reached his village at around 11am on Monday and he took us to a field nearby and gave us some ash to taste, which was probably laced with sedatives. Both me and my wife lost consciousness after that. When I woke up, my wife recounted her ordeal to me. We confronted the tantric, but he threatened to kill us. It was then that I decided to approach the police,” said the husband.Based on the man’s complaint, a case was registered at Rabupura police station against the suspect under sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/occult-practitioner-nabbed-for-raping-woman-on-pretext-of-curing-her-of-negative-energy/story-Bfca3iW3bJwFnZ3hMQIyJK.html

Last year, the drive was held on August 15 and over a million saplings were planted through at least 26 different public departments in the district.Forest department officials said that while they have recruited officials from different departments, they have also sought help from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), both under the central government, and the Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (UP-PAC) to meet for the shortfall in staff. The department did not give an exact number on the number of people they already have and on how many they will require.“Last year citizens participated in the plantation drive in thousands. This time we are neither expecting nor promoting public participation due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The ITBP, CRPF and UP-PAC have assured help. Officials of 25 departments have been roped in as well, but the staff shortage is likely to be felt. We have also hired about 2,000 daily wagers to dig the pits and transport the saplings. The estimated expenditure towards this labour is around ₹5 lakh,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer (DFO), GB Nagar.The department will distribute saplings to villages and houses in the district sectors on Thursday. They will be asked to plant them in their own locality. According to the CRPF, they will provide as much support as possible.“We have two battalions -- 221 and 235 -- stationed here that looks after X-plus, Y-plus and Z-plus security of VIPs, but we will provide support and promise to plant at least 45,000 saplings at a Greater Noida site and 45,000 in Noida. We expect to extend support of 100 to 150 personnel, and I can assure that one CRPF jawan will do proper plantation, ensuring survival of at least 1,000 saplings,” said Pradeep Kumar, Assistant Commissioner, CPRF.Forest department have said that they have also received offers from villages.“A large part of the drive is held around villages, especially for the timber trees. We have maintained a stock of over 12 lakh healthy saplings of different species including neem, mango, peepal, sahjan, seesam, arjun and banyan including others at five departmental nurseries in the district,” Srivastava said. ITBP and UP-PAC officials could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/amid-pandemic-forest-department-to-hold-plantation-drive-with-help-from-paramilitary-forces/story-Z1hcWB2k1njYJji8KQBNxL.html

01-07-2020||Noida||With 50 teams Noida to start antigen tests from June 2||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration on Thursday will begin deploying teams into containment zones to conduct rapid antigen tests.The Gautam Budh Nagar district includes Noida, Greater Noida and other adjoining areas, and accounted for 2362 cases as reported by the state government on Wednesday in its 12-hour summary report, which is nearly 10% of the total cases in Uttar Pradesh. The district had 293 containment zones as of Wednesday. The testing exercise will continue till all people in these zones are tested.“The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has trained our officials. Our doctors and health experts have, in turn, trained a total of 50 teams, which will start antigen testing beginning from June 2 in high risk containment zones,” said Suhas LY district magistrate Gautam Budh Nagar.A team will have three health workers -- assistant nursing staff and two lab technicians. They will collect swabs from the patient’s throat and nasal cavity to do the antigen test.On Wednesday, a district health team led by Dr Amit Kumar, a government doctor in charge of Police Lines, conducted antigen tests on 77 personnel at the police commissionerate located in sector 108. The district administration did not share the results of this exercise.On June 25, the ICMR released a document where it detailed the need for rapid antigen tests to massively scale up testing capacity as the number of Covid-19 cases rise and lockdown restrictions are gradually relaxed.With 15,000 rapid antigen test kits in their kitty, the district administration has constituted teams to identify high risk groups, influenza-like illness symptoms (ILI) and co-morbidities.These tests detect the presence of a foreign substance in a person’s oral or nasal swab that triggers the production of antibodies, and, therefore, can find infections. But these are non-confirmatory tests. This means that those who test positive through rapid antigen detection tests are considered “truly positive” for Covid-19 but those who test negative must go for an RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) test for re-confirmation. Rapid antigen tests are quicker -- taking just 30 minutes and can be conducted on-site, compared to RT-PCR’s minimum of two hours and requires a laboratory. They are also cheaper and differ in technology as they look for a specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. RT-PCR tests look for the exact nucleic signatures of the virus.The administration may keep people, who in a doctor’s opinion may have the virus, in home quarantine. “If a patient tests negative in the antigen test, but and doctors advice the RT-PCR for confirmation, then the doctor doctor can recommend home quarantine or institutional quarantine,” said Suhas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-50-teams-noida-to-start-antigen-tests-from-june-2/story-ZdjNPpHTmFn4Hg3SN8efGI.html
01-07-2020||City||UP CM approves lab for Ghaziabad with capacity to conduct 500 tests a day||In order to bolster the testing capabilities of Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has approved a laboratory for the district that will have a capacity to conduct about 500-600 Covid-19 tests a day.Announcing this, additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said on Wednesday that a request for a larger testing facility was made by Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey during a video conferencing meeting held on Tuesday night. Ghaziabad, at present, has no facility for conducting real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) tests. The samples from the district are currently being sent to Noida, Meerut or Delhi.The district has also been provided with a TrueNat machine, which can take up 30 to 40 tests a day and provide results within the hour. A TrueNat machine is a portable testing device which is used for detection of negative status of different forms of infection.The health department officials said that they have been provided with Covid-19 kits by the state government and presently the machine is used for getting true negative status of a Covid-19 sample.“If the sample tests negative on TrueNat, it is confirmed as negative. But it tests positive, then it has to be sent for a confirmatory RT-PCR test. The TrueNat gives us results within the hour and we generally use this in case of an emergency or women in labour, to check their Covid-19 status. One more TrueNat machine is proposed to be provided to the women’s hospital,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, said.Currently, Ghaziabad sends an average of 450 samples a day for RT-PCR testing. Since June 26, the district has also started conducting an average 275 antigen tests a day.HT, on June 22, had reported that plans are underway for an RT-PCR testing laboratory in Ghaziabad.“The CM also reviewed each district under the Meerut division (Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Meerut, Baghpat, Hapur and Bulandshahr) and directed that heightened steps be taken in order to spread of Covid-19. During the special screening and surveillance drive that will start from Wednesday (July 2) in the Meerut division the CM has directed that more antigen tests be conducted. The districts in Meerut division will be provided an additional 50,000 antigen test kits,” Awasthi said.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey was not available for comment.Dr Gupta said, “At present, Gautm Budh Nagar and Meerut have their own labs but there is no RT-PCR lab in Ghaziabad. We are dependent on other districts for getting our samples tested. There is considerable daily expenditure on fuel as we have to send vehicles with our samples to Noida, Meerut or Delhi. The results generally arrive on the third day. Once we get our own lab, we can get our test results within 24 hours. The proposed laboratory is expected to have a capacity of conducting anything between 400-600 tests per day and we have also identified a space for it at our Sanjay Nagar government hospital.” According to officials, an antigen test confirms a true positive. But those not found positive have to be tested again in order to ascertain a true negative.In the meanwhile, the health department has come up with quarantine facilities of 200 beds, combined, at RKGIT College and Ideal College for testing and treatment of influenza-like illness (ILI) patients.During the drive starting July 2, surveillance teams will identify patients having ILI and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) symptoms, so that they can be treated beforehand..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-cm-approves-lab-for-ghaziabad-with-capacity-to-conduct-500-tests-a-day/story-zRSkeKJ00ukKfvrPUXvGjL.html

01-07-2020||Chandigarh||PAU develops new pest-resistant BT cotton variety with a better shelf life||The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) claims to have developed a new variety of genetically modified Bt cotton seed which it says is pest-resistant besides having a better shelf life as it can be used in the subsequent sowing seasons. The variety is in final stages of getting notified by the central sub-committee on crop standards, notification and release of varieties that functions under the Union ministry of agriculture, said university officials. The new variety is resistant to pests such as American ballworm, pink ballworm, spotted ballworm and tobacco caterpillar, the varsity experts said. Also, the farmers will not have to buy seeds every sowing season as they can use the seed procured during the previous season, they said. Pankaj Rathore, director, PAU’s regional research station (Faridkot), said the variety has undergone trials by the Indian Council for Agriculture Research (ICAR) and they were also supervised by the All India Coordinated Cotton Improvement Project. “Generally, the private companies sell seeds which have to be purchased every season. We may start supplying this seed to the cotton growers in 2-3 years from now,” said Rathore. “The trials were held in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan where our variety showed excellent results. Once it is notified, we will start our own field trials on a larger scale,” he added. The BT-II has two genes while the BT-I the PAU launched in 2018 had only one gene. “The new variety is an improved version of the previous one,” Rathore said. Secretary (agriculture) KS Pannu said, “As the area under cotton cultivation has expanded threefold since 2017 from 4 lakh acres to 12.5 lakh acres we need new varieties which are resistant to pest attack.”It was in 2005 that US-based firm Monsanto introduced BT cotton variety in India. “In South and central India, Monsanto seeds have become vulnerable to pink, American and spotted ballworm pests,” said Dr. Rathore.

They tried to get a stay order from the courts, but the court did not grant it, he added. Bhath said the enforcement team reached the spot with police and machinery around 11am and started the demolition. “The owners tried to raise objections, but we warned them to stay away or else they could face penal action,” he said. “Two large buildings being constructed on 500 square yards and another being constructed on 1,000 square yards. These structures were being built for commercial purposes.” “We appeal to the plot buyers not to purchase property in illegal colonies as this would entail serious action and demolition,” said Bhath. The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on Wednesday demolished nine milk booths in its plots on sector 38, 39 and 47. Hari Singh Jakhar, HSVP subdivisional engineer, said that these booth owners had taken no permission from the authority. On Tuesday, the authority had demolished 10 such booths in sector 56 and 56 in the city. Jakhar said that warning has also been given to the booth owners and if they encroach upon the HSVP land then complaints will be lodged against them in area police stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-illegal-buildings-on-delhi-jaipur-highway-demolished/story-kc1eKBHlWJE7H94wBCdUrJ.html

01-07-2020||Mumbai||State issues government resolution to fix private ambulance fares||The Maharashtra government has decided to fix the fare for private ambulances and also requisition ambulances across the state to provide free services to patients. A government resolution (GR) in this regard was issued on Wednesday. In Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the per-kilometre fare is expected to be between ₹14 and ₹24, depending on the vehicle and facility. The minimum fare to be charged by private ambulance operators will be decided in conjunction with the regional transport authority (RTA).Ambulance prices in Mumbai and the MMR range between ₹700 for 24 hours or ₹14/km, to ₹1,190 for 24 hours or ₹24/km. An ambulance with basic facilities would cost ₹700 or ₹14/km, while an ICU or air-conditioned ambulance would cost ₹1,190 or ₹24/km.“Based on the prices fixed, the collectors and municipal commissioners will decide the rent for ambulances they requisition, and how much a person will pay if he hires a private ambulance. The fare and rent are expected to be around what RTA decides,” said a state transport department official.The public health department, which issued the GR, said that with the rising number of Covid-19 cases, there is a need to increase ambulance services. The order was issued after several complaints of private ambulances charging exorbitant fares to ferry Covid-19 patients.A note from the public health department said that the requisitioned vehicles will be used to ferry patients who are not in a serious condition, while private ambulances will be used for patients in serious condition.The district collector and municipal commissioners requisition private vehicles and ambulances on rent. In case a private operator wants to ply, minimum fare must be fixed based on the recommendation of the RTA of the district or city, on a per-kilometre basis. These ambulances will be available 24X7 to ensure prompt medical assistance to citizens.Last week, health minister Rajesh Tope had said that the state is working to fix the fare and get more ambulances. He had said that the Maharashtra government had decided to intervene to fix rates of these essential services and items so that there is no profiteering during the pandemic.The district administration or municipal corporation will pay for the ambulances their requisition, fuel, and drivers’ fee. Persons hiring private vehicles will have to pay the per-km fare. The state government has also asked district administrations and civic bodies to set up a mechanism to tackle complaints of inflated fares for ambulance services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-issues-government-resolution-to-fix-private-ambulance-fares/story-XUJgSrERyLTCoYWbdOPeLM.html
01-07-2020||City||Four of gang held for over 100 thefts in Gurugram during lockdown||Gurugram: The Sector 17 crime branch on Tuesday night arrested four members of a gang over their alleged involvement in at least 50 daytime burglaries in six residential areas across the city in the last three months, said the police.The gang used to target only locked houses in areas such as sectors 56, 57, 53, 54, Sushant Lok-1 and Palam Vihar, said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime). “The gang members had two various modus operandi. The first was to place a piece of paper on the door latch of the locked houses on the first day and check it the next day. If the paper was found missing, they used to target that house. In the second case, they used to ring the doorbell at least thrice, if no one answered within 10 minutes, they used to break the lock and ransack the house,” he said.Police said more than 100 theft cases were reported in the month of June alone from across the city.Sangwan said many families had left the city between March and April and returned in June. He said they received calls from these areas informing the police that their houses were targeted and electronic gadgets, cash and valuables are missing. In many cases, they had even picked up kitchen utensils and groceries.According to Sector 30 crime branch incharge Narender Chauhan, the suspects have been identified as Hari Kishan alias Sonu, Golu alias Vimal, Dalip Kumar and Ranjeet Soni, who are from areas of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Acting on tip-offs, the crime team arrested them from Sangam Vihar and Sainik Farms in Delhi. The gang is suspected to be involved in more than 100 cases of burglary in the city but police are working to identify more cases the suspects may have been involved in.The police said the suspects are history-sheeters who served time in Bhondsi, Tihar, Faridabad and Uttar Pradesh jails at different occasions in the last five years.Pankaj Kumar, a resident of Sector 56 who works in an IT firm in Sector 38, had reported that he had gone out of town with his family on April 2 and found their house ransacked when they returned on June 21. He alleged that cash, jewellery and electronic gadgets were stolen. “The entire house was topsy-turvy; the bed boxes were open, a cash locker fixed inside the almirah was missing. The television and computer were also taken away by the thieves. It seemed that they had spent enough time in the house as they had taken valuables from all rooms and took all utensils as well,” he said.Police said after they formed teams and recovered CCTV footage from different areas and got leads on location where the suspects were seen scouting repeatedly.They would usually steal items such as cash, jewellery and laptops, which are easier to carry in bags but due to lockdown, they picked up whatever they could even from the kitchen and the fridge, said the police, adding that they would spend more than two hours in a house or apartment without any fear.Sangwan said it is very shocking that the neighbours did not get to know about their movements or questioned any of them while they were leaving with bags and electronic gadgets which were visible.“During questioning, they revealed they carried out burglaries in locked houses as they were aware people had left for their hometowns and would not return during their operation. They would also switch off their phones to avoid detection via surveillance after leaving the spot, and changed numbers,” Sangwan said.The police said cases are registered against the gang members at four city police stations, and they are working on identifying more such cases. They are career criminals and have more than 100 cases registered against them in Gurugram, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh.Police said FIRs against them are registered under sections 380 (theft in dwelling house), 454 (house trespass) and 457 (house trespass in night) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-of-gang-held-for-over-100-thefts-in-gurugram-during-lockdown/story-WfuUUJFplkobo2rjPZ8l9N.html
01-07-2020||City||Haryana declares summer vacations for schools but online classes to continue||Gurugram: The state education department on Wednesday declared summer vacations for both government and private schools from July 1 till July 26 but with the caveat that distance-learning programmes and online classes would continue as usual -- leaving teachers confused and unhappy at the ambiguity of the decision. Schools will reopen only for teachers and administrative staff on July 27. Department officials said private schools could continue with online classes as usual during this period. Most private schools in the city had already declared vacation for a varying number of days between April and June in view of the Covid pandemic. The state government usually declares vacations in May-June every year. Government schools have been holding online classes since the first week of April due to the Covid pandemic. The state launched an e-learning campaign ‘Ghar se Padhao’ formally on April 14. Private school followed their own trajectory with some of them starting online classes in March itself.Indu Boken, district education officer, said declaration of the summer break was essentially a relaxation for government schools teachers, who had been reporting to work physically since last month. “School teachers and administration workers had been reporting to work so far. The declaration of summer vacations simply means they will not be required to visit schools during the specified period. Everything else including online classes will continue as before. The break will benefit staff members, especially at a time when cases in Gurugram are at an all-time high,” Boken said.The officer said schools will reopen only for teachers and staff after the vacation. “Physical classes for children will not start from July 27. The status quo remains as of now,” said Boken. Government school teachers who have been taking online classes since April said they were dumbfounded by the twin orders issued by the department on Wednesday. The government had initially issued an order declaring the onset of vacations, which was followed by another order clarifying that online classes would continue during the break.Teachers said the declaration of vacations was perfunctory at best and they had only been given a reprieve from physical visits to schools and not a break, as was being claimed. School heads and teachers have been asked to monitor online classes from home and submit a report as before.“We were under the impression that vacations had been declared for the benefit of teachers who were offering online classes since April. However, we have been asked to continue teaching as before. We are only getting a reprieve from physically visiting the schools. It is misleading to say that we will be on a break,” said a government school teacher who did not wish to be named. Another teacher, on condition of anonymity, said children were exhausted due to online classes and needed a break. “With easing of restrictions during the unlocking process and people resuming work, many children don’t have access to mobile phones during most part of the day. Some of them are going back to their native villages for a break. An actual break from classes would have helped these students,” said the teacher. Private school representatives said they were yet to receive any order through government channels. “We are yet to receive the order from official channels. So far, the understanding is that the order applies only to government schools. It doesn’t mention private schools specifically,” said Aditi Misra, principal, Delhi Public School, Sector 45. Boken said private schools could continue with online classes as usual.Parents are not happy with the decision. Kailash Sharma, general secretary of the Haryana Abhibhavak Ekta Manch, a parents’ body, said the summer vacation order was irrational and did not offer any relief to students who had been taking online classes for over three months now. “The government doesn’t understand that we are living through unprecedented circumstances. Students are already exhausted with online classes. They desperately need a break but by continuing online classes. The government is redefining the meaning of vacation,” said Sharma.Dayanand Singh Dalal, state president, Haryana School Lecturers Association, said the government failed to take cognisance of the interests of students and teachers who were stressed and were in need of a break. “Besides taking online classes, teachers have been actively involved in dispersal of mid-day meals and other requirements since the lockdown was first imposed. Students are stressed too, especially those who don’t have access to mobile phones. The government should have called off online classes and given time for revision instead,” said Dalal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-declares-summer-vacations-for-schools-but-online-classes-to-continue/story-OHu5WeVE1OrSP2PcccUMHK.html

01-07-2020||City||Health dept to distribute pulse oximeters to home isolation patients for better monitoring||Gurugram: To monitor the health of Covid-19 patients isolated at home, the health department is planning to provide them with pulse oximeters on a returnable basis. The department on Monday issued 200 such instruments to rapid response teams (RRT) engaged in contact tracing of Covid-19 patients. 2,000 oximeters will be distributed to patients at home across the city. Health officials said monitoring through oximeters, which are being distributed for the first time, will help in early detection of patients whose oxygen saturation level becomes low as they develop sudden complications. In association with the district administration, the department on Wednesday also started online counselling sessions for home-isolated patients. The department carried out 1,225 rapid antigen tests in the city on Wednesday out of which 46 people tested positive for Covid -19, health officials said. On Tuesday, the department carried out 1,074 rapid antigen tests in eight large outbreak areas (LORs) out of which 58 patients were found to be Covid-19 positive, according to data shared by health officials. Rapid antigen testing starting in the city on June 23 “Our target is to conduct 2,000 rapid antigen tests daily to ensure maximum people are covered in these areas by July 14. We are in the process of procuring pulse oximeters and these would be distributed to patients isolated at their homes,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. The health department has formed seven teams for LORs and four teams for the rest of the city to conduct rapid antigen, RTPCR and sero tests in these areas. Eight municipal wards in the city have been designated as LORs as the number of cases there have exceeded beyond 15, the district administration said. Apart from testing and contact tracing, the administration has imposed restrictions on movement in these areas. Yadav said 500 masks, Covid awareness booklets and other material have been given to each team which is constantly engaging with patients. “We will distribute immunity boosting medicine through Ayush in LORs in the coming days,” said Yadav. As part of the online counselling, two doctors from the health department will hold two sessions daily from 11 am to 1 pm and 5 to 7 pm for patients isolated at home. These doctors will operate from the Gurugram mini-secretariat and provide counselling free of cost. To motivate the residents of large outbreak areas, the authorities have taken local social workers and councillors into confidence so that maximum people come for testing. “The decision to involve locals was taken after it was observed initially there was resistance among people to get tested,” said a government official. A senior government official on the condition of anonymity also said the objective of the health outreach in containment zones and LORs was more focussed on voluntary participation and awareness rather than taking coercive measures, which would alienate the people. “Already, the lockdown has hit the morale and it would be better that this exercise is participatory,” he said. The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran, which is engaged in contact tracing of Covid 19 patients, meanwhile, said that to boost data-collection efforts across public health centres, it is holding a workshop for health care workers of those primary health centres (PHCs) that are lagging behind. “There are some PHCs where more training is required to streamline data collection and contact tracing. We are holding a workshop for them on Wednesday evening,” said Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer 1, HSVP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-dept-to-distribute-pulse-oximeters-to-home-isolation-patients-for-better-monitoring/story-wgej0I2TbK7ilLYBWLw9JO.html
01-07-2020||Chandigarh||In more relaxations, pillion rider allowed on bikes in Chandigarh||Now, a two-wheeler can have a pillion rider while three people can travel in car besides the driver. These are among a few relaxations allowed by the Chandigarh administration on Wednesday, following the announcement of Unlock 2 guidelines by the central government on June 29.Among other easing of restrictions, odd-even formula has been done away with in congested markets and serving of liquor has been allowed in marriage functions with approval of the excise department.As night curfew was relaxed by an hour on Tuesday, and will now begin at 10pm, shops and restaurants can remain open from 10am to 9pm. However, serving of liquor is still not allowed in restaurants, clubs and hotels while bars and pubs will remain shut.Also, call centres and industrial establishments can operate in night shifts, provided their employees do not leave the premises during the curfew period (10pm to 5am).Earlier, a two-wheeler was not allowed to have a pillion rider while a car could have only two people other than the driver. Besides relaxing these restrictions, the administration has also allowed auto-rickshaws to ferry up to two passengers, instead of just one.While odd-even formula was discontinued in markets during later phases of the lockdown, it remained in place in congested markets, such as Patel Market in Sector 15, Palika Bazar in Sector 18, Sadar Bazar in Sector 19 and Shastri Market in Sector 22. Besides doing away with it in these markets, it has also been discontinued at street vending sites.NO LIQUOR AT RESTAURANTSThe hospitality industry, which was the last to be allowed to open in Chandigarh, is one of the worst-affected sectors because of the Covid-19 lockdown.Its representatives expressed disappointment over the administration’s decision to not allow serving of liquor. “Though the administration has been allowing staggered opening of hospitality services, liquor, which is an integral part of guest requirements, continues to remain prohibited. This will have a negative cascading impact on the already paralysed industry,” said Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association. “The industry is in a severe crisis in the city. We have suffered more than ₹400-crore losses in the last three months. Even now, nearly 60% restaurants are closed, particularly because of the liquor ban,” said Arvinder Pal Singh, president, Chandigarh Hotel and Restaurant Association, while urging the UT to follow in the footsteps of Punjab for the sake of “survival of the industry, which is a major employment generator”. As liquor has been allowed at marriage functions, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said: “Opening of bars has been banned by the central government. In a marriage event, social distancing can be maintained.”Meanwhile, welcoming the UT’s decision on night shifts, Pankaj Khanna, president, Industries Association Chandigarh, said: “The administration should also address other issues faced by the industry in these extremely tough times.”NO APNI MANDIS FOR NOWWith concern over maintaining of social distancing norms at the congested apni mandis and organic markets, the administration decided to keep them closed for the time being.Also interstate bus service will continue to remain suspended, till further orders. With Covid-19 cases continuing to rise in Chandigarh, the administration on June 12 stopped the operations of all interstate buses just two days after Chandigarh Transport Undertaking had resumed its long-route services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-more-relaxations-pillion-rider-allowed-on-bikes-in-chandigarh/story-rRcu1qcSJoiLshyAGbZVzH.html
01-07-2020||City||Covid hits North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s tax collection||New Delhi: Already facing mouting budgetary losses, the Covid-19 pandemic has further crippled North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s finances as it struggles to pay its employees and contractors. To aggravate the problem, property tax collection, one of the main components of the civic body’s income, in the first quarter is running short by Rs150 crore, say officials privy to the information. Senior officials in both South Delhi Municipal Corporation and East Delhi Municipal Corporation also admitted to losses due to the pandemic but refused to share financial data. Civic authorities said that every year, the maximum amount of property tax is collected between April and June (the first quarter of the financial year) because of special discount of 15% offered by the municipalities.But, the authorities confirmed that collection in these three months was “very less” due to Covid-19 crisis and technical issues people faced while submitting the property tax online. Unable to meet its target, the North DMC has also extended its deadline for availing 15% rebate in property tax by one month till July 31. Officials said they have pegged the target for property tax collection 2020-21 financial year at Rs 1200 crore.Explaining the deficit in tax collection, a senior north corporation official, who did not wish to be named, said Rs 85 crore was collected in April, May and June while the collection in the same period last year was around Rs 264 crore -- Rs 179 crore less. The revenue collection in the same head during the first quarter in 2018-19 fiscal was Rs 250 crore.Officials said property tax collection in 2019-20 financial year was around Rs 600 crore, while in 2018-19 it was Rs 508 crore. “Generally, maximum share of property tax is collected either in the first quarter (April-June) or in the last quarter (January-March) because rebates are provided in these periods. The tax collection remained minimal in the first quarter this year because of lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic. Because of the crisis, we have revised target for the first quarter to Rs 150 crore. After relaxations began in June, we started setting up camps in different parts of the city for offline submission of property tax but the collection was still low,” an official of the north corporation said requesting anonymity.The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has been struggling to pay its employees including doctors, teachers, sanitation employees and civil contractors. According to municipal officials, there are around 12 lakh property tax payers under the north civic body’s jurisdiction but only 4.25 lakh regularly pay their dues. The annual income of the north civic body is around Rs 2,000 crore. This includes revenue collections from property tax, parking contracts, advertisements, stamp duty and aids from central and state governments.“Due to Covid-19 crisis, we are facing a loss of over Rs 150 crore. Our income has been curtailed due to lockdown. For example, we did not get even a single penny during lockdown period from parking contracts and conversion charges,” Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said.Officials also said that the other reason behind low tax collection is “unfriendly” online tax submission process due to technical issues with the website. The residents had complained that they were not able to submit their property tax online as the website was slow and the process had become complex, which was not the case till last year.Prakash said that corporation was working to solve the issue. “To boost our property tax collection, we are setting up camps where people can deposit their property tax. We have also extended the last date of availing 15% rebate on property tax by one month. It is now July 31. We are hopeful that we will be able to recover our losses by the end of this financial year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-hits-north-delhi-municipal-corporation-s-tax-collection/story-YSfwUT7nBMSCGdMCJDt5NJ.html

01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Farmer unions support Punjab CM on sending strong message against agri ordinances||Supporting chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s call to send a strong message to the Centre on the agricultural ordinances and the proposed amendments to the Electricity Amendment Act, farmer unions in Punjab on Wednesday passed a resolution urging the Narendra Modi-led government to reconsider and withdraw the statutes. Attending a video conference meeting convened by the CM, the union leaders said the ordinances and the proposed amendments are anti-farmer besides being a direct attack on the federal fabric of the country.The CM slammed the Centre for undermining the contribution of the farmers and the soldiers, pointing out that they had clearly forgotten ‘kisan’ in the ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’ slogan that reverberated through the country when Punjab’s farmers made India self-sufficient in foodgrains. Amarinder added, “The Centre is trying to take away all powers from the states. We should raise a united voice to send a strong message to Delhi that we will not allow this to happen.”He said the state along with the farmer unions will fight the Centre’s move to ruin the agriculture sector even without the support of the Akalis whom he accused of adopting double standards. He would try to get the CMs of other states on board to put up a united fight against the Centre on the issue, Capt said. On a suggestion of state Congress president Sunil Jakhar, the CM said he would get the proposal of challenging the ordinances in court legally examined besides discussing the issue in the Vidhan Sabha. He warned against trusting the Union government on the issue of continuation of minimum support price (MSP). “It is our responsibility to save Punjab’s future,” he said.A government official spokesperson said the farmer unions demanded the resignation of Harsimrat Kaur Badal from the central cabinet, citing the Akalis’ failure to protect the state’s interests to further their own political ambitions.Bhupinder Singh Mann, national president of Bharti Kissan Union (Mann Group) said they are with the state government in the fight against the ordinances. Bharti Kissan Union (Lakhowal) general secretary Harinder Singh Lakhowal said the Centre could not be trusted on its promise to continue MSP and procurement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmer-unions-support-punjab-cm-on-sending-strong-message-against-agri-ordinances/story-vTAOcaMVvRfcnRmmGwgF5O.html
01-07-2020||Lucknow||Eyeing a govt job, rowers struggle in the absence of training||Sports has been known to get recognition as well as job in a state like Uttar Pradesh. Be it the government-run sports hostels or sports colleges or private and government academies, the aim is to get their sportspersons a suitable job, especially in the government sector.Uttar Pradesh has been a nursery for sports quota recruitment in police, railways and even in armed forces across the country and going by the record so far, an umpteen number of sportspersons from the state have been serving the country in various capacities. It’s an uninterrupted process since long but the pandemic COVID19 has put breaks on this process.Latest on the list of such sufferers are 60-odd rowers, based in Allahabad, Kanpur, Varanasi and Lucknow, who have been struggling to get trained before taking up jobs mainly in defence services. Despite being not a fully ‘contact’ sport they haven’t been allowed to train in the water and the Uttar Pradesh Rowing Federation has urged the government to allow them to do the training so that they could prepare for jobs.“Unlike swimming and gymnasium where chances of getting infected with corona virus, rowing doesn’t have that much of a problem as rowers with single and double scull could be allowed by the government, but there is no response to our appeal so far,” UP Rowing Association’s secretary, Sudhir Sharma said on Tuesday.“Our rowers have already lost important three months of training due to the coronavirus and now the rainy season is all set to give little time to rowers to get ready for the trials for jobs in October-November,” said Sharma, who has been trying hard to bring professionalism in the UPRA ever since he took over the reins in 2018.The 44-year old UPRA, which came into existence in 1976, has its existence at the Boat Club in Nishatganj here at the banks of river Gomti with the availability of 16 international standard boats, including four single scull, four pair, four double scull and four-four. “We could get these boats under the government’s scheme, where the remaining expenditure of 50 percent was born by the Rowing Federation of India.”In fact, the season for rowers in India was due to start in July with the conduct of sub-junior nationals at Kolkata, followed by junior nationals at Pune in August and senior nationals at Bhopal in October. “Successful rowers at these championships get a good attention of government organizations, who recruit people through sports quota but due to the corona now things look almost bleak,” said Sharma.After a long time, two youngsters from the state, Yuvraj Singh Yadav and Himanshu could finish fourth at the sub-junior nationals at Pune in the under-13 category in 2019, whereas Allahabad’s Shivam Nishad lost out in the semi-finals only in the under-15 category. But the real achievement for UP came at the senior nationals at Hyderabad when the duo of Manish Singh Yadav and Akshat won a bronze medal in 500m men’s pair event. In 2018, Kiran Devi, Raj Narain and Prem Sankar also had bronze medals in different events.“Now, Kiran Devi has a job in Assam Rifles. Two of our former rowers like Indian team member at the Doha Asian Games, Munshadi Khatun has been hired by the Haryana Sports Department, whereas Kudrat Ali was given the prestigious Laxman award by the UP Government in 2018. Few others like Rajesh Yadav and Dalbir Singh were given Yash Bharti and Arjuna awards, respectively.”Sharma, however, said that getting jobs in Uttar Pradesh has been a difficult preposition as for the last many years, the concerned authorities are struggling to formulate plan for this. “Look at the non-implementation of the policy of giving jobs in 2015 in which sportspersons with international achievements were supposed to be appointed on gazette posts so expecting anything in near future is very difficult. But if our rowers get proper training now they could be successful in getting jobs in central government’s organisation,” said a senior rower on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/eyeing-a-govt-job-rowers-struggle-in-the-absence-of-training/story-00zDb9KPXssTCrW25MLIqN.html
01-07-2020||City||AIIMS doc teams up with IIT-Delhi to launch app for patients needing plasma||New DelhiA resident doctor from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has collaborated with IIT-Delhi students to develop an app that enable users to track eligible and willing plasma donors who have recovered from Covid-19 at the hospital.The app – COPAL-19 -- was launched on the occasion of National Doctor’s Day on Wednesday. The doctor came up with the idea after running into trouble while looking for plasma for one of his seniors. Convalescent plasma therapy uses the blood component from a recovered person, which is rich in virus-fighting antibodies that boost the immune response of a patient.“One of my seniors had to be admitted to the intensive care unit in the hospital and his oxygen saturation kept dropping. That’s when the doctors suggested he be given plasma therapy. But even for us doctors it was difficult to get a donor after putting up messages on social media and calling up patients who had been treated at the hospital randomly. We got a donor after 12 hours,” said Dr Abhinav Singh Verma, a resident doctor in the department of neurosurgery at AIIMS.With no convalescent plasma bank or a dedicated registry in place, the app will help patients in need of the therapy. It will have the names, addresses, contact numbers, and blood groups of patients who have recovered from AIIMS 28 days ago and are willing to donate their plasma.To ensure that a donor is Covid-19 free before giving the plasma, government guidelines suggest the donation be taken 28 days after the recovery of the patient. And, in case the donation is taken after 14 days, the donor has to test negative twice.“The app will list details of only those who are willing to donate plasma and have pledged to do so before discharge. When we were searching for plasma for our senior, we realised many people declined to donate,” said Dr Verma. He said the app is open source and databases from other hospitals can be incorporated too.The Delhi government, encouraged by the results of a small trial at its Lok Nayak hospital, is also in the process of setting up a plasma bank. However, plasma is still not a proven therapy and the union health ministry allows its use only in Covid-19 patients with moderate symptoms whose oxygen need does not come down despite receiving oxygen support and steroids.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aiims-doc-teams-up-with-iit-delhi-to-launch-app-for-patients-needing-plasma/story-RSfEJMiWEMpUAWVnt6OeeJ.html

He said that people of Punjab are surprised with this decision of Congress in a state whose official language is Punjabi.Cheema said that earlier, the government had made a provision to give five marks to those teachers who will teach 10% students of their class in English language and now taken this decision to abolish provisions to give eight marks to those who promote Punjabi language.“It means that those who are pro-Punjabi and work for the language will lose 13 marks according to the new rules framed by the Congress government. The message is clear – no need to promote Punjabi as you will get nothing,” he said.Cheema has written to Punjab higher education and language department minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa to apprise him of the development and demanded an independent probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/congress-govt-has-abolished-acr-for-punjabi-teachers/story-3gJZOVxXnEABJCsq7fnN9N.html

01-07-2020||City||Probe if medical certificates issued by a city doctor used to seek bail in criminal cases: Delhi high court||New DelhiThe Delhi High Court on Monday told the police, directorate of prosecution and police’s legal cell to examine their records and ascertain the number of cases in which people had applied for bail, interim bail and suspension of sentences in the last two years based on medical certificates and pathological reports issued by a city doctor. During a hearing, police said they found that the doctor handed several fake certificates to securing favourable court orders.The court issued the order while hearing the bail plea of one Abdul Rehman, who was involved in an Arms Act case. Rehman had attached a medical certificate prepared the doctor, Gajinder Kumar Nayyar.Opposing his bail, police had on June 22 filed a status report, alleging that Nayyar frequently prepared medical prescriptions in heinous cases in which the accused were granted bail or managed to get free from judicial custody and, in certain cases, the medical certificates were found to be fake.The doctor denied all allegations. “This is a planned attack on my reputation and I want a CBI enquiry into it. I have been falsely implicated by the police. I am running two charitable hospitals where several poor people come without documents. I cannot keep asking their criminal antecedents while treating them,”Nayyar said.“...the allegations raised by the prosecution and the orders passed by Delhi Medical Council, in my view, it would be appropriate if an inquiry is conducted by the crime branch ...into the allegations raised by the prosecution that Dr Gajinder Kumar Nayyar is issuing fake medical certificates to accused/convicts and/or family members of the accused/convicts for extraneous consideration and not for medical considerations to facilitate then in obtaining favourable orders of bail, interim bail and suspension of sentence,” the court said.The prosecution also said several certificates were issued by Nayyar in serious criminal cases. The police said the probability of him being part of a syndicate, if any, could not be ruled out. Advocate Rahul Mehra, the standing counsel of the Delhi government (criminal), said that despite the suspension of his licence from April 19, 2019, till November 29, 2020, Nayyar continues to practise as a doctor and issue medical certificates based on which several applications are being moved in courts seeking bail, interim bail and suspension of the sentence by accused.Following this, the court ordered the police to conduct an enquiry and file a status report in the matter. It said a copy of this order should be sent to all district judges of Delhi for immediate circulation it to all the judges of their respective courts dealing with applications for grant of interim bail, regular bail and suspension of sentences by accused people or convicts. The matter would be now heard on July 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/probe-if-medical-certificates-issued-by-a-city-doctor-used-to-seek-bail-in-criminal-cases-delhi-high-court/story-LlcTsKWZSSk6d0teycytQO.html

Chopra said while 10,000 beds had been created at the Radha Soami Beas Satsang facility, 8,000 beds have set up in 500 train coaches.The Delhi government initially plans to use eight banquet halls as Covid facilities and make space for at least over 1,100 beds in such spaces across the city. These eight are part of the 77 banquet halls identified and requisitioned by the Delhi government. At first eight halls will be used and if the need arises, the rest would be roped in.Highlighting the problems faced by banquet halls, Chopra said these facilities are not feasible to be used as Covid care centres because there are only 4-5 common toilets that are used by everyone.The court, at this point, interjected and said, “Why can’t it (banquet hall) be converted into a Covid care centre? It has a big hall which can be used. It is for the government to decide on the permutations and combinations of how the facilities can be used.”Advocates Ashutosh and Ayush Gupta, appearing for another petitioner, said no standard operating procedures (SoPs) had been followed by the government while taking the decision.Appearing for the Delhi government, additional standing counsel Satyakam told the court the decision was taken due to the increasing number of cases in the city. Delhi had till Wednesday recorded 89,802 cases of Covid-19.Satyakam said that in any case, the halls were not functional at present and the government had not granted them permission to operate even though a gathering of not more than 50 people had been allowed for marriages. After the arguments, the court asked the Delhi government to file its reply and posted the matter for July 7.The hall owners contended they had bookings for marriages. They argued that the government’s June 12 order to convert banquet halls into extended Covid hospitals was contrary to the law and liable to be quashed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-facilities-high-court-seeks-delhi-govt-response-on-plea-by-banquet-hall-owners/story-MwlsxTSxHhfgVVX9zVkD8I.html

The CBI had arrested the conduit, Bhagwan Singh, while accepting ₹1 lakh as part of the bribe amount on Monday.“We are taking action against Jaswinder, who has been placed under suspension. A departmental inquiry has been opened against her,” said superintendent of police Manoj Kumar Meena, who holds the charge of both crime branch and headquarters.Continues to evade arrest, CBI writes to SSPThe CBI after raiding Jaswinder’s house and police station had summoned her to join investigations on Tuesday, but she remains untraceable after switching off her mobile phone. During the raid, Jaswinder had maintained that the money recovered from Bhagwan is part of a compromise reached between Gurdeep and Randhir Singh, who had accused him of ₹28-lakh fraud in the name of getting his wife a government job. The CBI wants the inspector to join investigations in order to quiz her along with Bhagwan. The CBI has now written to senior superintendent of police Nilambari Vijay Jagadale, asking her to direct Jaswinder to join investigations. A reminder was also sent. The SSP is a supervisory officer.However, the SSP office on Tuesday had conveyed to the CBI that Jaswinder was transferred to the police lines and asked it to write to the SP headquarters, who oversees the police lines. The SSP office had also informed the CBI that for taking action against an inspector-rank officer, the deputy inspector general (DIG) or above is the disciplinary authority.Meanwhile, the CBI has seized a few more documents regarding the case, after Jaswinder on Tuesday claimed the complaint was not pending with her and she was being falsely implicated. She reportedly told the CBI that she had forwarded the file to her “seniors”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/departmental-inquiry-ordered-against-chandigarh-woman-cop-booked-in-5-lakh-graft-case/story-5CtiiZgqJ9ui8IelXJpXhM.html

Formal orders are yet to be received.”Anand further said, “Most probably we will test the students based on their previous assessments. The students cannot be let to fail simply because we are not able to hold exams. Our efforts are concentrated on promoting the students given the current situation and keeping legality in mind.”In Class 11 of 14,000 students who appeared in the term-end examination, 560 got compartments, whereas in Class 9, 4,100 of 12,000 students have to reappear.This when the students were also awarded 30 grace marks.

Prabjot Nagra, 26, was arrested while bringing in 4,296 kg of marijuana valued at $20 million in a commercial truck across the Peace Bridge connecting the two countries near the Niagra Falls, officials said on Monday.“For the third time in as many weeks, the diligence of Customs and Border Protection Officers has resulted in the seizure of literally tons of illegal controlled substances destined for our country,” James Kennedy, the federal prosecutor for Western New York said.Arshdeep Singh, 21, was caught smuggling 816 kg of marijuana valued at $2.5 million on June 5 and Gurpreet Singh, 30, was arrested on June 13 while transporting 1,517 kg of marijuana worth $5 million, according to prosecutors.Like Nagra, they are also Indian citizens and used commercial trucks with trailers to cross the Peace Bridge about 20 kilometres from the Niagra Falls with the contraband, officials said.Nagra and Gurpreet Singh face a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison because of the quantity allegedly smuggled and Arshdeep Singh five years.Nagra was arrested when an x-ray of his truck that was said to be carrying 55 storage containers showed “inconsistencies” in the trailer and an examination found the marijuana in vacuum-sealed bags before midnight last Thursday, according to prosecutors.It was probably the largest seizure of marijuana at the northern border in New York, WIVB TV reported quoting an official.Kennedy said, “We will remain vigilant to protect our border from those who seek to profit from the importation of these illegal substances, as they not only fuel the violent drug trafficking organisations who distribute them but jeopardize the health and well-being of those, including minors, who use it.”Using marijuana for recreational purposes, growing it and possessing it is legal in Canada since 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3rd-punjab-origin-man-held-in-a-month-for-smuggling-marijuana-from-canada-into-us/story-iZWvCZimFIvFIwJ9fdil4O.html

The college is among the 10 colleges fully funded by the Delhi government.Citing multiple complaints over financial irregularities as a “serious matter”, Sisodia, in the order, said, “These complaints have come from different stakeholders such as students, parents, teachers, etc.” The other allegations include financial irregularities in tendering processes, buying of unnecessary items not needed in educational institutions.”Acting Principal Charru Sharma said she wasn’t aware of the order and had joined the college only a year ago. A university official, requesting anonymity, said, “The order is like an intimidation tactic over the governing body elections in the college. They don’t have the numbers there to ensure that their candidate wins the elections for the post of the governing body chairperson.”“Directorate of Higher Education should immediately get the accounts of the last two years of Bhagini Nivedita College audited, preferably by a CAG empanelled auditor,” the order read, adding the compliance report should be submitted within 15 days.This is not the first time the Delhi government has levelled allegations of financial irregularities in DU colleges. In May, Sisodia had written to DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, alleging that the varsity was deliberately delaying the formation of governing bodies in 28 Delhi government-funded colleges of the varsity to shield corrupt officials.Across colleges, these governing bodies (GB) take decisions for smooth the functioning of a college, including the appointment of teaching and non-teaching staff. The 10-member governing bodies in these colleges have people nominated by both the university and the Delhi government.

However, the benefit of the same is not being given to faculty of the dental institute, they said.At first, a four-month deadline was given to PU in June last year, which the varsity missed. In January 2020, PU was given another deadline till March, but no hearing took place amid the Covid-19 lockdown. Now, as per reports, the high court has given a show-cause contempt notice to the vice chancellor and registrar of the university for willful disobedience.A committee was also formed by PU last year to examine the matter and make recommendations. It is learnt that despite the committee making its recommendation, the university has still failed to submit its reply to the high court.A member of that panel said, “As per my understanding, the dental faculty opted for the Punjab government’s scales for medical faculty, and there are some technical issues in implementing the career advancement scheme approved by the UGC.”Earlier, in 2017, the university had written to UGC which had opined that the matter does not come under the purview of the commission and recommended that it should be taken up with DCI.Dr Ikreet Singh Bhal, a faculty at the dental college, said, “We have been waiting for a promotion policy for the last nine years. I think the university has no intention to decide on it.” PU registrar Karamjeet Singh said, “We are in the process of deciding the policy and will adhere to the HC’s order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/year-on-pu-yet-to-decide-on-promotion-policy-for-faculty-of-dental-college/story-2JJNjoB4AnkoNUacmi3sEJ.html

01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Govt schools in Ludhiana to get improved sports facilities||State authorities have directed government schools to send them information regarding sports facilities available so that infrastructure/equipment can be upgraded. The state education department has decided to uplift sports infrastructure by setting up facilities for athletics, basketball volleyball, badminton and football to encourage students to participate in games. Schools have been instructed to provide information on the number of students, equipment required, area of the ground and if basketball and volleyball courts can be set up on campus.To avail of the upgraded sports infrastructure, every primary and middle school must have 100 or more students. For high school, the school must have a strength of 400 or more, while for senior secondary, the school should have 500 students or more. The school heads can email the information to aeo.ludhiana@gmail.com.The sports teachers in government schools said games help students learn various skills like leadership, teamwork, social skills, patience and discipline. They said every school must have a physical education instructor who can guide students and help them practice the game they are interested in. District education officer (secondary), Swaranjit Kaur, said, “For the holistic development of students, they need to participate in academics and other co-curricular activities. There are many schools in district which have grounds and tracks can be set up to organise games and students can use them for practice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/govt-schools-in-ludhiana-to-get-improved-sports-facilities/story-c03M66geezFpSIYEEf3xGN.html

It is a personal issue and I have no comments for them. I have also not made any comments anywhere. All (reports) are wrong reportage,” he said.Countering fake messages and photos being sent by some fake Twitter handle accounts created using his name, Choudhary, who is principal secretary of agriculture, horticulture, animal, sheep husbandry and cooperative departments, also officially informed that for the last several years he has not been using any social media platform like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn etc”.He further informed that this matter has already been brought to the notice of J&K Police cyber cell for taking appropriate action, and twitter.com has also been intimated about this serious matter.After Choudhary, along with 25,000 people, was granted a domicile certificate by the J&K administration, Kashmir centric parties said they have been opposing the law from the very beginning and could see the nefarious design behind it.Choudhary has also served in IT, finance, industries and tourism departments in J&K in his long career.“All our misgivings about the new domicile rules in J&K are coming to the fore. We in JKNC opposed the changes because we could see the nefarious design behind the changes.

Interestingly, Synergy Thrislington is a client of Level 9, he said.He alleged that only these two firms used to bid for building projects by HIMUDA and were awarded works of which they had no experience.“For a HIMUDA building to be constructed using expanded polystyrene system (EPS) , Level 9 was awarded work. However, a third party moved the high court contending that the firm had no experience in building EPS structures,” he said.Sharma alleged that the then state government mislead the high court by stating that the structure was being built with reinforced cement concrete system.The BJP leader also alleged that the works were awarded on much exorbitant rates to the two companies while the market price was much lower.He alleged that the rules were tweaked to grant special favours to the two companies. The government negotiated the rates with the companies after the price quoted by these two firms was higher than the government quotations, while as per the rules, these tenders should have been rejected.“The former minister should explain if he had some interest in the two firms,” he said while demanding a vigilance probe into the matter.Meanwhile, Sudhir Sharma’s supporter and president of district president of youth Indian National Trade Union Congress Shubam Sood said all the allegations against the former were baseless and they were not afraid of any probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-accuses-former-cong-minister-of-prejudice-in-granting-himuda-projects/story-RPSlMOaaXslEdXMSIvnPXJ.html
01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Residents, councillor protest over no water supply, dug up roads in Ludhiana’s Hargobind Nagar||With construction of roads and installation of water supply lines pending for around a year, residents of Hargobind Nagar (ward number 30) staged a protest against the Ludhiana municipal corporation on Wednesday. Protesters gathered outside the office of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councilor Jaspal Singh Giaspurah, who also joined the protest and said roads have been dug up in the area for a long time and two children suffered injuries after falling into the pits. Residents rued they haven’t been getting water supply for months now and are forced to fill buckets from houses where submersible pumps have been installed. The sewer lines are also choked and sewer water has accumulated in different parts of the area, the protesters said.Following the protest, Giaspurah had a heated argument with superintending engineer Ravinder Garg at the spot over unnecessary excuses being made by the MC staff for the delay. “The MC has to install 300 feet water lines in the area and the project has been hanging fire since last year. The road portion has been dug up and two children also suffered injuries after falling into the pit. When asked to construct the main road in the area, the contractor refused to start the project saying that the MC is not releasing payments. The MC has even failed to take up repair work of the road and rubble has been dumped to level the road portion. The project to clean the sewer also is also pending for over one and a half years,” Giaspurah said. A resident, Rajeev Kumar, said, “The area is in poor shape as there is no water supply, roads have been dug up and sewer lines are choked. But, the civic body is not paying heed to the problem. Even water tankers are not being supplied to the area due to which residents have been forced to take to the road.” Giapurah said that he would also take up the matter with local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra as the works have not commenced even after he had taken up the matter in the general house meeting of MC. Despite attempts to reach SE Ravinder Garg, he was not available for comments. Cong councillor locks up MC employees over no water supply in Dhakka colonyProtesting against no water supply in Dhakka colony for around a month, Parvinder Lapran, Congress councillor from ward number 48, and residents of the area locked up MC employees in the sub-zone office situated in Model Town area for over two hours on Wednesday evening.The protest was lifted after getting written assurance from the SE Ravinder Garg that the work to resume the water supply would commence from Thursday. “The water supply got disrupted around a month ago after the tubewell installed in the area developed a snag. The MC authorities and mayor Balkar Sandhu have just given assurances till now. The water is being supplied through water tanks and residents have to fight for their turn. Apart from harassment to the public, it is a shame for the MC that residents have to stage protests for water supply that too amid a pandemic,” Lapran said. Despite attempts to reach SE Ravinder Garg, he was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residents-councillor-protest-over-no-water-supply-dug-up-roads-in-ludhiana-s-hargobind-nagar/story-mJnm5yaG0T4U7CPuSpw0hN.html
01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Unlock 1: Cases surged in Panchkula and Mohali, but dropped in Chandigarh||While Chandigarh witnessed 34% drop in Covid-19 cases during the first phase of Unlock in June as compared to the lockdown period in May, infections surged by nearly 11 times in the neighbouring Panchkula district during the same period. Mohali, too, has nearly fourfold spike.As May began, Chandigarh had 74 cases, which increased to 294 on May 31 and 440 on June 30. In Mohali, the tally stood at 73, 114 and 271, respectively, and in Panchkula, the count of cases was 18, 26 and 112, respectively. With the easing of interstate travel restrictions in June, “there was an influx of people from Covid-19 hotspots such as Delhi and Mumbai, which led to the spread of infection,” said Dr Jasjit Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula. “The situation has stabilised (in recent days) as the movement from outside has decreased to an extent. To meet the challenge, we have increased testing and screening,” she said.Chandigarh, which reported the highest number of cases in May mainly due to the spread of infection in the congested Bapu Dham Colony, saw a dip in numbers in June as no new hotspots emerged, even as sporadic cases kept surfacing from erstwhile unaffected areas.“Besides the fact that cases were reported from around 10 sectors for the first time in June, the real concern was Mauli Jagran, where 14 family members and their two contacts were found positive. However, post screening and testing, it was established that there is no infection spread such as the one seen in Bapu Dham,” a senior UT health official said, on the condition of anonymity. Dr Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said screening and focused testing has led to better management despite an influx of people from outside Chandigarh during Unlock 1, adding that most cases are due to the interstate movement.In Mohali, too, nearly all cases reported in June are either of people with travel history or their contacts.“While roughly 90% people who contracted the virus in June have travel history, the remaining 8-9% are their contacts,” said Dr Manjeet Singh, civil surgeon, Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unlock-1-cases-surged-in-panchkula-and-mohali-but-dropped-in-chandigarh/story-PjOjZ74vBR8WKuSdDiJowK.html

01-07-2020||City||SAD asks state govt to pay students’ 6-month fee||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), on Wednesday, asked the Punjab government to pay private school managements the tuition and admission fee of all children whose parents’ financial status has been adversely affected by the Covid-19 lockdown for a six-month period from April to September this year.In a statement, former minister Bikram Singh Majithia said it is condemnable that the Congress government and state education minister Vijay Inder Singla have surrendered before the private school managements and even submitted in the Punjab and Haryana high court that private schools had the right to fix fee.“If the state has lost the case in the high court it is a direct result of collusion with private school managements. The state did not contest the case properly and failed to inform the court that the school managements could take moratoriums on loans taken by them and does not have to victimise the parents for the same.”Holding Singla directly responsible for the failure, he said it is apparent that Singla came under pressure of private school managements. “This is the reason why the Punjab government has failed to win any relief for parents while high courts of Uttarakhand, Delhi and Kerala have given relief to parents,” he said.“In such a situation, a direct compensation is needed to save the future of affected students. Government should give tuition and admission fee on behalf of these children for six months including the three-month period of lockdown and another three months during which schools are likely to remain shut,” he added.He said that if no assurance is forthcoming on this account, SAD will launch an agitation in support of parents from YPS, Patiala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-asks-state-govt-to-pay-students-6-month-fee/story-zmxraRQ6G3YNdUZAlMFhiK.html

01-07-2020||City||Behind Bihar’s Covid success rate is less testing State’s testing per million is 1767, lowest in the country and one-third of national average||PATNABihar’s Covid positivity rate, death rate and total cases per million population is lower than most states in the country. And, the state’s recovery rate is also better than the most.How does Bihar measure up to this achievement when its doctor-population ratio is the lowest in the country, with one allopathic doctor for a population of 28,391 (source: National Health Profile, 2018); and having just one hospital bed per 8,645 people.The answer to this puzzle lies in the Bihar’s low testing rate (1,767 per million population), which is the lowest among eastern India states such as Uttar Pradesh (2,841), Jharkhand (3,566), West Bengal (4,645), Odisha (5,449). Bihar’s testing rate per million is even less than that of Madhya Pradesh (4,019) and Chhatisgarh (4,995). Infact, Bihar’s testing per million is lowest in the country and is less than one-third of the national average of 6,622 tests per million.Delhi (29,750), Jammu & Kashmir (28,039), Kerala (23,967), Andhra Pradesh (16,981) and Tamil Nadu (15,393) are much better-off so far as testing is concerned, shows the data compiled by Hindustan Times through daily health bulletins of the state governments.The Bihar government has claimed to have ramped its testing capacity from about 2,352 tests per day on June 1 to about 8,500 on Friday last. Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday set a target of testing 15,000 samples per day.Bihar’s total testing capacity includes Covid tests done on real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Truenat and cartridge based nucleic acid amplification (CB-NAAT). Bihar has nine labs for conducting RT-PCR tests, including three in the private sector, and has mobile units to conduct Truenat test in all the districts. “We are increasing our testing capacity and the increase in cases is because we are testing more. We have already expanded our testing facility to cover all the 38 districts. We are also relentlessly striving to increase our testing capacity so that there are no missing cases,” said Bihar chief secretary Deepak Kumar. On Monday, Bihar recorded 389 cases — the highest reported in a day since it reported the first three cases of the fast-spreading contagion on March 22. On Friday, Bihar recorded 88 new cases taking the total infections to 10,076, from 3,692 cases on May 31. According to Bihar government data, around 70% of the total reported Covid cases during May and June were linked to in-migration of around 2.1 million migrants who returned to the state during lockdown. Despite high daily growth of Covid cases, Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said there was no reason any alarm as infection rate (positive cases of the total tested) was still very low. In fact, Bihar’s infection or case positivity rate has declined from 7.47% on May 24 (when there was high in-migration and the state was testing about 2,000 samples every day) to 3.20% in the week ending June 28 (when in-migration is almost nil though testing has touched 8,000 perday) and is less than the national average of about 8%.As on June 28, Bihar’s positivity rate was lower than Delhi (18.38%), Maharashtra (22.01%), Gujarat (9.75%) and Haryana (9.35%) and Uttar Pradesh (3.75%). The reason for this is again less number of tests than in these states, the data from HT Covid data dashboard shows. On the same day, however, the eastern state’s positivity rate was higher than that of Madhya Pradesh (2.73%), Andhra Pradesh (2.61%), Jammu & Kashmir (2.56), Punjab (2.45%), Himachal Pradesh (2.41%), Rajasthan (2.35%), Assam (2.27%), Chhattisgarh (2.03%) and Mizoram (0.53%). Except Rajasthan, all of states have low testing rates.“To me, the Bihar situation is a mixed bag as testing is low and therefore, the infection rate. We will have to see what happens when the states increases per day testing to 15,000,” said Dr K K Aggarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association. Health experts in Bihar, however, link the decline in Bihar’s infection rate to multiple factors — the lessening of in-migrant after June 1 being one of them.“Bihar imported the epidemic largely through inter-state travel, whereas states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal did it through international travel too,” said Dr Tanmay Mahapatra, an epidemiologist working in Bihar with previous experience of research in US on infectious diseases.“The influx of migrants has reduced, which must have reduced the positivity rate. Bihar’s infection growth rate is slow because its epidemic surge was late (first Covid case in Bihar was reported on March 22 vis-à-vis the first case in India on January 30), and the state got time to prepare itself,” he said.“The trend in the epidemic curve in Bihar is on expected lines and is following the same trend as other states, being slow in the earlier phase, and now rising. So, Bihar can ill-afford to breathe easy about the pandemic response,” added Dr Mahapatra.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also been dwelling on increased testing, but believes that it cannot be the only reason for increase in the number of Covid cases.“Bihar needs to test the vulnerable section, including doctors, pregnant women and the senior citizens. Its infection rate is also not the lowest in India. Increased testing cannot be the sole reason for spike in cases,” said Dr Ajay Kumar, senior vice-president of the Indian Medical Association, Bihar.A silver lining for Bihar were its low case mortality rate of 0.72% as compared to the national average of 2.97% as also its 77.52% case recovery rate, against a national average of 59.43%.(With inputs from HTC, New Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/behind-bihar-s-covid-success-rate-is-less-testing-state-s-testing-per-million-is-1767-lowest-in-the-country-and-one-third-of-national-average/story-Qahg1rLqTwFMX6d1fDwrRL.html
01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Pandemic slows down placements||HIRING AMID FIRING Amid uncertainty in the academic calendar of higher educational institutions and downsizing of industry in the region due to the Covid-19 pandemic, campus placements have taken a hit. HT reporters from J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh find job offers are on hold due to the slowdown and Covid-19 curbs, leaving youngsters anxious. The pharmaceutical industry offers a silver lining as it wants candidates to join at the earliest, while the reliable and buoyant information technology (IT) sector is in wait and watch mode. Offer letters have not been cancelled but joining has been deferred . The outlook is, however, bleak for those in the hospitality and tourism sectors. Virtual job fairs and upgrading soft skills are trending in a crisis that offers new opportunities Joining letters in hand, GNDU students keep fingers crossed The Covid-19 pandemic may have delayed their joining but no company has gone back on its job offer to students of Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU), Amritsar, despite reports of layoffs due to the economic slowdown.At least 729 students of the 2019-20 batch were offered jobs by 58 companies in July last year. Most of them were hired by information technology (IT) companies, including Capgemini and Tata Consultancy Services.“The process takes a year. Those offered jobs last year will be joining anytime. They have got their joining letters. A pharmaceutical company of Punjab has asked the 10 students it recruited to join as early as possible,” says university placement in-charge Amit Chopra.“Students hired by leading IT companies in Gurugram, Bangalore and Hyderabad are waiting due to the coronavirus-induced travel restrictions. IT companies are planning online joining,” he said.With the placement season for students of the 2020-21 batch set to begin, Chopra said the hospitality and service sectors have been hit but IT will cover up. “There will be more jobs in IT. Due to the pandemic, everything is being managed online. Some IT companies have already approached us,” he said. -Anil SharmaOnline hiring, virtual job fairs in Ludhiana Due to social distancing, companies are hiring students from campuses after video interviews and online assessments but the process has been slow.At Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, for instance, the placement cell was able to arrange jobs for only 25 final year students in three months, while 280 students were placed in companies such as Airbus and Samsung before March.The lifting of the Covid-19 lockdown has buoyed hopes in the IT sector. Placement officer GS Sodhi says companies are interested in hiring students of computer science engineering.Prabhudeep Singh, a final year student selected by SafeAeon, a California-based computer security company, says, “I was worried as many companies have laid off employees due to the recession. Thanks to the college placement cell and companies holding online interviews in May, I was selected and joined on June 1.”More than 200 students of the Industrial Training Institutes have been recruited in the virtual job fair being held along with the district bureau of employment enterprises in the past fortnight.Government ITI, Gill Road, principal Baljinder Singh, says, “The virtual job fair is on and interviews will be held after July 15. The jobs in demand are those of welder, fitter and machinist.”Balwant Singh, 22, a former student of ITI, Gill Road, says, “After passing out, I started working with a private firm as a welder but was laid off during the lockdown. Last month, I got in touch with my class in-charge who told me about the virtual job fair through which I’ve been hired by Hero Ecotech Limited at a monthly salary of Rs 17,200.” -Deepa Sharma SoodBathinda students await jobs in changing times Campus placement at the Maharaja Ranjit Singh Technical University in Bathinda failed to take place this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.University placement cell in-charge Harjot Singh Sidhu says exams for the final semester are still to be scheduled, so companies have not approached the institute.“Last year, more than 120 major companies held campus interviews and seven students were hired by an online learning enterprise. Though raw, the promising students got an annual package of Rs 10 lakh each,” he said.All students from textile engineering and management schools of the last batch got placed in 2019. “However, cononavirus is leading to changes that depend on the market demand. New avenues are opening up,” Sidhu said. Vishal JoshiOnline tests, interviews on at LPU, Phagwara, PTU The process of conducting online placements for the 2021 batch of Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, is underway despite the Covid pandemic.“We have conducted online placements for companies, including multinationals,” says Aman Mittal, who heads the division of international affairs at LPU.Though most students graduating in 2020 were placed in the last semester by February this year, the placement team is working to ensure opportunities for the 2021 batch.The IK Gujral Punjab Technical University (PTU), Kapurthala, conducted its placement drive in May and two companies are in the process of hiring students.Deputy director, corporate relations, Navdeepak Sandhu said that the companies have held online tests and the final recruitment process will start soon. An IT consulting and services company interviewed 400 students. -Jatinder MahalLaw firms take online option for hiring; Patiala university gears up The pandemic has not only delayed the academic session but also affected the placement processes at Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law (RGNUL) and Punjabi University, Patiala.RGNUL registrar Naresh Kumar Vats said law firms and corporates are approaching the university to conduct placements online. “Interviews are being held online. Since this is a new process, it will take a few days to be streamlined,” he said.Punjabi University placement cell director Manjit Singh says the process generally starts in September after students get admission in the final year of engineering and management courses. “The admission process was delayed due to Covid. We will invite companies for placement once the situation improves in September,” he said.Last year, 366 engineering students got jobs in different companies. “Thirty-eight high-profile companies visited the campus. Of them, only one company recently informed the university that it would defer appointment by three months,” he said. -Navrajdeep SinghUIET, UBS students safe so far but PEC, CU face the heat The economic slowdown has not yet impacted job offers for students of Panjab University but it has affected the prospects of students from Punjab Engineering College.Officials say so far no offer has been revoked by any company for students of University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET) and University Business School (UBS). According to the placement data, 103 of the 129 students who applied have been placed from UBS this year. The highest annual package for a UBS student this time is ₹55 lakh. Manoj Bobhariya, the student placement coordinator at UBS, said, “No company has revoked any job offer to our students.” Among the companies that recruited students from UBS this year are American Express, Avery Dennison, Bacardi, Edelweiss Tokio, HSBC, Infosys, Tolaram, Volvo Eicher and HDFC.At PU’s University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET), around 300 students were placed this year. Sarbjeet Singh, placement officer at UIET, said, “This year, however, we could not conduct the placement drives for students who were not selected.”But the story is different at Punjab Engineering College (PEC) and Chandigarh University. Job offers of six PEC students were revoked by United Airlines, while two companies withdrew offers of five students at Chandigarh University during the lockdown.Himani Sood, director, placements, at Chandigarh University, Mohali, said, “After the job offers of five students were revoked, we managed to get them placed in other companies. We conducted virtual drives.”At Chitkara University, no job offers of students have been revoked but internship programmes have been affected.More than 150 students were placed this year at Goswami Ganesh Dutta Sanatan Dharma College in Sector 32, Chandigarh. “We are back on track. Online interviews are being conducted and companies are ready to take students,” said college placement officer Kapil Dev. Dar OvaisKurukshetra University upgrades soft skills of students in uncertain times With campus placements becoming a challenge during the Covid-19 pandemic, Kurukshetra University has begun an online soft skill development course for its students.KU’s placement cell facilitates jobs to about 500 students every year, but this time only 50% of the students managed to get placement before the lockdown. The hospitality, management, tourism and the service sectors are affected the most. Job offers are for information technology (IT) students as work from home and digital marketing are trending.“Only 30 students have been placed in the past three months of the lockdown and most of the jobs are related to the IT sector. Axis Bank and Policy Bazaar used to hire around 100 students every year, but this time they have not come forward yet,” placement cell in-charge Mohinder Singh says. “Usually, 90% of students in our professional courses would get placed, but this year there is uncertainty,” he adds.But the placement cell is helping out students by holding an online soft skill development course. Nearly 1,000 students have undergone the training so far and upgraded their skills.A final year student of BTech, printing and technologies, says, “All my seniors used to get placed but this year, there were no campus placements. Due to the lockdown, companies are not hiring.”Bhavna Goyal, an MSc (chemistry) passout, who was among 11 students hired by IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Limited, Barnala, in February, however, said that she was waiting for the joining on July 5. “The company has completed all formalities and I look forward to joining my first job along with four of my friends soon,” she said. - Neeraj MohanPending exams, slowdown have HP students worried The Covid-19 pandemic has not only hit campus placements but also disrupted the academic schedule of students in Himachal Pradesh.Suniel Kumar, the placement cell in-charge at the University Institute of Information Technology, Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla, says, “Normally, the placement process starts in August when students are in the seventh semester. Most of those offered jobs last year have not been able to join work yet due to the pandemic restrictions.”The eighth semester exams are also pending so students are forced to wait.“The companies which visit our campus after March were not able to come this year,” he said.However, Dr Nitin Gupta, the training and placement officer at Shoolini University, Solan, said the institution starts its placement drives early so students had got job offers before the pandemic started. “Recruiters continued to engage with us online during the lockdown so it was business as usual with minimal interruptions,” he said.Amit Namta, the placement officer at AP Goyal University, Shimla, admitted that only preliminary interviews are being conducted. “The university was closed due to the lockdown so the placement process was delayed.”Puneet Kumar, 20, a final semester student of electrical engineering at Government Polytechnic College, Kullu, however, said, students are worried as companies, both government and private, are delaying job offers.Mohan Singh, the father of a final year student of hotel management in Shimla, is equally concerned. “My son was to complete his graduation this year and we were hoping that he would get placed but with colleges closed due to the pandemic, we can only hope for the best.” - Navneet RathoreCovid delays exams, job offers for students at Jammu UniversityThe Covid-19 pandemic is a testing time for Jammu University students who are yet to take their final exams and uncertain about job offers in hand.Vinay Chauhan, the placement officer of the university, says the placement process started in October last year and 70 students got job offers. “They were to join after their exams, which are getting delayed because of the pandemic. In the present scenario, insurance and IT sectors offer better prospects but the prime concern is to clear the exams.”Piyushka Pargal, 23, a fourth semester student of MBA from Jammu University, said, “I was placed with ICICI Bank before Covid but didn’t get any offer letter. Our exams have been postponed so we are neither unemployed nor students anymore.”Meanwhile, the placement cell has initiated a web lecture series, roping in experts from the US, to upgrade skills of MBA and MCA students. Sahil Koul, another MBA student, said: “We are upgrading our skills for new challenges. Covid will bring new opportunities.”However, BK Bhatia, the placement official of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University at Kakryal in Reasi district, said, “Our campus placement is almost complete. We started early last year. Infosys has taken 28 students, Wipro 24, TCS 34 and 13 students have been picked up by another MNC.”He said some companies such as Bosch India conducted online exams and interviews. As many as 191 students from MBA, engineering and other streams of SMVDU have been placed.- Ravi Krishan KhajuriaOnline job offers unlock hope in Kashmir The Covid pandemic put the brakes on campus placement drives in higher educational institutions of Kashmir but the unlock phase has come with hope for students upgrading their soft skills.“Big brands in tourism, automobiles and banking sectors used to come to our university but during the lockdown, the corporates did not show interest,” said Dr Zia-ul-Haq, placement officer of Central University of Kashmir. “The question is of stability. Many organisations are laying people off. Campus placements are futuristic and businesses can only recruit when they see a bright outlook. Manufacturing is down, supply chains are disturbed, and transportation is minimum and the future uncertain,” he said.At National Institute of Technology (NIT), Srinagar, two students were placed online during the lockdown. “We had one placement during the lockdown and another student was placed in an oil company in the first week of June,” said Dr Obbu Chandra Sekhar, head of the training and placement department at National Institute of Technology, Srinagar.He said that June had shown promise after the announcement of the unlock. “Things are better. A research company did online recruitment of five students recently. Five to six more companies are in the pipeline,” he said.All recruitments are happening online. “Most of these companies are research oriented, software and public sector undertakings,” he said.At Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST), Awantipora, an e-commerce organisation is to hold an online placement drive for recruiting customer service associates.“We managed to get a few students placed during the lockdown in an online educational company and one student in Apple,” said Dr S. Iqbal Querishi, in-charge career counselling and placement officer of IUST.“There is a change in recruitment. Work from home is the new concept but our 2G internet speeds are hampering the online recruitment. There is a change in student mindset to target companies looking for work from home,” he said.The students are also scaling up things to improve their skill sets, particularly in information technology.“The post lockdown period will be more technology-oriented. Some common sectors of work from home will be online tuitions, filing tax returns, content writing and related aspects. We have been attempting to organise online workshops for students,” said Central University of Kashmir’s Zia-ul-Haq. “Nobody knows where all this will end and we can’t just wait. The initiative has to be taken,” he said. - Ashiq Hussain||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pandemic-slows-down-job-placements-across-j-k-haryana-punjab-chandigarh-himachal/story-Rbm8QYiR2Mh22UXVZbP1uK.html

The downtime, however, was being caused by the power grids tripping due to overload and occasional cable failure in storms. On the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, an entire block of Sector 80 faced a blackout for one hour, leaving residents sweating.PS Virdi, member, Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission said the power body had failed to upgrade the infrastructure ahead of time and now residents were at the receiving end in the hot and humid weather. “Sometimes, the department takes several hours to rectify faults. Consumers deserve better services, especially during peak summer,” he said.Amit Khanna, resident of Sector 79, said even inverters failed during long power cuts. “This is especially troublesome now when students are attending online classes,” he said.Residents also complained of poor response on complaints made to PSPCL. The corporation, in July last year, had outsourced the customer care to a UK-based firm, Teleperformance. Ravinder Singh Saini, superintending engineer, PSPCL, claimed there were no unscheduled power cuts in the town, as the supply was more than the demand. “Even when there is an overload or fault in cables, we sort it out immediately,” he said.A senior PSPCL official said, “Mohali’s daily average demand is 420 MW (megawatt) per day, while the supply is 560 MW. Mohali has two main grids – one in Industrial Area, Phase 7, which generates more than 360 MW, whereas the demand is 300 MW, while the other gird in Sector 80 generates 200 MW against the demand of 120 MW.”The district has nearly 2 lakh power consumers in different categories, including 1.7 lakh domestic consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unannounced-outages-leave-mohali-residents-sleepless-in-peak-summer/story-JVJiIjOVvTSwbYIXTqEHtI.html

He also stressed on checking the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue in the state. “From Thursday, a special campaign for medical screening for Covid-19 will be started in six districts of the Meerut division which are Meerut, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Hapur and Baghpat,” the chief minister said.In the rest 17 divisions, the campaign will be run between July 5 and July 15, he said. When every persons of the state is screened, “the figure of those affected by the coronavirus will increase but it will certainly succeed in reducing death figures,” Adityanath said. The chief minister made the announcement during an event here to launch the Dastak campaign for control of vector-borne diseases.This campaign should be like that conducted for encephalitis eradication, Adityanath said. “In 2016 and 2017, the state witnessed more than 600 deaths due to encephalitis. But in 2018-19 their figure decreased and in 2019, it (death figure) came down to 126,” he said. “Reducing encephalitis, which has killed thousands of children in east Uttar Pradesh in the past 40 years, by 60 per cent and death caused by it by 90 per cent is an achievement. We have to make similar efforts for diseases like dengue, malaria, diarrhoea, kalazaar etc. For this a campaign is being started today in all 75 districts,” Adityanath said.Thirty-eight districts in the state are affected by encephalitis. Urban areas face the threat of dengue and several places face the threat of malaria and chikungunya. To check their spread, inter-departmental coordination is being ensured, he said.“We, the 24 crore people of the state, will fight the coronavirus and also deal with vector-borne diseases effectively,” the chief minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/covid-19-testing-campaign-will-help-reduce-deaths-but-up-might-see-rise-in-cases-cm-yogi-adityanath/story-4ifWPFWL4mIF2BCescus0N.html

01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Agricultural University counters criticism of DSR technique, shares farmers’ success stories||After videos of farmers ploughing paddy crop transplanted through the direct seeding of rice (DSR) method started doing the rounds on social media, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) experts and the agriculture department countered the videos with success stories of farmers who had used the new technique.The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) decided to counter the misconception after receiving feedback on why farmers decided to plough their fields.A PAU expert said the farmers who ploughed their fields were repenting after seeing the crops of farmers who stuck to the DSR technique.Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) senior agronomist Dr Makhan Singh Bhullar, during his weekly Facebook live, shared his mobile number and urged farmers to contact him before ploughing their fields or send a picture of their fields over Whatsapp if they were facing any issue pertaining to cropping of seeds.GENERATION GAP, PEER PRESSURE AT PLAY Bhullar said, “In most cases where fields were ploughed, belief in convention won over innovation. There was a conflict between the younger and older generation. For many decades, farmers have been sowing paddy using the traditional method. They were averse to new techniques. In many cases, fathers pressed their son to plough the field after 20 days and sowed the paddy nursery using the traditional puddling method,” said Dr Bhullar.The second reason was the availability of migrant labour. “There has been a sudden thrust of migrant agricultural labour in Punjab. Many farmers found sticking to the DSR technique a risky proposition and opted for a conventional method of farming,” said Bhullar.Chief agricultural officer Baldev Singh Naurath has posted several success stories of farmers who stuck to the new DSR technique.He noted that there was a lot of peer pressure among farmers, which led farmers to plough their fields.“Farmers want to play safe. In some villages, farmers collectively decided to opt for a conventional method. In order to stop such incidents, we decided to share success stories of farmers who stuck to their convictions and opted for the DSR technique,” Naurath said.RUMOURS ABOUND Harpreet Singh, of Kabarwala village in Muktsar district, who has successfully sown paddy over 21 acres through the DSR technique blamed the seed seller for spreading misconceptions.“A rumour was spread among farmers in Malwa region that crop sown through DSR technology was being attacked by fungus. This triggered panic among farmers. My father told to me to opt for the old puddling technique and my fellow farmers told me not to take a risk, but I stuck to my guns and now my field is green and farmers who ploughed their fields are repenting,” said Harpreet.The university had sanctioned 4,000 DSR machines and 800 paddy transplanter machines to farmers at a subsidy ranging from 40%- 50%. Farmers started sowing rice with the machines after May 20 in Punjab and against a target of 5 lakh hectares farmers sowed paddy over 7 lakh hectares of the state, which is 25%of the total area under paddy cultivation in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-agricultural-university-counters-criticism-of-dsr-technique-shares-farmers-success-stories/story-X62zPoQgdrTdO9Svrf3lFJ.html

She demanded that the guilty be punished.“The tragedy that the bodies of Covid-19 victims being thrown into trenches in Ballari, Karnataka is height of cruelty and an insult to humanity. Though incidents related to inhuman cruelty with corona patients are rampant but guilty of Ballari must be punished by the state government,” Mayawati said in a tweet.After the video surfaced online, Karnataka Health Minister B Sriramulu on Tuesday said the workers concerned have been suspended. Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa expressed shock over the incident. “The behaviour of the health workers with the dead bodies of the Covid-19 victims is inhuman and painful. I appeal to the health workers to be kind to the Covid victims and perform the last rites of the deceased with honour. There is no religion bigger than humanity,” he had said in a series of tweets. In a separate tweet, Mayawati asked the Centre to extend the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana till the end of the Covid-19 pandemic.“In order to check ignominy of starvation on account of long unprecedented hardship & unemployment due to coronavirus and the subsequent nationwide lockdown, the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna must continue not till November but till the end of the pandemic, this is the demand of BSP,” Mayawati said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/height-of-cruelty-mayawati-on-covid-19-victims-bodies-being-dumped-in-karnataka/story-GLqj5kRINzVZD9ettaD4WL.html
01-07-2020||Pune||Covid-19: Pune civic body to conduct rapid antigen tests||The Pune civic body in Maharashtra has decided to conduct rapid antigen detection tests for diagnosis of Covid-19 after a couple of days, a top official said on Wednesday.He said the move will decrease burden on the National Institute of Virology (NIV) and other laboratories.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has received one lakh rapid antigen testing kits, he said.As of June 30, Pune has seen 17,000 Covid-19 cases and 643 fatalities.The introduction of the rapid antigen detection test might see a rise in the daily number of cases in Pune.“We had placed an order of antigen rapid testing kits and received one lakh such kits. We will start conducting this test in the next couple of days after providing hands-on training to our staff posted in swab collection centres in the city,” said PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad.He said the accuracy rate of the rapid antigen test is 90 per cent which gives out results within 30 minutes.The antigen-based test uses nasal swab samples and enables quicker diagnosis.“The test is cost-effective one and there is no need for laboratory examination of the samples,” Gaikwad said.As the tests cover a larger population and throw quick results, it enables authorities to modify the testing and logistical strategies.It is a test on swabbed nasal samples that detects antigens (foreign substances that induce an immune response in the body) that are found on or within the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Gaikwad further said that the positive results will be included in the daily count of cases.“Since the antigen test gives out fast results, the number of swab samples sent to laboratories will decrease and the burden on the National Institute of Virology (NIV) and other labs will be minimised,” he added.Gaikwad said the use of the rapid antigen detection test will also cut down the lodging and food expenses of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-pune-civic-body-to-conduct-rapid-antigen-tests/story-KHD1xnnJudZwh9OdsEdcHL.html
01-07-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh cabinet expansion to take place on Thursday: CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||The Madhya Pradesh cabinet expansion will take place on Thursday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said.Chouhan flew to New Delhi on Sunday to hold consultations with the central BJP leadership over the much- talked about cabinet expansion.Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a programme here on Wednesday, Chouhan said, “The governor will take oath today. The cabinet members will take oath tomorrow.” Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel has been given the additional charge of Madhya Pradesh in view of incumbent Lalji Tandon’s hospitalisation.Asked about the delay in cabinet expansion, Chouhan said, “Only amrit (elixir) comes out of manthan (churning), vish (poison) is consumed by (Lord) Shiva.” Around 20 to 25 new members, including some former Congress MLAs who had joined the BJP in March, are likely to be inducted into the cabinet, sources in the BJP earlier said.Chouhan took oath as chief minister for a record fourth term on March 23 this year, after Kamal Nath resigned from the top post following rebellion by nearly two dozen MLAs of the Congress.Most of the rebels were considered close to former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, who quit the Congress and joined the BJP more than three months ago.The initial ‘mini’ expansion of the Chouhan cabinet took place on April 21 with the induction of five ministers, including two former Congress MLAs.When asked about Chouhan’s announcement of cabinet expansion on Thursday, Kamal Nath told reporters, “This is for the first time in the history of the country when the cabinet expansion is taking place after such a long time. Only time will tell what was the reason for this delay and what will be its results.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-cabinet-expansion-to-take-place-on-thursday-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan/story-x5v3HrnfDS0p4flf5tb3oL.html

Veterinary experts suspect that the animals are suffering from Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), also known as goat plague, and mycoplasma infection. The officer said the samples collected from the animals have been sent to the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals and veterinary laboratory in Bhopal. According to him,prevalence of Covid-19 has not been recorded in goats and sheep. The animals have been quarantined because PPR and mycoplasma too are communicable diseases and can spread to other animals, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/50-goats-and-sheep-quarantined-after-shepherd-contracts-covid-19/story-0Se3IqMsp2JUo5zpdX5UnM.html

The judge also permitted them to collect admission fee.The schools have, however, been restrained from increasing the fee for the 2020-21 session.On May 14, the court had allowed private schools in Punjab to charge 70% fee from students for the academic year as an interim measure. The court had also allowed schools to charge admission fee in two installments in six months and further directed that teachers in these schools would have to be paid 70% of their salaries.It had acted on a petition from the Independent Schools’ Association, Chandigarh, with member schools in Punjab, after the association had contested the government move to allow schools to charge only tuition fee during the lockdown and not building, transportation and meal charges. The schools had argued that if not allowed to collect or increase the fee, how would they pay teachers?The decision to allow 70% fee collection had led to parents holding protests. Subsequently, the state government and organisations of parents had become party to the dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-govt-to-challenge-high-court-order-allowing-private-schools-to-collect-tuition-fee/story-btk7QPecTml8aLMBU809RJ.html
01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Akal Takht, SGPC urge Centre to reopen Kartarpur corridor||Two days after Pakistan reopened its portion of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor, the Akal Takht and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Wednesday urged the government to reopen the Indian side of the corridor. The acting jathedar of the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhs, Giani Harpreet Singh, said, “On June 8, the government of India had opened all religious places. Our government should also open Kartarpur corridor for the Sikh sangat.”“I welcome the opening of the corridor by the Pakistan government. I also request to the government of India to try to open the corridor as soon as possible while following the guidelines of the health department,” said Gobind Singh Longowal, president of the SGPC.The jathedar and gurdwara body chief were taking to media persons after participating in a religious function organised at the Akal Takht secretariat to commemorate the foundation day of the supreme temporal seat of the Sikhs. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had said that he was in favour of opening the corridor, but added that the Centre will not be ready to reopen the corridor in such a short time.The jathedar also advised the Sikh youth to think twice while posting material on social media platforms.WORD TO THE WISE “Those who are destroying the determination and principles of the Akal Takht should be given a befitting reply. On social media, an atmosphere is emerging, which is encouraging genocide and destruction of our principles and organisations. We must be saved from it. I appeal youngsters to not get provoked and only share posts on social media after thinking twice so that no untoward incident takes place,” said the jathedar. His appeal comes after reports of ‘Khalistani operatives’ being arrested by the Punjab Police for ‘using social medial platforms’ to come in contact with their handlers in Pakistan came out. On Tuesday, the jathedar had asked the SGPC to pursue the cases of Khalistani operatives arrested by Punjab Police recently.“It has come to our notice that the Punjab Police arrested a few youngsters in the name of Khalistan. If any innocent person has been arrested or anyone has been put behind bars on false charges, it is condemnable, and the SGPC should pursue the matter and get the cases probed,” he had said. Earlier this month, he had claimed that every Sikh wanted Khalistan.JATHEDAR SEEKS PROBE INTO 22-YEAR-OLD’S SUICIDEA 22-year-old had committed suicide at Nangal Shanga village in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar on Monday. He alleged assault and harassment by some villagers at the behest of Congress MLA Angad Singh Saini, the village sarpanch and her nambardar husband.“A Sikh youth was humiliated and his kakars (five symbols of Sikh faith) were desecrated, after which, the young man committed suicide. This is condemnable. It is our appeal to the Punjab government, especially the CM, that all the accused, be it an MLA or MP, should be sent behind bars. A case under Section 302 (murder) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli¬gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli¬gious beliefs) should also be registered against the accused,” the jathedar said. He also asked the SGPC to form a committee and investigate the incident thoroughly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/akal-takht-sgpc-urge-center-to-reopen-kartarpur-corridor/story-ryPoRAWFzWBvVf2Z81xE7H.html
01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Canadian govt seals borders; stranded Punjabi NRIs, students appeal govt to start special flights||In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Canadian government has decided to keep its borders sealed till at least the end of July and has extended its ban on travellers. As such students and NRIs, who were hoping to return to India, will remain stranded in Canada for longer. Conversely, all those who had come to India in January and February taking leave from work or their educational institutions are also stuck in India. Joga Singh of Tut Kalan village, Jalandhar, says, “My wife and I were scheduled to fly to Canada on July 27 to attend the marriage of our only son, Mandeep Singh, on August 14. Earlier, we were unable to get a ticket because of the lockdown and now there are no options left. We will have to postpone the marriage.” An NRI, Amanpreet Kaur, said she had returned to her village in the Doaba region in February to attend a family function and was scheduled to return on March 29 but she was still stuck in Punjab. “I desperately want to return home to my children and grandchildren. I appeal both governments to ensure safe travel soon,” she said. Joban Sandhu, a Mohali resident, who was planning to shift to Canada in March said, “We have already cancelled our plan to go to Canada. We are now planning to travel in September or October if the situation allows us.”Recently, a 89-year-old Canadian citizen had committed suicide in Jalandhar because he was not able to get a ticket to travel home.STUDENTS IN A FIX Immigration experts say over one lakh students from Punjab and Chandigarh opt for popular education destinations such as the US, UK, Canada and Australia each year.Director of an international education consultancy, Jatin Wadhwa, said, “There are thousands of students from Chandigarh and Punjab who are waiting to fly to Canada. We are hopeful that from August the situation will improve otherwise their plans may get affected.”Simranjeet Kaur of Phagwara says, “I know almost 50 students from the region who had recently travelled to India to meet their families. However, they were stuck here due to the lockdown. Now, this new order has added to their woes and they will have to wait another month to return. Hopefully, the government will not extend the ban.” She said the Canadian government should start special flights for students as they did for stranded citizens last month.Chandigarh-based Rohan Verma, 21, who had applied to a Canadian college to pursue a course in 3D animation, is waiting for his visa to be processed. He says, “With every extension our hopes get diminished. I have already paid the college’s fee. Hopefully, travel restrictions will be removed by September or I will have to wait till December.” EVACUATION FLIGHTS COST A PRETTY PENNY Rohit Kapoor, a resident of Chandigarh’s Sector 46, said, “My daughter had returned from Canada in March and now she is stuck here. The charges of the special evacuation flights are very high. My wife is in Canada and she has not been able to return till now.”Anuj Kalra, a Chandigarh-based immigration expert, says, “There are only limited exemptions for travelling to Canada right now. We are receiving many queries these days.”A Canada Border Services Agency spokesperson had made the announcement.He said the agency had “implemented travel restrictions across all ports of entry in all modes of transportation - land, sea, air and rail. All travel of an optional or discretionary nature, including tourism and recreation, is covered by these measures.”The ban instituted in March had been announced by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and he had recently indicated it would remain in place. He had said during a media briefing that the federal government was “going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/canadian-govt-seals-borders-stranded-nri-s-students-appeal-govt-to-start-special-flights/story-7iFdTggPKZ5lmsYpo7PiWJ.html

A total of 713 people have tested positive in the district so far.The district has witnessed a steep hike in its tally in the last 10 days during which close to 100 people have tested positive in Paliganj sub-division alone.District Magistrate Kumar Ravi has ordered an inquiry to ascertain whether there was violation of norms at a marriage ceremony that was held on June 15 in Deehpali village and which appears to have triggered the biggest infection chain in the state so far.According to a release issued by the district administration, the sub-divisional officer of Paliganj has been asked to investigate as to whether measures like wearing of masks and social distancing were observed and the cap of 50 attendees was followed.“If any violation comes to the fore, stern legal action will be taken against those responsible for the arrangements,” said the release.The groom, who was suffering from fever at the time of the wedding, died two days after the marriage. It was not known whether he was infected since his family members cremated the body without waiting for authorities to collect the samples.Nonetheless, the administration tested samples of 259 people in the vicinity subsequently and 95 tested positive for Covid-19, said the release adding that eight containment zones have been set up in the affected areas.Covid-19 cases have been reported from all 38 districts in the state and only two Jamui and Sheohar have respective tallies lower than 100. Besides Patna, other districts which have reported a high number of cases are Bhagalpur 494, Madhubani 456, Begusarai 421 and Siwan 412.State Health Secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said that a high number of fresh cases notwithstanding, Bihar’s recovery rate of 77 per cent is significantly higher than the national average of 59 per cent.He also said the state has succeeded in increasing its testing capacity and 8,231 samples were tested in the last 24 hours. The total number of samples tested till date was 2.20 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/with-five-fresh-casualties-bihar-s-covid-19-death-toll-mounts-to-68/story-4WlwJtQorFpgzkgPqNvXnM.html

01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Do not start tourist activities till October: Himachal hoteliers||In wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Himachal hoteliers have urged the state government to not start touristic activities in the state till October despite the state government issuing standard operating procedures (SOPs) regarding the same last month.All Himachal Association of Hospitality and Tourism spokesperson Ashwani Bamba said, “The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the tourism and hospitality sector. Hotels have been closed for the three months and no revenue has been earned. While we are concerned about the survival of our industry, loss of revenue, our staff and families, we cannot put the health and lives of our society at risk.” “At present, there is no vaccine available to cure the coronavirus. The people are afraid and will not prefer to venture out of their homes and stay in hotels,” he said.In a letter to chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and the tourism secretary, Himachal’s hoteliers have said that tourist activities should not be permitted for the next few months as Covid-19 cases are increasing at an alarming rate in India and the world at large. As per expert opinion, the Covid-19 pandemic will be at its peak in July and August.In summer, tourists from Punjab, Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu flock to the state but these states are gravely infected and are in the red zone. Inviting tourists to visit Himachal will put our public at risk, the letter said. Railways will not be operating till August 12 and airlines have also suspended their operations till July 15.‘MOST PATIENTS ASYMPTOMATIC’ The letter says that as most of patients are asymptomatic, even if all precautions are taken and social distancing is maintained we will be putting the lives and health of our hotel staff at risk. Bamba said hoteliers were not expecting many tourists to visit Himachal in July and August and as such it will be financially inviable to open the hotels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/do-not-start-tourist-activities-till-october-himachal-hoteliers/story-n2aqoiJ13dCe8MleN8bDLP.html
01-07-2020||Chandigarh||In J&K, sports teachers are paid just one-sixth of a peon’s salary||When Rouf Ahmed, 31, a national-level canoeist, got posted at the Government High School in Hazibal last year, it was for the first time in 60 years that the school in a remote area of Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir got a sports instructor.Until then, students of the school were deprived of any sporting guidance. The students’ gain, however, did not translate into an equally rewarding experience for Ahmed, at least monetarily.Paid a meagre ₹3,000 a month, the 31-year-old, who had been recruited by the J&K youth services and sports department, spends ₹100 a day on commute as the school is 28km from his home and he has to take a shared cab to reach there. This leaves him with just ₹400 by the end of the month, and that too, because the school is closed on Sunday.PASSION, HOPE KEEP THEM GOINGAhmed says that the starting salary of peons, chowkidars and groundsmen in the UT’s sports department is ₹18,000 a month, six times higher than what he earns.“But it’s the passion for sports and a hope that we will get the full-scale pay someday that keeps us going,” says Ahmed, who had represented J&K in the kayaking and canoeing nationals in 2013 and 2014.Like Ahmed, there are sportspersons who have won medals at the national and international levels and are providing their services for the meagre amount.Among them is Riyaz Ahmad Dar, 37, who has a doctorate in physical education.SPORTS DEPT APPOINTED 2,764 YOUNGSTERSHe was one of the 2,764 youngsters who were appointed by the J&K sports department on the vacant posts under the Rehbar-e-Khel scheme in January 2019 with a minimum qualification of bachelors in physical education.“A person, to make up the deficiency of the physical education staff at the middle and high school level, will be designated as Rehbar-e-Khel,” reads the notification of 2017 for the appointment.Dr Saleem Ur Rehman, the director general of the J&K youth services and sports department, says the government is aware and reviewing their case.“We agree that sports instructors appointed under the Rehab-E-Khel scheme are underpaid. ₹3,000 is nothing. The department has already made a representation regarding their low salaries and the government is reviewing their case.”WOMEN PLAYERS CHIP IN, TOO“Paying ₹100 a day to a national-level player is nothing less than a joke,” says Sayima Rashid, 28, who has represented the J&K women’s cricket team at the national level 13 times and is the junior selector for the state women’s team (U-19 and U-23). She is posted at Government Senior School, Srinagar.Abida Akhtar, 28, an international medallist in wushu, who is posted at a remote village in Bandipora district, says, “Our job starts at 10am and goes on till 4pm, like all other teachers. We are producing good results and have introduced sports in schools which students were deprived of earlier,” said Akhtar, who holds a postgraduate degree.LONG PROBATION, SHORT ON INCENTIVEThe probation period for sports instructors under the Rehbar-e-Khel scheme is seven years, while in other UTs and states, it is one or two years.For the first two years of the probation, the instructors get a fixed monthly salary of ₹3,000, followed by ₹4,000 for the next five years. They are regularised and paid a full scale salary of ₹40,000 only if a post falls vacant.Before 2017, physical training instructors in the state were appointed at a starting salary of ₹40,000. In Haryana and Punjab, the starting salary is ₹35,000, while in most parts of the country. the salary in government schools is over ₹30,000.“In J&K, there is limited scope of jobs for youngsters pursuing sports as a career. So, they are dependent on government jobs,” says Manzoor Ahmad Bhat, a national-level martial arts player with an MPhil in physical education.Bhat is posted at the Government High School in Nillow village of Kulgam.“Initially, we were told that the authorities will review guidelines of the Rehbar-e-Khel scheme. We were appointed when there was President’s rule, but now J&K is a Union Territory, so we are hoping the Centre will look into our case sympathetically,” says national-level martial arts player Shaukat Khan, who is the president of the All J&K Rehbar-e-Khel Teachers Forum. Khan is posted at the Government Middle School at Kanifpora in Baramulla district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-j-k-sports-teachers-are-paid-just-one-sixth-of-a-peon-s-salary/story-diiVIfEpiVNipd3Gk5Su1N.html
01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal wants curbs on interstate travel to continue, seeks permission from Centre||The Centre’s guidelines for Unlock 2.0 allow for more activities in non-containment zones and inter-state movement. However, the Himachal government has sought permission to impose curbs on inter-state travel.Until a response is received, arrangements as per guidelines for Unlock 1.0 issued on May 31 and amended on June 14 and 18 will remain in force.In the directions issued to all the deputy commissioners and police superintendents of the districts, principal secretary (revenue and disaster management) Onkar Chand Sharma said the ministry of home affairs in an order dated June 29 has issued orders to extend lockdown in containment zones and shared guidelines for opening more activities in non-containment zones.“Under these guidelines, the government of India has allowed free interstate movement of persons without the need of permission or e-permit. This is likely to result in large scale movement of persons to and out of the state thereby jeopardising measures taken by the state government to contain the spread of Covid-19,” the order reads.“The administrative and health system of the state may not be able to respond to the challenges, which may emerge post Unlock 2 as the number of Covid-19 cases are likely to increase,” he said. The state government has taken up the matter with the Center, asking it to allow the state to impose certain restrictions and regulate interstate movement.Till the receipt of a clarification or reply from the Centre, the instructions of state executive committee will remain in force.The quarantine system will also continue to operate as per existing norms till further orders.Night curfew will continue with relaxation increased by two hours from 9 pm to 5 am. Earlier, the timings of night curfew were 8 pm to 6 am.SCHOOL, COLLEGE HOLIDAYS EXTENDED TILL JULY 12Meanwhile, the state government has extended holidays in schools and colleges till July 12.The online classes of school students will start on July 13 but the institutions will remain closed till July 31 as per the guidelines issued by ministry of home affairs.The state government has issued guidelines to call teachers back on duty from July 13.Education minister Suresh Bhardwaj said the government has also decided against promoting final semester students of undergraduate course. The schedule for sixth semester exams will be issued soon.All educational institutions in the state have been closed since March 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-wants-curbs-on-interstate-travel-to-continue-seeks-permission-from-centre/story-p721tHp7Ufj5Ntd5ywc42L.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Chasing the virus’: How Mumbai’s Dharavi beat back a pandemic||When coronavirus claimed its first victim in India’s largest slum in April, many feared the disease would turn its narrow, congested streets into a graveyard, with social distancing or contact tracing all but impossible.But three months on, Mumbai’s Dharavi offers a rare glimmer of hope with new infections shrinking, thanks to an aggressive strategy that focused on “chasing the virus, instead of waiting for disaster”, according to city official Kiran Dighavkar.The sprawling slum has long been a byword for the financial capital’s bitter income disparities -- with Dharavi’s estimated one million people scraping a living as factory workers or maids and chauffeurs to Mumbai’s well-heeled residents.With a dozen people typically sleeping in a single room, and hundreds using the same public toilet, authorities realised early that standard practices would be of little use.“Social distancing was never a possibility, home isolation was never an option, and contact tracing was a huge problem with so many people using the same toilet,” Dighavkar told AFP.An initial plan to conduct door-to-door screenings was abandoned after Mumbai’s searing heat and humidity left medical workers feeling suffocated under layers of protective equipment as they combed the area’s cramped alleys for cases.But, with infections rising fast and fewer than 50,000 people checked for symptoms, officials needed to move quickly and get creative.What they came up with was coined “Mission Dharavi”.Each day, medical workers set up a “fever camp” in a different part of the slum, so residents could be screened for symptoms and tested for coronavirus if needed. Schools, wedding halls and sports complexes were repurposed as quarantine facilities that offered free meals, vitamins and “laughter yoga” sessions.Strict containment measures were deployed in virus hotspots that were home to 125,000 people, including the use of drones to monitor their movements and alert police, while a huge army of volunteers swung into action, distributing rations so they didn’t go hungry.Bollywood stars and business tycoons paid for medical equipment as construction workers built a 200-bed field hospital at breakneck speed in a park inside Dharavi.By late June, more than half the slum’s population had been screened for symptoms and around 12,000 tested for coronavirus.So far Dharavi has reported just 82 deaths -- a fraction of Mumbai’s more than 4,500 fatalities.- ‘Brink of victory’ -“We are on the brink of victory, I feel very proud,” said Abhay Taware, a doctor who saw around 100 patients daily in his tiny clinic at the height of the crisis.The 44-year-old father-of-two also had to fight his own battle against coronavirus when he contracted the disease in April, but told AFP he had “no doubts” about returning to work.“I thought I could show my patients that a positive diagnosis does not mean the end,” he said.Although doctors like Taware worked to reassure worried residents, the stigma persists.After an isolating 25-day spell in hospital and a fortnight in quarantine, Sushil -- not his real name -- said he now feared discrimination if people found out about his diagnosis.The 24-year-old also struck a note of caution, warning of a potential resurgence in infections.“People need to take as many precautions as possible. The numbers might have come down but they can swiftly rise again”, he told AFP. - ‘No escape next time’ -With Mumbai and Delhi struggling to accommodate coronavirus patients as India’s cases surge past half a million officials are also wary of celebrating too soon.“It’s a war. Everything is dynamic,” said Dighavkar.“Right now, we feel like we are on top of the situation,” he said. “The challenge will be when factories reopen,” he added, referring to the billion-dollar leather and recycling industries run out of Dharavi’s cramped tenements.And some in the slum fear their community might not be as lucky next time.On a blazing morning, as car salesman Vinod Kamble lined up to have his temperature taken, he recalled his terror when the virus landed in Mumbai.“I felt like Dharavi would be destroyed, and nothing would be left,” he told AFP, describing the near impossibility of avoiding infection in the slum.“We need better infrastructure,” the 32-year-old said.“Otherwise the next time a disease like this emerges, I don’t think Dharavi will be able to escape.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/chasing-the-virus-how-mumbai-s-dharavi-beat-back-a-pandemic/story-fhx7Xr1yNNg3YA3CPrkfGM.html

Before taking the extreme step, the youth made a video wherein he claimed that he was attacked by local residents Parkash Raj, Gursewak, Paramjit with the support of MLA Saini, sarpanch Neena Devi and her husband Sucha Ram. His father, who filed a police complaint, said Parkash Raj also took away his son’s turban when he along with others carried out an attack at their house on June 11. An FIR was registered in this regard. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Alka Meena formed a special investigation team headed by SP (detective) Wazir Singh Khaira to probe the case. She also shunted out the Rahon station house officer (SHO) and the Shekhan Mazara police post in-charge over alleged mishandling of the case.It is learnt that the victim’s family had taken panchayat land on lease for the last couple of years but Parkash Raj made a higher bid this time for the land, leading to a tussle started between two parties, it is learnt. Even cross FIRs were registered recently. MLA Saini said there was a dispute between two parties and he had intervened to stop illegal encroachment of panchayat land. “I told them that the land should go to the higher bidder. I have nothing to do with it (youth’s suicide),” he claimed. The victim’s family refused to cremate the body till a case was registered against all the accused. The body was kept at a mortuary of a Banga hospital.

01-07-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: In the dream world of Chacha Chaiwale||He can easily pass off as a Barista serving the poetic world of ghazals and nazms. Seated beside his coffee machine, the gracious-seeming man in long beard is wearing a small skull cap, a loose-flowing salwar suit, and looks like a figure from a world peopled with poets like Ghalib and Zauq.Some places are so marked with distinct character, their ambiance so transportive that they immediate plunge the visitor into a setting totally different from the rest of the surroundings.Chacha Chaiwale’s, or tea man uncle’s, establishment in Old Delhi is one of these dreamlands.Tucked into the narrow Haveli Bakhtawar lane, the stall is only a few steps away from the historic Jama Masjid, and its vibes are as confident as that of the red sandstone 17th-century monument.Facing the hole-in-the-wall Rafiouddin Qureshi Meat Shop, the chai destination consists of a raised metal slab, planked across the pavement, on which Chacha Chaiwale sits. His real name is Haji Waziruddin. “I acquired the title of Haji after performing hajj in 1992,” he says in a most polite tone. That was also the year when he started this tea stall. Earlier, this same spot hosted his family-run ice-selling trade. “That line was started by my father before 1947,” says the gentleman.The fact that the origins of this pavement landmark go back to such a long-ago time infuses it with venerable dignity. Even an ignorant person, accidentally passing through the cramped alley, can easily sense the stall’s rootedness to the area — as if it had sprung from the very soil of the street. Just like two of the street’s other equally distinguished landmarks—the aforementioned meat shop (born 40 years ago) and Hilal Hotel (35 years ago).Haji Waziruddin’s personality also plays a role in making the mood of his establishment so unforgettable. His face glows in utmost calmness. He speaks in flawless Urdu—it is hard to hear such diction in Old Delhi these days (Chacha is equally adept in Old Delhi’s present-day colourful street lingo). You also have to look at his hands. The fingers are decked with shining rings—“each concerns a mannat (prayer) that has been fulfilled.” And this morning his long beard is tied by a band, as if it were a pony tail.Being a pious man, Haji Waziruddin is often seen holding his tasbih, the chain of prayer beads. Though right now it is hanging off a hook on the coffee machine. “I serve (butter) coffee in the winter... there’s no demand for it these days... so I make only chai.”The stall’s side wall is also an important character in the silent theatricality of the place. It unfolds to the viewer like a work of art. The wall is cluttered with all sorts of knick-knacks gathered by Chacha Chaiwale over the years: shop licence, prayer calendar, a clock, a teeny-weeny fan, a set of rusting keys, a metal stand to stack white thermacol glasses... even the wall colour is something to sing about. It must have been painted blue in some other era, but now it has a shade you might not find in any sophisticated painting catalogue.Additionally, a long metal bench is laid out beside the stall, presumably for customers to sit on. One could spend hours on it, gazing at the alley life of passersby — that include timid goats and brazen rats.One day, whenever possible, do drop by Chacha Chaiwale’s. The stall opens daily at 5am. “It closes at 1 am but these days I shut off at 9pm due to the pandemic.”And yes, the chai is tasty. But in a place crammed with so many exquisite details, the quality of the chai frankly doesn’t matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-in-the-dream-world-of-chacha-chaiwale/story-fy2GBZ2etn50qKDdMJiKqN.html

01-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra to get ₹793 crore for pollution control but no clarity on utilisation yet: MPCB||Six cities in Maharashtra with a one million-plus population will receive ₹793 crore for controlling air pollution in 2020-21, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) said. However, according to pollution control body there is no clarity on where and how the funds need to be utilised.Of the ₹793 crore, Mumbai will receive the largest chunk of the allocation – ₹488 crore – among 46 other cities in the country which have more than one million population, followed by Pune (₹134 crore), Nagpur (₹66 crore), Nashik (₹41 crore), while Aurangabad and Vasai-Virar will get ₹32 crore each.During a meeting scheduled on June 12 with the Union environment ministry, the pollution control boards of various states were informed about the disbursement of funds, said VM Motghare, joint director (air quality), MPCB.Also read| Clean air plan for Mumbai: Study raises concerns over accountability“The minutes of the meeting were shared with us on Friday, and we can formally announce that Maharashtra will get ₹793 crore as per the 15th Finance Commission report. However at the moment, there is no clarity on whether the disbursed funds will be linked to the Centre’s Smart Cities and Swachh Bharat Missions. Also, we need more clarity on the utilisation of funds and submission of expenditure statements,” said Motghare.On February 1, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech announced ₹4,400 crore for clean air in cities with a population more than one million. The fund was to be made available to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) to 46 cities in India. Soon after, the finance ministry published a document highlighting individual funds to be disbursed to these cities, with separate fund allocations for Swachh Bharat Mission and air pollution mitigation.In March, the Parliamentary Standing Committee in Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change observed that allocating ₹4,400 crore for air pollution control was more than the entire budget allocation for the entire Union environment ministry (₹3,100 crore) for 2020-21. Responding queries raised by the committee, the environment ministry on March 6 submitted, “The budgetary allocation of ₹4,400 crore through MoHUA, is intended to be a performance-related grant, which would be released to only the million-plus cities, based on the improvements in average annual concentrations of both PM [particulate matter] 10 and PM2.5 (equal weightage of 50%). Such grants would, however, be released only based on the improvements (as calculated in January 2021). Cities shall use the same for taking up activities and measures that would help to bring down the pollution levels further.”Meanwhile, of the ₹460 crore allocated for air pollution control by the finance ministry in 2019-20, Maharashtra was to receive ₹41 crore for 17 non-attainment cities (identified then) under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). This included ₹10 crore funds for two years for four million-plus cities (Mumbai, Pune, Navi Mumbai and Nagpur) and ₹10 lakh each for cities with a population of less than 5 lakh and ₹20 lakh each for those with a population of five to 10 lakh, among other non-attainment cities. Non-attainment cities are those with PM concentration consistently below the national ambient standards.“So far, we received ₹25 crore from the Centre, of which ₹6 crore each has been disbursed to civic bodies of Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune and Navi Mumbai, while the remaining ₹1 crore has been given to the remaining cities. We are yet to receive ₹16 crore from the 2019-20 budget,” said Motghare, adding that city-wise air action plan progress reports were being compiled by MPCB.Clarifying on the matter, SN Tripathi, apex committee member of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) and professor of Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur, said that the environment ministry and MoHUA are looking into the disbursal. “Two central ministries are working on this together. MoHUA will be disbursing the fund because it is focused on urban development for city level pollution abatement plans, but it will be done after evaluation by the Union environment ministry because this pertains to air pollution reduction. The environment ministry will be assessing the air pollution mitigation measures being implemented by each city based on their action plans, and their performance will be communicated to MoHUA, which will be disbursing the funds to individual cities on a quarterly basis. This is expected to happen from January 2021 onwards. The exact methodology of how this will be done is currently being worked out by the two ministries,” said Tripathi.Meanwhile, a senior official from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), who attended the NCAP meeting on June 12, said, “At the moment, all the cities have been asked to focus on their clean air action plans with the existing funds available to them. We are assisting the ministry in submitting the quarterly reports of the progress in these cities which will be further assessed by them, and the funds will be provided to urban local bodies, municipal corporations and other state departments engaged in improving air quality in these non-attainment cities.”“To ensure that blue skies become permanent, cities should be certain of their short, medium and long-term air pollution reduction goals. State and municipal budgets also need to reflect planned expenditure on air pollution mitigation,” said Tanushree Ganguly, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-get-793-crore-for-pollution-control-but-no-clarity-on-utilisation-yet-mpcb/story-DM03FcW23lZ27VSNExu32K.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Clean air plan for Mumbai: Study raises concerns over accountability||A latest study by think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and air pollution research group Urban Emissions has revealed that the mitigation actions entrusted on multiple state agencies to improve the city’s air quality could fragment accountability.The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board’s (MPCB’s) clean air action plan for Mumbai lists 58 measures across 16 different agencies. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been accounted for 41% of the activities, while 22% accountability lies with the transport department and the state’s pollution control regulatory body is in-charge of only 20% mitigation actions. The remaining responsibilities have been delineated to the district administrations and urban local bodies.“Mumbai’s action plan contains information on sources and lists financial requirements for implementations. However, the plan fails to highlight any measures to ensure regional coordination, even though independent estimates suggest that close to a third of the city’s air pollution originates outside city limits,” said Kurinji Selvaraj, research analyst, CEEW.However, MPCB chairman Sudhir Srivastava said this was not the case.“Accountability will not be an issue as action plan monitoring committees have been formed for every non-attainment city, which is headed by the municipal commissioner and municipal council head. Committee members include representatives from state agencies. Monthly meetings will help take stock of actions by different stakeholders.”The Centre’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) seeks to reduce particulate matter (PM) concentration by 20-30% by 2024. It identified 18 of 122 non-attainment cities from Maharashtra, the highest across India. Non-attainment cities are those with PM concentration consistently below the national ambient standards. The CEEW-Urban Emissions analysis approved action plans by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for elements responsibility delineation and cost-effectiveness of action plans, among other measures for each city.The analysis charted out the key components missing from the state’s air action plans, such as none of the 17 approved plans have a legal mandate for implementation, 65% plans had not outlined financial requirements for actions proposed, 70% plans do not include crucial information on air pollution sources and there is no regional coordination mechanism.Researchers identified key efforts that could help refine action plans and improve accountability.“Scaling up air pollution monitors, outlining specific tasks for each action point among agencies, fixing sector-wise emission reduction targets and developing a protocol for reporting progress could help meet the rising democratic demand for clean air in Maharashtra,” said Sarath Guttikunda, founder, Urban Emissions.Srivastava said agencies needed to separately chip in (with resources and funds) for their respective duties assigned as per the plan.“Dust suppression measures, treatment of construction and demolition waste, open burning of solid waste are all the responsibilities of civic bodies. Traffic management and pollution under control (PUC) checks are looked after by the transport department. Reduction in industrial pollution is MPCB’s outlook. Thus, well-defined targets for each agency will enhance accountability,” he said.CPCB has published the plans of all non-attainment cities in the state except Thane, the study said.“The action plan for Thane is ready, and will be sent to the CPCB for approval soon,” said VM Motghare, joint director (air quality), MPCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/clean-air-plan-for-mumbai-study-raises-concerns-over-accountability/story-xhD1wEBy95rGFWgj2xhZYO.html

They claimed that they have been working on low salaries from the past few years. However, the All India Labourers Employees Union later postponed the protest on the request of the civic body.Konark Desai, chairman, All India Labourers Employees Union, Maharashtra, said, “In such difficult times, health workers are supporting citizens relentlessly. They need to be supported with proper pay at least. Around 275 health workers associated with the corporation have been demanding a rise in their salary since the past few years but the corporation has been ignoring it.”The corporation assured the employees that soon they will get the desired hike. “We shall resolve the issue within the next few days,” said an officer from the KDMC. Following the assurance, the health workers said they will wait for 20 more days. “After 20 days, if there is no response from the civic body, we shall continue our protest and stop our work. We have been working on shifts endlessly, especially after the Covid-19 outbreak. We are only asking for what we deserve,” said a nurse from Dombivli, who participated in the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmc-health-workers-protest-demand-salary-hike/story-HkzrCkaMXXW4PUjgHWawhP.html

The spot is a popular attraction owing to its waterfalls and scenic mountains.“Till now 63 people have been booked since June 19 under sections 144 and 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for disobedience and unlawful assembly,” said senior inspector Suhas Kharmate from Tokawade police station.The Thane district collector on June 19 had issued a circular, prohibiting entry to all monsoon picnic spots, including waterfalls, trekking points and dams, across the district. The collector had imposed section 144 as well as section 34 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, prohibiting citizens from going anywhere along the 1-km perimeter of waterfalls, trekking spots, rivers, lakes, dams and picnic spots in Thane district. The collector stated that it is impossible to maintain social distancing at such places points and visiting them will increase the spread of Covid-19.Places near Malshej Ghat, such as Pimpalgaon Joga Dam, Harishchandragad, Ajoba Hill Fort and Naneghat, all are closed and even locals are not allowed to visit these spots.Kharmate said, “After the government declared the lockdown, villagers from areas near the ghat have been abiding by the lockdown norms and none of them ventured out unless there has been an emergency. However, many others from across the city failed to abide by the lockdown norms and visited the spot for picnic. We have seen people visitors regularly here since Cyclone Nisarga made a landfall this month.”He claimed that visitors come in private vehicles and there are around seven-eight passengers in one car, violating all social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/63-booked-since-june-19-for-visiting-malshej-ghat-near-thane-during-lockdown/story-5Dsaij1FwkTxnYtfgoGXVL.html

Food packets are being provided to many citizens by the civic body in the city, owing to the lockdown in the city. BJP group leader Prabhakar Shinde on Tuesday said, “On the pretext of coronavirus, there is corruption prevailing in the BMC. On Monday, without calling for tenders, a contract of ₹63 crore to provide food to the needy was invited via an e-quotation. My question is how will this benefit if there is no competitive bidding done?” he said. Replying to Shinde’s allegation, the BMC said that the contract for the distribution of food packets to the needy every morning and evening has been cancelled through e-quotation and now it will be called through e-tenders and open tenders through website. “The process of registering the participation in the e-tender process for the distribution of around 1 lakh 95 thousand food parcels every day will start from July 3 and the process is expected to be completed by July 15,” said the BMC said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-buy-food-packets-via-e-tendering-says-mumbai-civic-corporation/story-tLzsBuZpIaWl7wUVMwp0rL.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: NIOS cancels Class 12 exams for students with special needs||The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) on Tuesday announced that students with special needs who have registered for the Senior Secondary Examination (Class 12 equivalent) under the board will be exempted from giving the tests, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. The exams are scheduled to be held between July 17 and August 13.“Senior secondary special need NIOS learners registered for the March 2020 public examinations shall now be examined by the way of project work/ question-answer based assessment instead of appearing for the examination,” stated a circular released by the board on Tuesday. As per the circular, students would have to submit assignments for at least two modules of 40 marks each, which is a mandatory theory component for the examinations. The board has however, not given any clarity on the status of exams of students with special needs writing their secondary (Class 10) board exams which are held during the same time. The board will give details on the evaluation scheme at a later date. The announcement came after several parents and schools requested the board to either postpone or cancel the board exams. With the ongoing pandemic, parents were finding it difficult to find writers for such students and had said that travelling to exam centres would be too risky for the students. Geetha Sequeira, an assistant teacher at Childreach, a school that exclusively caters to children with special needs said that the circular lacks clarity and will add to the students’ stress. “To begin with, there is no mention of Class 10 students, leaving them in the lurch. Even for Class 12 students, submitting projects and assignments at a time like this is going to be stressful. Many students are planning to write some papers in the October exams and are busy preparing for that. This will be an additional burden for them,” she added. “We are not happy with the decision. At a time when several boards have cancelled exams, NIOS should not put such pressure on our kids. Many are slow learners or have learning difficulties. They cannot prepare the projects and study for the October exam at the same time,” said a parent from Andheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nios-cancels-class-12-exams-for-students-with-special-needs/story-1xE2qod44LaBAk3GzaP15K.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks report from Maharashtra government on purported police brutality during lockdown||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the state government to submit a report disclosing the status of the investigation into police brutality in enforcing the Covid-19 lockdown in the city. The report is expected to shed light on the death of two persons, who allegedly died following excessive use of force by police personnel.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice NJ Jamadar was responding to a petition by advocate Firdause Irani, based on his complaint that he, his wife, and two sons were beaten by local police personnel and civic officials outside his residence at Goregaon (West).The bench has asked assistant government pleader Jyoti Chavan that the report should also reveal the status of the investigation into Irani’s complaint.In his petition, Irani, a lawyer and human rights activist said that on the evening of April 16, when he returned to his residence along with his wife, a masked man in plain clothes, charged at them with a lathi. A verbal altercation ensued after he abused the lawyer and his wife.The petition added that other police personnel and civic staff reached the spot, by which point Irani’s two sons also arrived and pointed out that their parents had not committed any violation. Irani claimed that the police officers then started raining lathi blows on him and his family.He said that during the past two months, several Mumbai residents have been targeted with impunity by errant police personnel, and no action has been taken. He pointed out a report by a human rights organisation claiming that 15 persons died across the country due to police excesses during the lockdown, of which two cases were from Mumbai.One of them, according to the report, was Raju Velu Devendra, whose family alleges that on March 30, when they were going to their relative’s residence, a police team chased them and caught the deceased. The policemen reportedly informed the relatives that they were taking Devendra to Juhu police station. In the morning, police informed the family that Devendra was found lying at Nehru Nagar Chowk and when he was taken to a hospital, he was declared dead on arrival.Police, however, maintain that the 22-year-old was badly beaten by locals when he was caught attempting to commit a robbery. A case has been registered against eight persons in this regard.In the second case mentioned in the human rights report, on April 18, when Sagir Jamal Khan, a labourer, returned home, he informed his roommate that while he was pushing a handcart to deliver a refrigerator in Null Bazaar, police caught him and beat him on his head, hands and back. Later, while having dinner, Khan collapsed and was declared dead on arrival when he was taken to a hospital.However, a police officer claimed that Khan’s medical reports revealed that he died due to enlargement of the heart, and there was no external or internal injury on his body.HC has now posted the petition for further hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-seeks-report-from-maharashtra-government-on-purported-police-brutality-during-lockdown/story-cS0bsznuLQR4xqHngNXkyM.html

01-07-2020||City||60-year-old Thane man faces 24-hour ordeal after testing positive to get bed||Thane: Twenty-four hours after a the family of a 60-year-old Mumbra patient struggled to get him admitted to a Covid facility in Thane, the man was finally given a bed at Kopar Khairane in Navi Mumbai on Tuesday afternoon. The patient developed fever on Friday, following which he was admitted to a private hospital in Mumbra. When he started developing difficulties in breathing, the hospital conducted a swab test and on Monday afternoon, his report came positive for the virus. As the hospital he was admitted to was not a Covid facility, the family looked to shift him. However, they were unable to find him a bed in any of the facilities within Thane city. Later, a private hospital in Thane agreed to admit him, but demanded a deposit of ₹75,000, despite the fact that the family applied under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, meant for poor patients.“While most of the facilities did not have vacant beds, a private hospital, where beds were available, asked for a deposit of ₹75,000 prior to admission. The patient is retired, while his other two sons works as an autorickshaw driver and welder. The family lost their source of livelihood during the lockdown and could not afford paying such a hefty amount. Under the scheme, they should not have been charged such a huge amount,” said a friend of the patient.The family then consulted Dr Alfarooq Raut, a general physician from Mumbra, over the issue. “After the family contacted me, we reached out to the civic corporation through social media but only responded by saying that they will look into it. Although the patient does not have any comorbidity, he is a senior citizen who developed breathing difficulties and thus he should have provided with timely treatment. As the man was kept at a non-Covid hospital for long owing to lack of beds in Covid facilities, the health of other patients was also compromised,” said Dr Raut.The family then kept inquiring about availability of beds at Covid facilities across Thane, Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, following which the man was admitted to the Kopar Khairane hospital.The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) claimed it will inquire into the incident.“We have alerted hospitals to not charge hefty amounts and have also put up rate cards for the convenience of the locals. We shall inquire into this incident at the earliest,” said a health officer from Thane Municipal Corporation’s health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/60-year-old-thane-man-faces-24-hour-ordeal-after-testing-positive-for-covid-to-get-bed/story-p3WEasKSKmtd5LrP9RzdMO.html

The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), too, announced a complete lockdown in the twin cities during the same period.Grocery and medical stores, single vegetable stalls and milk vendors are allowed to operate during the 10 day-lockdown. Stepping out for morning walks and exercises are also not permitted. The corporation warned of action against those who violate the norms.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), said, “The city will be under complete lockdown from Thursday 7am till 7am on July 12, as per the orders issued by civic commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma. Only essential services will be allowed during these 10 days, and all non-essential shops will have to remain closed. No movement of private vehicles will be allowed unless it is for emergency purposes. Public transport services will also be suspended. People will have to remain at home, no one will be allowed to leave house without emergency reasons.”The TMC notification stated that if residents who are asked to remain in home quarantine venture out, they will be “forcefully sent to quarantine centres”. “More than five people cannot gather at any essential shop for buying essential goods, or else action will be taken,” the notification said.The decision to impose a complete lockdown in the city was pending since May 27, with the police and municipal corporation creating confusion among the residents owing to the uncertainty over the decision. On Monday, the police tweeted that there will be a complete lockdown, but hours later, after discussions with the civic body, it was decided to not implement the lockdown.Meanwhile in neighbouring Kalyan and Dombivli, a lockdown was announced last week in containment zones. However, with more than 300 cases reported since the past few days, the corporation decided to implement a complete lockdown. Madhavi Pophale, public relations officer, KDMC, said, “From Thursday, only essential services will be allowed in the city. The officials and ward officers concerned have to ensure that there are provisions for home delivery in all areas. Grocery and vegetable stores will be open only from 9am to 5pm, while dairy shops can operate from 5am till 10am.”What’s permitted and what’s notThe internal roads under TMC and KDMC’s jurisdictions will be closed and the police will patrol all the important points of the city.Big vegetable markets, all non-essential shops, commercial establishments, firms and workshops will remain closed.Morning and evening walks will not be allowed and the corporations asked residents to remain at homes.

01-07-2020||City||3 wards in Mumbai with most civic plaints have most containment zones||Three of the five wards that have the highest number of containment zones in Mumbai also had most complaints related to poor civic management such as water shortage, bad state of public toilets, overflowing drains and irregular collection of garbage between January and December 2019, according to NGO Praja’s report released on Tuesday. These wards are L (Kurla), M-East (Govandi) and S (Bhandup). The spokesperson of BMC said they do not want to comment on the report.The NGO claimed this points towards a correlation between civic issues not being resolved (poor maintenance and hygiene in the area) and outbreak of a pandemic. Following the three wards are K-West ward covering Andheri West, Oshiwara and R-South ward covering Kandivli.The report reveals that only 18% of public and community toilets in the five wards were connected to the sewer system, compared to 33% in rest of the wards. Also, one-third of total complaints of overflowing or choked drains and garbage not collected and one-fourth of the total toilet-related complaints were from these five wards. The NGO claims that as of June 24, the five wards had 8,930 complaints in 2019 relating to shortage of water supply, toilets, choked drainage and garbage collection against 22,760 similar complaints in the rest of the city. Nitai Mehta, founder trustee, Praja Foundation in the report, said, “While the entire world is grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) have gained immense importance in prevention of the disease. It is unfortunate that provision of water supply, proper sanitation and solid waste management (SWM), which are key determinants of health and also the most basic services, are brought to importance only at the time of a crisis. This is not just about the pandemic. A high number of infections and deaths are regularly reported due to water contamination, poor sanitation and mismanaged waste.”Mehta said, “For example, the water quality tests of BMC showed 1% unfit water samples in 2018-2019, but there were 1,03,509 reported cases of diarrhoea, 21 cases of cholera, and 4,280 cases of typhoid in the same period. These services are therefore the most basic requirements for good health and good quality of life.”Further, the number of civic complaints has increased from 92,329 in 2017, 1.16 lakh in 2018 to 1.28 lakh in 2019. The percentage of complaints closed has increased to 96% in 2019, compared to 83% in 2018 and 77% in 2017. Roads, drainage, water supply and solid waste management continue to remain the top four complaints, it states.Yogesh Desai, a civic activist from Andheri, said, “There might be an improvement in closing the number of complaints, but we also need to know how many complainants were satisfied with it.”The report claims that the BMC launched a 24x7 water supply project in 2014, but the average time for which water supply was received in 2018 was only 5.9 hours. Of the 273 zones, 180 zones (66%) received only upto 4 hours. In terms of public toilets the report states, “Only 1 in 4 public toilets were for women in 2018. There is currently 1 public toilet seat per 696 males and 1,769 females, while the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) prescribes 1 toilet for 100-400 males and 100-200 females, respectively. Results of BMC’s toilet survey in 2015 show only 28% of toilets were connected to the piped sewerage system, 78% had no proper information of water connection available, and 58% of the toilet blocks surveyed had no electricity.”In this context, the report further adds, “BMC claims 100 % door-to-door collection of waste as on 2018-19. However, of the total 17,116 solid waste management complaints in 2019, 36% were related to garbage not being collected. While BMC citizens’ charter prescribes 1 day to solve issues of garbage collection of garbage, it took 17 days on an average to solve complaints of garbage lifting, 20 days for unattended collection points and 22 days for garbage vehicles not arrived.”The report further states that in 2018-19, only 28% of the capital budget of the water and sewerage department was spent, while the solid waste management department spent only 23% of its capital budget. In 2019, attendance of corporators in ward committee meetings was 73% compared to 79% in 2018. A total of 952 questions were raised in 2019, compared to 1,046 in 2018, states the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-wards-in-mumbai-with-most-civic-plaints-have-most-containment-zones/story-xS7OvNYob4gTyry5Q0ajCL.html

Police said the woman’s 55-year-old son was admitted to a hospital a week ago, leaving her alone. Officials said the woman was a patient of acute diabetes. Her second son lived separately and has been bedridden for the past two-three months, police said. Senior officers said the woman is suspected to have died of natural causes. Autopsy details are awaited.According to the police, they were alerted about a foul smell coming from the house on Sunday. “A team reached the house on the second floor of a building and found that the door was locked from inside. Our officers broke open the door and found the body of the woman lying on a sofa. She was identified as an 80-year-old woman who lived with her son,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/80-year-old-woman-found-dead-in-south-delhi-s-malviya-nagar/story-9lEAHhTEb86XXDbIBoBhkJ.html
01-07-2020||Pune||Street lights to be installed in ghat section of Pune-Mumbai expressway||In a bid to reduce the number of accidents on the Pune-Mumbai expressway and upgrade its safety arrangements, the Maharashtra Highway Police (MHP) department along with the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) will install ‘street lights’ in the ghat section.The expressway witnessed 306 accidents in 2019 (including fatal, serious and minor injuries) along with 138 mishaps which did not result in injuries. Till May this year, the expressway had recorded 46 accidents (including fatal, serious and minor injuries) along with 12 mishaps which did not result in injuries. The reduced number of mishaps has also been attributed to the decreased vehicle movement on the expressway due to the lockdown in March, April and May, according to officials.This will be the first time when street lights will be installed on the expressway for better visibility at night, according to officials. The decision comes after MSRDC recently conducted survey wherein officials recorded that lower visibility increased the risk of road mishaps there. Vijay Patil, superintendent of police, Maharashtra Highway Police, said, “Monsoon brings heavy rains to the ghat section on the expressway and hence, we conducted a pre-monsoon survey with the help of MSRDC. Street lights will be installed along the entire ghat section of the expressway for better visibility in the region. The estimated cost of the project is ~ 7.5 crore. Street lights are being installed on the expressway for the first time. In the ghat section, tunnel work will continue simultaneously, but it will take another two years to complete and we want to reduce the number of accidents in the coming two years.” According to the state highway police and MSRDC, if things go according to plan, the actual work of installing the street lights is likely to start in the next couple of months.While the entire ghat section is 18km long, lights will be installed on the 10km stretch between Khandala and Khopoli. The Pune-Mumbai expressway, officially named as the Yashwantrao Chavan Expressway, has been operational since 2002. It is the country’s first six-lane concrete high-speed highway with a total of 94.5km joining Pune and Mumbai. Maximum fatal accidents have been reported on the expressway in 2016, in which 151 people died. “In our study of accident patterns in the ghat section, it was revealed that most of the accidents happen when vehicles ram into the motorist in front of them. One of the reasons behind this could be that the driver had not been able to judge the exact distance between the vehicles and hence, street lights can provide good visibility to them,” he added.In 2019, there were 22 fatal accidents in the ghat section of the expressway, starting from km 45 to km 36 which is a slope in the ghats, according to Patil. To prevent further accidents, MSRDC has on a trial basis installed blinkers, reflectors and rumbler strips on a one kilometre patch in the ghat section. This, according to officials, offered positive results as there had been no accidents in the same patch in the past six months.Vipul Alekar, a businessman and regular commuter between Pune and Mumbai, said, “I frequently travel to Mumbai from Pune for my business meetings and in the ghat section it is really risky to drive, specially at night. In the rainy season, we cannot see the vehicles in front of us and if street lights are installed, there will be more visibility.”Tanmay Pendse, an activist working for the safety of commuters using the expressway, said, “It is a very positive decision for the safety of travellers using the e-way. But it should have been done earlier and is a decision too late, according to me. There is always a visibility issue during the monsoon which leads to accidents, now after installing the lights, it will help drivers see clearly and judge the distance between vehicles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/street-lights-to-be-installed-in-ghat-section-of-pune-mumbai-expressway/story-6zB5QygCjvc7vrPW3XQaEO.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Congress minister hits back at Sharad Pawar over comments about 1962 war||Congress leader and energy minister in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, Nitin Raut, has reignited the political controversy around Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s statement reminding the Congress of the 1962 war with China while advising against politicising issues concerning national security.On Saturday, Pawar had said, “We can’t forget what had happened in 1962 when China occupied 45,000 square kilometres of India’s territory. While making these allegations, one should also look at what had happened in the past. This is an issue of national interest and once should not bring in politics here.”Pawar’s comments came in response to a question about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s charge that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had surrendered Indian territory to the Chinese aggression. The Congress party, led by its former president, has been taking jibes at the Centre since the June 15 violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.Raut hit back at Pawar, saying the latter should have “rectified the mistakes [done in 1962] when he was defence minister”. “Our leader Rahul Gandhiji has been speaking in the interest of the nation and asking the questions that are in the minds of people. Pawarsaheb was a Congress leader when he was defence minister of the country. As a political leader, he has been nurtured in Congress. NCP is part of the UPA-led by Congress and should not deviate from the stand taken by the alliance. He should support the stand taken by Rahul Gandhi,” Raut said. Raut said Pawar should have advised Modi to speak on the issue. “The situation in 1962 was different. After Krishna Menon resigned as defence minister, Yashwantrao Chavan took over as the defence minister. Pawar should also speak about the 1971 war against Pakistan and the victory under the leadership of Indira Gandhi and YB Chavan, who Pawarsaheb looks up to as a mentor,” said Raut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-minister-hits-back-at-sharad-pawar-over-comments-about-1962-war/story-smgKKx6a2v7AX10duXZygM.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Menstrual cycle, stigma: Women doctors face other challenges in Covid fight||Working for six hours straight donning personal protective equipment (PPE) inside a Covid-19 ward is tough, especially for women doctors during their monthly menstrual cycle. The social discrimination that they face makes it worse, said most doctors HT spoke to ahead of the World Doctor’s Day (July 1).Dr Reshma Shinde, a resident doctor in pathology department at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel, said even as they are being honoured as Covid warriors, she is experiencing stigma that is attached to the highly contagious infection. In an open letter, Shinde wrote, “Though my house was blessed with praises for my work, marriage proposals had stopped knocking my house doors. It took me no time to realise, that, it was due to the stigma associated with the word ‘COVID’. I started feeling very low as I could only see my dreams of marriage getting shattered (sic).”Shinde told HT, “That’s the mentality of the society. We are being stigmatised for saving lives of patients.”Another 28-year-old resident doctor who is on duty at SevenHills hospital also had a similar experience. “The groom’s family approached my father through a matrimonial website in February. We started chatting and everything was going fine until April, when I was put on Covid-19 duty,” she said. “He started to pressure me to stop going to the hospital, which I couldn’t as it is my responsibility. In May, they cancelled the marriage proposal.”“During periods, we lose additional water and blood, which makes us weak and dehydrated. In safety suits for six hours, we can’t even afford to go to the bathroom to change sanitary napkins. Then come the cramps that burn us out,” said Dr Shinde.Dr Sudeshna Salvi from the Grant Medical College, which is also known as JJ Hospital, said how once she had forgotten her date of menstrual cycle and started bleeding in her PPE suit. “I had no option as I was on my duty and I couldn’t open my PPE which could have been too risky. I spent six hours standing as I couldn’t sit,” she said.Dr Gautam Bhansali, in-charge of private Covid-19 hospitals in Mumbai, said women doctors have been working braving all odds. “If any woman doctor wants to postpone the duty dates around their menstrual cycle, we do it immediately. It takes a toll on the woman to work for hours wearing PPE during that time of the month. But hats off to them, for they always work with full devotion and enthusiasm,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/menstrual-cycle-stigma-women-doctors-face-other-challenges-in-covid-fight/story-X7aSGikCurIfxqGyEpYz5L.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Discrimination irks private doctors||Dr Zabir Hussain, 51, a general physician from Chembur, who also worked with government ambulance service (108) for Covid-19 patients at night, died on May 23. The sole breadwinner is survived by his wife and three teenaged children. While the family so far managed the household with Hussain’s salary of ₹27,000 for May, they now plan to return to their hometown in Uttar Pradesh.“My father had to feed four mouths, which left him with no savings. My mother can’t work as she is illiterate. We have therefore decided to go back to our hometown,” said Adil, his 17-year-old son. Like Hussain, 17 other private physicians have succumbed to Covid-19 infection in Maharashtra since the outbreak in March, according to data available with the Indian Medical Association (IMA). Additionally, 180 doctors have been diagnosed with Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19, and more than 1,500 physicians have been quarantined all across the state.Members of IMA said their records do not reflect the real picture owing to poor collection of data, and the actual numbers are likely to be higher than what exists on paper.As gatekeepers in screening Covid-19 patients, the state, under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, had directed private physicians to keep their clinics open. Doctors said, in addition to not providing them with personal protective equipment (PPE) despite being highly susceptible to the infection, the state government has not included private practitioners under Covid-19 insurance cover of ₹50 lakh. On the eve of National Doctors’ Day, the Maharashtra chapter of IMA in an open letter stated that their decision to observe - and not celebrate - July 1 as ‘Atma-Samman Divas’ as protest against what they describe as discrimination meted out towards private doctors.Doctors said the credit for patients’ recovery goes to the medical fraternity, especially doctors, who work round-the-clock, despite various occupational hazards. Till Monday, 1,69,883 people tested positive for Covid-19, of which 88,960 patients have recovered. .“The government declared insurance of ₹50 lakh for every healthcare worker. Later on the policemen were included...but the private doctors’ plea of the similar insurance was ignored. Even the doctors were ready to pay the premium amount for this insurance, at the same rate by which the government will pay the premium of these healthcare workers,” reads the open letter sent by IMA on June 30. The association has also demanded to honour the deceased doctors posthumously on Independence Day. Most families of physicians who died of Covid-19 infection that HT spoke to criticised the state for ignoring their plight. The kin of Dr Mithkesh Rampal Singh said they are not covered under Covid-19 insurance although the general physician contracted the infection on duty and died on June 8. “While treating an asymptomatic patient in a hospital, he got exposed to the virus. In this backdrop, he should get insurance,” said Dr Vimal Singh, brother of the deceased doctor. “My brother was living with his wife in a rented flat. The insurance money could have secured his wife’s life to some extent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/discrimination-irks-private-doctors/story-deYznc7RKc4urCHNwgmpiJ.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||State’s annual fish catch in 2019 was the lowest in 45 years: CMFRI||The state witnessed its lowest annual fish catch in 45 years in 2019 at 2.01 lakh tons, with a rapid decline in all major fish species being caught, the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) said.The environmental factors such as extreme weather events (heavy rain), five tropical cyclones, weather depressions in the Arabian Sea, and juvenile overfishing are said to be the reasons for 36% drop in a number of fishing days in 2019.“Due to extended rainfall beyond monsoon and extreme weather events including cyclones, total fishing hours along the Maharashtra coast reduced drastically, especially between August and December as compared to rest of the year,” said Anulekshmi Chellappan, scientist-in-charge, CMFRI Mumbai. “Owing to low fish catch many fishers did not venture into the sea at all, due to non-profitable operations. Combined with this, over-exploitation of fish stocks due to high juvenile by-catch, which continued unabated similar to previous years, further worsened fish landing numbers,” said Chellapan.The institute released its report on the Annual Marine Fish Landings in India for 2019 on Tuesday that identified a 32% decline from 2018 (2.95 lakh tons) for Maharashtra. In 2017 it was 3.81 lakh tons and 2.92 lakh tons in 2016. However, prior to 2019, the historical trend indicated a similar situation in 1974 when fish catch dropped to 1.8 lakh tons.Experts said CMFRI may be accurate. “The number of 2019 Arabian Sea cyclones were unusually high equalling a 117-year-old record. Rising sea surface temperatures may affect fish forcing them to migrate to cooler waters. However, in the process, changing habitats may not be favourable for growth or reproduction leading to mortality,” said Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. “A climate change link is there, but we need to monitor this carefully.”Maharashtra was identified as one of the leading states for post-harvest fish losses by CMFRI with a considerable reduction in fish quality (including those sold in the markets). “Whatever brought from the sea is a national resource and it cannot be allowed to be simply wasted. Its national food waste,” said Chellappan.Among major fish species, a 97% reduction was recorded for halibuts (fat fish), 84% decline for mullets, 82% reduction for sardines, 84% for perches, 81% for snappers, 34% drop for Indian mackerel, 45% decline for croakers, and an 86% drop for octopus, squid catch and 70% reduction for lobsters. Bombay duck was the third most landed species in 2019, though there was a slight decline (0.8%) compared to 2018, after non-penaeid and penaeid prawns that accounted for 30% of the total catch. Maharashtra contributed 5.6% of the country’s fish resources to the nation. The state ranked seventh among 10 coastal states and union territories while Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Kerala led the top rankings. Mumbai was the major contributor of fish catch for the state accounting for 40%. Of the tally of fishing boats in the state, 87.4% are mechanised, 12.4% motorised, and 0.2% non-motorised.The state fisheries department said they were concerned about the findings. “Climate change impacts are affecting the fisheries sector, and this will increase in the coming days. However, we have taken all steps to curb overfishing by issuing advisories to avoid catching juveniles and reducing harmful fishing practices as much as possible. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, the marine fish landings for 2020 are expected to be much worse,” said Rajendra Jadhav, joint commissioner (fisheries).CMFRI, however, estimated higher value of fish landings in 2019. Figures stood at ₹6,402 crore at landing centres, which accounted for 10.5% of the country’s overall tally (₹60,881 crore) against 2018’s estimate of ₹5,771 crore. At retail centres, the estimate was ₹9.835 crore in 2019 (accounting for 10.6% of overall India’s estimate at ₹92,356 crore). In 2017, the estimate at retail centres was ₹8,510 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-s-annual-fish-catch-in-2019-was-the-lowest-in-45-years-cmfri/story-0o7eD8epNJNm1NJeFlwF3K.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Less than 10% industries in Maharashtra operational after government opened up sector||Less than 10% of 7.34 lakh industrial units have resumed operations in Maharashtra after the state government opened up the sector from lockdown restrictions on April 20. The government had set a target of resumption of 60% of the industrial units, weeks after they were allowed to be operational. Industry stakeholders said that economic slowdown, disruption in the supply chain, and lesser demand are the reasons for this low response. After Maharashtra opened up the industrial sector, 63,891 of total 7.34 lakh industrial units that were functioning before the lockdown was announced in March, have resumed operations. Of them, 62, 490 (of 7.31 lakh) are micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and 1,401 (of 2,625) are large scale industries. 15.57 lakh employees have reported back to work, though many units are running at only 40-50% of their total capacity.As per data released by the industries department, of the 2.04 lakh industries operational before lockdown in Konkan division, 30,843 units have restarted production. In Pune, 13,458 of 3,55,255 units, 14,148 of 56,358 units in Nashik, and 5,442 of 1,06,952 units in Aurangabad have been operational till Monday. “It is true that we did not get the expected response, naturally because we are going through very challenging times. We have stricter restrictions in 19 municipal corporations that are in red zones. Entry of employees to these zones or from them is restricted. Industries are facing a phasing problem of the supply of raw material or some of the components that are supplied from restricted areas. We were expecting more relaxations in the near future, but the surge in cases in some parts may see their deferment,” said industries minister Subhash Desai.An official from the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) said that though the percentage of industries becoming operational is less in the organised sector, it is more than 50% in the unorganised sector among small and micro industries. Aurangabad-based industrialist Ram Bhogale said, “The units have been running at 40-50%of the workforce and much lesser production than their capacity. But we have been able to recover at least half of the recurring cost, though profit is out of the question in such a situation. The industries are facing many challenges; one of them is a disruption in raw material supply. Some industrial areas that are in the vicinity of containment zones are not allowed to open, but many industries in areas like Walunj are operational.”Industrialists say that the reverse migration of migrants has so far not affected industries as they are not running at full capacity. They also pointed out that the economic slowdown has resulted in low demand for their products.“Industries are also finding it difficult to comply with the government conditions like making arrangements for transportation and stay for employees. We also fear that with the rising number of cases, the situation in the industrial sector may take some more time to normalise,” said Santosh Mandlecha, president, Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/less-than-10-industries-in-maharashtra-operational-after-government-opened-up-sector/story-mlrDOEgjxovgUpvu9GSvDM.html

Govilkar submitted that the sangh had written to the Pune divisional commissioner seeking permission for the procession on May 28, however, as the application was not responded to, the sangh had approached the HC.The petition stated that the devotees were willing to maintain physical distance and follow other guidelines, including providing the list of devotees who would accompany the palkhi along with their Covid-19 test results.In light of these submissions, the plea sought directions to the authorities to allow 100 devotees of the sangh to undertake the procession and also allow devotees to take a holy dip in the Chandrabhaga river on July 1 morning, to perform Nagar Pradakshina and other rituals for Ashadhi Ekadashi.After hearing the submissions and perusing the details of the authorities concerned, regarding preparations for the festival, the bench held that the decision of the mandir committee and local authorities would suffice, and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-permission-for-procession-to-lord-vitthal-temple-on-ashadi-ekadashi/story-CVGYySXf681CQ1SuYtpeEN.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||‘50% of eateries will not be able to resume; need government relief’||More than 50% of the city’s hotels and restaurants may be forced to close if they don’t get immediate relief from the government, according to the Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) and Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR).Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, president of HRAWI, described the industry as “unsustainable” because of shrinking demand combined with costs ranging from licensing fees to staff salaries and rent. “Our assessment is that 50% of the restaurants will be unable to open their establishments,” he said. HRAWI has demanded relief in terms of reduction in both property tax as well as electricity bills.President of AHAR, Shivanand Shetty, agreed with Kohli’s assessment. “The current take-away business is hardly giving us any income. More than 80% of our staff are migrants and we cannot open if they don’t come back,” said Shetty.On Monday, the state government announced that hoteliers pay 50% of the annual liquor licensing, which was raised from ₹6.93 lakh to to ₹7.96 lakh this year, by September-end and the remainder by the end of the year. “The government has always been lenient and hence, we decided to give more time to hoteliers,” said excise commissioner Kantilal Umap.However, Shetty said the hike in licensing fees posed difficulties for establishments. “Our hoteliers are paying rents and salaries to staff during the lockdown. They cannot survive with additional expenses,” said Shetty, pointing out that the earnings of eateries would reduce once they open, because of distancing requirements.Satish Nayak, who owns A Rama Nayak’s Udupi Srikrishna Boarding, said implementing distancing norms will cut down his earnings sharply. “We can serve 79 patrons at a time. With distancing norms, we will not be able to serve more than 25 at a time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/50-of-eateries-will-not-be-able-to-resume-need-government-relief/story-eDmOHfChstZuI6iR8lLSNJ.html

The decision was taken to curtail dropout rates post-lockdown.Of the 114 government schools, there are over 70 government high schools and senior secondary schools in Chandigarh. As per estimates, the overall cost of the waiver would come to around ₹4 to ₹5 crore.As per sources, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore will take the final call on the proposal. The developments were confirmed by UT director of school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, who said the file awaits approval from the competent authority.No fee waiver for Classes 11 and 12However, it is to be noted that only fees of Classes 9 and 10 are being considered for waiver, whereas students of Class 11 and 12 will have to pay fees. Only students up till Class 8 do not have to pay fees as mandated under the Right to Education Act, 2009, which makes it the responsibility of the state to provide compulsory and free education for students till the age of 16.Alka Mehta, district education officer, said, “We have noticed a high dropout rate after students have go from Class 8 to 9, as they have to pay fees. However, that is not the case in Class 11 where many students of private school also take admission in government schools.”Students are charged fees under various heads, also called funds. A senior official of UT education department said they are considering whether they should waive off fees completely or of certain funds. Even partial waive off will cost the department between ₹2 to ₹3 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-education-department-mulls-fee-waiver-for-students-of-classes-9-and-10-of-govt-schools/story-x325c4Wb5h2C7bcgsvq68O.html
01-07-2020||Delhi||Things were tough in early June, now there is stability, says Manish Sisodia||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds temporary charge of the state health ministry, spoke to HT about where Delhi stands in the Covid-19 fight, working with the Centre on formulating strategies, ramping up testing, the positivity rate, community transmission, home isolation, and the state’s finances, among other issues. Edited excerpts:Click here for full Covid-19 coverageRight now, we are in a comfortable situation. If you ask me about the peak, the time between June 8 and June 15, or rather the first two weeks of June, were a bit hard. We have seen stability after that.Earlier, when we were testing 5,000-6,000 people, about 2,000 were testing positive. Now, we are doing anywhere between 17,000 and 22,000 tests, and 3,000 are testing positive. This means there is stability in the number of cases.If we look at the number of beds, the peak need was 6,200 beds. Now, it is close to 5,800-5,900—this shows that there is stability in the number of beds needed. Deaths are also under control; not a huge spike.Considering the character of this virus and what we are seeing across the globe, it will be wrong if I conclude that we will no longer see those jerks or spikes again. This phase, which I am calling a stable one, might be temporary phase, which is why surveillance and surveys, which are currently happening in the city, are very important.What I said back then was the ground reality of the time. Now, whether the decision to share the projection of Covid cases with the public was right or wrong is very subjective. My viewpoint is that by throwing the numbers out in the open, a sense of urgency came in all of us, including the Centre. It is because of that alert that all stakeholders, including the central government, our government, NGOs and municipal corporations, came together. I feel sharing data with the public always proves to be beneficial.These projections were made based on a formula given by the government of India (GoI), which has created a portal for this, and that is what we’re following. The projection of the total number of cases at present is not very different from the projection of 1 lakh cases by June-end that we had made back then. But other numbers are very different now. For example, we had then projected that active cases would be around 60,000 by now, but at present, we have only around 26,000 active cases.No, today also we are doing all arrangements based on the same assessment made in the beginning of June. Our target was to prepare 15,000 beds. We have that today. We also have more than enough beds in quarantine centres. There are more than 8,500 quarantine beds ready, and only over 1,700 of them are currently occupied.We were expecting that over 15,000 beds would be required, but now only around 5,900 beds are being utilised. In between, bed occupancy had peaked at 6,200 but things have improved since then.At present, there are some signs of stability with the recovery rate improving and the positivity rate declining. This stability gives us hope, but we cannot be under the illusion that no more preparation is required.The good thing is that Delhi’s recovery rate is very promising. Today’s recovery rate is 63.3%. This has helped us build confidence among the people in the chief minister’s five weapons to fight Corona. Testing is being scaled up, and based on that, symptomatic cases are being isolated. More beds than what is required are being set up. The fourth is plasma therapy, which has shown positive results in Delhi. And the last one is survey and screening.I agree that ventilators are the need of the hour, which is why I just took a meeting to review this matter, and we are working to augment it further. The central government has also helped us in this, but we are also procuring machines on our own. Every major Delhi government hospital has also been asked to chalk out a plan on how their capacity can be increased further.I stand by what the chief minister said yesterday – credit sara unka, zaroorat saari humari (credit all theirs, need all ours).One good thing is that with the Centre’s help, we have got some staff now in our dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. We have got staff from ITBP who are manning the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and hospital. At present, they have given staff for 1,000 beds, but I hope they will provide more personnel for all the 10,000 beds when they are utilised. Besides, we have got some oxygen cylinders, ventilators and rail coaches from the Centre.But this pandemic is so unprecedented that if any government or stakeholder claims that the situation was stabilised solely because of them, it would be too much. The good thing today is that all three – the Central government, the Delhi government and civil society – are working together in good coordination with each other. This is not the time to do post-mortems on who failed or passed.Difference of opinion is always there, and it is natural. There were some decisions taken by them (Central government and the Lieutenant-Governor), which we opposed in our discussions with them. We even kept our view in the public forum, sought views, and they withdrew those decisions. But, these things keep happening. It is a part of the process.Right now, in our hospitals, we are bypassing all government processes to appoint medical staff on an immediate basis. All our medical directors have been authorised or empowered to create posts and fill them. We have decentralised the system, which has helped a lot. The municipal corporations are doing their bit in conducting surveys.Yes, MHA has not given us any standard operating procedure (SOP) on how this is to be done. This was recommended by the Centre’s expert committee headed by Dr VK Paul of Niti Aayog. Once we get the SOP, then we will discuss it with them.We have issued a tender to rope in a private firm so that the follow-up process of home isolation patients is outsourced like before. In the meantime, we are trying to cope with whatever resources we have. We have put our staff from mohalla clinics and teams of district surveillance officers on the job as of now. But this is not sufficient.We are again going to outsource the tele-counselling task to a private firm. Which company gets the job will be known once the tender process is over. It will be finalised in a day or two.They (Centre) have asked for the data; we provided it. Now, pulse oximeters and oxygen concentrators are also available; this has made home isolation a great solution. So far, more than 52,000 people have recovered.In the beginning of June, there were some issues – there were times when it took two-three hours for the admission of patients; now it takes a maximum of 10 minutes.The Centre said in the past that deaths happening in first one to three days of hospital admission implied that home isolation protocols were not being followed strictly.If a person is eligible for home isolation as per ICMR protocols – we have not set up our own protocols – it is much better if they stay at home rather than going to the Covid centres. If someone needs hospitalisation, there is zero compromise on our end and from our medical teams. After reaching the hospitals, yes, there were some issues at the beginning. Now, the app is working really well and all the problems have been rectified.I feel that a lot of things will become clear after the sero surveillance study is done.Earlier, 20% of the cases were reported from containment areas, 40% from clusters, and almost 40% were isolated cases. Now the clusters have also been included in the containment zones. That’s why the increase in the number of zones.Actually, when you confirm community transmission, then rather than contact tracing, you focus on facilitating medical care. We are already doing that. But, yes, the resource and manpower that is focused on containment and tracing will no longer be a worry if you accept community transmission.However, we need to understand that Delhi is not a small city. In the same city, there could be a colony where community transmission could be ongoing but another colony in the same city might be very less affected. You cannot have the same yardstick for both. In a city like Delhi, you will still have to have multiple strategies.Every day, we are doing up to 20,000 tests. The main benefit is that we have been able to scale up testing. There is a limit to RT-PCR testing. That is why we are purchasing 5 lakh more tests so that we can increase it more.This is the benefit of rapid testing -- you can do it at a large scale. You cannot scale up RT-PCR to that level.We are moving towards 40,000 tests a day. And, the day we do that, it is possible that 4,000 people will test positive, I am prepared for that.No. Our collection for the first quarter of last year was ₹7,275 crore. This year it is approximately ₹2,500 crore only. So, our collection has been just one-third compared to last year. And, this is only GST and VAT. Excise, registry, and car sales have also stopped – that data has not been included in this. Total revenue in these categories must be only about 10% of the usual revenue.Since there is so much cooperation going on, and the Union home minister is also doing such handholding, I hope he will help us in this regard as well. I had written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman for ₹5,000 crore, but we are yet to hear from her. If we get this money – and I hope the Centre will give it – along with the GST compensation, then we can manage easily.Let us see. It is very difficult for me to say what the situation will be in July or August. The Government of India also said yesterday that schools will remain closed. We had assessed this a few days ago and announced our decision. It will take time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/things-were-tough-in-early-june-now-there-is-stability-says-manish-sisodia/story-3Gm0v8B0hhrfu0HpCvKyMM.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||IIT Alumni Council to eliminate Chinese systems, softwares||A day after the Indian government banned 59 mobile applications of Chinese origin, one of the largest global alumni bodies of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) has announced the elimination of Chinese systems and software in all its initiatives.IIT Alumni Council said that it was working with various technical institutes of excellence and research institutions to develop indigenous and cost-effective solutions to replace Chinese systems and software. IIT Alumni Council comprises alumni, students and faculty across all the 23 IITs and partnering technical institutes.“In support of the Indian government’s ban on Chinese apps, IIT Alumni Council is announcing an immediate ban on Chinese systems and software for all its initiatives including MegaLab. We are also sure that we shall not only achieve the goal of self-sufficiency for all our initiatives but would also export our software and testing systems to other parts of the world,” said Ravi Sharma, president and chief volunteer, IIT Alumni Council. MegaLab is the latest initiative of the council, which involves building a lab in Mumbai that will have the capacity to conduct 10 million tests for Covid-19 a month.Another initiative, with IIT Roorkee, aims to recycle plastic disposables used in the realtime polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) process (used to diagnose Covid-19. The council is also working on alternatives for viral sample tubes, sample plates and pipette tips.However, Subhasis Chaudhuri, director of IIT-Bombay (IIT-B), clarified IIT-B is not officially associated with the council. “We are not aware of any of their activities or decisions. Hence we cannot comment on their decision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-alumni-council-to-eliminate-chinese-systems-softwares/story-wSBIKbQYhVMFfsE4ePHkPO.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Source unknown in 4,041 Covid cases in Mumbai’s slums?||A total of 4,041 Covid-19 cases in Mumbai’s slums are not high-risk contacts of earlier patients , and hence their source of infection is not yet identified, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) ‘Chase the Virus’ mission data for June 3 to June 29 on its website revealed. However, BMC officials have denied the possibility of community transmission (in which people get infected, even if they are not in contact with an infected person) saying the source in the 4,041 cases is unidentified due to different reasons. They attributed the spread to intermingling within population of containment zones in slums, saying the source is linked to earlier positive cases through layers of contacts.Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner in BMC, said, “This means, there are some cases which are not from among high-risk contacts which are identified and shifted to Covid Care Centres (CCC1). The ratio is 1:13, on an average. But in slums, there are low-risk contacts too, who are not necessarily shifted outside [from their homes to quarantine centres]. There is some intermingling within population of containment zones for essential supplies. So we cannot say that the source of transmission for new cases is not known. Somewhere, it is linked to the earlier positive cases in layers of contacts.”BMC’s ‘Chase the Virus’ mission was launched by municipal commissioner IS Chahal on May 26. Among other targets, ward officers were given the task of tracing or ‘chasing’ maximum contacts of Covid-19 patients, moving them to institutional quarantine facilities, and breaking their contact with the community around them. From the earlier target of ‘chasing’ 10 high-risk contacts for every one Covid-19 patient, Chahal increased it to 15-high risk contacts. Currently, on an average, BMC has traced up to 13 high-risk contacts per positive patient across the city.Many slum pockets with high number of Covid-19 cases such as Dharavi, Govandi, Mankhurd and Kurla noticed a trend that most subsequent cases were among persons already moved to quarantine facilities by BMC as high-risk contacts of positive patients.In G-North ward, which includes Dharavi along with Dadar and Mahim, BMC has sent 2,631 high-risk contacts to institutional quarantine facilities between June 3 and June 29. The ratio is 1:15. In G-North ward, there are 178 cases who are not high-risk contacts of earlier positive cases.Similarly, in M-East ward that includes Govandi and Mankhurd, BMC has sent 2,150 high-risk contacts to institutional quarantine facilities between June 3 and June 29, and there are 130 cases who are not high-risk contacts of earlier positive cases. The ratio is 1:16.In H-East ward in Bandra East, where the ratio is 1:19, 465 high-risk contacts have been sent to institutional quarantine facilities between June 3 and June 29. There are 25 patients who are not high-risk contacts of patients.The highest instance of Covid-19 patients - 400 - who are not high-risk contacts of earlier cases is in S ward in Bhandup, where the ratio if 1:14. BMC has sent 6,586 high-risk contacts to institutional quarantine facilities.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of the civic health department, said, “In some cases, BMC is unable to trace the source of infection in any particular patient because maybe the patient is in a hospital, and may or may not be reached by civic staff to record his contact history.”When asked if the trend shows signs of community transmission, Kakani said, “No. So far, there is an index case for every Covid-19 positive patient in Mumbai. In some cases, there are delays in identifying the connection between this index case and new Covid-19 patient. For example, if a patient is in a hospital and is not able to speak with BMC staff, we may not know who all he has come in contact with.”Community transmission is supposed to be formally announced by the government and it has not yet been announced.On Tuesday, Mumbai reported 893 new cases and 93 new deaths. However, 57 of these 93 deaths occurred earlier. The number of cases now stands at 77,658 and deaths stand at 4556. Mumbai’s fatality rate now stands at 5.8% and recovery rate at 56.8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/source-unknown-in-4-041-covid-cases-in-mumbai-s-slums/story-v3yofDPg2grPBHe5CjHGGN.html

01-07-2020||Mumbai||Cops step up vigil after terror threat calls to Taj hotels||The Mumbai Police beefed up security outside Hotel Taj Mahal Palace and Towers in Colaba and Hotel Taj Lands End in Bandra after a caller who identified himself as a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative from Pakistan made two phone calls to the hotels and issued threats on Monday night. The iconic hotel in Colaba was the major target of Pakistani terrorists during the 26/11 attacks. The calls were made on the day the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi was attacked by four terrorists, killing four security personnel.A senior police officer, requesting anonymity, confirmed the threat calls and additional deployment at both hotels. Apart from quick-reaction teams (QRTs), counter-terrorism units have also been stationed as per requirements and protocol, said officers. Police officers said the first call was made around 12.30 am to Hotel Taj Mahal Palace and Towers in Colaba which was attended by a hotel staffer. The caller said he will blow up the hotel in a fashion similar to when LeT operatives had laid siege to the hotel on November 26, 2008 for 60 hours.Later, the caller called up Hotel Taj Lands End in Bandra and issued a similar threat. Both calls were made from a number now being investigated by a team of cyber police officials, said Mumbai Police officers. While both hotels have shut down its operations currently due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown that has been imposed, all measures are being taken to prevent any untoward situation, said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity. After the phone calls, Mumbai police has increased patrolling across the city and has stepped up its vigil across all vital installations in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cops-step-up-vigil-after-terror-threat-calls-to-taj-hotels/story-VGosB8eLDYjxR3scPnx9xN.html

The police have booked three of his employers on charges of abetment after the victim’s brother alleged that they had been harassing the victim.According to the police, the incident was reported on Saturday when the victim, a Narnaul resident, was rushed to Civil Hospital for treatment. After being administered first-aid, he had returned to his house. The police said on Sunday night, his condition worsened and he was taken to a hospital in Mahendragarh, where he succumbed to his injuries.The police said the victim’s brother filed a police complaint on Monday at Sector 29 police station.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “In the complaint, the victim’s brother said that on June 23, his brother had been in an accident while returning from Uttar Pradesh. In the accident, the cab had suffered extensive damage and his employers had been putting pressure on him to get the car repaired immediately. The complainant alleged that his employers had been harassing his brother and he was under duress, due to which he took the extreme step.”The police said they have initiated a probe and have summoned the three suspects to record their statements. “No one has been arrested so far and we are verifying the allegations,” said Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police.A case was registered against the suspects under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Sector 29 police station, said the police.Gurugram does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/30-year-old-cab-driver-kills-self-employers-booked/story-5fQ1m1bdwrVpf7wFKm2eTK.html
01-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram reports 87 fresh Covid cases, 68 more found positive during antigen testing||The district reported 155 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking the total tally of reported cases to 5,415. However, health department officials clarified that 68 positive cases reported through antigen testing were not included in the day’s bulletin, which only reported 87 new cases on Tuesday.“The 68 cases that tested positive via antigen tests will be reflected in tomorrow’s (Wednesday’s) bulletin,” Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said. Based on Tuesday’s bulletin data, Gurugram’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) was 9.3%, down slightly from 10% on Monday. There was also one new death in the district on Monday. Gurugram’s total mortality stands at 91, of which 56 patients died because of the presence of co-morbidities. Nearly 1.6% of the total reported Covid-19 cases in the district have resulted in a loss of life.Gurugram, on Tuesday, also recorded 79 new recoveries (down from 135 the previous day), taking the district’s cumulative recovery rate to 74.1%, slightly better than Monday’s 73.8%. The number of active cases in the district now stands at 1,289—just one more than Monday’s tally of 1,288. Of these, 828 patients are currently in home isolation, while 58 patients have been hospitalised. The remaining 402 patients are under observation at various Covid-19 care facilities across the district.Gurugram, on Tuesday,also collected 1,704 new samples for testing, significantly more than the 931 samples collected on Monday. “This was mainly because we have scaled up antigen testing from today. With a combination of RT-PCR tests and antigen tests, we aim to collect close to 2,000 samples per day soon,” Dr Jai Prakash, DSO, Gurugram, said.Of the 1,704 new samples collected on Tuesday, 991 were for antigen tests. The remaining were for RT-PCR tests, of which 65% (474 samples) were taken by private labs while 35% (239 samples) were taken by the health department. Gurugram’s backlog of samples—for which results are awaited—rose to 378 (up from 215 on Monday). On June 11, this backlog almost comprised 450 samples. However, the total number of tests conducted was down to 931, as opposed to 957 on Monday. “From Wednesday, we will be back to testing over 1,000 samples per day,” Dr Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-reports-87-fresh-cases-68-more-found-positive-during-antigen-testing/story-f4tW2WkYLA4qCMHTUmGkXJ.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||A first after becoming CM: Thackeray in Pandharpur for Ashadhi Ekadashi prayers||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray will attend early morning prayers at the Lord Vitthal temple in Pandharpur on Ashadhi Ekadashi on Wednesday.This will be the first time Thackeray will be offering prayers at Pandharpur temple as CM of the state.It is a long-standing tradition in Maharashtra for the CM and his spouse to attend the morning prayers at the Lord Vitthal temple in Pandharpur on the occasion of Ashadhi Ekadashi.Despite Shiv Sena being part of previous governments, the Thackeray family has never been part of this tradition as no member had contested any elections till recently. Last year, Aaditya Thackeray, the CM’s son was the first member of the family to contest and win the state Assembly elections. This year, Thackeray too got elected as a member of the Legislative Council, to retain his post as chief minister.On Tuesday afternoon, Thackeray left to Pandharpur. He will attend special prayers at 2.20am along with his wife Rashmi and son Aaditya, who is also the environment minister.Traditionally, lakhs of ‘warkaris’ (pilgrims) – devotees of Lord Vitthal – undertake the ‘wari’ (pilgrimage) on foot from across the state and reach Pandharpur on Ashadhi Ekadashi, which falls on July 1 this year.However, given the coronavirus outbreak, local authorities have decided to keep the celebrations low-key this year. They decided that this year, the wari, with the padukas (footprints) of Saint Dnyaneshwar, Saint Tukaram, and seven others will be taken to Pandharpur by bus with a limited number of people, not on foot as it is traditionally done. The district collector has also decided to close the temple to devotees between July 1 and 15, to avoid crowding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/a-first-after-becoming-cm-thackeray-in-pandharpur-for-ashadhi-ekadashi-prayers/story-edz8q7b3ie9dWjLnPKwGML.html
01-07-2020||Pune||National Doctor’s Day: Doctors reflect on tough Covid fight on||July 1 is observed as National Doctor’s Day in India and this year, the day is even more special given the ‘frontline warrior’ tag that all medical staff have bravely pinned to their the never-ending struggle against the Covid-19 pandemic.Doctors attending to Covid-19 patients take a moment to allow what National Doctor’s Day means to them because a moment is all these warriors can afford.Dr Dnyaneshwar Upase, who works at the district hospital in Aundh has not seen his seven-month-old daughter for two months.He said, “We have been working without any weekly offs or breaks for two months. While initially it was meant to be six hours, the numbers of cases are rising, so the number of working hours has now gone up to 12 hours. I wear the same PPE kit for the entire day. I have not been home for two months now. I have a seven-month-old daughter and I would not like to risk her health. I live in a separate room away from my family. I am in touch with them only on the phone.”Upase further added that PPE kits do provide safety from infection, but once the kit is on, for the next six hours, the person wearing the kit cannot consume any food, water or even a bathroom break.“We suffer dehydration due to severe sweating; loss of appetite as we skip lunch; and in the long run it could lead to a deficiency of vitamins. If this continues, doctors might even quit their profession and choose a completely different career,” Dr Upase said.Dr Nitim Kadam, who was recruited under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), a national programme for early identification and early intervention for children, is posted with the PMC ambulance in Bhavani peth.“I have not had a proper conversation with my family for months now. Initially, we had no weekly offs and the cases were also low, but then, as the number of cases rose it became extremely exhaustive and we decided to take weekly offs in turns,” Dr Kadam said.“Before wearing the PPE kits I drink one litre of water and then, from 10am to 4pm, I am wearing that same kit without a lunch break or bathroom break. This could possibly lead to kidney stones in future. Although we do get a break for lunch, I choose not to take any risk. After finishing this I have to also go for my night shifts every alternate day in a private hospital, where multiple doctors quit in one go after a patient tested positive for Covid-19. Due to the physical and mental exhaustion, I have lost almost four kilos in a month,” Dr Kadam said.Dr Parikshit Prayag, a consultant with Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, which reported the first death in Pune related to Covid-19, said, “PPE kits are not the most comfortable outfits. We sweat a lot which causes dehydration. Also, the personal interaction with patients is lost completely. The patient does not recognise who the doctor is. I have personally not taken a day off since March because we have to be present and available as the numbers of cases are rising. We have complete support from the administration, but yes, we have to be ready for any emergency, especially those working in ICU, emergency response or medicine.”What you can do to help doctorsWear masks in all public placesMaintain social distancing normsFollow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquettesReport any Covid-19 symptoms immediately to the civic doctorsQuarantine yourself for at least 14 days after any long-distance travel||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/doctors-reflect-on-tough-covid-fight-on-national-doctor-s-day/story-SrhQ3LUKqhRKTJWiEsoJdP.html
01-07-2020||Pune||Allow or not to allow outsiders... housing societies face dilemma||In the wake of an incident where a secretary of a co-operative housing society was booked on Sunday after an outsider was denied entry, the Pune district co-operative federation – an umbrella body of housing societies condemned the police action in a special meeting held on Tuesday.During the meeting on Tuesday which was held to discuss various issues related to entry for outsiders and the criminal case, the federation called the action taken by the deputy registrar of co-operative housing societies in lodging an FIR uncalled for. An FIR was lodged against the Rohan Nilay co-operative housing society in Aundh for violating the directives of the district collector by framing their own rules.However, the federation has appealed to all societies to follow guidelines issued by the co-operative department regarding the entries subject to verification and checks in larger public interests.The police action evoked sharp reaction among societies, office bearers, residents, especially, senior citizens who feel domestic help, drivers and others should be allowed amid public experts asking caution and measures to be taken while allowing outsiders.Pune district co-operative federation chairman Suhas Patwardhan said “Instead of establishing lines of communication with society, the government is directly lodging an FIR against the society which is wrong, the manner in which the state government directed the deputy registrar’s office to lodge an FIR against the society secretary. The society office bearers had allowed the tenants inside but were verifying details as they had come from a containment area. The secretary booked has always been at the forefront in helping people and it is wrong that he has been booked. The FIR must be withdrawn with immediate effect.”The police booked secretary of society from Aundh on the charge of insisting for a medical certificate from a pregnant woman and her family. The society eventually did not allow them entry. “There is a serious communication gap from the government department. The federation and also societies should have been taken into consideration before lodging the case. This is condemnable and the FIR will deter societies from discharging their duties which are completely in the public interest. As many as 450 persons participated in the meeting. We have asked all the office bearers to adhere to the guidelines issued by the co-operative department and they must not be violated at all. In fact, nobody is violating the rules and regulations listed by the government,” said Patwardhan.The Pune district co-operative federation will issue a written communique to all the ministerial departments concerned seeking a rollback of the FIR and demanding greater protection of society rights.Santosh Krishna - Ivy Estate, director-WHSA said “In most cases, lack of counselling of society staff results in confusion and results in setting random standards. The society rules should be in accordance with the cooperative housing dept. and the collector office issued orders. Besides this, these guidelines should also be pasted in the society notice boards, security gate and cabins for more clarity. To ensure that the guidelines issued by the housing society department is strictly followed, the society should ensure they do the briefing on the latest guidelines to their facility management and the security staff as they need to understand the rules clearly as they operate on the ground round the clock.”Kiran Moghe, leader of the Pune district ghar kamgar sanghatna, a domestic workers body union said, “Domestic maids cannot be stigmatised by the society. There is no proof that they spread infections and it can be contrary that those who are infected are transferring the infection to the maids. The maids have equal human rights and their selective branding must be avoided by the society and instead, steps must be taken to encourage and motivate them towards their socio-economic empowerment.”Moghe further added that housing societies were behaving as per their whims and fancies by subjecting the domestic helpers to harassment and unnecessary suspicion due to inherent biases.Moghe’s organisation has further demanded enactment of protective legislation that will guarantee basic minimum working hours for domestic workers including minimum wages, weekly holidays, paid leaves, bonuses and social security benefits including insurance and pensions.It has also demanded anti-discrimination measures, protection from indignity and providing legal and financial support during a crisis.Sarika Gaikwad, a housemaid from Wanawadi said “We have already lost our livelihood due to Covid-19 crisis. Over and above, the housing societies and their members have a biased mindset that maids spread Covid-19 infection as they come from slums. This mentality has to change. The societies take assistance and help from the maids for their personal benefits and easily dump them in the corner during the crisis as we are poor. However, the workers’ organisations have stood behind us which is why we are fighting effectively against this discrimination. However, not all members of society have the same bias as there are strong supporters for us too.”Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor, Jan Arogya Abhiyan said there is a lot of fear psychosis in the society regarding Covid-19 infection and nobody should succumb to overreaction and fear. “However, it is mandatory that social distancing is maintained, masks worn and hands cleaned with sanitizers. There is absolutely no need to overreact, panic and resort to measures which will lead to a complete ban on entry and exit of the society. Absolute ban of free movement is not required if we carry out regular sanitation drive in the society where staircase, elevators and other places must be cleaned. Proper awareness in the housing society regarding Covid-19 is the need for us and we must work towards that. Mask literacy has to be cultivated and ingrained amongst society. People who have come from outside must stay in fourteen days quarantine and society must assist them in the process. We should learn to live with Covid-19 and instead of banning entry and exits follow laws with due diligence. Precautionary measures must be taken for preventing the disease. Panic and overreaction must be avoided as it leads to harassment of the people.Societies reporting fresh cases after govt permits movementA 65-year-old retired government doctor from Padmawati area died due to the Covid-19 infection, triggering fear among other residents of the housing society on whether they should have allowed outsiders.The society that the 65-year old was a resident of had recently allowed entry to outsiders including those coming for domestic work.Residents from society said they are reviewing the decision whether to allow outsiders after some of the members tested positive.According to the Pune municipal Corporation (PMC) officials, as many as 20 residential societies have reported fresh faces in the past one week. “We have not reviewed the situation today and by Wednesday, when we release our containment areas list, these societies will figure in it,” said PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad.The PMC, as per fresh policy, has decided to review the containment zone map.Gaikwad said, since the infection is spreading to areas which were Covid-free so far, the PMC has decided to keep asymptomatic patients at home.“Once we confirm that a particular person is positive from these societies, where people can afford to stay home in isolation, we speak with them on web camera and ask them to stay home,” said Gaikwad.

01-07-2020||Chandigarh||Capital ‘super spreaders’ a major challenge for Haryana||Delhi is the topmost city across the country responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in neighbouring Haryana, particularly in the national capital region (NCR) districts of the state. Back and forth movement of a large section of population between Haryana’s NCR districts and the national capital for professional and personal reasons is the cause behind the spread of disease, officials said. State-wise travel history data and source of infection statistics show that 431 individuals who tested positive for coronavirus in Haryana had contracted the disease in Delhi. In comparison, 89 people found infected in the state had sourced the contagion from Maharashtra, 51 from Uttar Pradesh and 15 from Gujarat. The transmission of virus from the national capital had also forced the state government to restrict the interstate movement between Haryana and Delhi. Health department officials said the information about the antecedents and travel history of the Delhi patients was established after questioning them. “The primary and secondary contacts of the infected individuals in Haryana were traced, tested and quarantined. It is a big number in terms of contagion spreaders who infected multiple persons in the state. Then it becomes a chain of infection,” said a health official. Officials said there were several contagion spreaders having the national capital links, which could not be identified due to various reasons. “Many Delhi residents who have extended families or relatives in Haryana got themselves tested in the state. They couldn’t be counted as Delhi residents because they furnished local addresses. Then there were Delhi-based patients who got tested at private labs in Haryana and furnished incorrect addresses,” said an official monitoring the NCR situation. In fact, many Delhi private labs which had tested samples of such floating populations failed to communicate the results to the state authorities. Health officials said that a number of vegetable traders, commission agents and workforce detected positive in Jhajjar and Sonepat had also carried the virus from Delhi.Positivity rate higher in NCR districtsWhile Haryana’s ten districts have a sample positivity rate of less than 2%, a desirable value as per the parameters of the Union ministry of health, the three NCR districts of Faridabad, Gurugram and Sonepat accounting for more than 68% of the active cases have more than 6% positivity rate, a critical value as per the health ministry parameters. Faridabad has a positivity rate of 15.6%, followed by Gurugram (13.4%) and Sonepat (6.6%). Bhiwani with a sample positivity rate of 5.9% and Rewari at 5.8% are on the verge of breaching the 6% mark.Contact-tracing algorithmThe state health officials have put into effect an elaborate contact-tracing algorithm for the infected individuals. Once an individual is suspected of carrying the infection, the process starts with testing the suspect, tracking his travel history and movement, identifying his high and low-risk contacts, testing and putting them under quarantine and further investigating the primary and secondary contacts of these high and low-risk contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capital-super-spreaders-a-major-challenge-for-haryana/story-1bBS4RVNePlsiShoqwumCI.html
01-07-2020||Noida||GB Nagar administration to collect 4,000 samples per day for Covid-19 test in special drive||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has set a target to collect 4,000 samples per day to test for Covid-19 during a special drive beginning in Meerut division from Thursday.Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the samples will be tested via different methods. “We have set a target of testing 1,000 samples through the lab-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, and 3,000 via the rapid antigen method. Teams of trained health workers are being constituted for different localities. We will focus on taking samples from residents living in high-risk containment areas,” he said.The district magistrate further said that till date, over 20,000 samples have been collected by different labs in the district. “We have so far tested samples from over 18,500 persons through RT-PCR, while over 1,500 samples have been tested through rapid antigen test kits. This special drive, beginning Thursday, will not only help identify more positive cases but will also aid their speedy recovery. Gautam Budh Nagar district’s sampling rate is around 10,000 per million, which is around five times the national sampling rate of less than 2,000 per million,” he said.Suhas also said that taking cognisance of the rising cases in the district, the leaves of all the government employees have been cancelled until further notice. “According to the government order, they have been asked not to leave their headquarters without my permission, except for an emergency,” he said.The district magistrate further said that the annual Mudiya Poono fair, scheduled to begin from July 1 this year has been cancelled due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “We will restrict the movement of people from the district to Govardhan in Mathura district. The state government has issued an order in this regard” he said.Meanwhile, the Gautam Budh Nagar district, on Tuesday, reported 97 new cases in the past 24 hours, taking the overall Covid-19 count in the district to 2,301 cases. The district chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that as many as 76 Covid-19 patients were cured and discharged from different hospitals by Tuesday, taking the overall number of cured patients to 1,506 in the district so far. “So far, 22 patients have lost their lives in the district. As a result, the district now has 776 active cases,” he said.According to the daily Covid-19 bulletin released on Tuesday by the state headquarters in Lucknow, in the last 24 hours, as many as 25 Covid-19 patients in Uttar Pradesh have lost their lives and their death audit report is awaited.According to the bulletin, the overall tally of the Covid-19 positive cases in the state has gone up to 23,500 with 672 new cases in the last 24 hours. “While 672 patients have lost their lives due to the infection in the state so far, 16,085 patients have been cured and discharged from different hospitals in the state till date,” the bulletin stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-administration-to-collect-4-000-samples-per-day-for-covid-19-test-in-special-drive/story-hX6JQQSltNQ9MbzvvtOpNL.html
01-07-2020||Mumbai||Three teenagers back in custody after escaping Dongri Children’s Home||The three teenagers who had escaped from the Dongri Children’s Home on Tuesday, returned during the night hours. All three were runaway kids and were in custody of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), since over six months. The teenaged kids, after finding all trains, buses, and transportation mediums non-operarional and shops shut due to the lockdown, returned to the children’s home in the night. During their brief period outside, they visited Gateway of India, in Colaba, officials said.The Dongri police had launched a hunt for the three. The teenagers were of age 14, 16 and 17, and originally hailed from Darchula district in Nepal, Supaul in Bihar and Dawla in West Bengal, respectively.On Tuesday afternoon, during their kitchen gardening training, they excused themselves to attend nature’s call. They managed to dodge guard’s attention and escaped from the main gate, said an official from Dongri Children’s Home.“The three have tendency of escaping. They have escaped from their homes at least five times in the past. They were brought to the children home as missing kids. Their families knew that their kids are in safe custody in Mumbai,” said Rahul Kanthikar, superintendent of Dongri Children’s Home.The kids at the children’s home are anxious due to the pandemic. Two kids and a nurse had tested positive for Covid-19 in April. “We are worried about the kids as probably they are not completely aware about the conditions outside. The lockdown is in effect and even if they attempt to escape the city, they won’t be able to do so, as trains and other public transport mediums are not operational,” said another official.Teenagers’ escape was captured in the CCTV cameras installed near the Children’s Home. The three were in the uniform and were wearing mask.Hindustan Times in its June 22 edition had published a report explaining how around 75 rescued children are ‘stranded’ in Dongri Children Home since last three months, and cannot be re-united with their families as authorities of other states refused to take them, citing spread of novel coronavirus as the reason. These kids are rescued by the police from various factories, small scale units, where they were being exploited as child labours. Some of them are rescued from child trafficking rackets, some are street kids and missing kids, while some are runaway kids.Usually the CWC re-unite the rescued kids with their families in maximum one month’s time, but due to the lockdown, not a single kid was reunited in the past three months.The longer stay of kids at the children home has left adverse impact on children’s psyche. They are facing problems such as anxiety, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, feeling low, mood swings, drop in daily activities, etc, said officials. Women and Child Development commissioner Hrishikesh Yashod had too admitted that the kids are anxious, panic and are in stress because of the lockdown. The commissioner had said that there is reluctant approach of the administration of other states. Unavailability of police escort party is also an issue. However, efforts are being taken to re-unite the kids with their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-teenagers-escape-from-dongri-children-s-home/story-qPVOCINZRcjn0i9xpH4lqI.html
01-07-2020||Delhi||Migrants who stayed back helping shape Delhi’s biggest Covid-19 facility||Attempting to catch a quick nap amid a hectic schedule, Ishtiyak Ali is perched atop a large seven-ton air-conditioner, about 25 feet above the ground, at the Radha Soami Satsang Beas in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur, which is being prepared to serve as a 10,000-bed temporary Covid-19 hospital.His break will not last long. Hired by a private firm to set up air-conditioners at this facility, 26-year-old Ali will be back to work in less than 30 minutes.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“I have been working my regular shift from 8am to 6pm as well as overtime until 1am. It will help complete the work quicker and I’ll receive some extra overtime pay,” Ali, a native of Mau district in Uttar Pradesh, says.Unlike many migrants who left for their hometowns during the lockdown, Ali and scores like him chose to stay back in the city. They see the work at the facility as an opportunity to earn after a prolonged period of unemployment as well as a chance to contribute to the country during a pandemic.MORE THAN 900 WORKERSBM Mishra, district magistrate of the south district, said about over 900 workers from different departments and organisations have been working in shifts since June 14 to prepare the facility wherein 2,000 beds have already been readied to take in Covid-19 patients.“These include about 250 people fixing air-conditioners, 100 making the beds, 200 handling the electricity works, 100 from MTNL and another 125 from SDMC and NDMC,” Mishra said, while overseeing the work on a hot and humid Monday afternoon.Several of these departments have outsourced the work to small firms who have hired either daily wage labourers or skilled workers. Apart from these, there are about 700 ‘sewadars’ (volunteers) from the satsang.But these workers were difficult to find. Sandeep Panwar, whose firm is one among several installing 18,000 tons of air-conditioners here, says that the unavailability of labourers has forced him to task his employees to find them.“Most of the workers you see around are new labourers. My employees are visiting labour chowks across the city to scout for them,” Panwar said.And when these workers see the nature of the job, some of them leave, Panwar said. “It is a tough task to load the heavy ACs on the iron frames. Not everyone is willing to do this task in this heat.”EXTRA PAY IN TOUGH TIMESVikas Kumar, a 40-year-old labourer who took up this job, acknowledged that it is a laborious task, but he needed the money. “I was unemployed for a lengthy period during the lockdown. Now if I am getting paid ₹500 for a regular shift, I’ll take up any work for my family,” Kumar said immediately after loading an AC.An overtime allowance of ₹200-₹300 is also what has kept Kumar and his colleagues working hard over here.Nandini Maharaj, the assistant collector of the south district, says that work on the ground began on June 14, the same day that she and the other officers began conceptualising the task.“We have been working here till 2am and so have many labourers. It wouldn’t have been possible to finish such a task if not for the contribution of these workers. We have ensured that they have a decent place to stay and timely meals,” Maharaj said.On Monday afternoon, some workers went about fixing cardboard beds, others loaded large and heavy air-conditioners on iron pole frames while some others flattened the mud floors even as a few took quick breaks.Nearby, a group of 50 workers used cardboard sheets to set up beds. Over the last seven days, they readied 5,000 beds, Rajesh Ranjan, the project head of Sleepwell, a private firm that has donated 10,000 bedding sets to this facility, said.‘CONTRIBUTING IN A PANDEMIC’Rajan Bargujar, one of the workers here, said he and most of his colleagues had been unemployed for three months. “We have being given minimum wage and promised a bonus, but it is the sense of working for the country that will keep us working here despite the threat of infection,” Bargujar said.Vijay Kumar Yadav, an electrician who is visually challenged in one eye, chose not to go back to his village in Bihar hoping he would find work when the lockdown was lifted. He said that after being disappointed in the initial days when lockdown restrictions were lifted, he found work at this facility that is paying him a little more than what he earned earlier.“I made about ₹600 a day earlier. For this work, I am getting paid ₹900. It is as if someone has lent me a helping hand,” Yadav, who is done fixing charging points under each of the 2,000 ready beds, said.But more than the money, Yadav says he has been enjoying the satisfaction of “serving the country”.“I have worked for over two decades, but work has never this voluminous and hectic. It feels like work is going on at a war footing and I am fighting a battle for my country,” says 42-year-old Yadav.Yadav knows that soon patients infected with Covid-19 will begin occupying the 2,000 ready beds, but he and his colleagues say they aren’t concerned, even though they must continue readying other sections at the same facility. “I am in no hurry to leave from here. What would happen if doctors began leaving this place if I got infected and hospitalised,” says Yadav’s colleague Sanjay Tiwari.But the fear of having to work near patients is also what is keeping some workers toiling harder than usual.One among them is Mohammad Ahmed, a labourer hired to level the mud floor—which will eventually be covered with vinyl sheets.“My colleagues and I are working harder to finish the work in the next couple of days. It won’t be safe once patients start coming in,” Ahmed, who belongs to Saharsa in Bihar, but didn’t find an opportunity to return to his village, says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/extra-pay-and-sense-of-service-make-workers-toil-hard-at-10-000-bed-facility-at-chhatarpur/story-q5uUWBrPzM9fI5zvgNBgXI.html
01-07-2020||Delhi||Medical waste piles up as MCDs short of hands||As more and more Covid-19 patients are being put in home isolation, daily collection of biomedical waste from their houses is proving to be a big challenge for the already short-staffed municipalities.In many neighbourhoods where Covid-19 positive patients are in home isolation, daily biomedical waste is not happening, residents say. In other areas, waste is being collected every three to four days.Delhi has at present 17,148 people in home isolation, out of the total 27,847 active cases.The city on Tuesday recorded 2,199 cases, taking the total to 87,360. Sixty-two deaths were reported on Tuesday, taking the total count to 2,742. Surya Pratap Singh, a resident of north Delhi’s Rohini who tested positive eight days ago, and is in home isolation till July 1, said waste is being picked up from his house every alternate day.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“First, I tested positive, then my wife and mother was infected. All of us are in home isolation. The daily waste generation is so much that it needs to be collected every day. There have been days when we keep the waste bag outside our house for collection in the given time but it just stays there. We have to put it back inside because neighbours start complaining,” Singh said.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines for the management of Covid-19 biomedical waste says refuse from patients’ houses must be collected daily, in colour-coded and sealed bags, to prevent any spread of infection. Household biomedical waste has to be put in yellow bags.Municipalities said that with an “exponential” increase in the number of home isolation cases and with limited staff and resources, it is becoming difficult for sanitation workers to cover all the houses of infected people in their areas. Jai Prakash, North Delhi mayor, admitted the municipalities were not being able to collect garbage every day. He, however, assured that the north corporation plans to rope in more people in the coming weeks to collect and handle biomedical waste from houses. Workers are likely to be outsourced, though no plan has been finalised yet.“The generation of biomedical has increased exponentially. For instance, if we were collecting biomedical waste from 40 households earlier, now we have to collect waste from 400 houses. We are trying to get more people on the workforce for collecting waste from positive houses. Meanwhile, if we receive any complaint of garbage not being picked up on our control room helpline, we immediately send our team for collection,” Jai Prakash said.The MCD’s control room helplines are 155304/18002008701/1800118700/1266.A senior official of the East Delhi municipal corporation (EDMC) explained that because of the shortage of sanitation workers, the civic agency has dedicated only a part of its team to focus on home isolation waste. For instance, if an area has a team of 20 sanitation workers, only 10 are dedicated to biomedical waste collection, while others focus on the rest of the city. This is putting more stress on these people.The three municipalities--north, south and east-- engage around 71,345 sanitation workers. The north corporation has 31,332 workers with a shortfall of nearly 10-12%, EDMC has 15,023 but needs 15-20% more staff, while there are 25,000 sanitation workers with SDMC, a shortage of nearly 5% employees.“We cannot risk putting our entire workforce for the management of biomedical waste; we will need a backup team, especially because infections are rising at such a high rate. With limited staff, it becomes difficult to cover all houses every day,” the official said on the condition of anonymity.Neel Kanth, general secretary of DDA Flats in Dwarka sector-14, said three houses in their colony are marked for home isolation but municipal workers only stand at the gate and do not collect waste from each of these houses.“Ours is a gated colony and taking advantage of that, the collectors stand outside instead of going door to door. The colony’s private waste collector wears safety gear, picks up the bags and hands it over to the workers,” Kanth said.A resident of east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar phase-I, pocket-2, who did not wish to be identified, said his father tested positive on June 24 but sanitation workers collected waste from their house only twice. He said keeping bags of biomedical waste inside the house with other healthy members was a matter of great risk. The health agencies have been very cooperative but handing over of waste is definitely an issue. We had raised this issue with the health official who calls every day to enquire about my father’s condition and they said the issue will be raised with the departments concerned,” he said. In some localities, RWAs are taking it upon themselves to coordinate with sanitation teams and ensure garbage is collected every day. A residents’ group in Shiv Vihar said they coordinate with municipal agencies and Delhi government dispensaries to ensure waste is collected daily and all home isolation rules are followed. “Since the same team is assigned for this locality, we coordinate with them every morning and make sure bags with biomedical waste from the marked houses are kept outside so that none of the parties is inconvenienced,” said Prashant Tiwari, member of the Shiv Vihar residents’ group. Swati Sambyal, a Delhi-based solid waste management expert, said the problem of waste management has become more severe with the pandemic and will only get worse as cases increase. “The cities practising a dentralised system of waste management are doing fairly well with garbage management after Covid. But Delhi was struggling with concepts of segregation and waste management even before the pandemic and the disease put more stress on the system and on the sanitation workers,” Sambyal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/short-staffed-municipalities-struggle-to-collect-biomedical-waste-from-home-isolation/story-HjSKUV7NHssZC7PH5k9AHO.html
01-07-2020||Delhi||National Doctors’ Day: Delhi doctors say they are ready to face any situation||From fearing a novel disease to learning how to work in full-body suits, doctors have kept working throughout the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last four months. “In the last few months, we have become confident that no matter how difficult the situation, doctors will be ready to fight any war,” Dr Sunil Dhuchania, the president of the resident doctors’ association at Lady Hardinge Medical College, said.On the occasion of National Doctors’ Day on July 1, the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) will felicitate all those who were infected in the line of duty on Wednesday. National Doctors’ Day is celebrated on the birth anniversary of the legendary physician Dr BC Roy.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Now that many of our colleagues are recovering from the infection, the fear has definitely reduced. We know that if we take adequate precautions we can protect ourselves and even if we do get it, the infection is not all that bad—most people get mild symptoms,” Dr Duchania said.It is, however, working while wearing personal protective equipment —coveralls, head cover, mask, gloves, goggles or face shield and shoe covers—that is troublesome. “There is no air circulation in the suits. There is so much sweating, people get dehydrated. We cannot drink too much water because we cannot go to the washroom. This is the most difficult part of working in Covid-19 areas,” he said.Dr Amarinder Singh Malhi, the assistant professor of cardiac radiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said, “Imagine wearing a personal protection equipment (PPE) suit for six to eight hours at a stretch in this hot and humid climate, without being able to eat and drink, or even use the washroom because it is a sterilised environment. This is what some of our colleagues have been doing routinely for months now.”“And with the number of cases rising, it is becoming more exhausting. We have seen some people faint due to dehydration,” he added. The challenge is no less for the doctors working in non-Covid areas. They are routinely exposed to the infection as well.“Because we are a non-Covid hospital, we just put on a mask and see our patients in the OPDs and emergency wards. However, many of them are infected and even if we screen them, we cannot detect all the cases. Doctors in the so-called ‘low-risk’ areas are also routinely exposed to the infection. We are not even tested routinely, so we work in the blind, hoping that we have either had the infection or we do not get it,” Dr Maruti Sinha, a gynaecologist at North corporation-run Kasturba Gandhi Hospital and the secretary of the MCD Doctors’ Association, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/if-doctors-can-face-covid-they-can-face-anything/story-v2yBXv3ExKXUBarjhs8SeI.html
01-07-2020||Noida||Woman raped by occultist in Greater Noida, case lodged||A 20-year-old married woman who was allegedly raped by an occult practitioner in Greater Noida on Monday morning on the pretext of ridding her of ‘negative energy’.The suspect, identified as Pappan, was later booked by Rabupura police on a complaint by the woman’s husband.The husband of the woman has told police that the incident took place after the couple decided to visit the occult practitioner to seek solutions for some of their problems.“We had gotten married in February, but things seemed off from the starting. She often turned very aggressive and some unexplained things started happening at home. It seemed like she was under the influence of some spirit. So we got in touch with an occult practitioner to help her out,” said the husband.He also said that the suspect had visited the family at their home four days ago, taken Rs 5,000 from them and had asked them to bring the woman to his village, a few kilometers away.“When we went there on Monday around 11am, he took us to a field nearby and asked us to taste some ash, which was probably laced with a sedative. Both me and my wife lost consciousness after that. When I woke up, my wife recounted her ordeal to me after which we confronted the man. He in turn threatened to kill us. We then reported the matter to the police,” said the husband.Based on the man’s complaint, a case was registered at the Rabupura police station against the suspect under sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the Indian Penal Code.Police officials said that a search for nabbing the suspect is underway.“The incident happened yesterday and we have filed an FIR. A medical examination has been ordered for the woman. The couple allege that there were fed some sedative mixed in ash. A probe in the matter is going on,” said Vineet Kumar, station house officer, Rabupura police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-raped-by-occultist-in-greater-noida-case-lodged/story-oUUahWfSZDp1jfm73zJMEN.html
01-07-2020||Pune||No relatives, no friends, no contacts traced... 72 hours in... no last rites for 46-year-old Covid victim in Pune||The body of a 46-year-old Covid-19 victim has lain in the mortuary of Sassoon Hospital since June 28, the day the man passed away at the hospital itself.“We received a letter from the police. PMC officials were informed and the procedure was completed this evening (Tuesday). The body was handed over to PMC officials at 7pm and they will undertake the cremation process,” said Dr Swapna Jadhav, resident medical officer, Sassoon General Hospital.However, in violation of state guidelines and due to the fact that the neither the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) nor the police were able to trace any next of kin, it has taken 72 hours for a Covid-positive victim to be cremated. On April 30, the Maharashtra government issued guidelines to hospitals to regulate the final rites of Covid-infected deceased. As per the guidelines, in effect from May 2, the body of a Covid-19 victim should be moved from the hospital within 30 minutes, with final rites concluded within 12 hours.“We have a very smooth procedure in place for disposal of bodies. The body is first handed over to the family, but they are not allowed to conduct last rites. Once information about a body is provided to us, the disposal team gets into action. Now, with this body, I’m not aware where the hold-up was. We have disposed of 500 Covid-19 bodies till now without a glitch in the system,” said Dr Kalpana Baliwant, assistant medical officer, PMC. Dr Baliwant heads the department that disposes the bodies of Covid-19 victims as per religious preferences.The man died of acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, according to PMC data. He also had a heart disease along with being Covid-19 positive. He was undergoing treatment since June 9.“The registered address is Shukrawar peth. An unidentified man brought him to hospital had gave a phone number and a forwarding address. However, the phone has been off and there was nobody at that address,” said police inspector (crime) Uttam Chakre of Khadak police station.The Khadak police then wrote a letter to the hospital to inform them about the situation.Dr Naresh Zanjad, head of the forensic department at Sassoon hospital, said, “This is the first time such a thing has happened - that we are unable to track the relatives of the deceased. As soon as the person was declared dead we tried to contact the relatives, but the only number we had was not reachable. We have now informed the PMC who will dispose of the body as per ICMR protocols.”Officials of another police station also tried to track down the relatives on Monday.“The Sassoon officials had provided the address. We checked it on Monday and found it to be in the jurisdiction of Khadak police station. Therefore, the information was passed on to them,” said senior police inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of Faraskhana police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-relatives-no-friends-no-contacts-traced-72-hours-in-no-last-rites-for-46-year-old-covid-victim/story-7I4JrVuE84jO1KutCrs39I.html

An extension of six months was given to the contractor, however, the work is still in progress. The entire stretch where footpath construction work has been undertaken is 2.5 kilometres in total, starting from Goodluck chowk to Agriculture College. The project includes building of a footpath on the left flank up to five metres, including a cycle track and 3 metres on the right flank. The cost of the project is Rs 25 crore that includes parking lots on both sides. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) claims that during the lockdown, the contractor faced a shortage of raw material, including paver blocks, as the order could not be delivered due to transportation issues.The work on the footpath began two years ago in May 2018 and the project has now moved into its last leg with the installation of paver blocks near Goodluck chowk. However, the pace at which the work is undergoing may push back the completion date even further. According to the PMC officials, pedestrians will be able to utilise the newly-constructed Smart footpath in eight to 10 days and the entire stretch of the road will be completed by the end of July.At present, the paver blocks have been installed between Ranade campus and Dnyaneshwar Paduka chowk stretch, while work is in progress at the Goodluck chowk.PMC executive engineer Dinkar Gojare, said, “The pedestrians will be able to walk on the Smart footpath in eight to ten days and the entire FC road will be fixed as well as enhanced by the end of July. We are waiting for the supply of paver blocks as we have not received the order due to Covid-19 lockdown. The work can be fast-forwarded and can be completion once we receive the paver blocks. However, due to less traffic on the road, the project is now near completion. Due to the lockdown, we were short on the resources and labour.”The PMC has tendered the project to Dhoot Constructions and despite repeated attempts; the contractor could not be reached.Many shopkeepers on FC road have complained about the slow pace of work by the contractor that caused an inconvenience before the lockdown and a drop in sales due to restricted access to the commercial shops.A shopkeeper on FC road said that they had encountered a dip in footfall by almost 30 per cent than usual when work was on. “We have encountered a fall in sales as it was difficult for the customers to reach the shop due to the project and almost for two months we suffered losses. We now hope that the footpath will soon be in service and customers start returning after three months of lockdown,” said Dinesh of Tantra on FC road.Shakid Shaikh, manager of Metro shoes, said, “Footfall at our shop wasn’t affected, but customers often complained about parking issues. We were worried about the sales after lockdown, but when we reopened the shop after lockdown, we were pleased to see that the work was almost done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/contractor-misses-1-yr-deadline-plus-extension-to-construct-fc-road-footpath/story-Lpkmc8nqs6uQqGLFTj44rN.html
01-07-2020||Pune||Street lights to be installed in ghat sections of Pune-Mumbai Expressway to prevent accidents||In a bid to reduce the number of accidents on the Pune-Mumbai expressway and upgrade its safety arrangements, the Maharashtra Highway Police (MHP) department along with the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) will install ‘street lights’ in the ghat section.The expressway witnessed 306 accidents in 2019 (including fatal, serious and minor injuries) along with 138 mishaps which did not result in injuries. Till May this year, the expressway had recorded 46 accidents (including fatal, serious and minor injuries) along with 12 mishaps which did not result in injuries. The reduced number of mishaps has also been attributed to the decreased vehicle movement on the expressway due to the lockdown in March, April and May, according to officials.This will be the first time when street lights will be installed on the expressway for better visibility at night, according to officials. The decision comes after MSRDC recently conducted survey wherein officials recorded that lower visibility increased the risk of road mishaps there. Vijay Patil, superintendent of police, Maharashtra Highway Police, said, “Monsoon brings heavy rains to the ghat section on the expressway and hence, we conducted a pre-monsoon survey with the help of MSRDC. Street lights will be installed along the entire ghat section of the expressway for better visibility in the region. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 7.5 crore. Street lights are being installed on the expressway for the first time. In the ghat section, tunnel work will continue simultaneously, but it will take another two years to complete and we want to reduce the number of accidents in the coming two years.” According to the state highway police and MSRDC, if things go according to plan, the actual work of installing the street lights is likely to start in the next couple of months.While the entire ghat section is 18km long, lights will be installed on the 10km stretch between Khandala and Khopoli. The Pune-Mumbai expressway, officially named as the Yashwantrao Chavan Expressway, has been operational since 2002. It is the country’s first six-lane concrete high-speed highway with a total of 94.5km joining Pune and Mumbai. Maximum fatal accidents have been reported on the expressway in 2016, in which 151 people died. “In our study of accident patterns in the ghat section, it was revealed that most of the accidents happen when vehicles ram into the motorist in front of them. One of the reasons behind this could be that the driver had not been able to judge the exact distance between the vehicles and hence, street lights can provide good visibility to them,” he added.In 2019, there were 22 fatal accidents in the ghat section of the expressway, starting from km 45 to km 36 which is a slope in the ghats, according to Patil. To prevent further accidents, MSRDC has on a trial basis installed blinkers, reflectors and rumbler strips on a one kilometre patch in the ghat section. This, according to officials, offered positive results as there had been no accidents in the same patch in the past six months.Vipul Alekar, a businessman and regular commuter between Pune and Mumbai, said, “I frequently travel to Mumbai from Pune for my business meetings and in the ghat section it is really risky to drive, specially at night. In the rainy season, we cannot see the vehicles in front of us and if street lights are installed, there will be more visibility.”Tanmay Pendse, an activist working for the safety of commuters using the expressway, said, “It is a very positive decision for the safety of travellers using the e-way. But it should have been done earlier and is a decision too late, according to me. There is always a visibility issue during the monsoon which leads to accidents, now after installing the lights, it will help drivers see clearly and judge the distance between vehicles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/street-lights-to-be-installed-in-ghat-sections-of-pune-mumbai-expressway-to-prevent-accidents/story-t4HkKKjFtTinqQC4BgQ9vJ.html

01-07-2020||World||Russian voters agree to reform that could extend Putin’s rule to 2036||A majority of voters approved changes to Russia’s constitution that would allow President Vladimir Putin to hold power until 2036, but the weeklong plebiscite that ended Wednesday was tarnished by widespread reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities.With most of the nation’s polls closed and 20% of precincts counted, 72% voted for the constitutional amendments, according to election officials.For the first time in Russia, polls were kept open for a week to bolster turnout without increasing crowds casting ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic — a provision that Kremlin critics denounced as an extra tool to manipulate the outcome.A massive propaganda campaign and the opposition’s failure to mount a coordinated challenge helped Putin get the result he wanted, but the plebiscite could end up eroding his position because of the unconventional methods used to boost participation and the dubious legal basis for the balloting.By the time polls closed in Moscow and most other parts of Western Russia, the overall turnout was at 65%, according to election officials. In some regions, almost 90% of eligible voters cast ballots.On Russia’s easternmost Chukchi Peninsula, nine hours ahead of Moscow, officials quickly announced full preliminary results showing 80% of voters supported the amendments, and in other parts of the Far East, they said over 70% of voters backed the changes.Kremlin critics and independent election observers questioned official figures.“We look at neighboring regions, and anomalies are obvious — there are regions where the turnout is artificially (boosted), there are regions where it is more or less real,” Grigory Melkonyants, co-chair of the independent election monitoring group Golos, told The Associated Press.Putin voted at a Moscow polling station, dutifully showing his passport to the election worker. His face was uncovered, unlike most of the other voters who were offered free masks at the entranceThe vote completes a convoluted saga that began in January, when Putin first proposed the constitutional changes. He offered to broaden the powers of parliament and redistribute authority among the branches of government, stoking speculation he might seek to become parliamentary speaker or chairman of the State Council when his presidential term ends in 2024.His intentions became clear only hours before a vote in parliament, when legislator Valentina Tereshkova, a Soviet-era cosmonaut who was the first woman in space in 1963, proposed letting him run two more times. The amendments, which also emphasize the primacy of Russian law over international norms, outlaw same-sex marriages and mention “a belief in God” as a core value, were quickly passed by the Kremlin-controlled legislature.Putin, who has been in power for more than two decades — longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin — said he would decide later whether to run again in 2024. He argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants focused on their work instead of “darting their eyes in search for possible successors.”Analyst Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin political consultant, said Putin’s push to hold the vote despite the fact that Russia has thousands of new coronavirus infections each day reflected his potential vulnerabilities.“Putin lacks confidence in his inner circle and he’s worried about the future,” Pavlovsky said. “He wants an irrefutable proof of public support.”Even though the parliament’s approval was enough to make it law, the 67-year-old Russian president put his constitutional plan to voters to showcase his broad support and add a democratic veneer to the changes. But then the coronavirus pandemic engulfed Russia, forcing him to postpone the April 22 plebiscite.The delay made Putin’s campaign blitz lose momentum and left his constitutional reform plan hanging as the damage from the virus mounted and public discontent grew. Plummeting incomes and rising unemployment during the outbreak have dented his approval ratings, which sank to 59%, the lowest level since he came to power, according to the Levada Center, Russia’s top independent pollster.Moscow-based political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann said the Kremlin had faced a difficult dilemma: Holding the vote sooner would have brought accusations of jeopardizing public health for political ends, while delaying it raised the risks of defeat. “Holding it in the autumn would have been too risky,” she said.In Moscow, several activists briefly lay on Red Square, forming the number “2036” with their bodies in protest before police stopped them. Some others in Moscow and St. Petersburg staged one-person pickets and police didn’t intervene.Authorities mounted a sweeping effort to persuade teachers, doctors, workers at public sector enterprises and others who are paid by the state to cast ballots. Reports surfaced from across the vast country of managers coercing people to vote.The Kremlin has used other tactics to boost turnout and support for the amendments. Prizes ranging from gift certificates to cars and apartments were offered as an encouragement, voters with Russian passports from eastern Ukraine were bused across the border to vote, and two regions with large number of voters — Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod — allowed electronic balloting.In Moscow, some journalists and activists said they were able to cast their ballots both online and in person in a bid to show the lack of safeguards against manipulations.Kremlin critics and independent monitors pointed out that the relentless pressure on voters coupled with new opportunities for manipulations from a week of early voting when ballot boxes stood unattended at night eroded the standards of voting to a striking new low.In addition to that, the early voting sanctioned by election officials but not reflected in law further eroded the ballot’s validity.Many criticized the Kremlin for lumping more than 200 proposed amendments together in one package without giving voters a chance to differentiate among them.“I voted against the new amendments to the constitution because it all looks like a circus,” said Yelena Zorkina, 45, after voting in St. Petersburg. “How can people vote for the whole thing if they agree with some amendments but disagree with the others?”Putin supporters were not discouraged by being unable to vote separately on the proposed changes. Taisia Fyodorova, a 69-year-old retiree in St. Petersburg, said she voted yes “because I trust our government and the president.”In a frantic effort to get the vote, polling station workers set up ballot boxes in courtyards and playgrounds, on tree stumps and even in car trunks — unlikely settings derided on social media that made it impossible to ensure a clean vote.In Moscow, there were reports of unusually high numbers of at-home voters, with hundreds visited by election workers in a matter of hours, along with multiple complaints from monitors that paperwork documenting the turnout was being concealed from them.At the same time, monitoring the vote became more challenging due to hygiene requirements and more arcane rules for election observers.The Golos monitoring group pointed out at unusual differences between neighboring regions: in the Siberian republic of Tyva over 73% voted in the first five days, while in the neighboring Irkutsk region, turnout was about 22% and in the neighboring republic of Altai, it was under 33%.“These differences can be explained only by forcing people to vote in certain areas or by rigging,” Golos said.Observers warned that the new dubious methods used by authorities to boost turnout, combined with numerous bureaucratic hurdles that hindered independent monitoring, would undermine the legitimacy of the vote.“There is a big question about the results of this vote,” Melkonyants said, adding that its outcome “can’t really bear any legal standing.”—-Irina Titova in St. Petersburg contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-voters-agree-to-extend-president-vladimir-putin-s-rule-to-2036/story-r3ZHrGb8YZxr7qwmQkZmNI.html
01-07-2020||World||Over 160,000 coronavirus cases reported every day in past week, a record: WHO||The global coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, the World Health Organization said Wednesday, with the number of daily cases surging beyond 160,000 every day in the past week, a record.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also told a virtual briefing that well over half of all cases recorded since the novel coronavirus first emerged in China late last year were registered in June.“For the past week, the number of the new cases has exceeded 160,000 on every single day,” he said, adding that “60 percent of all cases so far have been reported just in the past month.” Data provided by the UN health agency showed that the highest number of new daily COVID-19 cases ever recorded came on June 28, when more than 189,500 new cases were registered worldwide.Prior to June 25, daily cases only surpassed 160,000 twice before, both in the preceding week, while daily cases did not pass the 100,000 mark until May 18, the data showed.With over 511,000 deaths and more than 10.5 million known infections worldwide, the coronavirus pandemic is “not even close to being over”, the WHO warned earlier this week.Tedros reiterated that taking a “comprehensive approach” was the best way to rein in the virus.“Find, isolate, test and care for every case, trace and quarantine every contact, equip and train health workers and educate and empower communities to protect themselves and others,” he said.“Not testing alone. Not physical distancing alone. Not contact tracing alone. Not masks alone. Do it all.”Countries that have implemented a wide range of measures, including contact tracing, isolation, physical distancing and mask wearing “have suppressed transmission and saved lives”, he said.- ‘Fragmented approach’ -The UN health agency was therefore very concerned, he said, to see that a number of countries “have not used all the tools at their disposal and have taken a fragmented approach.“These countries face a long, hard road ahead,” he said, stressing though that “no matter what situation a country is in, it can be turned around.”“It’s never too late,” he said, pointing for instance to how Italy and Spain managed to rein in daunting outbreaks earlier this year.Tedros also highlighted that more than 1,000 scientists from around the world were this week taking part in discussions on the vast array of COVID-19-related research, including on the development of potential vaccines and treatments.He reiterated the call for equitable access for all, insisting that while the pandemic posed a scientific challenge, “it’s also a test of character”.“We have a shared responsibility to ensure that all people have access to the tools to protect themselves, especially those who are most at risk.”Six months into the global pandemic, the WHO also said it is aiming next week to send two Geneva-based experts to China to lay the groundwork for an investigation into the virus source.The organisation has been pressing China since early May to invite in its experts to help investigate the animal origins of the coronavirus.“The planned mission is an advance mission... to make preparations with Chinese colleagues, essentially to set up the scope of the mission,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told Wednesday’s briefing.He added that the team would consist of one animal health expert and one epidemiologist.nl-rjm/cdw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-160-000-coronavirus-cases-reported-every-day-in-past-week-a-record-who/story-HXsC8NQqPTqMB9KnFJBOCL.html

We hope the Indian side will work with the Chinese side towards the same goal, keep up close communication through military and diplomatic channels, and ease the situation and reduce the temperature along the border,” the spokesperson said.Separately, quoting anonymous sources, nationalistic tabloid Global Times reported that the “two sides had a frank and in-depth exchange of views, discussed effective ways to resolve current differences in border control, and studied concrete measures to enhance mutual trust and maintain stability.”Quoting the source, the GT report said the military commander-level’s meeting showed the two sides’ willingness to ease tensions on the border, and avoid further escalating the situation.The latest meeting took place at Chushul on the Indian side of the LAC, while the previous two meetings were held at Moldo on the Chinese side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-welcomes-military-talks-working-towards-de-escalation/story-nTSqqQAG3J5eaf1ATj0J4O.html

The re-election operation has struggled to respond to crises, including the coronavirus pandemic, the economic damage it has wrought and the growing demands for racial justice.The changes were orchestrated by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a White House adviser, according to another person. Kushner has played an influential role in the campaign though he is not officially part of it.Kushner swapped COOs without telling key aides, including campaign manager Brad Parscale, beforehand about his decision, according to two people familiar with the situation.DeWit was the chief financial officer at NASA from March 2018 until February, and the COO of Trump’s 2016 campaign for president. Glassner, who worked on that effort as well, has been chief operating officer since December 2016.Trump recently held discussions with some top donors about the campaign over the weekend, including over dinner Saturday with Bernie Marcus, a billionaire co-founder of Home Depot Inc., and Steven Hantler, Marcus’s political strategist.Some donors have suggested to Trump that Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist and an architect of his 2016 victory, should be brought back in a top role advising on the president’s re-election, according to two people familiar with the matter.Bannon joined the administration as a top White House aide but was fired in August 2017, weeks after John Kelly took over as White House chief of staff.Glassner will focus now on campaign legal matters, Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman said in an email late Tuesday night.‪Glassner’s role as COO had already been changing; responsibility for ‬‪organizing the campaign rallies was transferred from Glassner to a team of staffers in February‬.The shakeup, first reported by Axios, comes at a critical moment for the president’s campaign and his administration. Trump has been widely criticized for his responses to the pandemic, which has surged anew in several states; and to the widespread protests that began after the death in police custody of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis.Less than two weeks ago, the president drew a disappointing crowd to a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that had been presented as a revival of his election fortunes.“This is not a reaction to Tulsa,” Murtaugh said. “Michael Glassner is moving into the long-term role of navigating the many legal courses we face, including suits against major media outlets, some of which will likely extend beyond the end of the campaign. He is one of the founding members of Team Trump and his dedication to the success of the president is unmatched.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-campaign-reshuffles-key-staff-hiring-ex-nasa-official/story-IkWHFRGSxAgqX7QNaMYLZP.html
01-07-2020||World||Donald Trump threatens to veto defense bill over bases named after confederate generals||President Donald Trump has threatened to veto the US defense budget legislation for 2021 now being considered by congress if it included provisions renaming army bases and assets honouring confederate figures. The present bill contains a provision, backed by Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, to remove the rename bases and all military assets named after confederates within three years. The legislation was approved by the senate armed services committee of the Republican-ruled Senate earlier this months and its now being debated in the senate.“I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth ‘Pocahontas’ Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill!” Trump wrote in a tweet on Tuesday.There are at least 10 army bases named after generals of the army of the Confederate States of America — 11 states in the south — that had seceded from the United States to fight for and protect slavery in 1860. They returned to the union after a crushing defeat in a civl war that ended in 1865.The demand for replacing their names, and taking down monuments and statutes named after them generally, received fresh impetus in the anti-racism protests and demonstrations following the death of George Floyd, an African American man, under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis.US military leaders were open to a debate renaming them, but they were shut down by Trump, who has opposed it arguing they figures are a part of American heritage. In reality, critics have said, it’s his way to further polarize the country as he seeks to consolidate his support among conservative white voters.Trump tied the renaming bid to Warren, a progressive Democrat, as part of the same effort to rally supporters, in this instance by stoking their fears about the “radical left” as he and his allies have sought to blame for the protests and demonstrations. The two of them also have a history.“American military bases that carry the names of Confederate generals are not named for heroes,” Senator Warren said in a floor speech in the senate Tuesday. “They are not named for men who risked their lives defending the United States and its soldiers. They are named for men who took up arms against the United States of America and killed American soldiers in the defense of slavery.”She added, in a possible swipe at the president, “Those who complain that removing the names of traitors from these bases ignores history ought to learn some history themselves.”But monuments, statutes and insignia going back to the confederacy are tumbling all around the United States, irrespective of Trump. Mississippi state — one of the 11 that had seceded — removed a confederacy emblem from its flag, and Boston in Massachusetts decided Tuesday night to remove a statue depicting a freed slave kneeling at Abraham Lincoln’s feet.And continuing scrutiny of police in the wake of Floyd’s killing, New York city has decided to take away a $1 billion from the police’s budget and reallocate it towards education an social services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-threatens-to-veto-defense-bill-over-bases-named-after-confederate-generals/story-kS4W0hb875ieMhUJeXWmEJ.html
01-07-2020||World||Hong Kong police arrest more than 300 in first protest under new security law||Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas and arrested more than 300 people on Wednesday as protesters took to the streets in defiance of sweeping security legislation introduced by China that critics say is aimed at snuffing out dissent.Beijing unveiled the details of the much-anticipated law late on Tuesday after weeks of uncertainty, pushing China’s freest city and one of the world’s most glittering financial hubs on to a more authoritarian path.As thousands of protesters gathered downtown for an annual rally marking the anniversary of the former British colony’s handover to China in 1997, riot police used pepper spray and fired pellets as they made arrests after crowds spilled into the streets chanting “resist till the end” and “Hong Kong independence”.“I’m scared of going to jail but for justice I have to come out today, I have to stand up,” said one 35-year-old man who gave his name as Seth.Police said they had made more than 300 arrests for illegal assembly and other offences, with nine involving suspected violations of the new law. The law punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, will see mainland security agencies in Hong Kong for the first time and allow for extradition to the mainland for trial.China’s parliament adopted the law in response to protests last year triggered by fears that Beijing was stifling the city’s freedoms, guaranteed by a “one country, two systems” formula agreed when it returned to Chinese rule.Police cited the law for in confronting protesters.“You are displaying flags or banners/chanting slogans/or conducting yourselves with an intent such as secession or subversion, which may constitute offences under the ... national security law,” police said in a message displayed on a purple banner.Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have repeatedly said the legislation is aimed at a few “troublemakers” and will not affect rights and freedoms, nor investor interests.But critics fear it is aimed ending the pro-democracy opposition and will crush the freedoms that are seen as key to Hong Kong’s success as a financial centre. The United States and its Asian and Western allies have criticised the legislation. Britain said it would stand by its word and offer all those in Hong Kong with British National Overseas status a “bespoke” immigration route. Britain and Canada also updated their travel advice for Hong Kong, saying there was an increased risk of detention.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described Wednesday’s protests as heartbreaking and reprimanded HSBC and other banks for supporting the new law, saying the rights of Hong Kong should not be sacrificed for bankers’ bonuses. Police fired water cannon to try to disperse the protesters. A game of cat-and-mouse reminiscent of last year’s often violent demonstrations followed, with protesters blocking roads before running away from riot police charging with batons, only to re-emerge elsewhere.Police posted pictures on Twitter of an officer with a bleeding arm saying he was stabbed by “rioters holding sharp objects”. The suspects fled while bystanders offered no help, police said.On July 1 last year, hundreds of protesters stormed and vandalised the city’s legislature to protest against a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.Those protests evolved into anti-China demonstrations and calls for democracy, paralysing parts of the city and paving the way for Beijing’s new law. ‘BIRTHDAY GIFT’In Beijing, Zhang Xiaoming, executive deputy director of Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, told reporters suspects arrested by a new Beijing-run security office could be tried on the mainland.He said the new office abided by Chinese law and that Hong Kong’s legal system could not be expected to implement the laws of the mainland. Article 55 of the law states that Beijing’s security office in Hong Kong could exercise jurisdiction over “complex” or “serious” cases.“The law is a birthday gift to (Hong Kong) and will show its precious value in the future,” Zhang said, adding the law would not be applied retroactively.(For highlights of the law, click)Speaking at a flag-raising ceremony to mark the handover, the city’s Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, said the law was the most important development since 1997.“It is also an inevitable and prompt decision to restore stability,” Lam said at the harbour-front venue where the last colonial governor, Chris Patten, a staunch critic of the security law, tearfully handed back Hong Kong to China. Some pro-Beijing officials and political commentators say the law is aimed at sealing Hong Kong’s “second return” to the motherland after the first failed to bring residents to heel.Luo Huining, the head of Beijing’s top representative office in Hong Kong, said at the ceremony the law was a “common aspiration” of Hong Kong citizens. Some pro-democracy activists gave up membership of their groups just before the law came into force into force at 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Tuesday, though they called for the campaign to carry on from abroad.“I saw this morning there are celebrations for Hong Kong’s handover, but to me it is a funeral, a funeral for ‘one country two systems’,” said pro-democracy lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-arrest-more-than-300-in-first-protest-under-new-security-law/story-Cv9hiXMUA7hHVholTPrwNO.html
01-07-2020||World||Covid-19: Leicester lockdown spreads dismay among Indians, others||Visitors arriving in Leicester by train are greeted with welcome signs in Hindi, Gujarati, Punjabi and Urdu, among other languages, reflecting the city’s multicultural reality, but dealing with the diversity during the pandemic may have contributed to a spike in new infections. Leicester in the east Midlands has been placed under a lockdown while the rest of England will largely re-open from Saturday, spreading disappointment among its over 3 lakh population, nearly half non-white, including nearly 30 per cent of Indian heritage.Official messages in the city are invariably translated in Indian and other languages, but reports allege that the new infections may be the result of coronavirus-related messages not being translated for the benefit of some sections of the population. Other causes for the spike mentioned include high levels of economic deprivation, congested housing and allegations of exploitation of undocumented migrants and workers by owners of garment and food factories, who reportedly insisted on them working despite being infected.Local resident Prabin Hazarika, brother of cultural icon the late Bhupen Hazarika, said: “The lockdown is a huge disappointment. There were already indications that many people were not taking official advice seriously enough”.Trisha, his wife, added: “I am very angry and also very sorry for the mostly young workers who are exploited by food-processing and other factory owners. No PPE, no social distancing at work. This is earning a bad name for Leicester”.Leicester mayor Peter Soulsby and other leaders said that until recently they did not have data from central health authorities to deal with the situation. The spike in infections was evident in tests carried out outside hospitals, whose figures are not usually published.Labour Behind the Label, a campaign group that works to improve conditions and empower workers in the global garment industry, said in a new report that factories in Leicester are no stranger to illegal working conditions, with numerous reports of low pay and intimidation of vulnerable workers.It said that garment manufacturing is a major industry in Leicester with over 1000 known sites, excluding home-working; most are small workshops, often housed in dilapidated buildings with little investment in building safety and modern ventilation.The group said it had reports that workers have been told to come to work – even when they showed symptoms of Covid-19 – and would lose their jobs if they did not: “We have heard of several incidents, whereby workers who had tested positive were told to come into work, and of managers telling workers not to tell anyone else about positive cases”.According to an analysis by local health officials, more people in Leicester from BAME (Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic) backgrounds are dying than White British people from the virus.This, the analysis adds, is likely due to a combination of factors that include: more BAME people being exposed to/contracting the virus in the first place; they are more exposed to the virus as they form a significant majority of health and social care work force (44% of NHS medical staff) as well as other frontline service professionals (such as delivery drivers and transport staff); and because people from certain ethnic backgrounds are more likely to have long-term health conditions, which likely exacerbate symptoms and/or severity of the virus.Expressing disappointment at the lockdown, former Labour MP from Leicester East, Keith Vaz, said that because of its large South Asian origin population, Leicester has one of the largest number of diabetes sufferers in the UK.Calling for wide testing for diabetes, he said: “What we also need to do is to ramp up the testing for diabetes, it is now established that one of the underlying health conditions that causes Coronavirus complications is those who have diabetes and it is essential that they are tested for diabetes and are able to manage their condition”.Leicester has been held up as a poster city of multiculturalism due to its success in assimilating waves of migrants that included thousands of Indians who were expelled from Idi Amin’s Uganda in the early 1970s. They have since rejuvenated the local economy and gone on to hold senior positions in various walks of life.Local businessman Uday Dholakia said: “Considering the diverse majority communities in Leicester, the communication and conveyance of trust has fallen short. The local media, politicians and community stalwarts have been preoccupied with issues like the Gandhi statue, important though, that is”.“The reality of making a living is a hard reality for many. The public intervention, although commendable at national level, has been patchy locally. Many business and community support networks have been systematically destroyed. Exclusion in all facets of life is obvious to see. Covid-19 has brutally exposed it”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-leicester-lockdown-spreads-dismay-among-indians-others/story-iDhCOTNBuf0n94RhHHHnXP.html
01-07-2020||World||UK hits back over China’s law on Hong Kong; offers citizenship||Terming China’s new security law for Hong Kong a ‘clear and serious breach’ of the agreement that preceded the 1997 handover, the Boris Johnson government on Wednesday hit back at Beijing and offered a new citizenship path to residents of the former British colony.In strongly-worded statements, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and foreign secretary Dominic Raab told parliament that the law violates the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration under which Hong Kong’s autonomy was guaranteed under the ‘one country, two systems’ principle for a period of 50 years. It also violates China’s and Hong Kong laws, they claimed.Raab said the UK will work with partners across the world to ensure that China lives up to its obligations to uphold the rule of international law. The European Union on Wednesday also termed the law as a violation of the pre-handover agreement.Raab told the House of Commons that there will be no limit to the number of people who could use the new pathway and enter the UK, but official estimates put the figure of BNO holders and their dependants at nearly 3 million.The bespoke immigration route will allow BNOs to come to the UK without the current six- month limit, granting them five years limited leave to remain, with the ability to live and work. After these five years, they will be able to apply for settled status and, after a further 12 months with that status, apply for citizenship.Raab, said: “We will not look the other way on Hong Kong, and we will not duck our historic responsibilities to its people. We will honour our commitment to change the arrangements for those holding BNO status and continue to stand up for the people of Hong Kong.”Home Secretary Priti Patel added: “China’s decision to impose national security legislation on Hong Kong is deeply regrettable. Now China have imposed this law we will launch a new immigration route for British Nationals Overseas and their families.“The UK has a historic and moral obligation to British Nationals Overseas in Hong Kong and we will honour our commitment to them.”The BNO status was created by Article 4(1) of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986 which came into effect on 1 July 1987. As of February 2020, there are 349,881 holders of BNO passports; the government estimates there are around 2.9 million BNOs currently in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-clashes-uk-to-offer-citizenship-to-hong-kong-residents/story-7TRYixyDMcFR7nSEzoI1EL.html

Mobile-phone video showed a large plume of smoke rising from the clinic as onlookers gathered. Twenty people escaped via windows and balconies.There was no indication that the incident was linked to a blast at a military installation near Tehran last week, in which a gas leak was also blamed.Iran said that explosion took place at Parchin, which is thought to have played a role in the country’s nuclear program. But The New York Times reported Tuesday that satellite imagery showed the incident actually struck a nearby missile-production facility.Together the explosions jolted a nation being ravaged by the region’s worst coronavirus outbreak while locked in a tense standoff with the USAs the first reports of Tuesday’s explosion surfaced, the latest chapter of their standoff was unfolding. US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo urged the United Nations Security Council to extend an expiring arms embargo on Iran as world powers from China to Europe pushed back against US threats to reimpose UN sanctions on Tehran if the weapons ban lapses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-makes-arrest-over-second-deadly-blast-in-tehran-in-less-than-a-week/story-6b9Zkhqcubg4NAWk2D0PzO.html

01-07-2020||World||Russian vote on extending Putin’s rule until 2036 nears end||Russia’s vote on constitutional amendments that could allow President Vladimir Putin to extend his rule until 2036 entered its final day Wednesday amid widespread reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities.For the first time in Russia, the polls were kept open for a week to help reduce crowds on election day and to bolster turnout amid the coronavirus pandemic — a provision that Kremlin critics saw as just an another way to manipulate the vote.Putin is all but guaranteed to get the result he wants following a massive state propaganda campaign and the changes and the opposition’s failure to mount a coordinated challenge. Ironically, however, the plebiscite aimed at consolidating Putin’s grip could end up eroding his position because of the unconventional methods used to boost participation and the dubious legal basis for the ballot.By Wednesday morning, the turnout already exceeded 55%, according to election officials. But Kremlin critics and independent election observers questioned official figures showing that in some regions up to 85% of eligible voters had turned out.Grigory Melkonyants, co-chair of the independent election monitoring group Golos, called the overall vote numbers “suspicious in general.”“We look at neighboring regions, and anomalies are obvious — there are regions where the turnout is artificially (boosted), there are regions where it is more or less real,” Melkonyants told The Associated Press.The ballot completes a convoluted saga of concealment, deception and surprise that began in January, when Putin first proposed the constitutional changes in a state-of-the-nation address. He offered to broaden the powers of parliament and redistribute authority among the branches of the Russian government, stoking speculation he might continue calling the shots as parliamentary speaker or as chairman of the State Council when his presidential term ends in 2024.The Russian leader’s intentions became clear only hours before a decisive vote in parliament, when legislator Valentina Tereshkova, a Soviet-era cosmonaut who was the first woman in space in 1963, suddenly proposed a measure to let him run two more times. The amendments, which also emphasize the priority of Russian law over international norms, outlaw same-sex marriages and mention “a belief in God” as a core value, quickly sailed through the Kremlin-controlled legislature.Putin, who has been in power for more than two decades — longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin — said he would decide later whether to run again in 2024. He argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants from “darting their eyes in search for possible successors instead of normal, rhythmical work.”Gleb Pavlovsky, a political analyst and former Kremlin political consultant, said Putin’s unrelenting push to hold the vote despite the fact that Russia is reporting thousands of new coronavirus infections each day reflected the Russian leader’s potential vulnerabilities.“Putin lacks confidence in his inner circle and he’s worried about the future,” Pavlovsky said. “He wants an irrefutable proof of public support.”Even though parliamentary approval was enough to make it law, the 67-year-old Russian president put his constitutional plan to voters in a bid to showcase his broad support and add a democratic veneer to the changes. His maneuver backfired weeks later when the coronavirus pandemic engulfed Russia, forcing Putin to postpone the plebiscite originally scheduled for April 22.The delay made Putin’s campaign blitz lose momentum and left his constitutional reform plan hanging as the damage from the virus mounted and public discontent grew. Plummeting incomes and rising unemployment during Russia’s outbreak have dented Putin’s approval ratings, which sank to 59% during Russia’s outbreak, the lowest level since his ascent to power, according to the Levada Center, Russia’s top independent pollster.Amid the uncertainty, Putin rescheduled the vote immediately upon seeing the first signs of a slowdown in Russia’s infection rate even though the daily confirmed cases remains high.Moscow-based political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann said the Kremlin had faced a difficult dilemma. Holding the vote sooner would have brought accusations of jeopardizing public health for political ends, while delaying it further raised the risks of defeat, she said.“A late vote could have been lost. Holding it in the autumn would have been too risky,” Schulmann said.Schulmann argued that the Kremlin’s focus isn’t so much on boosting overall turnout but rather on increasing attendance by public sector workers.The authorities have mounted a sweeping effort to persuade teachers, doctors, workers at public sector enterprises and others who are paid by the state to cast ballots. Reports surfaced from many corners of the vast country that managers were coercing people to vote.Kremlin critics and independent monitors pointed out that the relentless pressure on voters coupled with new opportunities for manipulations from a week of early voting eroded the standards of voting to a new low.The Golos monitoring group noted unusual differences between neighboring regions: in the Siberian republic of Tyva over 73% voted during the first five days, while in the neighboring Irkutsk region the turnout was around 22% and in the neighboring republic of Altai it was under 33%.“These differences can be explained only by forcing people to vote in certain areas or by rigging,” Golos said.Monitoring the vote became more challenging due to hygiene requirements and more arcane rules for election observers. The Kremlin also has used other tactics to increase turnout and support for the amendments.Prizes ranging from gift certificates to cars and apartments were offered as an encouragement, giant billboards went up across Russia and celebrities posted ads for the “yes” vote on social media. Two regions with large numbers of voters — Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod — allowed electronic balloting and voters with Russian passports from eastern Ukraine were brought across the border in buses to vote.Most observers expect the Kremlin to get its way, regardless of the opposition’s strategies.“People are angry at the government, but they still don’t have any alternative to Putin,” Pavlovsky said.He noted, however, that the unusual methods used by authorities to boost turnout and get the result Putin wants will undermine the legitimacy of the vote.“The procedure has been distorted and simplified to the point when it would be difficult to trust the figures,” Pavlovsky said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-vote-on-extending-putin-s-rule-until-2036-nears-end/story-XxffakjGaUsrswkI0MXxZO.html
01-07-2020||World||UK beckons scientists, students with better visa offer, new Office for Talent||Extending the post-study work visa offer from two to three years for those completing PhD from 2021 and setting up a dedicated Office for Talent in No 10, Downing Street, are among a range of initiatives announced by the Boris Johnson government on Wednesday.Keen to attract global talent after the Brexit transition period ends on December 31, the cross-department Office for Talent will help cut unnecessary red-tape in the UK’s visa system for scientists, students, researchers and entrepreneurs. EU and non-EU citizens will be treated at par for visa purposes from January 1.Under the revived post-study work arrangement, Indian and other international students will be able to stay in the UK for two years after completing studies in 2021, but those at PhD level will be able to stay on for three years, officials said.The Office for Talent, they added, begins work immediately to review the effectiveness of the current rules and ensure excellent customer service across the immigration system, so that it is simple, easy, and quick. It will also help those coming to the UK better understand the opportunities on offer and break down any barriers they might face.The government also plans to improve the new points-based immigration system when it is implemented later this year, including extending the window in which prospective students can make visa applications, removing study time limits at postgraduate level and allowing all students to switch any other type of visa from within the UK.The initiatives, outlined in the government’s Research and Development Roadmap by business secretary Alok Sharma, is aimed at creating the conditions for ground-breaking research, attracting global talent, and cutting unnecessary red tape.Sharma said: “The UK has a strong history of turning new ideas into revolutionary technologies – from penicillin to graphene and the world wide web. Our vision builds on these incredible successes to cement Britain’s reputation as a global science superpower”.“The R&D Roadmap sets out our plan to attract global talent, cut unnecessary red tape and ensure our best minds get the support they need to solve the biggest challenges of our time”.The initiatives include funding, international collaboration and an innovation fellowship programme sponsored by the prime minister’s office.Science minister Amanda Solloway said: “Coronavirus has shown us the agility, creativity and innovative thinking of our world-leading institutions, scientists and researchers to tackle this disease and save people’s lives. We want to harness this expertise to rejuvenate science and research across the UK, building a future that is greener, safer and healthier”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-beckons-scientists-students-with-new-office-for-talent/story-L7r1yr5oxwu3YqnOFL8JFJ.html
01-07-2020||World||UN says Afghan army mistakenly fired mortars in southern Helmand province that killed 23||The UN mission in Afghanistan said its findings indicate the Afghan military had mistakenly fired the mortars this week at a busy market in southern Helmand province that inflicted heavy civilian casualties.A car bombing and mortar shells struck the market in Sangin district on Monday, killing 23 people, including children, according to a statement from a provincial governor’s office. Both the Taliban and the Afghan military blamed each other for the attack.A series of tweets late Tuesday from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, said that “multiple credible sources” have asserted that the Afghan army fired the “mortars in response to Taliban fire, missing (the) intended target.” That suggests there was a battle between the Taliban and Afghan forces at the time of the attack.The UN did not elaborate how its mission reached those findings.The tweets said both parties in the war in Afghanistan “must stop fighting in civilian-populated areas” as such fighting has caused thousands of civilian casualties. UNAMA also urged the Afghan government “to set up independent investigation team for Monday’s incident” and offered its assistance.The Afghan government has insisted there was no military activity in the Taliban-controlled area at the time of the attack. The Defense Ministry responded on Wednesday to the UN tweets by repeating that statement, adding that Afghan mortars cannot reach the Sangin market from their checkpoints.Civilians are often caught in the crossfire of the fighting — even as Afghan forces say they are targeting the insurgents, not civilians, in anti-militant operations. A UN report in May blamed the Taliban for killing or wounding a total of 208 civilians in April and also said that operations carried out by Afghan forces had killed or wounded 172 civilians.The attack in Helmand came as Washington’s special peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, is again touring the region to try and push the peace process forward. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a Monday video conference with the Taliban pressed the insurgents to reduce violence in Afghanistan.There have been expectations that talks between Afghan government representatives and the Taliban could possibly start this month in Doha, Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-afghan-army-mistakenly-fired-mortars-in-southern-helmand-province-that-killed-23/story-CBgYbHP8fdZy1TQ9oPOjLO.html

01-07-2020||World||Donald Trump faces pressure over Russia bounties to kill US troops||President Donald Trump on Tuesday came under growing pressure to respond to allegations that Russia offered bounties for killing American troops in Afghanistan, with Democrats demanding answers and accusing Trump of bowing to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the risk of US soldiers’ lives.Frustrated House Democrats returning from a briefing at the White House said they learned nothing new about American intelligence assessments that suggested Russia was making overtures to militants as the US and the Taliban held talks to end the conflict in Afghanistan. Senate Republicans who attended a separate briefing largely defended the president, arguing along with the White House that the intelligence was unverified.The intelligence assessments were first reported by The New York Times, then confirmed to The Associated Press by American intelligence officials and others with knowledge of the matter.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that Trump had been briefed on the intelligence, a day after saying he hadn’t because it had not been verified. McEnany added that there were still reservations within the intelligence community on the veracity of the allegations.“Make no mistake. This president will always protect American troops,” she said.Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and a small group of other House Democrats met with White House officials as Trump downplayed the allegations. The Democrats questioned why Trump wouldn’t have been briefed sooner and pushed White House officials to have the president make a strong statement about the matter.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, one of the Democrats who attended the briefing, said it was “inexplicable” why Trump won’t say publicly that he is working to get to the bottom of the issue and why he won’t call out Putin. He said Trump’s defense that he hadn’t been briefed was inexcusable.“Many of us do not understand his affinity for that autocratic ruler who means our nation ill,” Schiff said.Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., a freshman and former Navy helicopter pilot and Russia policy officer, said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows briefed the group. She said the Democrats told the White House briefers that the president should make a statement.“These are very concerning allegations and if they’re true, Russia is going to face repercussions,” Sherrill said. “We really pushed that strongly in the meeting.” She wouldn’t say how the White House officials reacted or say if the briefers told the Democrats that in fact Trump had been briefed.Trump and his aides set a high bar for briefing a president since it is rare for intelligence to be confirmed without a shadow of doubt before it is presented to senior government decision-makers.McEnany declined to say why a different standard of confidence in the intelligence might apply to briefing lawmakers than for bringing information to the president.Some House Republicans who were briefed by the White House on Monday also said they left with questions.Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said the panel would “leave no stone unturned” in seeking further information. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming insisted there would be “ramifications” for any targeting of Americans.But Senate Republicans seemed less concerned and questioned the media reports. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he didn’t think Trump should be “subjected to every rumour.” “Conclusions, apparently, were not reached,” McConnell said.The White House was working to schedule a briefing for Wednesday with McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the top Republicans and Democrats on the two intelligence committees according to a person familiar with the talks. The person declined to be identified because the so-called “Gang of 8” briefing will be classified. That group receives the most sensitive information in regular meetings with administration officials.A separate group of Senate Republicans briefed in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday appeared mostly satisfied with the answers they received. Senate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said he was “convinced” Trump hadn’t known about the intelligence. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Trump “can’t be made aware of every piece of unverified intelligence.” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Marco Rubio said he believed the US was prepared “to do everything possible to protect our men or women stationed abroad, from a variety of threats.” Some Republican senators did express frustration.Nebraska Republican Ben Sasse, a member of the intelligence panel, said Monday evening that Congress should focus on finding out who knew what, and when, “and did the commander in chief know? And if not, how the hell not?” While Russian meddling in Afghanistan isn’t new, officials said Russian operatives became more aggressive in their desire to contract with the Taliban and members of the Haqqani Network, a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan and designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2012.The intelligence community has been investigating an April 2019 attack on an American convoy that killed three US Marines after a car rigged with explosives detonated near their armored vehicles as they traveled back to Bagram Airfield, the largest US military installation in Afghanistan, officials told the AP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-faces-pressure-over-russia-bounties-to-kill-us-troops/story-k20vC3PIt6w98tGb0q0GJI.html
01-07-2020||World||China to foreign critics: Hong Kong law ‘none of your business’||China on Wednesday slammed international criticism over a controversial new national security law for Hong Kong, saying other countries should keep their noses out.Western governments and critics have warned the new law will curb the city’s freedoms and undermine its “One Country, Two Systems” governance scheme, which technically allows freedoms unseen on the mainland.But Beijing officials rebuffed the criticism of the law at a press conference.“What’s this got to do with you?” said Zhang Xiaoming of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office of the State Council. “It’s none of your business”.Officials insisted there had been wide consultation with members of Hong Kong society and hit back at criticism it was undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy.“If what we want is one country one system, it would have been simple,” Zhang said. “We are completely able to impose the criminal law, the criminal procedure and the national security law and other national laws on Hong Kong. “Why would we need to put so much effort into formulating a national security law tailor-made for Hong Kong?And he lashed out at suggestions of punishment from other nations.“As for... some countries now saying that they will impose severe sanctions on some Chinese officials, I think this is the logic of bandits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-foreign-critics-hong-kong-law-none-of-your-business/story-RunDeQxPyRRCISO5odRkQP.html
01-07-2020||World||Suspects arrested in Hong Kong by central security office to be tried in mainland, face life in jail||Suspects arrested by the mainland’s new security office to be set up in Hong Kong under the controversial new law will be tried in the mainland, Zhang Xiaoming from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said on Wednesday.The city’s legal system cannot be expected to implement the laws of the mainland, Zhang told a press conference on the national security law in Beijing.Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, had erupted in violent protests in June last year over an extradition bill that, if implemented, could have brought suspects to the mainland for trial.That bill was subsequently withdrawn but with the new law, which came into effect Tuesday, Beijing has pushed it through anyway.There’s unlikely to be similar protests against the new law, which was signed into a legislation by President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, as it could attract stringent punishment. Crimes committed in Hong Kong related to secession, subversion, terrorism and working with foreign forces will be punishable up to life in prison, as Beijing on Wednesday revealed details of the controversial new security law that came into effect in the financial hub Tuesday night.What is likely to increase criticism of the law is that the activities of a new national security agency to be set up in Hong Kong will be beyond the jurisdiction of the local government.Activities of both permanent and non-permanent residents will come under the jurisdiction of the law.The new law will give Beijing – the seat of the Communist Party of China-ruled government – overarching responsibility for Hong Kong’s national security affairs.Damaging certain transportation vehicles, equipment will be considered an act of terrorism, the new law says, adding that authorities can monitor and wire-tap persons suspected of endangering national security.The full text of the legislation Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) was put out hours after Xi signed the bill into law.“Convicted criminals will be disqualified from running for public office, and people in public office who are found guilty of the crimes will be removed from their posts,” a text of the law published by official news agency, Xinhua, early on Wednesday said.“The law shall apply to acts committed after its entry into force for the purpose of conviction and imposition of punishment,” according to its provision.The territory of Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997.Under a unique Sino-British agreement supposed to protect certain freedoms that people in mainland China do not enjoy - including freedom of speech and the freedom to gather.Critics say the new law could curb and crush exactly those freedoms and jail people for showing dissent.Described by Beijing as a “sword” hanging over the heads of those endangering national security, the law has taken effect just six weeks since it was first unveiled.Hong Kong’s leader, the pro-Beijing chief executive Carrie Lam, defended the law, saying it filled a “gaping hole” in national security.Lam said the law will only target a “small minority of illegal, criminal acts and activities”.“Rights and freedoms including freedom of speech, of the press, of publication, of assembly and demonstration, will be protected in accordance with the law,” the new legislation says. The law gives Beijing jurisdiction over “very serious” national security crimes.With 66 articles in six chapters, the law lays down the duties and government bodies of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security and four categories of offences -- secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security -- and their corresponding penalties.Prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong announced he’s stepping down as leader of his anti-Beijing group Demosisto, soon after China passed the controversial law.“After much internal deliberation, we have decided to disband and cease all operations as a group, given the circumstances,” Demosisto said on Twitter.Chinese foreign ministry said it will take necessary countermeasures to “firmly safeguard” its national interests in response to a decision by the US to end special treatment for Hong Kong over the new law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/life-imprisonment-for-breaking-new-beijing-imposed-law-in-hong-kong/story-BOZA7vziO0SWM3MLtKzMXI.html
01-07-2020||World||Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree: November election could be corrupt||President Donald Trump and his challenger, Joe Biden, have found something they agree on: The November election could be rife with corruption because of how officials handle the voting process.Of course, the Republican incumbent and his Democratic rival place the prospective blame in different places. Each points at the other’s party.“I really, really, really believe we’re on the cusp of what could be the most corrupt process that we’ve seen in a general election if we don’t monitor this every single second,” Biden told donors Tuesday evening as he discussed Trump’s and many Republicans’ opposition to expanding early voting and mail-in voting amid the Covid-19 pandemic.That’s similar language to what Trump has tweeted to his millions of social media followers in recent weeks. “Mail-in voting … will lead to the most corrupt election in USA history,” Trump declared Sunday.The president previously argued that mail-balloting allows voters to “cheat.” One such tweet drew a rare, special tag from Twitter that directed readers to mail-voting facts that rebutted the president’s unsupported claims about voter fraud. There are instances of voter fraud in the US, most often found in local or smaller jurisdictional elections, but there is no evidence of widespread fraud that would tilt statewide or national results.Biden noted Tuesday that Trump himself has voted using mail ballots, most recently using Florida’s absentee process to cast his Republican primary ballot in March.Similar word choice aside, Biden’s and Trump’s disparate framing of voting by mail tracks the long-running, largely partisan fight over ballot access and election security. Republicans nationally have pushed aggressive culling of voter rolls, identification requirements that are arduous for some voters, and strict signature and witness rules for absentee ballots. GOP officials cast such rules as necessary fraud prevention; Democrats call them systemic voter suppression.“We have got to keep ringing the bell about this all the way to the election,” Biden said, adding that his campaign and the Democratic Party have put together a team of hundreds of lawyers and volunteers to focus on voter protection and education. “It’s the greatest concern I have,” Biden said, “not just for my race, but for races up and down the ballot.”Biden singled out Trump’s opposition to injecting federal aid into the US Postal Service. “He’s talking about defunding the post office so they can’t deliver mail-in ballots,” Biden said.The postal agency doesn’t actually get direct taxpayer support for normal operations, as Biden’s dig suggested. But Covid-19 has devastated its already precarious finances, and Congress has considered an aid package. Trump’s White House blocked one bailout effort earlier this year and wants to attach strings to any taxpayer assistance.At the time, Biden said that he believed Trump was pushing a narrative to cloud the results in November should the president lose. Biden went so far in that April 23 event as to suggest Trump might attempt to postpone the election. Biden offered no evidence of that claim.Besides Trump’s opposition to mail ballots, Biden declared Tuesday that dozens of proposals from state lawmakers around the country amount to “Jim Crow-type efforts to restrict access to voting.” He did not elaborate. But he promised to “restore the Voting Rights Act,” the 1965 civil rights law that, until a 2013 Supreme Court ruling, required many Southern states and some counties outside the South to get federal approval for all changes to election rules and procedures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-and-donald-trump-agree-november-election-could-be-corrupt/story-hfwaqHAC3HO8XCwQjkQTuI.html

At the successful event, President trump discussed ways in which he’s been working with Prime Minister Modi,” Carter said.“Some of these topics include security and defense cooperation, energy, trade and promoting women entrepreneurs,” the Republican lawmaker from Texas said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressman-applauds-joint-efforts-of-india-united-states-against-terror/story-kiC7y7HVnA4qfdCyqBk7cP.html
01-07-2020||World||Boston’s art commission to remove statue of slave kneeling before Lincoln||Boston’s arts commission voted unanimously Tuesday night to remove a statue that depicts a freed slave kneeling at Abraham Lincoln’s feet.The commission had fielded escalating complaints about the Emancipation Memorial, also known as the Emancipation Group and the Freedman’s Memorial, as a nation confronting racial injustice rethinks old imagery.The statue has stood in a park just off Boston Common since 1879. It’s a copy of an identical monument that was erected in Washington, D.C., three years earlier. The copy was installed in Boston because the city was home to the statue’s white creator, Thomas Ball.Although the monument was created to celebrate the freeing of slaves in America, its design disturbed many who objected to the optics of a Black man kneeling before Lincoln.“What I heard today is that it hurts to look at this piece, and in the Boston landscape, we should not have works that bring shame to any groups of people,” said Ekua Holmes, vice chairperson of the arts commission.“After engaging in a public process, it’s clear that residents and visitors to Boston have been uncomfortable with this statue,” Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said in a statement.More than 12,000 people had signed a petition demanding the statue’s removal. Officials did not immediately set a date to take it down, and said details would be worked out at their next meeting on July 14.The memorial has been on Boston’s radar at least since 2018, when it launched a comprehensive review of whether public sculptures, monuments and other artworks reflected the city’s diversity and didn’t offend communities of colour. The arts commission said it was paying extra attention to works with “problematic histories.”“As we continue our work to make Boston a more equitable and just city, it’s important that we look at the stories being told by the public art in all of our neighbourhoods,” Walsh said.Freed Black donors paid for the original in Washington; white politician and circus showman Moses Kimball financed the copy in Boston. The inscription on both reads: “A race set free and the country at peace. Lincoln rests from his labors.”But Blacks weren’t part of the design process, and the memorial’s central visual takeaway — a Black man kneeling before his white saviour — has had people cringing for years.Protesters have vowed to tear down the original statue in Washington, which has been protected by National Guard troops guarding it and other monuments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boston-s-art-commission-to-remove-statue-of-slave-kneeling-before-lincoln/story-QizpsK77bVSDEwFsptgILO.html

The prohibition was originally announced on March 16 and the only exemption is for those coming from the United States for “essential” reasons.The announcement came from a spokesperson for the Canada Border Services Agency, who stated that the agency has “implemented travel restrictions across all ports of entry in all modes of transportation - land, sea, air and rail. All travel of an optional or discretionary nature, including tourism and recreation, is covered by these measures.”Exceptions have also been made during this period - some repatriation flights took stranded Indians back home - but those are facilitated at a government-to-government level.The ban instituted in March had been announced by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and he had recently indicated it would remain in place, as he said during a media briefing that the federal government was “going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders.”Non-essential travel between Canada and the United States remains paused till later in the month, while stringent quarantine measures applied to the few which allowed entry into the country have also been extended till the end of July.Travellers like Canadians of Indian origin, permanent residents or immediate family members will have to confirm they have a suitable place to self-isolate for a mandatory 14-day period, otherwise they may be placed in a government-approved facility.This announcement came even as the European Union announced that similar travel restrictions were being lifted for citizens of 14 nations, including Canada. However, it does not appear that Canada will immediately reciprocate by opening up travel to the country for EU residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-canada-extends-ban-on-foreign-travellers-till-july-31/story-xbuYSQ8P6XanPAkWxkj9LP.html
01-07-2020||World||Israeli PM Netanyahu signals delay in West Bank annexation plan||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that discussions with the US on his plan to annex occupied West Bank territory would continue “in the coming days”, indicating he would miss a July 1 target date for beginning the controversial process.Netanyahu made the comments on Tuesday shortly after wrapping up talks with White House envoy Avi Berkowitz and the US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. The sides have been holding talks for several months on finalizing a map spelling out which areas of the West Bank will be annexed by Israel.“I spoke about the question of sovereignty, which we are working on these days and we will continue to work on in the coming days,” Netanyahu said.Netanyahu has been eager to begin annexing West Bank territory in line with President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan. The plan, unveiled in January, envisions turning over some 30 per cent of the territory under permanent Israeli control, while giving the Palestinians autonomy in the remaining land.But the plan to redraw the Mideast map has come under fierce international criticism. The UN secretary-general, the European Union and key Arab countries have all said Israeli annexation would violate international law and undermine the goal of establishing a viable independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.The Palestinians, who seek all of the West Bank as part of a future state, have rejected the Trump plan.Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. The international community considers the territory to be occupied, and for Israel’s more than 120 settlements to be illegal.But Trump has taken a far more conciliatory line than his Republican and Democratic predecessors. Netanyahu, a close ally of Trump, has said Israel must take advantage of what he calls a “historic opportunity”, and is eager to move forward before the November presidential election.In an unsourced report, Israel’s public broadcaster Kan published a graphic on Tuesday showing what it said was proposed Israeli modifications to the initial annexation map proposed by Trump.The map calls for turning over additional West Bank territory allocated to the Palestinians, specifically land surrounding settlements and highways that is marked in green. In return, it proposes “compensating” the Palestinians with territory, marked in yellow, the Trump proposal had allocated to Israel.Israel’s Channel 12 TV reported that the American negotiators are asking Israel to make “a significant step” as a gesture to the Palestinians, such as handing over West Bank territory to Palestinian control comparable to that annexed.Israel currently has full control over 60 per cent of the West Bank. That report also was unsourced.Netanyahu says his goal of annexing all the settlements, as well as the strategic Jordan Valley, is necessary to protect Israeli security. He also has defended it in religious terms, saying the territories are part of the biblical Land of Israel.Besides international opposition, Netanyahu has encountered some resistance from his governing partner, Defense Minister Benny Gantz.The coalition agreement for their new government, which took office in May, gives Netanyahu the authority to present an annexation proposal after Wednesday. But US officials have said they do not want to move forward with a plan unless the two leaders are in agreement.Gantz, who also holds the title of alternate prime minister, said on Monday that the July 1 target date was not “sacred”. He also said that annexation “will wait” while the government grapples with Israel’s health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-netanyahu-signals-delay-in-west-bank-annexation-plan/story-0kfjUY2PPP5o1dZwtkclOJ.html

As Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, I know she will serve the people of her province and our country well, and continue to be a source of inspiration for all Canadians,” the Prime Minister said in a statement. Lakhani, a follower of the Ismaili sect, was born in Uganda but her family was forced to leave after the Indian-origin community in the African country was expelled by dictator Idi Amin. She has a degree in Clinical Biochemistry from the University of Manchester. She later moved to Edmonton in 1977, along with her husband. They have two daughters.A Lt Governor in Canada is the equivalent of a Governor in India and is nominated by the federal government. While the role is largely ceremonial, the appointment is symbolic of diversity in how leadership in the country looks.Among those who welcomed her appointment was the Premier of Alberta Jason Kenney, who tweeted, “Ms. Lakhani has a remarkable background in business and volunteerism, reflecting the Alberta culture of enterprise and community.”The PMO noted she was a “long-time community advocate and successful business owner” who has dedicated herself to “helping people in need and those who face obstacles to success in our society. Through her work to advance education, health care, women’s empowerment, human rights, and support for new immigrants, she continues to be a champion of diversity, pluralism, and inclusion.”She was a founding member of ‘NorQuest College’s 1000 Women: A Million Possibilities’ movement and has been on its advisory committee and board for the past decade. Lakhani is also associated with the Aga Khan Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/salma-lakhani-appointed-lieutenant-governor-of-alberta-first-muslim-in-canada-to-hold-post/story-JEQdeP6RfVUFa6vW0lkyeI.html
01-07-2020||World||PIA failed to develop software for safety data management within stipulated time: Report||The European Union Aviation Safety Agency on Monday (local time) suspended flight operations of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) for a period of six months after it failed to fully develop its software application for safety data management within the earlier given stipulated time.This order has been issued after Pakistan’s Minister for Aviation Ghulam Sarwar Khan disclosed in the National Assembly that many pilots have dubious licenses following which the PIA announced that 141 pilots holding fraudulent licenses have been grounded.“The software application, proposed by the operator, for safety data management, risk assessment and analysis including the statistical analysis and the ability to identify repeated or similar hazards/occurrences is still under development. The Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited indicated that the software development completion requires additional three to four months, which cannot be granted by the EASA, as EASA considers that the operator has been granted a sufficient timeline to eliminate the issues (more than nine months since the issuance of the finding),” said EASA in its letter.It further said that the submitted documents related to the measurement of safety performance indicators (SPIs) have revealed that some of the SPIs were controlled by different departments with different target settings. “Furthermore, PIA Corporation Limited provided evidence of the correction of the calculation errors of the SPIs for 2018, where EASA found some major inconsistencies, and even illogical, for instance, the input for the SPIs are performed in the flight hours, but the formula calculates the number of landings. Furthermore, the submitted corporate SPIs does not contain all indicators measured by the departments themselves.”EASA had already granted the PIA Corporation Limited an extension of the corrective action plans (CAP) implementation deadline from May 24 to June 17. “Following the recent tragic events that M/S Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited has faced, including flight PK8303 on 22 May 2020 and the initial findings laid down in the preliminary accident report showing successive breaches of multiple layers of safety defences in the safety management system, EASA is concerned that the safety management system is not achieving its primary objective,” the letter read.While the PIA has claimed that it has grounded all pilots that were part of the list of fraudulent license holders compiled by the Pakistani authorities, the EASA said that “there are strong indications that a high number of Pakistani pilot licences are invalid.”“This decision enters into force on Wednesday, 1 July 2020 and has an immediate direct effect on any existing operating permits already issued by the Member States for the M/S Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited’s operations into, within or out of territories to which the EU Treaty applies, and Member States may issue new permits only when the suspension is lifted by EASA.”“When the period of six months from the date of suspension has expired, EASA may extend the suspension period for an additional 3 months. EASA shall revoke the TCO Authorisation when the suspension period is over if the EASA is not satisfied that successful corrective action has been taken,” the EASA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pia-failed-to-develop-software-for-safety-data-management-within-stipulated-time-report/story-m5XiJc1crKn3SUpuBKLBCN.html

Participants chanted slogans echoing demands from protesters last year for political reform and an investigation into alleged police abuses.The law directly targets some of the actions of anti-government protesters last year, which included attacks on government offices and police stations, damage to subway stations, and the shutdown of the city’s international airport. Acts of vandalism against government facilities or public transport can be prosecuted as subversion or terrorism, while anyone taking part in activities deemed as secessionist would also be in violation of the new law.The new national security law further blurs the distinction between the legal systems of semi-autonomous Hong Kong, which maintained aspects of British law after the 1997 handover, and the mainland’s authoritarian Communist Party system.Its passage comes after Hong Kong’s legislature in early June made it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem.President Xi Jinping signed a presidential order making the law take effect after its approval by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp legislature, and it has been added to the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s constitution.Under the law, those found guilty of inciting secessionist, subversive, terrorist activities and colluding with foreign forces could face life imprisonment if they are deemed masterminds of such activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-security-law-s-passage-hong-kong-marks-china-s-rule/story-oQID2f2h2GH30LX8n5To4O.html
01-07-2020||World||Brazils new education minister resigns amid scrutiny of his academic credentials||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s latest education minister reportedly offered his resignation Tuesday just days after his appointment, creating a new headache for the embattled leader as he struggles to start a new chapter at the ministry and shore up flagging support.Economist Carlos Alberto Decotelli, facing a slew of allegations that he embellished his academic credentials, tendered his resignation in the afternoon, Brazilian media reported. The press offices of Brazil’s presidency and education ministry didn’t respond to The Associated Press’ requests to comment on whether Bolsonaro accepted.But late Monday, Bolsonaro said in a Facebook posting: “Due to curricular inadequacies the professor (Decotelli) is facing all kinds of delegitimization.”The president announced on social media Thursday that Decotelli would take over the education ministry, and Bolsonaro highlighted degrees the professor had from universities in Brazil and abroad. Soon enough, three of those institutions began disavowing the achievements of Decotelli, who was yet to be sworn in.In the most recent case, the Getulio Vargas Foundation said Tuesday the would-be minister was neither a researcher nor a professor at the Brazilian university as had been reflected in Decotelli’s resume shared by the government. Rather, he had acted as a collaborating professor in post-graduate courses, the school said in a statement.“The professor acted only in courses of continued education, in programs for executive development and not as a professor in any of the FGV’s schools,” the statement said.Decotelli also had included on his resume a doctorate from the University of Rosario in Argentina, but the rector of that institution said on Twitter last week that he hadn’t finished his studies.The nominee also claimed a post-doctoral degree from the University of Wuppertal in Germany. Local television network Globo cited a statement from the university saying Decotelli obtained no such degree.Decotelli’s claimed credentials and abrupt resignation create discomfort for Bolsonaro as he seeks to ease tensions with other government branches and reverse rising disapproval numbers prompted by the spiraling Covid-19 pandemic.The president took office in 2019 with promises to appoint ministers with technical expertise rather than dole out positions to curry political favour. Opponents have railed on the education ministry for shortcomings in that regard, with the first minister fired after four months and the second minister frequently criticized for focusing more on waging culture wars than coordinating educational policy.Decotelli had been slated to become Bolsonaro’s first Black minister, replacing Abraham Weintraub, who is one of the targets of an investigation into a network of people that allegedly spreads defamatory and threatening social media posts about Supreme Court justices. Weintraub in a Cabinet meeting on April 22 called the members of the top court “bums” and said he supported jailing them, according to video of the meeting released last month.The Supreme Court voted June 17 to keep Weintraub under investigation and days later he resigned his Cabinet post and traveled to the US, where the Brazilian government intends for him to assume a position at the World Bank.Bolsonaro last week met with potential candidates to helm the education ministry, which commands one of the largest ministerial budgets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-new-education-minister-resigns-amid-scrutiny-of-his-academic-credentials/story-csXMxIDULMIgiNXiS4kU0J.html
01-07-2020||World||Nepal Opposition take to streets against discriminative Citizenship Act||The Nepal’s opposition Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) on Tuesday staged nationwide protests against the new Citizenship Bill claiming it to have targeted the minority groups of the nation.The Opposition claimed that the new Citizenship Bill has been targeting LGBTQ+, foreign women married onto Nepalese men, and the ex-Gurkhas who want to get a Nepal Citizenship.“The central government has shifted its focus from controlling the coronavirus situation to the Citizenship Amendment Bill. According to Clause 5.1 of the current Citizenship Act, foreign women are immediately eligible for citizenship upon marriage to a Nepalese man while there are no provisions for a foreign man who gets married to Nepalese women,” Hishila Yami Bhattarai, one of the leaders of JSP told ANI.A meeting of Parliamentary Committee on June 21 had endorsed a new bill proposing a 7 year probation period for women marrying Nepalese men. The Nepal Congress and JSP had opposed provision calling it unconstitutional as “it goes against the provision of interim constitution 2006.”“Provisions which had continued from a long time and endorsed on by themselves, today they are attempting to change it with 7-year probation. Are they trying on to show themselves as nationalists?” Bhattarai questioned.Speaking on the LGBTQ+, she said, “If the sexual minorities are required to undergo medical tests (to acquire citizenship) then it also should be applicable for men and women too. What are they trying to show the world by making them undergo such tests?”She said that the government has become hostile to the Gorkha Forces who have already acquired citizenship by serving the country. “We want that they and their family members be given citizenship.”Nepal politics have remained undecided over the Citizenship Act for two years despite holding as many as 140 meetings over it by the same committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-opposition-take-to-streets-against-discriminative-citizenship-act/story-OFJDo0V0rK19sn7mjW31ZI.html
01-07-2020||World||Security Council trying again for first Covid-19 resolution||The UN Security Council is trying again to reach agreement on its first resolution on Covid-19 since the coronavirus started circling the global in February, after a lengthy dispute between the US and China over mentioning the World Health Organization.A revised draft resolution by France and China was submitted for a vote on Tuesday and the result is expected to be announced on Wednesday.The draft resolution backs Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ March 23 call for global cease-fires to tackle the pandemic, and demands an “immediate cessation of hostilities” in all conflicts on its agenda including Syria, Yemen, Libya, South Sudan and Congo.It calls on all warring parties “to engage immediately in a durable humanitarian pause for at least 90 consecutive days” to enable the safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and medical evacuations.The draft resolution states that these measures do not apply to military operations against the Islamic State and al-Qaida extremist groups and their affiliates.Guterres told a press conference last Thursday that his appeal for a global ceasefire has been endorsed by nearly 180 countries, more than 20 armed groups, religious leaders and millions of members of civil society.“The difficulty is to implement it,” he said.The secretary-general said he and UN envoys are working together “to establish effective cease-fires and doing everything possible to overcome the legacy of long-lasting conflicts with deep mistrust among the parties and spoilers with a vested interest in disruption”.Repeated attempts to adopt a Security Council resolution have been stymied over a reference to the World Health Organization.President Donald Trump suspended funding to WHO in early April, accusing the UN health agency of failing to stop the virus from spreading when it first surfaced in China. He said it “must be held accountable”, and accused WHO of parroting Beijing.China strongly supports WHO and insisted that its role in calling for global action on Covid-19 be included in any resolution, diplomats said, while the US insisted on a reference to “transparency” on Covid-19 and no mention of the WHO.The draft being put to a vote doesn’t mention either the WHO, a UN health agency, or transparency.But it does take note of a resolution adopted April 2 by the 193-member UN General Assembly which “calls for intensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat the pandemic, including by exchanging information, scientific knowledge and best practices and by applying the relevant guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization”.That resolution recognizes “the unprecedented effects” of the pandemic and calls for “intensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat” the new coronavirus.The General Assembly adopted another resolution on April 20 urging global action to rapidly scale up development, manufacturing and access to medicine, vaccines and medical equipment to confront the pandemic.While General Assembly resolutions reflect the opinion of governments around the world, they are not legally binding. By contrast, Security Council resolutions are legally binding.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday that a council resolution is very important.“The Security Council has primacy in the UN over issues of peace and security,” he said. “A strong unified statement from that body supporting the secretary general’s call for a global cease-fire, I think, would go a long way in, hopefully, making a call for a cease-fire a reality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-council-trying-again-for-first-covid-19-resolution/story-65Yj2RIC99j30sbGRRBMNK.html

Maleki added that firefighters had rescued 20 people.Video posted online appeared to show more than one explosion and thick black smoke rising from the flames.Hamidreza Goudarzi, deputy Tehran governor, told state TV that a leak from medical gas tanks in the building was the cause of the explosion and fire.People in nearby Tajrish Bazaar rushed to the scene, impeding a rescue operation, authorities said. Videos on social media showed people gathered outside of the building.State TV said there could be more explosions because there were a number of oxygen tanks remaining in the medical centre.Witness Marjan Haghighi told The Associated Press that police blocked roads to the neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosion-from-gas-leak-at-clinic-in-iran-s-tehran-kills-19/story-vBpNPo7kfwuIco16rvGuZL.html

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency’s decision on the trial comes after the drug was found in another UK trial to have no benefit for patients already infected with Covid-19. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced a £5 billion economic package to recover from what he called the “disaster” of the cornavirus pandemic, as the east Midlands town of Leicester with a large population of Indian origin went into the UK’s first local lockdown.Harping on the mantra of “build, build, build”, Johnson drew comparisons with former US President Franklin Roosvelt’s “New Deal” that took the country out of depression in the 1930s.England is due to ease lockdown restrictions on Saturday, but Leicester will be excluded due to a spike in infections, particularly among young people. The infections are particularly high in areas of pre-existing economic deprivation, such as Evington.Johnson said, “Too many parts of this country have felt left behind, neglected, unloved, as though someone had taken a strategic decision that their fate did not matter as much as the metropolis.”The economic package includes building new homes, schools, more funding for the National Health Service, tackling skills crisis and bridging gaps in connectivity, productivity and opportunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-regulator-says-trial-of-hcq-for-covid-19-can-resume/story-RhbT78TNnG46ueg8BP9YHK.html
01-07-2020||World||China opens border dispute with India ally Bhutan||Continuing with its expansionist agenda, China has now created a new border dispute with Bhutan, one of India’s traditional ally.At a virtual meeting of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) in the first week of June, Beijing objected to the grant for Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS) in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district bordering India and China, claiming that the location was disputed.Even as the rest of the world is struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in Wuhan city of China’s Hubei province, Beijing has been aggressively attempting to alter the status quo in East China Sea, South China Sea and with India in Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh.As per Strat News Global, the GEF Council gathered to decide on funding for various environmental projects across the world, was shocked by China’s objection and instantly rubbished it.The majority of the GEF council members supported Bhutan’s view and the draft summary of the chair was approved by the council and despite objection from the Chinese council member, the work programme was adopted.The council refused to record China’s reason for objection, saying that the footnote would only record that China objected to the project. However, the Chinese council member said that he would need time to consult with his higher ups to come to a view on the matter.The reasons were included in the highlights of the discussion, which is a less formal record, and not in the chair’s summary, Strat News reported. The draft summary of the chair mentioned in the footnote that “China abstains and does not join the Council decision on this project.”The Bhutan government has since issued a formal letter to the GEF council, strongly opposing the references questioning the sovereignty of Bhutan and its territory on the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary in the documents of the council’s session. Bhutan has urged the GEF council to purge all references of China’s baseless claims from Council’s documents.Bhutan and China have a border dispute since 1984. Talks between Thimphu and Beijing have been limited to three areas of dispute (two in North Bhutan -- Jakarlung and Pasamlung areas -- and one in West Bhutan). Sakteng is not part of any of the three disputed areas||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-opens-border-dispute-with-india-ally-bhutan/story-vUh1dTWHWNqlEyM9sDfaeN.html
01-07-2020||World||How India’s app ban threatens China’s rise as a global tech power||China over the past decade built an alternate online reality where Google and Facebook barely exist. Now its own largest tech corporations from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. are getting a taste of what a shutout feels like.India’s unprecedented decision to ban 59 of China’s largest apps is a warning to the country’s tech giants, who for years thrived behind a government-imposed Great Firewall that kept out many of America’s best-known internet names. If India finds a way to carry out that threat, it may present a model for other countries from Europe to Southeast Asia that seek to curtail the pervasiveness of apps like ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok while safeguarding their citizens’ enormously valuable data.The surprise moratorium hit Chinese internet companies just as they were beginning to make headway in the world’s fastest-growing mobile arena, en route to going global and challenging American tech industry supremacy. TikTok had signed up 200 million users there, Xiaomi Corp. is the No. 1 smartphone brand, and Alibaba and Tencent have aggressively pushed their services.But India’s policy jeopardizes all those successes, and could have wider geopolitical consequences as the U.S. seeks to rally countries to stop using Huawei Technologies Co. for 5G networks. With China’s tech companies poised to become some of the most dominant in emerging industries like artificial intelligence, India’s actions may spur countries around the world to weigh the extent to which they let China gain user data -- and potentially economic leverage in future disputes.“Techno-nationalism will manifest itself increasingly across all aspects of geopolitics: national security, economic competitiveness, even social values,” said Alex Capri, a Singapore-based research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. “It will be increasingly difficult to separate Chinese tech firms from the CCP and China’s geopolitical ambitions. They will find themselves increasingly locked out.”Chinese internet firms have struggled to replicate their online services beyond their home turf, even before Washington lawmakers began raising concerns about the wisdom of allowing the Asian country’s corporations -- like ByteDance -- to hoover up valuable personal data. India amplified those concerns by accusing apps including TikTok, Tencent’s WeChat, Alibaba’s UC Web and Baidu Inc.’s map and translation services of threatening its sovereignty and security.India’s prohibition provides further evidence that nations are using tech for to assert themselves geopolitically, following the Trump administration’s worldwide campaign to contain China and national champions like Huawei. That depends in part on how much Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s actions are motivated by domestic interests following the worst military clash between India and China in almost half a century.“Beijing should certainly worry that the impact of the deadly clash could push India toward the U.S.,” said Zhang Baohui, director of the Centre for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University. “But these recent economic measures by India may not by themselves concern Beijing too much as it understands that Modi’s government, facing rising domestic nationalism, has to do something to soothe the public sentiments and retain legitimacy.”China-India tensions continue despite pledge to disengageIt remains unclear how India will enforce its decision, given TikTok -- for one -- has already been downloaded by roughly one in six people. But it follows a series of steps to curb China’s presence in the country, demonstrating the administration’s hardened resolve since long-simmering tensions boiled over after a deadly Himalayan border clash that killed 20 Indian soldiers.The country’s government procurement website has barred purchases of Chinese-made goods. Authorities have asked the largest e-commerce companies, including Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart, to start showing “country of origin” on goods sold. And India is said to be dragging its heels on clearing goods imported from China, stranding electronics at ports.“The Indian government thinks about governing the internet in a very similar way to China, which is blanket bans, asserting national boundaries on the internet and essentially carving out what would eventually become a version of the Indian Great Firewall,” said Dev Lewis, a research fellow at Digital Asia Hub in Shanghai. “Everyone’s struggling to deal with governing technology companies and apps, especially ones that cross borders. So when India takes a step like this, it sets a precedent for the things that you can do.”In terms of the immediate business consequences, ByteDance could be hardest-hit. India is its biggest market with more than 200 million TikTok users. During a brief ban last year, the Chinese company estimated it was missing out on half a million dollars a day of revenue. In a statement posted to Twitter, TikTok India head Nikhil Gandhi said the company complies with all data privacy and security requirements under Indian law and has not shared any user information with any foreign government, including Beijing.India’s prohibition could also give American companies a possible edge over Chinese players in a rare global tech market that is both populous and not yet saturated. While WeChat never made it big in India, banning it may help shore up Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp. Cutting out TikTok immediately gives Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube a boost.On Tuesday, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian said China was “strongly concerned” about India’s actions. “The Indian government has a responsibility to uphold the legitimate and legal rights of the international investors including Chinese ones,” he said.In India, TikTok takes on YouTube in a nasty fight for dominanceBut for now, China doesn’t have many great options to retaliate.“While Beijing is highly adept at economic coercion, in this case it has somewhat limited options to act in a reciprocal manner,” analysts for the Eurasia Group wrote in a research note. “Bilateral trade is heavily weighted toward Chinese exports to India. Attempts to hurt India economically could blowback on Chinese companies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-india-s-app-ban-threatens-china-s-rise-as-a-global-tech-power/story-jCVGbfFVL34E06EfFurmSI.html
01-07-2020||World||Ire as China passes Hong Kong national security law||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday signed into law the Hong Kong national security bill in a closed-door meeting of the of the Communist Party of China (CPC) elite in Beijing, formalising a legislation that critics fear could crush the city’s freedoms.Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activists could potentially face life sentences if they are found to have broken the new law.The legislation was unanimously approved little more than six weeks after it was first unveiled. Xinhua reported that Chinese lawmakers voted to adopt the law and decided that it will be included in Hong Kong’s mini-constitution known as “Basic Law”.Beijing says the law will be enforced to tackle separatism and foreign interference, but critics feel it will outlaw dissent and curb the various freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong’s citizens under the “one country, two systems” mechanism under which it has been governed since 1997. The law will come into effect on Wednesday, which marks the anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to China by Britain.Prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong announced he’s stepping down as leader of his anti-Beijing group Demosisto, soon after China passed the controversial law.“After much internal deliberation, we have decided to disband and cease all operations as a group, given the circumstances,” Demosisto said on Twitter. Chinese foreign ministry said it will take necessary countermeasures to “firmly safeguard” its national interests in response to a decision by the US to end special treatment for Hong Kong over the new law.Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam said the law will only target a “small minority of illegal, criminal acts and activities”.‘Deeply concerned,’ says UK PM JohnsonUK PM Boris Johnson the text of the new law will now be scrutinised. “I am deeply concerned at the law being passed. We will be looking at it carefully and scrutinise it if it is in conflict with the declaration with China. We have a duty to BNOs (British National Overseas) in Hong Kong as I said earlier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ire-as-china-passes-hong-kong-national-security-law/story-TSHJRmPmIP1kOZWPFaETPL.html
01-07-2020||World||US body calls Huawei, ZTE security threats||The US Federal Communications Commission designated Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. as national security threats, a step toward driving the Chinese manufacturers from the US market where small rural carriers rely on their cheap network equipment.The action means money from federal subsidies used by many small rural carriers may no longer be used to buy or maintain equipment produced by the companies, the FCC said in a news release.“Both Huawei and ZTE have close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military apparatus,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said on Twitter. “We are sending a clear message: the U.S. government, and this @FCC in particular, cannot and will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. communications networks.”The FCC has increasingly scrutinised Chinese companies as tensions grow between Beijing and Washington over trade, the coronavirus and security issues. The agency is considering banning three Chinese telephone companies, and last year barred China Mobile Ltd. from entering the US market.The U.S. contends that Huawei’s equipment could be used by China for spying. The company has repeatedly denied that it poses any security risk, and insists that it is independent of the Beijing government.Tuesday’s action formalises a proposal the FCC adopted in November. The agency also proposed requiring carriers to remove gear from companies designated a threat.FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks in a statement Tuesday said that “untrustworthy equipment” remains in place and called for the FCC to institute a replacement programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fcc-designates-china-s-huawei-zte-as-national-security-threats/story-tiUIK6slMeMy09PemzkzJN.html
01-07-2020||India||Terrorist attack kills civilian, his 3-yr-old grandson saved||A Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper and a civilian were killed in a terrorist attack on security forces in north Kashmir’s Sopore town on Wednesday, officials said.The three-year-old grandson of the deceased civilian was rescued by security forces, according to officials. A photograph of him sitting on the lifeless body of his grandfather was widely shared on social media. The Jammu and Kashmir Police later shared on its official Twitter handle a picture of the child being carried by a security official.Terrorists hiding in the attic of a mosque fired at CRPF personnel when they were getting off a bus around 7:30am, a spokesperson of the paramilitary force said. CRPF personnel retaliated, but the terrorists managed to escape. It was not immediately clear how many terrorists were holed up inside the mosque.CRPF head constable Deep Chand suffered bullet injuries and died in the attack. Three others were wounded and admitted to a hospital.The civilian, a 65-year-old resident of Srinagar, was passing by in his car with his three-year-old grandson when the attack began. Sopore, known for its apple orchards, is 50km from Srinagar.His family accused CRPF of killing him, a charge dismissed by security forces as “false news” spread by miscreants. In a video, the man’s son said his father left home for some work early in the morning, and alleged that he was “brought down from his vehicle and fired upon”.Vijay Kumar, inspector general of police, Kashmir Range, said the terrorists fired indiscriminately at CRPF personnel when they were de-boarding a bus. Panicked, the civilian rushed out of his vehicle with the child and tried to escape, but he was killed by a bullet.“Later, miscreants spread false news. Even his son, due to the fear of militants and the miscreants, released a video, which is completely baseless,” Kumar said. He added that securitymen rescued the child without caring for their lives. The Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party, led by Altaf Bukhari, demanded an impartial probe into the killing. The National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), too, demanded a time-bound probe.Every incident becomes a “propaganda tool in the bloody violence in Kashmir”, former chief minister Omar Abdullah said.“A three year old toddler has to have his misery broadcast to the whole world to drive home the ‘we good they bad’ message. We would have got the point without his misery being filmed and shared so please don’t,” he said on Twitter. “We would have expected no less from the men in uniform than to rescue the young boy and for that they have our gratitude but we would expect better than for them to film & use a three year old’s pain the way it’s being done today,” he added.Meanwhile, in the Jammu division, the Indian Army foiled an intrusion bid and killed a suspected Pakistani terrorist along the Line of Control (LoC). “We acted on the basis of specific intelligence inputs from J&K Police, and a joint operation was launched close to the LoC in Keri area of Bhimber Gali sector in Jammu division’s Rajouri district,” said Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, spokesperson, Indian Army.“Terrorists were seen crossing the LoC. Our alert troops foiled the infiltration bid. One terrorist was killed and an AK-47 rifle and two magazines were recovered...,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorist-attack-kills-civilian-his-3-yr-old-grandson-saved/story-UmmeQrwSUYsqoWEMdes54J.html
01-07-2020||India||HC notice to Centre on plea over e-tailers||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the Centre’s response to a plea seeking that directions be issued to e-commerce platforms to ensure that products they sell display the name of the manufacturing country. The plea, filed by advocate Amit Shukla, seeks implementation of the Legal Metrology Act 2009 and the rules framed under it , specifically clause 3.2 (ii) of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, which mandates that name of the country of origin be displayed on products being sold. The petition contended that this was not being enforced with respect to e-commerce entities.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan issued notice to the Centre and e-commerce platforms, including Amazon India, the WalMart-owned Flipkart and Snapdeal, seeking their responses by July 22.HT reported last week that the Centre is considering making it mandatory for retailers and e-commerce platforms to display the country of origin on every product sold on e-commerce websites, so that consumers could choose between local and imported goods. The move comes at a time when Prime Minister has pushed for an “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India), and asked citizens to be “vocal on local” as a way to help revive the local economy; and amid heightened tensions with China along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh that have prompted a sharp Indian response on the economic front.In his plea, submitted before the court, Shukla contended: “ Today, when a large number of Indian citizens intend to comply with the government’s appeal on promoting and buying Indian goods to strengthen the nation, it becomes essential that the e-commerce websites conspicuously display the country of manufacturing/origin for all products sold through e-commerce platform.”On Wednesday, the petitioner told the court that if someone wants to buy only products made in India, the option should be available on websites. He also contended that in 2017, the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 were amended, making it mandatory to publish the country of origin. “ However no compliance of the rule has been made by the companies,” he said.The notice to the Centre was accepted by government’s standing counsel Ajay Digpaul on behalf of the Union ministry of consumer affairs.The matter will be now heard on July 22.Snapdeal did not respond to the queries. Both Amazon and Flipkart did not respond to repeated calls and texts. On June 24, the commerce ministry held a stakeholders’ meeting on ways to enforce explicit labelling of goods with their respective countries of origin after it was made mandatory for products sold on the state-run trading platform Government e-Marketplace (GeM).The same day, Bloomberg reported that Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart agreed to compel merchants to start prominently displaying “country of origin“ for all goods sold online in India.Apar Gupta, advocate and executive director of Internet Freedom Foundation, says that generally the names of the country are mentioned on the products. “If there is valid legislative framework which is in place and not being followed then the court can issue direction on the implementation of the law or rule. However, if no such legislature exists then the parliamentarians should look into the matter and the courts cannot pass any direction because it is a policy decision, Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-notice-to-centre-on-plea-over-e-tailers/story-CzpaiUDCXctpEkpmzw7RQO.html
01-07-2020||India||PM Modi exits Weibo account, posts taken down||Beijing: Prime Minister Narendra Modi exited his Weibo account on Wednesday, a day after India banned 59 Chinese apps, and with the armies of the two countries facing off along the de factor border after a skirmish in Eastern Ladakh on June 15 left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers dead. “The message is loud and clear. If red lines are crossed, there will be consequences, “ the BJP’s IT cell chief Amit Malviya said on Twitter, a micro-blooging platform after which Weibo is modelled. All 115 posts on Modi’s Weibo profile have been taken down, as has been his profile photograph. The removal of all information from Modi’s Weibo account comes 10 days after at least three official Indian statements – including the PM’s – were deleted from the Indian embassy’s official account on the popular Chinese social media app, WeChat.“We are taking action to unsubscribe the account,” an Indian embassy official told HT.Modi’s Weibo account was set up in 2015 amid much fanfare and publicity before his first visit to China as prime minister.Since then the account has built 244,000 followers, many of them Chinese.Since 2015, but barring this year, Modi has wished President Xi Jinping ahead of his birthday on June 15. He also published messages on Sino-India ties especially after meetings with Xi.Modi’s posts on Weibo were in Chinese.The Hindustan Times has reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry for a comment on this development.Modi’s abrupt departure from Weibo account and removal of the Indian government’s posts on Chinese social media come in the backdrop of the violent face-off, and ongoing tension, between Indian and Chinese troops. The Chinese government has so far not revealed the casualties suffered by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) although China has admitted to international diplomats that it did suffer casualties. .On June 20, an India’s external affairs ministry (MEA) statement about the Indian position on the ongoing border tension with China was mysteriously deleted from the embassy’s official Weibo account a day before the WeChat posts were deleted.Tencent, a leading Chinese tech company that owns WeChat, didn’t respond to HT’s questions on the taking down of Indian government’s official statements.The message that popped up on WeChat when clicking the MEA’s statement on the Galwan Valley clash said: “This content was reported and confirmed by the platform of the following:” before it says in Mandarin: “Suspected of violating relevant laws, regulations and policies”.The long list of regulations include: “endangers national security, divulges state secrets, subverts state power, or undermines national unity, inciting hatred, disseminating false information, inciting illegal assembly, demonstration or gathering of people to disturb public order”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-exits-weibo-account-posts-taken-down/story-YYCAqWvAaJ1Ryzogwk9FuO.html
01-07-2020||India||India, China talks focus on expeditious de-escalation||Indian and Chinese armies stressed the need for an “expeditious, phased and step-wise de-escalation” of the ongoing border conflict “on priority” during a marathon meeting between senior military commanders at Chushul in Ladakh on Tuesday, people familiar with the developments said on Wednesday.But the disengagement process will be “complex” even though the military discussions “reflected the commitment” of both sides to reduce tensions, the people added on condition of anonymity.The June 30 meeting focused on issues related to “disengagement at the face-off sites” along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) and “de-escalation from the border areas”, according to one of the people cited above.“More meetings are expected at the military and the diplomatic level to arrive at a mutually-agreeable solution and to ensure peace and tranquility along the LAC as per bilateral agreements and protocols,” a second person said.This was the third meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region; and the second after the brutal clash at Galwan Valley on June 15 that left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead. There was no official statement from Indian Army on Tuesday’s Chushul talks.But the people indicated that disengagement is expected to kick off with rival troops pulling back a few hundred metres from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides. India and China have significantly reinforced their deployments with thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems in the region.Experts said that the Indian Army must follow a cautious approach during the disengagement process as the continuing Chinese buildup calls into question the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) intent to restore status quo ante (the status in early April in this case) in strategic areas.“It appears the talks have led to some partial forward movement. But the reliability of the Chinese remains suspect, given their track record in the area. The army will verify if the Chinese are retreating from face-off points at each stage every 72 hours. Disengagement will have to be followed by de-escalation and de-induction of troops and equipment from the region,” said Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd), a former Northern Army commander.The Indian side on Tuesday reiterated its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from several friction points along the LAC and sought the restoration of status quo ante in key areas including Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and the strategic Depsang plains, apart from emphasising the need for thinning the military buildup in the region.“Both sides have emphasised the need for an expeditious, phased and step-wise de-escalation as a priority. This is in keeping with the agreement between the external affairs minister and his Chinese counterpart during their conversation on June 17 that the overall situation would be handled in a responsible manner, and that both sides would implement the disengagement understanding of June 6 sincerely,” the second person said.The two senior officers first met on June 6 to ease growing tensions along the LAC. But the limited military disengagement that began in some areas after the first meeting was derailed after the bloodshed in Galwan Valley.The delegations led by the corps commander-ranked officers last met on June 22 when they hammered out a consensus on disengaging from friction points along the disputed border. However, the “mutual consensus to disengage” from all “friction areas” has neither enabled any disengagement on the ground nor led to the thinning of military build-up by rival forces in the region”, Hindustan Times reported last Wednesday.“The June 30 meeting was held in a businesslike manner keeping in view the Covid-19 protocols. The discussions reflected the commitment of both sides to reduce the tensions along the LAC. The process of disengagement along the LAC is complex and in such a context, speculative and unsubstantiated reports need to be avoided,” said the first person.India is especially concerned about the People’s Liberation Army holding positions in the Finger Area where it has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes, tented camps and observation posts in areas New Delhi considers its territory. Chinese buildup has also been seen in the Depsang sector, the Galwan Valley, and the Gogra Post-Hot Springs region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-talks-focus-on-expeditious-de-escalation/story-4IyG7lBZqmL2aTUcBg5hBK.html

The move comes against the backdrop of increased tensions with China following deadly clashes along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh on June 15, after which India began reviewing involvement of Chinese companies in crucial areas. Shortly after, the Union government asked the two state-run telecommunications operators, BSNL and MTNL, to not use equipment from Chinese manufacturers. On Monday, the government separately banned 59 mostly Chinese mobile applications.  According to the DoT official, the new process may allow only domestic manufacturers, possibly cutting out Chinese majors such as Huawei and ZTE that at present dominate the telecom hardware market.“However, any decision will only be taken after the committee’s report is submitted,” said the official , referring to a committee set up last month to review the tender. While the Chinese telecom equipment makers are privately owned, there’s widespread belief that they have deep ties with the state. The six-member committee is headed by DoT technology advisor K Ramchand and has representatives from BSNL and MTNL, two independent experts and another representative from the industry.The fresh tender will be “futuristic” and with “realistic” expectations, officials earlier told HT.The move is part of the DoT push to reduce the reliance of India’s telecom sector on foreign equipment and increase domestic manufacturing. According to experts, nearly 75% of the telecom equipment is sourced from China. Other major foreign players include Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung.  DoT is also in the process of starting trials for 5G telecommunications, a process in which Huawei was slated to take part amid concerns by countries such as the United States. According to the official cited above, no decision has yet been taken on when the 5G trials will take place.Separately, DoT is also in consultation with private telecom service providers to encourage the use of equipment manufactured in India.According to former DoT technology advisor RK Bhatnagar, the department in February , issued a memorandum that said India is liable to take reciprocal action against any country that does not provide market access. “Although it wasn’t explicitly stated, the context was China,” Bhatnagar said. “Whether DoT explicitly states it in the fresh tender or not, it is unlikely procurement from Chinese firms will be allowed.”Bhatnagar added that the Federal Communications Commission, US, has designated Huawei and ZTE as a “national security risk”. He also said that during a national crisis the government also has the right to take over any network, even private ones. “There is no mandatory testing of equipment that is procured,” said Bhatnagar. “Right now, the situation with China is tense but if it escalates they could use the equipment and sabotage us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsnl-cancels-4g-tender-after-govt-nudge-on-china/story-pbeno5MGHwACTOhHiiWLsI.html
01-07-2020||India||300 frontline workers in Odisha have tested positive for Covid-19 in last 3 months||More than 300 frontline including policemen, nurses, ASHA workers, doctors, anganwadi workers and sanitary staff in Odisha have tested positive for Covid-19 over the last 3 months making the battle looking increasingly grim for the state, officials said.Of the 300 who have tested positive, more than 200 are from the Covid-19 epicentre of Ganjam district where close to 1500 cases have been detected so far. Most of the frontline warriors in Ganjam are ASHA workers, ANMs, anganwadi workers and local sarpanch who are either in charge of quarantine centres populated by migrant workers or take swabs of people who show symptoms of Covid-19. On June 30, at least 43 such corona warriors in Ganjam tested positive for Covid-19.Similarly, in Khurda district about 65 such people including 44 employees of a private nursing home tested positive this month. Among the 65, are 7 doctors in AIIMS Bhubaneswar.Cuttack is among the other districts where more and more corona warriors are getting infected. In Cuttack, a police station was sealed after the inspector and the sub divisional police officer were infected along with several other police officials.“It’s a matter of concern for us as they are the ones who are spearheading the fight against the pandemic. In Ganjam, a BDO, tehsildar, several sarpanch, doctors and nurses have been infected over the last 2 months. We have taken several steps including enforcing shutdowns to ensure our warriors don’t get infected, but it is becoming difficult. Unless people adhere to social distancing norms and wear masks, the spread will continue,” said Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrit Kulange.Doctors and nurses who run the biggest risk of getting infected, say there is not enough PPEs for them in non-Covid wards of hospitals where an asymptomatic patient can infect them. “Unless regular supply of PPEs is ensured, it’s a matter of time before every doctor gets infected,” said a doctor at a medical college and hospital. Similarly, ASHA workers and anganwadi workers say they don’t get adequate number of PPEs while collecting swabs or visiting the quarantine centres in villages. “The government has said the next of kin of frontline health workers like ASHA workers and anganwadi workers will get Rs 50 lakh if they die due to Covid-19. The government can simply prevent our death by providing us with enough PPEs,” said Basant Kumar Sahu of Odisha Rajya ASHA Sathi Sangh.Odisha health department officials said a separate database of such workers as well as members of local Panchayati Raj bodies are being kept ready in each district for regular monitoring by the department. “The monitoring team will contact with the hospitals to ensure special attention in treatment. The team will contact family members to assure and update on the patient’s status,” said state health secretary PK Mohapatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/300-frontline-workers-in-odisha-have-tested-positive-for-covid-19-in-last-3-months/story-b82LXKmhuHI6NvtjhUdxxI.html

01-07-2020||India||BJP lauds CM Mamata for anti-China stand, says she stands with Centre on national security||Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may be fighting for every inch of political ground in the poll-bound state but Mamata Banerjee is drawing appreciation from the opposition for taking a strong stand against China. The Bengal chief minister, while attending the June 19 all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi convened to discuss the Ladakh crisis, said her government firmly stands by the Centre.While addressing an online rally from Delhi on June 28, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman virtually lambasted the TMC government but lauded Banerjee on one issue. “Over the past one year, the Bengal chief minister has vehemently opposed all development schemes of the Centre. But there is one thing I want to say in her support and appreciation. When the Prime Minister called the all-party meeting on the Ladakh issue, our Didi (Banerjee) at least spoke for our country and in support of the Central government,” said Sitharaman.The video of Sitharaman’s speech is embedded in the BJP Bengal unit’s Facebook page, the cover photo of which carries the slogan “Aar noi Mamata” in bold letters.On Tuesday afternoon, Banerjee went a step ahead and said, “To ban some apps will not be enough. We have to give China a befitting reply. How we do it, that we have to decide.”Interestingly, state forest minister Rajib Banerjee, who is known to be close to the chief minister, has sung in Hindi to pay homage to the 20 Indian soldiers killed in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on the night of June 15. The song, ‘Hindustan Meri Jaan’, has been made into a music video which was released on June 23. The video features images and names of the soldiers and the colonel as well as clippings of army exercises and Republic Day parades.Two of the soldiers, Rajesh Orang and Bipul Roy were from Bengal’s Birbhum and Alipurduar districts respectively. The state government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh and a government job for each family.The Bengal BJP leadership too did not hesitate to appreciate the chief minister in public.“We welcome the position Mamata Banerjee has taken on China. In a multi-party democracy all parties should be united on the issue of national security despite their differences on internal issues. It is a pity that the Left and Congress walk a different path. Though TMC MP Mahua Moitra tweeted against the BJP on the Ladakh issue, we appreciate that the TMC chief has taken a serious stand,” said BJP Bengal unit vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar.Political observers feel that Banerjee has made the right decision by not following the Congress.“This is a national crisis. All political parties, including the Congress, should stand by the Centre in the fight against Chinese aggression. When Banerjee is saying that she fully supports Narendra Modi, she is doing the right thing. The BJP is appreciating her gesture. We welcome this because all parties should forget their differences in the interest of the nation,” said Prof Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, noted political analyst and former principal of Presidency College.Incidentally, after the deadly terror attack on the CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama on February 14 last year, the Bengal CM joined Congress and other opposition parties that questioned the extent of damage done by the Indian airstrike on Balakot in Pakistan. Two of the soldiers killed in Pulwama were from West Bengal. The Bengal CM used Pulwama and Balakot as issues in her campaigns prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi countered it at a rally in Kolkata. “We hit there (Balakot) but it hurt people here. Kolkata’s Didi was more pained than people in Islamabad and Rawalpindi,” said Modi. In the elections, the BJP, which had only two Lok Sabha members from Bengal, bagged 18 of the state’s 42 seats, marking the party’s highest growth in Bengal.Asked why he did not sing in Bengali, the state’s official language, forest minister Rajib Banerjee said, “I chose Hindi to reach out to people of this country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-lauds-cm-mamata-for-anti-china-stand-says-she-stands-with-centre-on-national-security/story-tbJflBzDkKah2dDGHHycnM.html

Our victory is certain. We all should take a resolution that we will make Madhya Pradesh a corona and disease free state,” Chouhan said.The Covid-19 tally in Madhya Pradesh now stands at 13,861 including 581 casualties.A total of 11,458 survey teams will be deployed across the state for a door to door survey. Non-contact thermometers, pulse oximeters and essential protective gears will be provided to each survey team.Besides identifying suspected patients of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) the suspected patients of malaria, dengue, chikungunya will also be identified by the survey teams and the information will be uploaded on a ‘Sarthak App’.The sampling of Covid-19 suspected patients, whose details are uploaded on Sarthak App will be tested. More than three lakh samples will be taken of the identified suspected patients across the state and a capacity of 21,000 tests per day is being developed.Appreciating the role of doctors para-medics and anganwadi workers, ASHAs and NGOs etc on Doctor’s Day, Chouhan said, “The state had one testing lab three months ago with only 60 tests per day capacity. Now, 30 labs have been developed for testing corona in the state with a capacity of 9,000 tests per day. The State’s recovery rate is 77%, which is better than other states. Infection has come down.”Chouhan sounded confident that the door-to-door survey will help control the virus.“We are also taking the cooperation of private hospitals. The ICU beds are available in sufficient quantity in districts. We have achieved success in controlling the corona in Indore and Bhopal. The door-to-door survey will now completely control coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-chouhan-launches-kill-corona-campaign-in-mp-with-door-to-door-survey/story-luISqdmy28Dk1hlIniGNII.html

This is the second seizure by the Gariaband police in the last 12 days. Police said that in both the cases the accused poachers were from Nowrangpur district of Odisha, and were active in the Maoist-hit part of the Gariaband district of Chhattisgarh.On Tuesday, Buduram Gond, 40, of Raidhar, Odisha, was arrested by a special team from Shuklabhata village in Baghnala police station limits, Superintendent of Police Bhojram Patel said.Speaking to Hindustan Times, Patel said police got an input that a man was trying to find a buyer for a leopard skin.“A team of policemen was sent to Maoist-affected Shuklabhata and the accused was nabbed. When interrogated, Gond confessed to poisoning a water body to kill the big cat,” said Patel, adding that the skin was 82 inches long from head to tail.Gond has been booked under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act.On June 19, Gariaband police arrested a 55-year-old man for allegedly possessing a leopard skin. The accused Ramnath Netam lives at the border of Chhattisgarh and Odisha.Police said that since most of the part of Udanti Tiger Reserve, which borders Odisha, is Maoist affected, hence these poachers enter easily and hunt animals.Recently, police have also seized a pangolin which was smuggled from this area.“In Gariaband, leopards have been found in nearly every part of the district and we are suspicious about the international gang active in this region. It seems that they know the people who purchase these skins since both came to sell them. We are working some leads and something positive will come out soon,” said Patel.Wildlife activists of the state also believe that an international gang is working in Gariaband district, particularly near Udanti Tiger Reserve.“Last November, seizures of pangolins were made in Nowrangpur district of Odisha. This is a fact that an inter-state gang has been active in Gariyaband since last year. We have found that wild animals’ skins and other parts are smuggled to countries through north-east states and Nepal,” said Meetu Gupta, member of the state wildlife board and wildlife activist.Gupta has been demanding that a special task force (STF) be formed to nab the poachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-police-arrest-man-selling-leopard-skin-2nd-time-in-12-days/story-EMPZTGnKyJqMfqSIrii4mI.html

Hence, now dues as on 30.06.2020 is nil against her,” a spokesperson for the ministry of housing and urban affairs said.The ministry has also said that she had accumulated dues of RS 3,46,677 till 30th June.The directorate of estate department of the ministry had issued a notice to her to vacate her house within a month.“Consequent upon withdrawal of SPG protection and grant of Z+ security cover by Ministry of Home Affairs, which does not have provision for allotment/retention of Government accommodation on security grounds to you, the allotment of Type 68 house No. 35, Lodhi Estate, New Delhi is hereby cancelled w.e.f 01/07/2020. One month concessional period on the same rent up to 01.08.2020 is allowed as per rule,” the letter sent by the ministry said.“Any stay beyond 01.08.2020 will attract damage charges/penal rent as per rules,” it added.According to the current norms, there are no provisions for allotment or retention of government retention unless exceptions are made based on recommendations given by the Union home ministry.“In view of this, she is no longer entitled for Government accommodation and her allotment has been cancelled by the Directorate of Estate,” the spokesperson of the ministry of housing and urban affairs addedGandhi was allotted bungalow 35, Lodhi Estate on February 21, 1997 on security ground as an SPG protectee.“Cabinet Committee on Accommodation (CCA) in its meeting held on 07.12.2000 reviewed the guidelines on allotment of Government accommodation on security ground and decided that in future no private person, other than those who are SPG protectees, shall be given Government accommodation on security ground. Such allotments were to be done at the market rate i.e. 50 times of normal rent,” the official said.However, the decision to modify the rules was formally taken by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in 2015.Congress chief minister Captain Amrinder Singh has protested the move and urged Centre to revoke the order. “Captain Amrinder Singh takes exception to orders asking Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi to vacate govt house, urges Centre to restore her SPG cover and revoke allotment cancellation on security grounds in view of threat perception to Gandhi family,” the Punjab Chief minister’s office said.“Blind hatred and a sense of vengeance with the Congress leadership is evident by the BJP and Modi government… The notice to clear Priyanka’s house shows the uneasiness of Modi ji-Yogi ji. We are not afraid of the frustrated decisions of the authoritarian government,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-clears-dues-on-lutyens-bungalow-hours-after-govt-notice/story-T1Iie2HBcOe8R4UcmRVNOP.html
01-07-2020||India||Cow who ate ball of explosives in Andhra Pradesh dies, 3 arrested||The cow, Laxmi, which ate a ball of explosives wrapped in some food stuff at Kogileru village of Ped Panjani block in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district on Saturday evening, died in the early hours of Wednesday. It was cremated according to Hindu rituals. In a similar incident, a pregnant wild elephant in Kerala died two weeks after consuming a pineapple filled with firecrackers. The cow in Chittoor suffered from infection for more than three days before it died. “The post-mortem report revealed that infection caused by the explosion of the crude bomb in Lakshmi’s mouth spread to the entire body. There were blood clots in several parts of the body,” Arjun Reddy, caretaker of “Gow-Matha Peetham,” a cow shelter with 17 cows.Peda Panjani police sub-inspector Chitreddy Lokesh Reddy said the police had arrested three hunters, including two from Kogileru village and remanded them in judicial custody on Tuesday.The police had booked cases against the accused under Sections 286 (negligent conduct in using explosives) and 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle) of Indian Penal Code, Section 11 of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960 and Section 9 (B)(1) of the Explosives Act.The hunter had planted the explosive wrapped in some food stuff made of flour in the grass closer to the adjacent forest area in order to kill wild boars. The cow which was being grazed in the area ate it accidentally and it exploded in her mouth.Due to its impact, the lower jaw of the cow got ripped off. Doctors at the government veterinary hospital in Tirupati tried to restore the jaw by conducting a surgery on Monday evening, but they failed because the jaw was completely broken.“We brought Lakshmi back to the cow shelter on Tuesday and administered intravenous fluids. But it collapsed later in the night and died in the early hours of Wednesday,” Arjun Reddy said.Arjun Reddy, along with the villagers, conducted Lakshmi’s funeral as per Hindu rituals, similar to the ones performed for dead human beings. “We are planning to construct a Samadhi for the cow in the same place where she died and develop it as Lakshmi Ghat with a beautiful garden around it,” Reddy added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cow-who-ate-ball-of-explosive-in-andhra-pradesh-dies-3-arrested/story-qLD0JGSYXBjjMe7RzIoauK.html
01-07-2020||India||Lockdown a drastic strategy to eliminate coronavirus, says Oxford University don||While the Indian government has often cited the lockdown as a vital factor that helped control the spread of Covid-19, Professor Sunetra Gupta, an epidemiologist at Oxford University, says lockdown is a drastic measure and may not be a long-term solution.“I think lockdown is really a drastic strategy which is being implemented rather widely without any consideration as to what costs it imposes. I have been pushing for a while now to consider the costs of lockdown and to urge governments to reopen rather being in a state of lockdown or keep on re-imposing lockdowns in the hope of somehow eliminating or eradicating this virus,” she told HT in an interview.Professor Gupta acknowledged that lockdown may have reduced transmission of Covid-19.“Lockdown has some effects. It does reduce transmission. Lockdown played a role in the dissemination of the virus to out of some metropolitan areas both in the UK and Germany and various parts of Europe. But I don’t know if that’s a long-term solution.”She also rubbished comparisons among countries about the impact of Covid-19.“It is nonsensical to compare India to Germany or the UK or to the US or Brazil as if there is a sort of a beauty contest going on. Essentially the virus is spreading through a geographical kind of dimension. It starts in China and I am very surprised that it hadn’t already arrived in India, in certain parts of India particularly metropolitan areas. I am very surprised that it may not have arrived and spread through significantly before lockdown,” Professor Gupta said.Asked whether the use of BCG vaccine in India could be a reason for the comparatively lower mortality rate from Covid-19, she said it was unlikely.“I very much doubt it could be the BCG vaccine which doesn’t even do the job it is supposed to do which is to protect against TB so if it protects against coronavirus that would be something…. The virus doesn’t affect everyone equally so there is vulnerable sector of the populationwho are at risk of diseases and death. Some of those are very frail, elderly populations,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-a-drastic-strategy-to-eliminate-coronavirus-says-oxford-university-don/story-9euCBbI9I9tSULFaWEzAGI.html
01-07-2020||India||Focus on Guwahati after over 500 Covid-19 cases detected in less than 24 hrs||Assam and northeast’s biggest city Guwahati is in focus following a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases and detection of over 500 positive patients in less than 24 hours.On Tuesday, the city recorded 382 Covid-19 positive cases and on Wednesday till 3 pm another 157 had been added to the tally. Between June 24 and June 30, the city recorded 1,212 positive cases.The Assam health minister termed the situation as “extremely critical” and urged residents to be very careful. Guwahati and the rest of Kamrup Metro district are already under total lockdown for 14 days beginning June 28 in a bid to arrest the sharp spike in Covid-19 cases.“I had a phone conversation with union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday and he informed that in the Centre’s view, the Covid-19 scenario in Guwahati is extremely worrying. He instructed us to change our testing pattern urging to conduct 10,000 tests for the city daily,” said Sarma in a press conference.“ICMR has suggested the use of rapid antigen-based tests which will enable us to deliver results within an hour. Tests will be done on nasal swab samples. Those found positive will be sent to isolation and those found negative but having symptoms will be subjected to a RT-PCR test,” he added.Sarma said that training of personnel to carry out the new tests will happen from Thursday and the new testing regimen will be in place within the next few days. He added that initially around 3,000-4,000 tests would be done daily and it would be scaled up in future.Following detection of over three dozen positive cases without travel history, the Assam government had started a campaign from June 15 urging people to come forward for tests voluntarily and deposit samples at 31 centres across the city. Till June 30, over 19,000 tests had been conducted as part of that drive.“At present we have 1,538 hospital beds in Kamrup Metro for Covid-19 patients and 987 of them are occupied. We need another 1,500 beds immediately to cater to the rising number of cases,” Sarma said.“We are also setting up a plasma bank in the next 4-5 days. A plasma separator has already been installed at the Guwahati Medical College Hospital. Training of personnel is on and we will soon be able to start plasma therapy for Covid-19 patients who need it,” he added.The minister informed that a new website www.covidassam.in would be launched soon where people would be able to check their swab test results. The state government has also decided to allow home-cooked food for Covid-19 patients provided they are delivered to hospitals in disposal bags.Till Wednesday afternoon, Assam had recorded 8,547 Covid-19 positive cases. A total of 5,647 patients have recovered and 12 deaths have been reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-guwahati-after-over-500-covid-19-cases-detected-in-less-than-24-hrs/story-ToKZdrBd1bKebTVzp8JzTI.html
01-07-2020||India||US lends support in India vs China in UNSC over Karachi attack statement||The United States on Wednesday stepped in to stall a United Nations Security Council statement pushed hard by Xi Jinping’s China on this week’s Karachi terror attack in light of New Delhi’s reservations over the Imran Khan government’s efforts to politicise the attack at Pakistan Stock Exchange.The UNSC routinely condemns such acts of terror. But the statement on the Karachi terror strike got complicated after Islamabad attempted to pin the blame on New Delhi.Pakistan foreign minister Makdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi had blamed the attacks on India on Tuesday. His boss Imran Khan echoed him in the National Assembly on Wednesday, claiming Islamabad had no doubt that India was involved. The Balochistan Liberation Army is reported to have claimed responsibility for the attack in Pakistan’s southern port city on June 29.In informal consultations, several UNSC members took a dim view of Pakistan’s effort to queer the pitch and use the UNSC to achieve their political objectives in cooperation with mentor, China.Germany was the first to speak up on the China-sponsored statement. The UNSC follows the silence procedure that considers a resolution to have the support of all members concerned if no one raises an objection to it within a specified time.Germany’s intervention pushed the timeline, forcing China to extend the silence process to 10 am (Eastern Time) on July 1.As this deadline was to expire, the United States also made an intervention. The procedure now stands extended till 1 pm (Eastern Time) on July 1. Officials said that there was a good chance that the statement on the terrorist strike in Pakistan would be approved by the UNSC sooner or later. The delay, however, is the message to the China-Pakistan team that it could not expect a smooth ride at international fora.Indian and Chinese soldiers have been locked in a stand-off in eastern Ladakh for weeks after People’s Liberation Army soldiers attempted to expand their territory on the Indian side. On July 15, the stand-off escalated into a violent scrap that led to loss of lives on both sides.One Chinese diplomat posted at the UN who tried to push the Pakistan statement tried to nudge others to move quickly, arguing that taking action “slowly will send a bad signal to others and the victims.”That statement, however, did not have the desired impact, particularly since China doesn’t have a track record of coming down strongly on terror. At the UNSC, China - one of the five permanent members - had blocked a resolution designating Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist under 1267 resolution for years. Beijing eventually had to take a step back last year under intense international pressure. Pakistan has, however, not acted against Masood Azhar despite the UNSC resolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-lends-support-in-india-vs-china-in-unsc-over-karachi-attack-statement/story-hiV3U1JHELduesCQYitP1M.html

01-07-2020||India||Railways scraps thermal cameras tender after firms allege advantage China||The railways has scrapped a tender for thermal cameras meant for ‘Covid surveillance’ after Indian firms alleged that the tender specifications favoured a Chinese company.In June, Railtel, the railways’ telecom arm, had issued a tender for thermal temperature screening AI-based surveillance cameras for assistance in Covid-19 surveillance. The government company has decided to issue a fresh tender after the controversy. “EOI for selection of partner for thermal temperature screening solution to RCIL’s customers stands cancelled with immediate effect. Fresh EOI will be published soon,” a notice by the PSU said. This comes at a time when the Indian government has banned 59 apps, mostly having Chinese links, saying they were “engaged in activities prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India”.India and China are involved in a tense border stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. A brutal brawl in Galwan Valley on June 15 led to 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers dead.In a letter written to Railtel, one of the vendors said the pre-qualification criteria laid down for the OEM & bidder has some anomalies and ambiguities. Hindustan Times has seen a copy.“Even after the release of the latest corrigendum (on June 23) the department has some ambiguities too in technical specifications. Specifications issued are biased to Chinese OEM i.e. Hikvision, Specs clearly mentioned DeepinMind technology which is a proprietary feature of Hikvision NVRs,” the letter said.Indian firms have alleged that artificial intelligence technology - DeepInMind - which is specified in the tender is a proprietary feature of Chinese firm Hikvision, a company partly owned by the Chinese government. According to Hikvision’s technology, Network Video Recorder (NVR) has a “mind” of its own and can analyse and classify human and vehicle targets from video streams.Under the specifications mentioned in the tender for temperature screening with facial recognition and mask detection, Railtel mentioned “Special interface in DeepinMind NVR.” The specifications for the cameras include temperature screening with facial recognition and mask detection, simultaneous temperature screening for multiple persons, detecting whether people wear masks and giving timely alarms on people without masks.While the initial tender for these cameras issued on June 9 excluded a crucial specification called “black body” temperature - the ability of the cameras to accurately measure temperatures emitted by a person to say whether a person has fever or not - and the DeepinMind technology specification, they were included in the revised tender issued on June 23.Railtel had floated the tender to purchase around 800 such camera systems.Hindustan Times had on November 10 last year reported the national carrier is planning a complete overhaul of security at railway stations through the use of facial recognition technology backed by artificial intelligence.It also planned to link the facial recognition system (FRS) with existing databases such as the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) to identify criminals prowling railway stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-scraps-thermal-cameras-tender-after-firms-allege-advantage-china/story-UiGb6FKhUWIZVl40ZkGf5K.html

The driver’s body was ripped into pieces and the vehicle was completely destroyed. The driver could not be identified till Wednesday evening. Local people said the vehicle was coming from the Ghorapir area in the Englishbazar municipality’s ward no 25 and was going towards Prabalpally.It was not clear during preliminary investigation whether the driver was carrying explosives or whether the battery, which powers e-vehicles, exploded.Malda superintendent of police Alok Rajoria rushed to the spot with senior officers and CID’s bomb disposal unit. The CID team collected samples.“We are trying to identify the deceased. Samples have been collected from the blast site. We have started a probe,” said Rajoria.Pratim Saha, a resident of the area, said, “The sound could be heard from a long distance. Luckily there was no one close to the vehicle. We rushed to the spot and found pieces of the driver’s body scattered all over the road.”Saiful Alam, another local resident, said, “We have never seen an e-rickshaw blowing up like this. We saw a white container in the wreckage. Probably, it contained some explosive material.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explosion-in-e-rickshaw-kills-driver-damages-houses-in-bengal-town/story-zws4bPTsaKhU1CPgyRRJWN.html

The petitioner cannot be given differential treatment because he is under detention,” the bench headed by justice Indira Banerjee remarked.An ex-councillor, Yadav was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment by the trial court in 2013 for his role in the 1984 anti-sikh riots in Delhi in which more than 2,700 sikh persons were killed in the aftermath of the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh bodyguards.He was convicted for the offence of rioting by the trial court and sentenced for three years. The conviction and sentence was upheld by the Delhi high court in December 2018.Yadav, who tested positive for Covid on June 26, pointed out that one of the 29 inmates with whom he was sharing barracks at the Mandoli jail in Delhi passed away due to coronavirus. Seventeen of the remaining inmates were found to be Covid-19 positive, he added.Citing his advancing age (he is 70), and other ailments like diabetes and kidney issues, he sought bail.“The petitioner cannot even walk properly without support and the doctor has suggested replacement of both knees. He is also suffering from acute diabetes and other kidney problems,” the plea said. Senior counsel R Basant, appearing for Yadav, submitted that even at the hospital two constables are posted outside his ward and relatives are not allowed to visit him.Additional solicitor general KM Nataraj, appearing for the CBI, submitted that all the patients are given equal treatment and there is no discrimination meted out to the petitioner or the members of his family on the ground that he is a convict.The bench, which also comprised justice BR Gavai, noted that there was no specific suggestion forthcoming from Yadav as to what steps his family intended to take if Yadav was released on bail. “There is no offer from the family to shift the petitioner to any other hospital. There is not even a whisper in the petition that any differential treatment is meted out to the patient or to his relatives on the ground of incarceration of the petitioner”, the court said while dismissing the plea.On May 13, the Supreme Court rejected the plea for interim bail filed by Sajjan Kumar, former Congress MP and convicted in the same case. Kumar had also sought interim bail on health grounds but the court turned down the plea stating that Kumar did not require immediate hospitalisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-positive-1984-riots-convict-files-for-bail-supreme-court-rejects/story-0Oa0hpFiGQKKRBDNI7Wp8K.html

(depend) on it for their livelihood.”It remains unclear, however, how the bans would work, with Indians who have downloaded TikTok on their phones still able to use the app on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mike-pompeo-welcomes-india-s-ban-on-chinese-apps-including-tiktok/story-4e1gmVc1nRpUogSQehPi0I.html

Thousands of vehicles got stranded at toll gates on the Hyderabad-Vijayawada national highway and at inter-state borders at Garikapadu.Many migrant labourers from Andhra, who returned to Hyderabad after lifting of lockdown restrictions, were also rushing back to their native villages. Similar incidents of a large number of vehicles getting stranded were reported from Pondugala and Vadapalli inter-state check posts.Most of these travellers going back to Andhra were, however, stopped at the check-posts, as the Andhra police did not allow them into the state unless they had registered their names in the state government portal, Spandana, and obtained a travel permit.“It was a shock for us, as the Union government guidelines for unlock 2 clearly said there shall be absolutely no hindrance in the inter-state or intra-state movement of individuals or goods and that no separate permits or passes will be required for the same,” S Narasimha Rao, a private employee who was held up at the Garikapadu check post along with the family, said.However, Andhra Pradesh Director General of Police Gautam Sawang said the state had powers to decide on the inter-state transport. “Since people are coming from Hyderabad which has been witnessing a high number of Covid-19 cases, we are taking precautions in allowing them into the state,” he said.The officer made it clear that only those who had obtained travel permits after registering their details on the official portal would be allowed into the state. “We shall allow them only after conducting the mandatory thermal screening. These restrictions will continue till further notice and people should cooperate with us in their own interest,” Sawang said.Even the passholders are being stopped at the check-posts if they are coming after 7 pm. “The travel permits are valid only between 7 am and 7 pm.

Hotels in Goa had been shut since the lockdown was announced in march to contain the spread of Covid-19.The Goa government had sought applications from hotel operators who were willing to reopen as well a declaration that they will abide by the standard operating procedures. Around 250 hotels applied for reopening. “The hotels will be allowed to start from tomorrow. Those who want to travel to Goa can do so. Hotel booking should be done prior to travelling to the state and with a hotel that has been allowed to reopen. Without booking tourists will not be allowed. At the entry point we will check if they are tested 48 hours prior. If not, the tourist will be sent to a hotel, where he will be tested. And once the test is negative, the tourist will be allowed to move out,” Ajgaonkar said. “If the tourist is staying with friends or relatives, there should be documentation,” Ajgaonkar added. The tourism minister said that he was expecting those from the cities who were fed up with the lockdown and being stuck in their homes to opt for travel for a “change of scenery”. “We are not forcing anyone to come. We are only creating facilities for them,” Ajgaonkar said when asked whether the reopening of the sector will help spread the virus at a time when the state is still struggling to cope with rising cases of Covid-19.“We do not want to play with anyone’s life. At the same time we need to boost revenue and the economy. Economically we are in bad shape,” Ajgaonkar added. Tourism on which the state relies heavily for revenue had come to a complete standstill in Goa following the lockdown. The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) has claimed that the direct and indirect economic impact of the tourism industry is estimated at 40% of the state’s GDP including multiplier effect.The industry has also sought that bars and restaurants be allowed to reopen in the state as hotels “cannot successfully (reopen) unless the bars and restaurants are given permissions to reopen as well.”The TTAG has been petitioning the government to allow them to reopen in order that they can begin taking bookings for later in the year when the European tourists start arriving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-govt-s-green-light-to-250-hotels-to-reopen-on-thursday/story-LhGJGl1tfSwdme7JWAkWOO.html

It isn’t easy||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has deleted his posts on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like account after India decided to ban 59 mobile applications linked to China. New Delhi had initially tried to delete PM Modi’s account but it turned out that the Chinese social media platform had a “complex procedure” for VIP accounts, people familiar with the development said.The government has initiated the process for deletion of the account. “For reasons best known to the Chinese, there was great delay in granting this basic permission,” a government functionary said.As an interim measure, the Prime Minister’s Office decided to remove its posts from the platform. PM Modi made his debut on the Chinese social media in 2015.“PM Modi had 115 posts on Weibo. It was decided to manually delete them and after much effort, 113 posts were removed,” news agency ANI added, quoting sources.The government had on Monday ordered the ban on the 59 mobile apps after an assessment that “they are engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, the security of the state and public order”.The move, which many analysts say, could become the template for other countries to act against Chinese companies, have angered Beijing. In a statement last evening, China claimed that the ban selectively and discriminatorily targets Chinese apps on ambiguous and far-fetched grounds and abuses national security exceptions.Back home, China has for years banned internet websites that it felt could hurt its national security. Beijing does not allow its nationals to access sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-hits-delete-on-his-weibo-account-after-banning-it-in-india-it-isn-t-easy/story-rL3DYMNPd88Ez5BlYXznRO.html
01-07-2020||India||India to ban Chinese companies from highway projects, says Nitin Gadkari||India will not allow Chinese companies to participate in highway projects, including those through joint ventures, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday amid border standoff with China. Gadakri also said the government will ensure that Chinese investors are not entertained in various sectors like Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The senior minister’s assertions assume significance against the backdrop of border standoff between India and China in Ladakh that also saw the death of 20 Indian Army personnel last month. Amid escalating tensions, the government on Monday banned 59 apps, mostly having Chinese links, citing threats to national security. “We will not give permission to joint ventures that have Chinese partners for road construction. We have taken a firm stand that if they (Chinese companies) come via joint venture in our country, we will not allow it,” Gadkari told PTI in an interview. The Road Transport, Highways and MSME minister said a policy will be out soon banning Chinese firms and relaxing norms for Indian companies to expand their eligibility criteria for participation in highway projects. Currently only a few projects which were undertaken much earlier involve some Chinese partners. When asked about this, the Minister said that the new decision will be implemented in current and future tenders. With respect to existing tenders and future bids, Gadkari said rebidding would be done if there are any Chinese joint ventures. “We have taken a decision to relax norms for our companies to ensure that they qualify in bidding in large projects. I have directed the Highways Secretary (Giridhar Aramane) and NHAI Chairman (SS Sandhu) to hold a meeting for relaxing technical and financial norms so that our companies can qualify to work,” he said. Elaborating on the decision, Gadkari said if a contractor can qualify for a small project, he can also qualify for a large project. “Construction norms are not good so I have asked to change it. We are changing it so that we can encourage Indian companies,” he added. According to him, qualification norms for projects are being rationalised to ensure Indian companies do not require to enter into pacts with foreign partners to grab projects. “Even if we have to go for foreign joint venture in the areas of technology, consultancy or design, we will not allow Chinese,” the Minister said. About the MSME sector, Gadkari said the effort is to enhance the capacity of local production but at the same time foreign investment is being promoted. However, he made it clear that despite decision to encourage foreign investment, Chinese investors would not be allowed. “For upgradation of technology, research, consultancy and other works, we will encourage foreign investment and joint ventures in MSMEs but in case of Chinese we will not entertain them,” he said. On stopping of consignments from China at Indian ports, the minister said there is “no arbitrary stopping of goods” at Indian ports and the government is initiating path-breaking reforms to help MSMEs and businesses in a bid to make the country self-reliant. “It is a good step. The imports from China will be discouraged and the country will take large strides towards self-reliance,” the Minister said and added that he is among the strongest proponents of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. Gadkari said that he had urged departments concerned to expedite clearance of consignments which were booked two to three months in advance before the situation took its present shape. After a representation from a farmers and traders’ body that imported agriculture equipment consignments were delayed at ports, Gadkari in a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal had sought early clearance of the said consignments. There are reports that customs authorities at Chennai and Vishakhapatnam ports are conducting extra scrutiny of consignments from China. Gadkari, as per the information, did not mention the name of the country from where these equipment were imported. “Indian business has the strength and skills to grow further and power our journey towards self-reliance. Under strong leadership of PM Narendra Modi, the Government of India is proactive and initiating path-breaking reforms that will help businesses and MSMEs,” he said. Most of these equipment, as per the information, pertain to spraying devices for pesticide control as the same had been diverted to urban areas during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Amid heightened border tensions with China, Indian customs officials have started physical inspection of all consignments coming from the neighbouring country specially Chennai and Vishakhapatnam ports.

She was allotted the Lodhi Estate bungalow in 1997 on the recommendation of the SPG.Priyanka Gandhi still has the Z+ security cover but this category does not entitle protectees to government accommodation unless the cabinet committee approves the exception on the recommendation of the home ministry. The home ministry didn’t see any reason to make an exception for her, people familiar with the development said.An official said she has accumulated dues of Rs 3.46 lakh and has also been asked to clear the dues.Officials said the cabinet committee had decided way back in December 2000 that no private person, other than those protected by SPG, should be given government accommodation on security grounds. If such an exception had to be made, the cabinet committee had recommended charging at the market rate.In July 2003, it was decided to charge a special rate of licence fee, that is 20 times the normal rent from such allottees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-asked-to-vacate-govt-allocated-official-accomodation-within-one-month/story-KdWz8gKVpH0KT3lDbjgSzL.html

Any stay longer than August 1, the government order said, will attract “damage charges and penal rent” as per rules.“Upon withdrawal of SPG protection and grant of Z+ security cover my ministry of home affairs, which doe snot have provision for allotment/retention of government accommodation on security grounds to you, the allotment of Type 6B house No 35, Lodhi estate is cancelled, read a notice from Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.There was no immediate comment from Priyanka Gandhi or her party Congress.Gandhi was allotted her Lodhi estate bungalow on February 21, 1997 on security ground as an SPG protectee.According to the current norms, there are no provisions for allotment or retention of government accommodation to those with Z+ security unless exceptions are made based on recommendations given by the home ministry.In November last year, the Centre withdrew SPG security cover to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Lok Sabha member Rahul Gandhi and daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The decision was taken on the recommendation of a top security review panel that carries out a threat perception analysis of protected persons. The three Gandhis are now protected by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).While in August that year, the security cover of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was also downgraded after a security review.The Special Protection Group was raised in 1985 – after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi - to protect the Prime Minister and their immediate family members. Former Prime Minister and their family members were brought under the SPG cover after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-asked-to-vacate-govt-allocated-official-accomodation-within-one-month/story-pFpe8WXbU8Lrb25XY8a2nJ.html

One immediate consequence of this downsizing has been that the photography business has suffered a body blow.Wedding photographers are wooing customers with ‘attractive lockdown budget packages’! A flyer doing the rounds in WhatsApp groups reads: ‘Booking open for up to 50 members wedding. Attractive live streaming wedding packages in your budget.’The packages of fat-weddings have come down 50-70%, costing between Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000. “One of the main reasons for this is that lavish marriages have shrunk to become small affairs. A high-end marriage used to have 2-3 drones, LED screens, Gimban equipment for cinematic shots, lighting paraphernalia and multiple photo and video cameras. Now, in functions where 30-50 persons are allowed, we have trimmed decor, limited arrangement so these high-end gadgets are not required so the budget has come down heavily,” said wedding photographer Amit Saheta.Shooting too is done with just two or three people, as every head at the venue is counted in the permissible limit. “We have an eight-person staff and expenses have not stopped. We had 15 bookings for June and we are ending the month with 3 events. Expecting Rs 6 lakh business, we barely did Rs 1 lakh work. So, it’s a tough phase,” he added.Photographer Mohd Azmi said that from 8,000-10,000 average photographs in a marriage the mandate for the last wedding he worked at was 200 photos. Those too were demanded in a pen drive and not as a wedding album, as is customary.Arun Pushkar, another lensman, highlighted a new trend that he had witnessed. “I had a wedding booking that solemnised at a five-star hotel this month. They changed the terms and made us click from both bride and groom side. I eventually sent three persons as the budget was slashed,” he said.In another function the pre-wedding shoot was cancelled totally. “Advance ‘wapas karna pada’ (had to return). I am returning the amount to them in instalments, as I had passed the advance on to my staff. It would be wrong of me to expect them to return the amount, but I will have to adjust the amount in future jobs,” he adds.Established wedding photographers say that competition from newcomers is another reason for falling market rates. “Most photographers buy cameras and equipment on a loan. To meet monthly instalments, newcomers are ready to work at any rate,” said Mohd Asad, a photographer.This scenario has created a win-win situation for customers. “Now, one can afford photographers that one could not think of in the small budgets we have. Spending even Rs 75,000 on marriage photography is a big thing for us. Now, at least one can negotiate and capture the golden memories forever,” said recently married Upendra, a Lucknowite.The lensmen too don’t mind what they are getting as after July first week the ‘muhurats’ (auspicious dates) are only available after November 25 and that too in a limited number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/wedding-snappers-snap-up-biz-at-slashed-rates/story-120I4Yaz5hU6F6HLh6F6CJ.html

Shri Pati Mishra, Superintendent of Police (SP), Deoria, on Wednesday announced a reward of Rs 25,000 to help find the absconding officer while police teams also carried out raids to nab him.Police officials said the inspector was accused of touching his private parts intentionally to sexually harass the two women while talking to them in his office chamber. Mishra said an FIR under sections 166 (public servant disobeying law), 354-A (sexual harassment) and 509 (act with intent to insult the modesty of woman) of the IPC has been registered against inspector Bhisma Pal Singh. He said the inspector was told to surrender but has been missing since then. Another police official of Deoria said the initial investigation had revealed that the video was recorded on June 22 when the inspector was posted as in-charge of Bhatni police station. Narrating the sequence of events, the official said the inspector was seen masturbating on his chair while the two women, seated opposite him, were talking about a land dispute with their relatives. The complainant said she, along with her mother, visited Bhatni police station at least thrice but their complaint was never heard. She said the inspector in-charge Bhisma Pal Singh was touching himself in front of the two when they visited him.“I ignored him at least twice before deciding to record his act on camera and expose him in front of his seniors and public,” she emphasised. She said she secretly shot the video when the inspector repeated the act on June 22 and later shared it with some senior officials.The inspector was suspended on June 26 and finally the FIR was lodged on June 30 when local journalists started questioning the SP after the video went viral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cop-masturbates-before-woman-complainant-she-records-it-files-fir/story-ytoThfHFYHfBOSk8Gp2UmI.html

The others are at liberty to undergo tests. We were sitting in the same room more than eight days ago and all precautionary measures were followed,” Sawant said.The infected MLA is undergoing treatment at a local hospital and his health condition is stated to be stable.The CM also retracted his earlier statement that community transmission has started in Goa and insisted that the disease is spreading from one infected person to another.“It is not in the air. If we check the root of all the cases, even though I had said earlier that the community transmission has started, I stand corrected. It is being transmitted from one person to another. We have to be careful to break the chain. There is no community transmission in Goa,” Sawant said. Goa has reported a spike in Covid-19 positive in June, the worst month to date, when 95% of the cases were detected.Though the coastal state had reported less than 100 Covid-19 positive cases till end-May, the tally has since risen to around 1,400, including 700 active cases and four deaths.Front-line healthcare workers such as nurses, hospital attendants, and police personnel, who are battling the pandemic, have been the worst affected by the contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-goa-cm-sawant-retracts-his-statement-on-community-transmission/story-Akam0FA4ZgKk7JdbvvDXLO.html

Our alert troops foiled the infiltration bid. One terrorist was killed and an AK-47 rifle and two magazines were recovered. The search operation is still on,” he added.The infiltration bid was foiled around 5.55 am . On Tuesday, Dilbag Singh, director-general of police (DGP), J&K Police, had said Jammu and Kashmir’s anti-infiltration grid is intact, despite active terror launch pads across the LoC constantly trying to infiltrate terrorists.Singh had said that the anti-terror operations are on at full throttle in Kashmir and 128 terrorists have been eliminated by the security forces to date this year.There has been a spurt in ceasefire violation and infiltration attempts by Pakistan along the International Border (IB) and the LoC since March 15 amid the Covid-19 outbreak.The government has been making a concerted bid to mount anti-terror operations to stymie homegrown terror groups’ attacks.Meanwhile, the J-K administration is making all necessary arrangements for the annual Amarnath Yatra which is likely to be held from July 23 to August 3 along the shorter Baltal track in Ganderbal district.In 2017, a bus carrying Amarnath pilgrims from Gujarat, was attacked by terrorists in Anantnag district that left seven of them dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistani-terrorist-killed-along-loc-in-rajouri-infiltration-bid-foiled/story-RdjWIDHRCR6YGt5J2110lM.html
01-07-2020||India||Indian, Chinese armies stress on need for quick, phased de-escalation at border||The Indian and Chinese armies stressed the need for “expeditious, phased and step-wise de-escalation” along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) on priority during a 12-hour meeting between senior military commanders at Chushul in Ladakh on Tuesday as part of ongoing efforts to cool heightened border tensions, people familiar with the developments said on Wednesday, on the condition of anonymity.The discussions reflected the commitment of both sides to reduce tensions along the disputed border, said one of the persons cited above, adding that the disengagement process would be complex.“More meetings are expected both at the military and at the diplomatic level to arrive at a mutually-agreeable solution and to ensure peace and tranquility along the LAC as per bilateral agreements and protocols,” he said. This was the third meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region; and the second after the brutal clash at Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead. The Galwan Valley clash, which took place on June 15, derailed an earlier disengagement plan.“India and China have been engaged in discussions through established military and diplomatic channels to address the situation along the LAC in India-China border areas,” said the second person cited above.He said the focus of the June 30 meeting was to discuss issues related to disengagement at the face-off sites along the LAC and de-escalation from the border areas.“Both sides have emphasised the need for an expeditious, phased and step wise de-escalation as a priority. This is in keeping with the agreement between external affairs minister and his Chinese counterpart during their conversation on June 17 that the overall situation would be handled in a responsible manner, and that both sides would implement the disengagement understanding of June 6 sincerely,” the second person added.The two delegations last met on June 22 when they hammered out a consensus on disengaging from friction points along the disputed border during an 11-hour meeting. The “mutual consensus to disengage” from all “friction areas” reached eight days ago has neither enabled any disengagement on the ground nor led to the thinning of military build-up by rival forces in the region, as reported by Hindustan Times on Wednesday.“The June 30 meeting was held in a businesslike manner keeping in view the Covid-19 protocols. The discussions reflected the commitment of both sides to reduce the tensions along the LAC. The process of disengagement along the LAC is complex and in such a context, speculative and unsubstantiated reports need to be avoided,” said the first person cited above.The two senior officers first met on June 6 to ease growing tensions along the LAC. The limited military disengagement that began in some friction areas after the first meeting was derailed after the bloodshed in Galwan Valley.The Indian side on Tuesday reiterated its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from the friction points and sought the restoration of status quo ante (early April) in key areas including Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and the strategic Depsang plains.The latest meeting took place at Chushul on the Indian side of the LAC, while the previous two meetings were held at Moldo on the Chinese side.China has not halted — but instead ramped up — its military activity in Finger Area near Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and Depsang Plains after the senior officers last met on June 22.India is especially concerned about the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) holding positions in the Finger Area where it has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes, tented camps and observation posts in areas New Delhi considers its territory, as reported by HT on Tuesday..The situation is equally critical from the Indian standpoint in the Depsang sector as the PLA has mobilised troops, weapons and other military equipment in sensitive areas, with its forward presence disrupting the army’s patrolling patterns there.Both India and China have significantly reinforced their deployments with thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems in the region.The Chinese buildup in other areas including Galwan Valley and the Gogra Post-Hot Springs sector hasn’t thinned either. Satellite imagery dated June 22, released by US firm Maxar Technologies, shows not only is the PLA holding ground in Galwan Valley but has also shored up its military positions in the area, as reported by HT on June 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-armies-stress-on-need-for-quick-phased-de-escalation-at-border/story-bv3S9eUtvJUYAw1ys50AGJ.html

The four accused involved in the crime fled from the scene on foot with one of them wielding a dagger at passers by. Rajesh Bhatt, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Kashipur, said, “The deceased was identified as one Guchchan Khan, a resident of Nai Basti colony in Jaspur who was a daily wage earner. He had gone to meet the four accused- Rizwan, Naushad, Danish and Akram near a petrol pump on Tuesday evening to settle a financial dispute of Rs 1,500 between his son Nadeem and them”“The four had initially called Nadeem but being suspicious something was not right, Khan’s wife sent him to meet the accused. After he reached there to speak to the four, a heated argument broke between them in which suddenly two of them dragged him on the road despite the traffic and stabbed him multiple times with a dagger. Seeing the attack some passersby tried to stop the accused but they wielded the dagger at them before fleeing from the scene leaving behind gravely injured Khan,” said Bhatt. The victim who had collapsed on the road was rushed to a nearby hospital but the doctors declared him dead on arrival. While the accused were fleeing, a policeman briefly chased the accused but failed to nab them. Bhatt said Khan’s son lodged a complaint against the four accused in the evening after which they were booked on charges of murder under relevant sections of IPC. “Police have formed two teams to nab the accused who are absconding. We also questioned at least three persons to know their whereabouts and on the basis of their information, the manhunt is on,” said Bhatt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elderly-man-in-uttarakhand-killed-over-rs-1-500-murder-caught-on-camera/story-TsqgTUb3ZMWHpCvxiAZLBK.html
01-07-2020||India||‘Impulsive decision’: Nusrat Jahan on India banning TikTok, 58 China apps||Trinamool Congress MP Nusrat Jahan underscored on Wednesday that TikTok, one among 59 Chinese-linked apps banned by the Centre earlier this week, is an entertainment app, questioning what’s the government’s “strategic plan” going forward. The Centre’s decision to ban the apps follows June 15 violent scrap between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh’s Galwan valley. Twenty Indian soldiers died in that clash. “TikTok is an entertainment app. It’s an impulsive decision. What’s the strategic plan? What about people who will be unemployed? People will suffer like demonetisation. I don’t have any problem with the ban as it is for national security but who’ll answer these questions,” Nusrat Jahan said during an event at Iskcon in Kolkata today, news agency ANI reported.TikTok, according to Bloomberg data, had nearly 200 million users in India as of January this year and had become one of the most prominent social media tools used by young Indians.Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today said the ban on Chinese mobile apps is a great opportunity to help Indians come up with good apps of their own and end foreign dependence for such things.“In the wake of the ban which we have imposed...I think it is a great opportunity. Can we come up with good apps made by Indians? Let the dependence on foreign apps, with their own agenda for a variety of reasons, stop,” said the IT and telecom minister.The government said these applications were “engaged in activities prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order”.The Basirhat MP’s comments come on a day when the CEO of TikTok Kevin Mayer wrote to employees in India that “our platform has encountered an unfortunate challenge in India. However, we stay resolved and committed to our mission, and are working with stakeholders to address their concerns”.CEO Mayer further underlined that TikTok is popular among users in remote cities, towns and villages across India.Actions by the Indian authorities could lead to retaliatory measures by Chinese counterparts.Indian IT companies have been eyeing the Chinese market as part of their strategy to reduce dependence on tapping the Chinese market to the US and UK, which together make up over 70% of Indian IT exports.Beijing on Tuesday said it was “strongly concerned” about New Delhi’s decision to ban Chinese mobile applications. It stressed on cooperation between the two countries and underlined that the ban would go against “India’s interests”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/impulsive-decision-nusrat-jahan-on-india-banning-tiktok-58-china-apps/story-fsngBj7RQvgTP3V6RFvINK.html

A memorandum will soon be issued in this regard,” chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb wrote on a social media post.State law minister Ratan Lal Nath said: “Tripura is the only one to have decided to give one-time relaxation in the upper age limit for the candidates appearing for the direct recruitment process. It will remain in force till December 31 since the date of issue of the notification.”The student wing of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), recently demanded that the CM give the upper age limit relaxation for candidates aspiring for government jobs.“We are thankful to the CM for giving the one-time relaxation in the upper age limit for government job aspirants,” said Rupam Datta, organising secretary, ABVP, Tripura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-tripura-announces-one-year-upper-age-limit-relaxation-for-govt-jobs/story-qtG9xmsG937AndlGK6I6lK.html
01-07-2020||India||Darjeeling tourist spots, hotels open amid questions over safety||All hotels in the Darjeeling hills and the Dooars region of north Bengal opened on Wednesday – the first hill station in the country to welcome tourists, albeit with some restrictions – amid concerns over the safety of locals and visitors because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Darjeeling district has reported 518 Covid-19 positive cases and 11 deaths to date, but the district headquarter has not recorded a single fatality due to the viral outbreak. Most of the Covid-19 positive cases have been reported from Siliguri, a sub-division of Darjeeling district and the biggest town in north Bengal.Tourists would have to carry fitness certificates to visit the Darjeeling hills. They would also be screened for Covid-19 symptoms before entering the hills, the officials said.Suraj Sharma, assistant director of the autonomous Gorkhaland Territorial Administration’s (GTA) tourism department, said, “It takes three to four months to prepare the ground and send a message to tourists that they can plan their visit to Darjeeling hills. The tourist spots have been opened to send a positive vibe. Tourists will have to carry fitness certificates with them.”Tourist spots, safari parks and hotels were shut after the nationwide lockdown restrictions were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the viral outbreak.Though July, August and September are considered to be the lean season for tourism because of the monsoon fury, the West Bengal government and the GTA authorities are hopeful that some tourists from the plains are likely to visit the hills. Industry stakeholders said the opening the tourism sector might not boost business immediately but at least prepare them to draw tourists during the upcoming peak season of October and November.“Murti and Jaldapara in the Dooars received some tourists on Wednesday,” said Tanmoy Goswami, a Siliguri-based tour operator, as he hailed the decision as a key step to revive tourism in the region.Raj Basu, convenor, Association for Conservation and Tourism (ACT), said, “The tourism business will take time to be back on track. The stakeholders can expect some business in October. We have already lost the business in the March-April season. We need to move ahead with a positive mindset, as the livelihood of thousands of people are involved.”Representatives of political parties and hotel owners, however, said they are not sure how community-based surveillance committees would treat tourists since all people coming from outside the region are made to stay in home quarantine for 14 days.Even local people, travelling from Siliguri town, or the neighbouring Kalimpong district, are not exempted. There have been instances, when homes of some families were locked from outside by the surveillance committees. GTA officials have convened a meeting in Darjeeling on Thursday to discuss this issue. Amar Lama, a senior leader of the local Jan Andolan Party (JAP), questioned the GTA authorities’ move.“It is quite unbelievable that tourists are being allowed to travel to the hills, when even local people, travelling from one village to another, are being asked by surveillance committees to stay in quarantine,” Lama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darjeeling-tourist-spots-hotels-open-amid-questions-over-safety/story-YU08LKJeDfcCOuwlzTb3dP.html

01-07-2020||India||PM Modi’s Weibo account goes blank in China; profile photo, posts taken down||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Twitter-like Weibo account in China went blank on Wednesday after his photo, posts and comments were removed from the handle.The removal of all information from Modi’s Weibo comes 10 days after at least three official Indian statements – including the PM’s – were deleted from the Indian embassy’s official account on the popular social media app, WeChat.It could not be immediately ascertained when Modi’s Weibo handle was taken down but on Wednesday, the page was blank.It also comes in the backdrop of India banning 59 Chinese apps on Monday because of security and data breach concerns.Also read: PM Modi debuts on Weibo, told Arunachal belongs to ChinaOn Wednesday, all information from Modi’s account – including his profile photo – were taken down.Modi’s Weibo account was set up in 2015 amid much fanfare and publicity before his first visit to China as prime minister.Since then the account had 244000 followers, many of them Chinese.Since 2015, but barring this year, Modi had wished President Xi Jinping ahead of his birthday on June 15.He also published messages on Sino-India ties especially after meetings with Xi.Modi’s posts on Weibo were in Chinese.An Indian embassy source said, “We are taking action to unsubscribe the account”.The Hindustan Times has reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry for a comment on this development.Also read: Why everyone -- from Narendra Modi to Tim Cook -- is joining WeiboThe sudden taking down of Modi’s Weibo account and removal of the Indian government’s posts on Chinese social media come in the backdrop of the violent face-off, and ongoing tension, between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley region.While 20 Indian Army soldiers died, the Chinese government has so far not revealed the casualties suffered by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) though China has admitted to international diplomats about casualties on its side.On June 20, an India’s external affairs ministry (MEA) statement about the Indian position on the ongoing border tension with China was mysteriously deleted from the embassy’ official Weibo account a day before the WeChat posts were deleted.Tencent, a leading Chinese tech company that owns WeChat didn’t respond to HT’s questions on the taking down of Indian government’s official statements.However, the message that popped up on WeChat when clicking the MEA’s statement on the Galwan Valley clash said: “This content was reported and confirmed by the platform of the following:” before it says in Mandarin: “Suspected of violating relevant laws, regulations and policies”.As it then turns out, according to WeChat, the spokesperson’s statement was removed because it carried “…contents prohibited by laws and regulations of the state.”The long list of regulations include: “endangers national security, divulges state secrets, subverts state power, or undermines national unity, inciting hatred, disseminating false information, inciting illegal assembly, demonstration or gathering of people to disturb public order”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-weibo-account-goes-blank-in-china-profile-photo-posts-taken-down/story-1U1fJXBnLiXth89erJhssK.html
01-07-2020||India||National Doctors’ Day: Meet corona warriors who are going the extra mile||The unprecedented times due to Covid-19 pandemic have demanded some extraordinary efforts from the healthcare professionals. Working in 48 hour shifts in high risk environments while sweltering in PPE kits, the medical practitioners have been doing it all, as the frontline warriors against coronavirus. But that’s not all for some doctors have been going beyond their call of duty to help others survive the difficulties. For families of patients stranded at night shelters outside AIIMS in Delhi, when the lockdown was announced, the situation became worse. Dr Vijay Kumar Gurjar, assistant professor of Geriatric Medicine at AIIMS, took upon himself to provide meals to these family members of patients. He has even made arrangements for access to sanitisers and masks for about a 1,000 people in the slum areas while his social work continues within AIIMS. “As opposed to earlier practice, we are now making two meals available to attendants of patients as well. For them, with nearby places closed, it was hard to make food arrangements. No one should have to go hungry at this hour,’’ Gurjar opines. The need to serve people was also at the core of Gurugram-based gynecologist, Dr Aruna Kalra’s decision when she took the call to keep aside one day in the week to treat for free, those patients who’ve lost their jobs and women who are pregnant. “The situation is exceptionally difficult for people who have lost their jobs during the lockdown. Many pregnant women are finding it very difficult to afford the expense for their treatment. For me, as a doctor, my patients’ health is my first priority,’’ says Kalra. Her concern extends for her nursing staff; she has been cooking all meals for them! “They (nursing staff) give their 100% in taking care of the patients, but often end up neglecting their own health. I feel it’s my responsibility to take care of them as my family,” adds Kalra. Some doctors have even come forth to be angels in disguise for those who have been living through the pandemic alone, and even departing this planet alone. “Everyone deserves to be buried with dignity,’’ says Dr Deepak Devgan, a senior pharmacy officer at Civil Hospital in Amritsar. Devgan has been cremating unclaimed bodies during the pandemic. “There have been instances where the kin have refused to cremate the body of their relative fearing infection while some bodies have been found lying unclaimed in public areas, and were brought to us. I’ve cremated almost 50 people during the lockdown,” shares Devgan, feeling sad that misinformation around coronavirus has led to people not coming forward to put the dead to rest, in a respectful manner. “Indeed the lack of information needs to be addressed during the pndemic,” says Dr Preet Hathi, a senior resident doctor of surgery at Ahmedabad’s Civil Hospital. When on duty, Hathi contracted Covid-19 on May 5. But soon after his recovery, he started donating plasma, and has done it twice by now. “One plasma helps two patients. The idea that I’m directly the cause for recovery of four patients means a lot to me,” he says adding, “Ahmedabad has had about 20,000 patients so far, and only less than 50-60 plasma donations. Even in these, 20 or so would be doctors. We need more people to know that this is safe and effective, and one of the ways to show it is to do yourself,” urges Hathi.

01-07-2020||India||Assam ordinance on land conversion for industries raises concerns on threat to land rights of indigenous people||Assam government’s decision to allow conversion of land without clearances for the setting up industries in the state has sparked a row and has drawn flak from opposition parties.On Monday, the state cabinet had approved an ordinance that allowed micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to set up industries by only submitting a self-declaration.“In a historic and far-reaching decision to ease out the process of setting up industries in Assam, the state cabinet has approved an ordinance today. Now, anyone will be able to set up industry in Assam just by submitting a self-declaration,” industries minister Chandra Mohan Patowary had tweeted on Monday.“No permission, clearance, or licence will be required for three years. Land will also be deemed converted for industrial purposes. Such bold and advantageous change is expected to accelerate the industrialisation process in Assam,” the minister had added.Though more details of the ordinance, which is yet to be approved by Governor Professor Jagdish Mukhi, are not available, apprehensions have surfaced on whether it will lead to the rapid conversion of agricultural land as well as those in tribal belts for industrial purposes without any checks and balances.“This ordinance will severely hurt Assam’s rural economy and the state’s farmers. Not many Assamese have means to procure land and set up industries and the benefit of this ordinance will be reaped by those from outside,” said Debabrata Saikia, a Congress legislator and the leader of opposition in the Assam Assembly.“Last December, when protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was at its peak, the state government had announced that it would enact two laws to protect the land rights of indigenous people. But this ordinance runs contrary to that assurance. We demand that it is repealed immediately,” Saikia said.He also expressed concerns about health and environmental hazards.There is no clarity yet on whether MSMEs willing to set up industries will have to seek environment and pollution clearances.“We have around one lakh MSMEs in Assam and the ordinance could seem aimed at them benefitting from nearly Rs 6,000 crore expected to come to the state as part of the Centre’s Rs 3 lakh crore stimulus package for the sector,” said Nilay Dutta, a senior advocate.“But, existing MSMEs don’t need land. We welcome steps taken to ease setting up new industries, but when they set up business in agricultural land without any clearances, all protection provided to indigenous farmers will disappear in a flash. What was the grave urgency for this move?” Dutta asked.The All Assam Students Union (AASU), a potent political force in the state, said that the ordinance was anti-indigenous people as it goes against the recommendations given by the committee on Clause VI of the Assam Accord and also contrary to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s promise of protecting the state’s maati (land).“Allowing industries to set up without any clearance from the revenue department solely on the basis of a self-declaration form will hit the land rights of Assamese people and make the state a playground for industrialists from outside. We want this ordinance revoked at the earliest,” said Lurinjyoti, Gogoi, general secretary, AASU.Prodyut Bora, the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), alleged that the move would lead to a largescale land grab by “moneybags” and all lands located on both sides of national and state highways would be bought and converted into industries.Bibhab Talukdar, the founder of Guwahati-based wildlife non-governmental organisation (NGO), Aaranyak, too, took exception to the state government’s “hurriedly-conceived move”.“The ordinance appears to be framed hurriedly without assessing Assam’s ability to grow economically without further damaging its ecosystem, goods, and services. An unscientific way of converting agricultural land for industries calls for an immediate re-look. If an industrialist wants to set up an industry in key wilderness spots in the state such as Deepor Beel, located on the south-western part of Guwahati, won’t it compromise the conservation of pristine forests, rich and diverse wildlife and the environment? The state government has a lot to answer for,” said Talukdar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-ordinance-on-land-conversion-for-industries-raises-concerns-on-threat-to-land-rights-of-indigenous-people/story-y5kgSPdFmE5aWHiw38wrbO.html

01-07-2020||India||Imran Khan to join Xi Jinping to shore up Nepal’s PM Oli against India||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has decided to extend his support to Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli who is finding himself increasingly isolated within the ruling Nepal Communist Party after blaming India for a rebellion in his party, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.PM Oli had on Sunday accused his detractors of trying to push him out of power, accusing India and politicians in Nepal of being involved in a conspiracy to topple him for publishing the country’s new map that depicts Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory.This accusation, however, appeared on Tuesday to have backfired on PM Oli after rival leaders such as Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” demanded that he quit his leadership role in the party and government. They had earlier given him an option to retain one of the two posts.Imran Khan’s outreach to PM Oli comes at a time when he is struggling to stay in power.Officials told HT that Islamabad had sent a formal communication to the Nepalese foreign ministry to fix a time for Imran Khan’s phone call to PM Oli.Imran Khan has proposed a 12 noon phone call on Thursday (12.45 pm Nepal Time, 12.30 pm IST).Also Read: How Nepal’s PM is harming tiesDiplomatic sources said it is obvious that the flavour of the conversation is going to be India.Imran Khan’s Pakistan has accused India of engineering the terrorist attack at the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi while PM Oli has been accusing India of destablising his government.The phone call comes at a time Xi Jinping’s China is engaged in a standoff with India over Ladakh. The two prime ministers also owe a huge debt to China for projects that critics say, largely serve Beijing’s interests. “China is their common link,” a Kathmandu watcher said.On the domestic front, PM Oli’s move to come out with a redraw his country’s political map and whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments was an attempt to consolidate his support within the party. PM Oli tried to use it to the hilt this weekend, imputing motives to his rivals who want to see his back.Prachanda and Oli are co-chairs of Nepal’s communist party. Oli is, however, seen to lean a little too heavily towards China and has managed to hold on to the PM’s post due to Beijing’s intervention in the past.PM Oli’s hard push to redraw the Himalayan nation’s political map to create a dispute with New Delhi was also timed to serve China’s interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imran-khan-to-join-xi-jinping-to-shore-up-nepal-s-pm-oli-against-india/story-oOnbE0uSw9LKi8cYmPYrBK.html
01-07-2020||India||‘Let’s stop foreign dependency’: Union minister on China-linked apps ban||Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad underscored on Wednesday that the ban on Chinese mobile apps is a great opportunity to help Indians come up with good apps of their own and end foreign dependence for such things. “In the wake of the ban which we have imposed...I think it is a great opportunity. Can we come up with good apps made by Indians? Let the dependence on foreign apps, with their own agenda for a variety of reasons, stop,” said the IT and telecom minister. Citing national security concerns, the central government on Monday decided to ban 59 mobile applications, including the wildly popular TikTok, linked to China. Government officials told Hindustan Times that the deliberations to ban the apps were fast-tracked after June 15 violent scrap between soldiers at Galwan valley in eastern Ladakh.A statement by Ravi Shankar Prasad’s information technology ministry said the decision was taken as these applications were “engaged in activities prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order”.Beijing on Tuesday said it was “strongly concerned” about New Delhi’s decision to ban Chinese mobile applications. It stressed on cooperation between the two countries and underlined that the ban would go against “India’s interests”.TikTok, a video-sharing platform to create short videos, stopped working in India on Tuesday as the company appeared to comply with the ban. It also no longer came up in searches on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, while the company disabled the webpage. Some of the other prominent applications – such as WeChat and CamScanner – continued to work and were available on the application stores of both platforms till Tuesday night.TikTok, according to Bloomberg data, had nearly 200 million users in India as of January this year and had become one of the most prominent social media tools used by young Indians.In a statement issued by TikToK, the company’s India head, Nikhil Gandhi, said they “have been invited to meet with concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-s-stop-foreign-dependency-union-minister-on-china-linked-apps-ban/story-n6UAp0pBviMWWNcgyIpMaP.html

On June 23 too, the Rath Yatra took place without any devotees.After the morning rituals at Gundicha temple, the three deities set off for the main temple atop their respective chariots. Lord Balabhadra, the eldest was the first to set off in his red-bluish green coloured chariot Taladhwaja, followed by Goddess Subhadra in red-black chariot Darpadalana. Lord Jagannath was the last to start in his red-yellow chariot Nandighosha.The ritual of chhera pahanra (sweeping) was performed by Puri king Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb on three chariots between 10.30 am and 11.15 am. The pulling of chariots started at 11.25 am, ahead of a schedule fixed by the Sri Jagannath temple administration. The entire process is being telecast live by Doordarshan as well as state government’s own agencies.Sri Jagannath temple chief administrator Dr Krishan Kumar said all the rituals of the festival till now have been completed on time.This was also the first time in 285 years when the Bahuda Yatra like the Rath Yatra was held without the presence of a single devotee. The Rath Yatra was earlier stalled following SC order on June 18. However, following interventions by several individuals including the head priest of the temple, the apex court had allowed the Rath Yatra on the condition that there is no public attendance and all entry points into Puri will remain closed. It also said each of 3 chariots, would be pulled by not more than 500 people who test negative for coronavirus.Though around 2,000 servitors were tested ahead of the Rath Yatra on June 23, over 5,500 persons including servitors, police, staff of temple administration and sanitary staff were again tested for the Bahuda Yatra two days ago. Out of them 12 including a servitor tested positive for coronavirus.“The persons who tested positive have been isolated and their contact tracing is on. All the servitors who took part in today’s Bahuda Yatra had tested negative for Covid,” said Puri district collector Balwant Singh.After arriving at Simhadwar, the main gate of the Jagannath temple, the three deities will be draped in Sunabesha (golden attire) on Thursday.Adharpana ritual, which witnesses serving 100 litres of pana (sweet drink) to the deities in specially made terracotta pots, will be held on Friday. On Saturday, the three deities would be taken back to the main temple in a ritual called Niladri Bije.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chariots-of-lord-jagannath-and-siblings-return-to-main-temple-without-devotees/story-FzJkb01hbTWbLnjx6VXmQM.html

While ambulances with toll-free number 104 will run as emergency services in rural areas, 108 will be for the urban parts of the state.Of these new ambulances, 412 and 676 have been divided for urban and rural areas, respectively.The ambulances will run as mobile clinics with advanced life support systems. The ambulances include 26 vehicles that will be used exclusively for neo-natal services equipped with incubators and other essential facilities for babies born with complications.The CM said 676 ambulances would serve as Mobile Medical Units (MMUs), which would provide 20 types of medical services, including all screening for communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs).Altogether, 744 doctors would be made available for these services and they would visit a village once a month to offer medical services, he added.Besides oxygen cylinders, these new ambulances would have ventillators, infusion pumps, syringe pumps, and comfortable stretchers besides provisions for delivery of babies. The vehicles are also enabled with surveillance cameras to ensure proper healthcare monitoring by doctors, he said.The CM also announced a hike in the monthly salaries of ambulance drivers from Rs 18,000 to Rs 28,000 and ambulance technicians from Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000.Special chief secretary (medical and health) KS Jawahar Reddy said the ambulances would be attached to the primary healthcare centres in all the revenue blocks for the deployment of doctors on call.“This would help people know doctors they should contact in emergencies and doctors, too, would have an understanding of the health profile of the villagers in general and families in particular. The government is in the process of preparing digital family health profiles,” he said.The estimated time of arrival of these emergency vehicles to the spot from the time of receiving an emergency call is expected to be 15 minutes in urban areas, 20 minutes in rural areas, and 25 minutes in the remote tribal areas of the state. A new programme, Dr YSR Rahadari Bhadratha, is also being linked to the urban service, where any road accident patient will be treated free of cost in any hospital across the state for the first 48 hours and up to a maximum expenditure of Rs 50,000. Dr. YSR Aarogyasri Health Care Trust would reimburse the expenses for the road accident patients, the CM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ap-acquires-1-088-state-of-the-art-mobile-clinics-to-provide-emergency-medicare-to-patients/story-OXK5Zwyj0IhIBJOk5iBLJL.html

Soon this Coivd-19 immunity booster kit will be available across the country and we are in talks with those states also where due to some confusion the sale of Coronil was being opposed,” said Swami Ramdev.He pointed out that right through from licence seeking process, clinical trials, scientific documentation to submission of all the requisite documents pre and post trials, Patanjali followed each and every rule but undue confusion and doubts were created to malign their sincere efforts on creating an immunity boosting Ayurvedic medicine for Covid-19.Lashing out at those who cast aspersions on Patanjali’s Coronil, Swami Ramdev said that yoga and Ayurveda are ancient time-tested therapies and some segments of society including pro allopathic supporters, drug mafia and multi-national companies were not able to accept the remarkable work being done by Patanjali Yogpeeth in the field of health and medicine through Ayurveda.“The drug mafia, MNCs and anti-national forces want me in jail,” he said.Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit three years ago, during the inauguration of the Patanjali Research Institute, Swami Ramdev recalled that PM Modi had then suggested that Patanjali should establish Ayurveda as evidence-based medicine, for which Patanjali has been for the past few years concentrating immensely with a dedicated team of 500 senior Ayurveda researchers and practitioners working round the clock to achieve this target.The time has come that Ayurveda should be given due medicinal status. We hail from a humble background, are seers, wear saffron clothes but our yoga-ayurveda based work and infrastructure is not going down well with some segments as a result of which we are being dragged unnecessarily into controversies,” said Swami RamdevAcharya Balakrishna, general secretary of Patanjali Yogpeeth, said that Patanjali has carried out clinical trials for more than ten diseases like dengue, hypertension, asthma, swine flu and it’s not the first time that they are conducting virology trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronil-will-be-in-stores-soon-after-ayush-ministry-calls-it-a-covid-19-management-drug/story-Lmhw1MXRZqCf9nD5HoTLFO.html

They also broke the chairs, tore the posters, and damaged a car. There was a scuffle with my security guards. I have informed the local police over the phone and a written complaint will be lodged soon. I could identify a few of the attackers. They are all TMC supporters,” alleged Ghosh.The TMC has, however, rubbished the allegations.Sudip Banerjee, TMC’s leader in the Lok Sabha said: “I hear such allegations from the BJP almost every day. Our party is not associated with such attacks.”Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, condemned the attack and said: “There may be political differences. But for that, you cannot attack the head of a party. This proves how the TMC behaves with opposition parties in Bengal.”“Such attacks would ultimately help Ghosh in bringing him to the limelight. The TMC is helping the BJP. We condemn such attacks,” said Sujan Chakraborty, a Communist Party of India (Marxist) lawmaker, who represents the Jadavpur assembly constituency and also the leader of the Left parties in the Bengal Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-bengal-unit-president-allegedly-heckled-by-tmc-supporters/story-GVdgyvPsrPkktuRwkKLfhI.html
01-07-2020||India||Tests reduced despite rising Covid-19 deaths, cases: AIIMS worker to Rahul Gandhi||A coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patient, who works as a healthcare worker at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, during an interaction on Wednesday with the former Congress president, Rahul Gandhi, lamented that the testing has drastically reduced in the national capital despite a significant increase in viral infection and fatality rates.“This is, indeed, a sad state of affairs. I want to inform you about some statistics. On May 27, the infection rate in Delhi was 13.7%. We were doing 7,000 tests per day. By June 12-13, our infection rate had crossed 30% and we are doing under 5,000 tests per day,” said Vipin Krishnan, who has been working at AIIMS for the past two years.“This is surprising given that our deaths and infection rates are increasing, but we have reduced testing. I don’t understand what is happening?” he asked Gandhi.Krishnan was joined by three other nurses -- Anu Ragnat from New Zealand, Narendra Singh from Australia and Sherlylmol Puravady from the United Kingdom (UK) – who shared their experiences with Gandhi via a video-conference link about fighting the Covid-19 pandemic as frontline healthcare workers. The conversation covered a range of subjects, including the reason behind Indian nurses are sought after across the world and working in a Covid-19 environment that has had an impact on their family lives. Krishnan, who belongs to Kerala and along with his wife is in quarantine after both tested Covid-19 positive, shared statistics about the skewed ratio between doctors and nurses to patients in the country.“We have 1.2 million registered allopathic doctors in India. We have around 3.7 million registered nurses in India. The ratio is 1:1,500 for doctors to patients and 1.7:1,000 nurses to patients in the country,” he said.“However, the WHO (World Health Organisation) had recommended that the ratio should be 1:1,000 doctors to patients and 3:1,000 nurses to patients. Though we are way short of human resources, we are still fighting hard,” Krishnan added.Gandhi said the doctors are a frustrated lot and do not know how to move forward in terms of conducting Covid-19 tests and are facing enormous challenges such as putting a patient, who has contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, next to a non-Covid-19 patient. “I think the government is trying to manage the perception and trying to give a sense that the problem is not as bad as it is. But I believe that we have to face the problem. We should accept and define the problem accurately and then fight it. I don’t know how you react to that,” the former Congress chief said.“You are absolutely correct,” Krishnan replied.“We have a pandemic situation and the AIIMS director has said that we will peak in June and mid-July. So, even the Delhi chief minister has stated that they are expecting 5.5 lakh cases. We are having 10,000 beds in Delhi. Can you imagine the gravity of the situation, if 5.5 lakh people were to be admitted? Of course, they won’t come at the same time, but on average we will have lakh patients a day. I can’t imagine the gravity of the situation. What will we do?” he asked.Krishnan claimed that outpatient departments (OPDs) in many government hospitals have ceased to function. “We have no way out. We have to think about how to help non-Covid-19 patients. I have also received many calls from cancer patients and others asking for help but we are unable to help. Most of the beds are being allocated for Covid-19 patients, not just in AIIMS but in most government hospitals.”Krishnan also talked about the difference between government and private hospitals in the country.“There is a sea of difference between government hospitals and private hospitals in India… When we look into the private sector, there are a lot of discriminations. Private nurses are saying that their salaries are being cut. How will they care for their families during this pandemic? In such a situation, I think the government must help them and pay their entire salaries. In this condition, it is difficult for them to survive,” he said.Asked by Gandhi if he was scared, Krishnan replied: “I don’t think we are scared of the Covid-19 pandemic. To save the country, we have to fight at the frontlines. My own experience showed that. I was not scared but now that I have been infected, I am still not scared. I want to tell you and the government that once I recover, I want to go back to the Covid-19 ward.”He also demanded that doctors and nurses should be included under the risk allowance category of the central government, as they are losing their lives while fighting against Covid-19 as frontline workers like the army personnel, who are busy guarding the country’s borders.“We can compare this (Covid-19) to a bio-war. It is not a bio-war, but a virus, a small microscopic organism is challenging the world and the country at large. So, we are fighting like the army or the air force. I’m not comparing this with our force. But at least I think you will agree with that we are fighting as an army,” Krishnan said.“Yes, you are a non-violent army,” agreed Gandhi.“We are exhausted but we are fighting in the frontline without any fear or favour. We will win. You and the government are with us. I have complete faith that we will fight this war against Covid-19 and win,” added Krishnan.He also claimed that the voice of healthcare workers is not being heard while making policies. “When a policy is being made related to nurses and the medical profession at large, the experts should be asked for their inputs. Then, only the policies should be made. Unfortunately, that has not been happening in our country. Many organisations’ leaders are not being called when it comes to policymaking decisions.”While Ragnat shared her experiences in New Zealand, Singh gave an account of how the Covid-19 battle is fought in Australia and Puravady talked about the challenges faced by the UK.In Australia, Singh, who is from Rajasthan, said initially Covid-19 was thought to be a simple flu and not taken seriously. “But once the viral outbreak became widespread, we saw it on news every day. And then Italy’s mortality rate started climbing. That was time we started thinking that it was not the simple flu. This is really serious. I think we have to take this viral outbreak seriously,” he said.Talking about her experience in the UK, Puravady, who also belongs to Kerala, told Gandhi that they were quick to use the personal protective equipment (PPE) units such as surgical masks, aprons, and gloves even before the lockdown restrictions were announced.In the UK, she said people are respectful of healthcare workers. “We have dedicated shopping time for the National Health Service (NHS) staff or the care workers. Every Thursday the government is putting it as the clapping for the care workers and things like that. So it is so supportive, all supermarket authorities are very supportive.”Ragnat, who is also from Kerala, said the figures could have gone up easily into five digits if New Zealanders were careless.“So, I think going hard and going early was the motto of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. She’s done absolutely well. I think going hard and early was really the right thing and that really flattened the curve in New Zealand,” she added.Ragnat said the New Zealand government had the beginning itself announced a $10-million package, including accommodation for healthcare workers. “If you don’t want to go back home to an immune-compromised family member, you can stay either in a hospital or in nearby motels and the government would pay for that. Listening to the rest of the team, I feel like we are in a blessed position actually,” she said.Asked by Gandhi why Indian nurses are valued so much abroad, Puravady said they are very hardworking and dedicate their lives to the profession.“They don’t care about themselves. They see the patients in front of them as either their parents or children, their mother, their brother or sister,” she said.“I think we are go-getters. We are always on the frontline. I think we are ready to cope in any country in any situation, in any scenario, and easily adapt being in few other roles,” she added.The dialogue was a part of Gandhi’s series of video conversations with global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences on the country’s economy.In the past, the Congress chief had interacted with former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan; Nobel Laureate Professor Abhijit Banerjee; Harvard Professor Ashish Jha; Swedish epidemiologist Johan Giesecke; Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj and the former US under-secretary of state Nicholas Burns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/testing-reduced-despite-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-infections-rates-aiims-health-worker-to-rahul-gandhi/story-6NIEjMamoGl7x5XcMA8eZM.html
01-07-2020||India||Spurred by business resumption, GST revenue improves in June||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection, a weathervane of economic health, has posted a 46% jump in June at Rs 90,917 crore compared to the previous month, indicating a recovery in business activities post 68-day nationwide Covid-19 lockdown. However, the revenue is still 9% short of Rs 99,939 crore collected in June last year.The GST collections for April was Rs 32,294 crore, a 72% year-on-year decline, the first full month under the 68-day nationwide coronavirus lockdown since March 25, a finance ministry statement said. Although the GST revenue for May saw some improvements at Rs 62,009 crore, it was still 38% less than the revenue collected in the same month last year, the statement said.The government had not released revenue collection figures for April and May this year. In March 2020, the revenue collection dipped by 8% at Rs 97,597 crore even as the slowdown had affected only the last week of the month. Giving subdued collection in June 2020, the statement said the revenues from import of goods came down by 29% and the revenues from the domestic transactions (including import of services) came down by 3%.“However, since the government has allowed a relaxed time schedule for filing of GST returns, returns of the month of April, March, as well as some returns of February, got filed during June 2020 and some returns of May 2020, which would have otherwise got filed in June, will get filed during first few days of July,” it said.The GST collections for the first quarter of the current financial year is 41% less than Rs 3,14,090 crore revenue collected during the same quarter previous year. “However, a large number of taxpayers still have time to file their return for May 2020,” it said.“The gross GST revenue collected in the month of June 2020 is Rs 90,917 crore of which CGST [Central GST] is Rs 18,980 crore, SGST [State GST] is Rs 23,970 crore, IGST [Integrated GST] is Rs 40,302 crore (including Rs 15,709 crore collected on import of goods) and cess is Rs 7,665 crore (including Rs 607 crore collected on import of goods),” it said.The government has settled Rs 13,325 crore to CGST and Rs 11,117 crore to SGST from IGST as regular settlement, it said. The total revenue earned by the Union government and the state governments after regular settlement in June 2020 was Rs 32,305 crore for CGST and Rs 35,087 crore for the SGST, it added.MS Mani, partner at consultancy firm Deloitte India said, “While a decline in GST revenues was expected due to business activities coming to a near standstill, these revenue numbers indicate that a revival is underway and collections will improve in the coming months.”“It is also very interesting to note that in June some of larger producing states have shown an increase in collections or stable revenues compared to last year while some of the consuming states have shown a decline,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spurred-by-business-resumption-gst-revenue-improves-in-june/story-DWvOZ7qsMCm00JcKMG2WxO.html

While the son died on the same night, the father breathed his last on the morning of June 23.Judicial magistrate M S Barathidasan, who investigated the incident, submitted a four-page inquiry report which includes the testimony of a policewoman, the only eyewitness on record. The policewoman has said in the testimony that both Jayaraj and Bennicks were beaten through the night on June 19.“There were blood stains on the lathis and a table,” she said and asked the magistrate to obtain them immediately.The report also claimed that camera footage from that night was unavailable because the CCTV camera inside the police station was set on auto-delete.Barathidasan said in the report that the police staff at the station did not cooperate in the investigation. In fact, it further mentioned, that Additional Deputy Superintendent of Police D Kumar “flexed his body to show his physical strength” before the magistrate.Kumar, Deputy superintendent of police C Prathapan and constable Maharajan are facing contempt case based on Barathidasan’s complaint. Three other policemen of the station - one inspector and two sub inspectors - were suspended from duty last week.The incident has led to political battle in Tamil Nadu with Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin accusing chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami of concealing the brutal murders at the police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shocked-rajinikanth-demands-punishment-in-tamil-nadu-custodial-death-case/story-VXvmKIEttSEZSl2UqX7GVK.html

CERT-In also said that it found these extensions contained code to bypass Google Chrome’s Web store security scans.CERT-In comes under the Ministry of Electronics and Technology and deals with cyber security threats.The malicious extensions had the ability to take screenshots, read the clipboard, harvest authentication cookies or grab user keystrokes to read passwords and other confidential information, said the agency.The agency advised Internet users to only install extensions which are absolutely needed and refer user reviews before doing so.Last month, researchers had said that spyware effort attacked users through 32 million downloads of extensions to Google’s Chrome web browser. Google had said that it removed more than 70 of the malicious add-ons from its official Chrome Web Store after being alerted by the researchers.Most of the free extensions purported to warn users about questionable websites or convert files from one format to another. Instead, they siphoned off browsing history and data that provided credentials for access to internal business tools.In January this year, Google had suspended all the commercial extensions in the wake of a significant increase in the number of fraudulent transactions that aim to exploit users.Malicious developers have been using Google’s Chrome Store as a conduit for a long time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-s-cyber-security-agency-says-over-100-malicious-chrome-extension-removed-asks-users-to-be-cautious/story-1fRfBC0ByDkjPsurGAZawM.html

01-07-2020||India||BSNL’s 4G tender scrapped, Chinese companies may be excluded in next round||The BSNL 4G upgradation tender was cancelled on Wednesday by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). The decision comes after the DoT decided to issue fresh specifications for the upgradation process.A fresh tender will be issued by the DoT, officials said, in the next two weeks after the six-member committee set up to review the upgradation requirement submits its report. The tender will focus on boosting the Indian manufacturing sector, as the DoT pushes the government’s flagship initiative, Make in India. The Central government had instructed BSNL to not use Chinese equipment for the upgrade - days after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash with Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) - which is likely to cost Rs 7,000-8,000 crore.In the fresh tender, DoT may ask government telcos, BSNL and MTNL, to not use equipment from Chinese companies, DoT officials told Hindustan Times.“However, any decision will only be taken after the committee’s report is submitted,” said the official on the condition of anonymity. HT had earlier reported that the six-committee is headed by a DoT Technology advisor K Ramchand and has representatives from BSNL and MTNL, two independent experts and another representative from the industry.The fresh tender will be on “futuristic” and “realistic” expectations, officials had earlier told HT.The move is part of the DoT push to reduce reliance of India’s telecom sector on foreign equipment and increase domestic manufacturing. According to experts, nearly 75% of the telecom equipment is sourced from China. Two major Chinese firms with a stake in the Indian market are ZTE and Huawei, both Chinese companies. Other major players include Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung. The DoT is also in the process of starting the 5G spectrum testing, in which Huawei was slated to take part. Separately, the DoT is also in consultation with private telecom service providers to encourage the use of equipment manufacture in India.Earlier this week, the electronics and information technology ministry had also banned 59 Chinese apps citing security concerns. According to former DoT technology advisor RK Bhatnagar, the DoT in February 2020 had issued a memorandum that said India is liable to take reciprocal action against any country that does not provide market access. “Although it wasn’t explicitly stated, the context was China,” Bhatnagar told Hindustan Times. “Whether DoT explicitly states it in the fresh tender or not, it is unlikely procurement from Chinese firms will be allowed.”Bhatnagar added that the Federal Communications Commission, US, has designated Huawei and ZTE as a “national security risk”. He also said that during a national crisis the government also has the right to take over any network, even private ones. “There is no mandatory testing of equipment that is procured,” said Bhatnagar. “Right now, the situation with China is tense but if it escalates they use the equipment and sabotage us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsnl-4g-tender-cancelled-after-dot-excludes-chinese-companies/story-heXvPzkfYDKju3ZZHSK1sM.html

The company said that it has procured the licence approval for Divya Coronil tablet and Divya Swasarivati on their “traditional reported usage”. “Ayurvedic drug licences and control clinical trials are two different streams,” the statement read.This comes a day after Acharya Balkrishna, the chief executive officer of Patanjali clarified that the company never claimed that its newly-tested medicines would treat Covid-19.“We cited Coronil as ayurvedic medicine for immunity boosting, fever, cough and allergic problems,” Balkrishna said, adding, “Only results of clinical trial based curing of positive patients were claimed by us”.Last week, Patanjali Ayurved launched a drug called “Coronil”, claiming that it had cured within a week all Covid-19 patients who took part in a trial conducted in Jaipur.The claim triggered a row with the Union AYUSH ministry directing the firm not to sell the drug.Uttarakhand’s Ayurveda department said the firm had only applied for a licence to manufacture an immunity booster and not a cure for coronavirus.In reply to a notice by the Uttarakhand government, Patanjali clarified not promoting any “kit” to treat Covid-19 and only sharing the findings of the “successful trial” of a medicine on patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-difference-of-opinion-with-ayush-ministry-patanjali-issues-statement/story-DSvJWjobZcHUg8XLM8xGlJ.html

The five countries are party to a treaty for cooperation in signals intelligence and the alliance has faced criticism in recent years for its covert activities.RNZ cited one New Zealand source, who spent more than 20 years at the highest levels of the public sector, as saying he was concerned about the nature of the work SIS carried out for its Five Eyes partners.The source, who had close dealings with intelligence agencies, said “New Zealand came under pressure from its Five Eyes partners, especially the US and Australia, to do their dirty work”. The source also felt New Zealand “sometimes risked its international reputation by doing things that largely benefited Five Eyes partners”.Breaking into an embassy is a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which states that foreign missions are inviolable and the host country should not even open diplomatic mail bags.Geoffrey Palmer, New Zealand’s prime minister between August 1989 and September 1990, said he had not heard of the raids on the Indian and Iranian embassies but should have been alerted by SIS if they occurred when he was in charge of the agency.“If it was at the time I was prime minister, I most certainly should have been,” he told RNZ.Jim Bolger, prime minister during 1990-97, said he too couldn’t recall signing any warrants to allow SIS to break into foreign embassies. He expressed surprise there had been a raid on the Indian mission and asked why New Zealand would want to carry out a covert attack on India.Bolger said: “I have no recollection of that ever hitting my desk and if it did, I have to say, my memory is not gone yet, I’d be very surprised if I was ever advised of any such event. I have no recollection – and that’s not just a brush-off.”Former premier Helen Clark refused to confirm or deny whether raids happened during her term as prime minister between 1999 and 2008.SIS said in a statement it was “unable to respond to questions about what may or not be specific operational matters”. The statement added: “The mission of the NZSIS has always been to keep New Zealanders safe, protect our key national institutions and promote New Zealand’s national advantage.”RNZ learned about the raids after piecing together information gained over months of engaging with multiple sources in New Zealand, Britain and the US. The raids were brought to light by Wellington-based writer and documentary maker John Daniell, whose mother and stepfather worked for SIS, and RNZ journalists.In February, the Washington Post had reported that CIA and its West German counterpart, BND, had controlled Crypto AG, which made coding machines for dozens of countries, including India and Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-zealand-intelligence-broke-into-indian-mission-in-1989-and-1991/story-KBSMcx9xpvEvoZYUeyZf1N.html

This is important to ensure that biased information shouldn’t reach Indian users, the organisation of the digital arms of media companies said.Pawan Agarwal, DNPA chairman said this is the time that we should consider upholding India’s security, sovereignty as the utmost priority.On Monday, the government banned 59 mobile apps linked to China citing concerns that these are ‘prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order’.DNPA underscored that Beijing had practically banned Indian media in China, preventing people in their country from accessing news and opinion from India. “None of the Indian websites can be opened in China even via a VPN (virtual private network),” the statement said.The DNPA’s communication to the government comes days after Robert O’Brien, National Security Adviser in the Trump administration, spoke about heavy investments by the China’s communist party into overseas propaganda operations. O’Brien said the communist party owned or worked closely with nearly every Chinese language news outlet in the US and was making inroads into English language media as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-china-funded-news-platforms-in-india-online-publishers-group-dnpa-to-centre/story-UcZE3Mi6gYDsd2ZV2COOMO.html
01-07-2020||India||Pak terrorist killed along LoC, infiltration bid foiled||The Indian Army on Wednesday foiled an intrusion bid and killed a Pakistani terrorist along the Line of Control (LoC) in Rajouri district in the Jammu division of the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K). “We acted on the basis of specific intelligence inputs from J&K Police and a joint operation was launched close to the LoC in Keri area of Bhimber Gali sector in Jammu division’s Rajouri district,” said Lieutenant Colonel, Devender Anand, spokesperson, Indian Army.“Terrorists were seen crossing the LoC. Our alert troops foiled the infiltration bid. One terrorist was killed and an AK-47 rifle and two magazines were recovered. The search operation is still on,” he added.The infiltration bid was foiled around 5.55am and the terrorists had entered 400 metres inside the Indian territory in the Keri sector, said an Army source, requesting anonymity.On Tuesday, Dilbag Singh, director-general of police (DGP), J&K Police, had said the UT’s anti-infiltration grid is intact, despite active terror launch pads across the LoC constantly trying to infiltrate terrorists.“Our anti-infiltration grid is intact on the border and in the hinterland. But, at the same time, the launch pads of Pakistan are active and they keep trying to push terrorists to our side. Our security forces have foiled their sinister designs and will keep doing so,” he had told media persons after reviewing the security scenario along the LoC and in the hinterland in Jammu’s division’s Poonch district.Singh had said that the anti-terror operations are on at full throttle in Kashmir and 128 terrorists have been eliminated by the security forces to date this year.“In the Kashmir Valley, 48 terrorists have been eliminated in June alone. So far, 128 terrorists, of which 70 belonged to Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), 20 each from Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and remaining from other groups, have been killed in anti-terror operations,” he had said.The DGP said that two terrorists were killed during an operation in Bijbehara in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district on Tuesday. The slain terrorists were involved in the killing of an infant (5) and a CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) jawan on Sunday.There has been a spurt in ceasefire violation and infiltration attempts by Pakistan along the International Border (IB) and the LoC since March 15 amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.But there has been a concerted bid to mount anti-terror operations to stymie the home-grown jihadi groups’ terror attacks.The J&K administration is making all necessary arrangements for the annual Amarnath Yatra in the south Kashmir Himalayas, which is likely to be held from July 23 to August 3 from the shorter Baltal track in the Ganderbal district.In 2017, a bus, carrying Amarnath pilgrims from Gujarat, was attacked by terrorists in Anantnag district that left seven of them dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-terrorist-killed-along-loc-infiltration-bid-foiled/story-Gj8UeV4ThFRaOHyua3lq7M.html

The state topped 2,000 cases on June 4 and it took another 10 days for the figure to double. Assam has reported 12 Covid-19 related deaths till Tuesday and 5,647 patients have recovered from the viral infection at a recovery rate of 72%.So far, the north-east’s most populous state has conducted over four lakh Covid-19 tests.“Our aggressive and targeted testing is designed to flatten the curve by tracing all those who may be potentially infected. Continuing Herculean efforts, health department teams reached test figures of 412,214 today,” Sarma tweeted on Tuesday.Though the viral outbreak was under check in Assam until April, the situation worsened from May 4 onwards amid the easing of lockdown restrictions and the resumption of domestic flights that led to the return of over 3.5 lakh stranded people to the state.The state government has imposed the 14-day lockdown in the Kamrup Metro district after around three dozen Covid-19 positive cases were detected last week among people, who didn’t have any recent travel history.However, the surge is yet to be under control in Guwahati, despite the imposition of lockdown restrictions.Guwahati has reported 1,727 Covid-19 positive cases to date.Earlier, the minister had said that 890 hospital beds are available for Covid-19 patients in the Kamrup Metro district and justified the imposition of lockdown because of the spike in the viral outbreak.On Tuesday, the minister inaugurated a 250-bed facility for Covid-19 patients at Palashbari on the outskirts of Guwahati. Another 900-bed Covid-19 facility is expected to be opened soon at Khanapara in Guwahati on the Assam-Meghalaya border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-s-covid-19-cases-double-in-fortnight-to-cross-8-000-guwahati-worst-hit/story-KVqrCy3hxAYYgEQiFH5kXI.html
01-07-2020||India||Doctor’s Day: How to address exacerbating burnout rate among medics due to Covid-19||With the contagious Covid-19 virus gripping the nation, the first line of defence, doctors and other healthcare workers have been caught in the eye of a storm. The saviours are at the highest risk for depression, insomnia, anxiety, and increased alcohol consumption. The thought that you may cause the infection to your loved ones when you go back home every single day is crawling under their bellies.“There is always a constant fear that runs in my mind that what if I am spreading the deadly coronavirus to my children, who diligently follow the hygiene guidelines as suggested by the health bodies,” said Dr Shuchin Bajaj, Internal Medicine, Ujala Cygnus Orthocare Hospital, New Delhi.Besides battling with fear, Dr Bajaj also struggles with sparing quality time for the family. “Since life has become different especially for a healthcare professional, I try to utilize the time with my family as I know I might have just a couple of hours to spend with them in our 24-hour job. It’s very hard to express those feelings as a father, who can’t hug their children and kiss them,” added Dr Bajaj.Who would have thought that the person who could provide aid against the disease would be in the clutches of the disease itself? Doctors who are in hotspots usually show a higher degree of a psychological burden compared to the ones away from them.“A large proportion of healthcare professionals, especially doctors are experiencing symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and psychological distress. They report severe symptoms, which should not come as a surprise, as they often must engage in a lot of emotional labour, like reassuring patients, while keeping their own emotions in check,” said Dr Shweta Sharma, Consultant-Clinical Psychologist, Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurugram.The old adage ‘Prevention is Better than Cure’ comes handy for the doctors when it comes to stopping the Covid-19 spread. The sole fear among doctors which increases anxiety level in them is of their family being affected due to them, along with long working hours with PPE kits.“I practice Yoga, meditation to come out of depression and try spending quality time with my family with some recreational activities,” said Dr Ashok Rai, BAMS, MD, Kanchan Poly Clinic, Badarpur.“Though it is a noble profession, for one to embrace it every single day and fight one’s fear and the patients’ fear and illness is not an easy task. Doctors should be discussing with their peers and watch their moods in terms of feeling sad, mood swings, increased irritability, increased anger, please speak to someone competent to handle mental health,” said Dr Preeti Singh, Sr Consultant Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Paras Hospitals, Gurugram.Like soldiers on the frontline, doctors are performing their duties during the ongoing pandemic with utmost diligence. We need to acknowledge their contribution and should express the gratitude in these testing times. Life has become an emergency drill for medics working 24X7 at a full-fledged Covid-19 hospital armed with PPE kit and determination to save lives. National Doctor’s Day, July 1, is a perfect day to thank all of them for their round the clock service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-s-day-how-to-address-exacerbating-burnout-rate-among-medics-due-to-covid-19/story-B1jyQoymtJJULhFvRpjELJ.html

01-07-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi talks to Indian nurses from across globe, discusses Covid-19 situation||On National Doctors Day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday hosted a conversation with Indian nurses from around the world on the Covid-19 crisis.The conversation revolved around the Covid-19 situation around the world and how the nurses’ experience can help in tackling the disease.“When this Covid-19 started, we initially thought this is a simple flu. We thought this flu is killing more people than Covid. We didn’t take it seriously. When it started rolling over, and we saw news in Italy that the death toll is rising higher and higher, then we thought that this is not a flu, that this is serious,” said Narendra Singh, who works in Australia’s New South Wales. He belongs to Sikar in Rajasthan.Another Indian-orign nurse, Anu Ragnat, who works in New Zealand said that the tough policies adopted by prime minister Jacinda Arden helped flattened the curve. “Going hard and going early was the motto by Prime Minister Jacinda Arden. That really flattened the curve in New Zealand,” said Ragnat.Vipin Krishnan, who works in Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said that there are differences in the pay given to nurses in private and government hospitals. “Private hospitals are deducting salaries if these nurses. How are they going to look after their families in such a scenario?” he asked.Krishna belongs to Kerala and has contracted Covid-19. “Me and my wife have been infected. We are right now in quarantine,” he said but added that he is ready to again work on the frontline once he is cured.Krishnan also talked about the statement made by Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia where he had estimated that Delhi will have 5.5 lakh Covid-19 patients by July end. The AIIMS staffer said that a shortage of beds at hospitals could pose a problem if that happens.However, Sisodia has now said that the going was tough in the first two weeks of June, but the national capital is now in a comfortable situation as far as management of the Covid-19 crisis is concerned. Union home minister Amit Shah, who has been coordinating with the Delhi government to check the spread of the disease, had earlier said that he doesn’t agree with Sisodia’s comments and that the 5.5 lakh estimate created fear.The nurses today also talked about their learnings from the Covid-19 crisis. Almost all of them emphasised on the hand hygiene and wearing proper PPE kits.Gandhi had earlier said that he was “immensely grateful” to the doctors who are on the frontlines fighting against the coronavirus pandemic.“On Doctors Day, I am immensely grateful to the dedicated professionals who inspire hope in (the) Covid-19 times,” the Congress leader had tweeted on Wednesday morning.The first National Doctor’s day was celebrated in July 1991.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-talks-to-indian-nurses-from-across-globe-discusses-covid-19-situation/story-b6TiJ3DzwP30l3SK4dIwtI.html
01-07-2020||India||India sending high-powered boats to match heavier Chinese vessels while patrolling Ladakh lake||Indian Navy is sending a dozen high-powered, bigger capacity and top-of-the-line surveillance equipped steel boats to Ladakh so that the Indian Army can patrol Pangong Tso and match the heavier Type 928 B vessels of the Chinese Army lake fleet. The Pangong Tso lake is at the centre of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aggression in East Ladakh with the Chinese bullying India into ceding territory on both the banks and deliberately pushing the Modi government into retaliatory mode.While the third senior military commander level talks stretched late into Tuesday night at Chushul, the word out is that they were held in cordial atmosphere with both the Leh Corps Commander and his Xinjiang Military district counterpart discussing the specifics of de-escalation and dis-engagement along the 3488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC).The decision to send steel hulled boats to Pangong Tso was taken by the tri-services this week with the Navy asked to transport the vessels through C-17 heavy lift transporters to Leh on a priority basis. Apart from signalling Indian intent to stand up strong to any Chinese provocation, the heavier vessels will not be pushed around in the water by PLA boat fleet. Even though there are some logistical issues in transporting the huge boats by plane, solutions are being worked out by both Indian Navy and Army.The Indian Navy is forwardly deployed on its eastern and western seaboards with its naval fleets monitoring the movement of ships from Andamans Sea to Persian Gulf to prevent any untoward activity.While ostensibly China is talking peace and disengagement in the East Ladakh, it is quite evident to Indian national security planners that the PLA is actually consolidating on the four stand-off points along the 1597 KM LAC in the western sector. The amassing of troops in the Galwan sector, the building of road at Gogra point, the upgradations of communications at Hot Springs and the massive infra push at the Pangong Tso all shows that the PLA has no intentions to restore status quo ante. Instead, the PLA is hell-bent on provoking Indian Army by trying to nibble more territory and force an escalation on the border.The Modi government has given Indian military a free hand to deal with the situation on the border as China has decided to turn the difference on the LAC into permanent dispute. The Indian troops and air force are all standing up to the PLA but will not initiate escalation on their own but only responds to the Chinese aggression. Just like 2001 Operation Parakram, Indian Forces are prepared to wait till such time status quo ante is restored in East Ladakh.Even as the world, particularly the US and Russia, are waking up to new Chinese aggression, the Middle kingdom has always been a civilizational concept with Beijing rulers in the past two centuries. In this concept the only refined society is China with the rest of world being barbarians or tributary states. By contesting sovereignty of Senkaku islands with Japan, contesting Taiwan security with US, contesting South China Sea with ASEAN and forcing India into a military stand-off in Ladakh, China is cocking a snook at the globe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sending-high-powered-boats-to-match-heavier-chinese-vessels-while-patrolling-ladakh-lake/story-FZSNWwepM10bzGg0CoXGIJ.html

As many as 19 people died in the attack, apart from four terrorists of the Balochistan Liberation Army.According to diplomats based in New York, China on Tuesday proposed a UNSC statement on the attack and put it under silence till 4 pm (US East Coast Time). While such statements are routinely issued by the UNSC after a terror attack, fellow UNSC members intervened at the last moment expressing reservations on uncalled statements by Pakistan. Politically beleaguered Prime Minister Imran Khan followed rising star foreign minister Makdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi in blaming India for the attack without even a shred of evidence. India on its part has totally rejected the outlandish charge.It is understood that fellow UNSC members said the matter should not be dealt by the security council after Qureshi’s statement had vitiated the atmosphere by blaming an elect non-permanent member of the council.Also read: ‘No doubt’ India behind attack on Karachi stock exchange, says Pak PM Imran KhanWhile the UNSC statement is expected to be issued later in the day today, the Chinese diplomats expressed their frustration on the issue to other members by saying that it is the obligation of the UNSC to lend its voice “in time.” One Chinese diplomat in UN said that taking action “slowly will send a bad signal to others and the victims.” It is another matter that China blocked designation of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as global terrorist under 1267 resolution at the behest of Pakistan.An internal communication from the Chinese diplomat recorded that they had to extend the silence process after a member asked for extension at the last minute. The procedure is now stands extended till 10 am (East Time) on July 1, 2020.Also read: 2 Taj hotels in Mumbai get threat calls from ‘LeT operative in Pak’, cops step up vigilWhile the Chinese UN diplomats have asked the Council members to act seriously and follow the rules, fact is that the Karachi Stock Exchange attack has been condemned by UN Secretary General, members of the Security Council and India, which is outside the council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/members-unhappy-over-pakistan-blaming-india-for-karachi-blast-unsc-statement-delayed/story-TC5uhWGps57eHidSGEii4M.html

Three CRPF personnel also got injured in the attack. Area has been cordoned off and search is on to nab the #terrorists,” Kashmir Zone Police tweeted.The man, a 64-year-old resident of Srinagar, was passing by in his vehicle when the attack happened and was killed in the firing, officials said. His grandson was also with him.“JKP #rescued a three years old boy from getting hit by bullets during #terrorist #attack in #Sopore. @JmuKmrPolice (sic),” Kashmir Zone Police tweeted.However, his family said he reached the spot after the attack and alleged that CRPF personnel asked him to get out of his vehicle and killed him on the road.A CRPF spokesperson said they have not received any input from the ground.After the attack, the area was cordoned off and a search operation launched to track down the assailants.Dilbag Singh, Jammu and Kashmir’s director general of police, had said on Tuesday that anti-terror operations are on at full throttle in Kashmir and 128 terrorists have been eliminated by the security forces so far this year.“In the Kashmir region, 48 terrorists have been eliminated this month.

Websites of many departments are also only in English language. Similarly, many municipal corporations are issuing notices, letters, applications and samples only in English. Complaints in this regard have been raised by the public representatives time and again,” states the circular.Instructions to all the department heads on using Marathi in all the official business have been issued in the past. They are again directed to strictly implement the instructions and take necessary action against those who are found not following the instructions.In the budget session of the state assembly in February, the government had passed a law making Marathi language a mandatory subject in schools.Marathi Language Minister Subhash Desai and Education Minister Varshan Gaikwad reviewed the progress in this regard in a meeting in May. They said that Marathi language will become a compulsory subject from the academic year 2020-21 for classes 1 to 6 in schools of different mediums and education boards in Maharashtra.Maharashtra has studied laws enacted by southern states of Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala that made their languages mandatory in schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-marathi-in-official-communication-those-violating-the-order-to-not-get-increment-maharashtra-govt/story-djPcOGdkFyWopdzA84ZHVN.html
01-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand govt clears forest land transfer to build roads near China border||The Uttarakhand government has cleared diversion of about 70 hectares of forest land in the Gangotri National Park for construction of three strategically important roads to China border. The decision was taken in the 15th State Wildlife Advisory Board meeting on Monday, officials said.The road proposals cleared include preserving the Gartang Gali road in the Uttarkashi district, an ancient road between India and Tibet.Uttarakhand forest minister Harak Singh Rawat said that these roads are important from the national security point of view as they connect the base camps of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) set up near China border in Uttarkashi district.“In a big move for national security, wildlife clearance proposal was given for three roads passing through Gangotri National Park which includes a 11.85 km long road from Sumla to Thangla for which transfer of 30.39 hectares of forest land was approved. The second road is a 6.21 km long road from Tripani to Rangmachagar for which transfer of 11.218 hectares of forest land was approved. The third road is a 17.60 km long road from Mandi to Sangchokla for which transfer of 31.76 hectares of forest land was approved,” said Rawat.These proposals will now be sent to National Board for Wildlife for final approval.When asked about the impact on forests and the environment due to the construction of the roads, the minister said, “If a road is constructed then there will be a slight impact on the environment, but this region is important from national security point of view. The impact would not be much as the common man would not be using these road and it would only be for the security personnel. The construction of the roads will improve the supply of food, ration, weapons for our soldiers.”He added the estimation will be done to find out the number of trees that “might have to be cut for construction of these roads.”“During the 1962 war we did not have roads constructed till the border area and China was in an advanced position. The stand-off at the border is happening because India has started constructing roads and strengthening border areas. With the current condition of roads, it is difficult to take weapons to the border points, but once the road is constructed, that process will become smooth,” added Rawat.NB Sharma, deputy director of Gangotri National Park, said these three roads are in the interior part of the park near the China border.“From areas of Sumla, Tripani and Mandi, our troops including army and ITBP personnel have to reach the border area on foot. The State Wildlife Advisory Board at present has given wildlife clearance and the proposal will now be sent to National Board for Wildlife for further clearance after which the land transfer process will start. The area where the roads will be constructed is at a height of 15,000 feet from sea level and have complete barren lands with no trees. Only some grasses grow in that area and as there are almost no trees, they would not have to be cut,” said Sharma.However, experts say that environmental impact should also be considered along with the strategical importance of the project.Ajay Singh Rawat, an environmentalist, said, “For the construction of roads, agencies might have to opt for blasting, which will disturb the mountains and can trigger tremendous landslides. If motorable roads are made at such places without giving importance to the ecological effect and a landslide occurs, then the road will be blocked. These areas are part of the catchment area for the Indo-Gangetic plains, which is home to 40% of India’s population. If the ecology of such an area is disturbed, then the impact percolates down to other states also.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-clears-forest-land-transfer-to-build-roads-near-china-border/story-5zAgMiDVTfqoTKrsKfptHM.html
01-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand Congress leader says ‘corona sent by Lord Krishna’, BJP demands apology over comparison||A controversy erupted after Uttarakhand Congress vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana said the coronavirus pandemic has been sent by Lord Krishna, drawing a sharp response from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state.Dhasmana reportedly made the comment while participating in a debate on a local Hindi news channel on Monday evening. The statement was soon shared by several users on social media and many accused him of ‘insulting’ the Sanatan Dharma. “Both Corona and Krishna starts with the sound of ‘K’. Hence it’s obvious that the coronavirus has been sent by him in this world,” he reportedly said.Dhasmana, however, stated he had said nothing against Sanatan Dharma or Lord Krishna. “My statement was completely misconstrued. I had clearly quoted the Gita while making the statement. In Gita, Lord Krishna himself has said that he is only the creator, preserver and destroyer of the world. Nothing in the world happens without his will. Referring to that I said, corona has been sent by Lord Krishna and its vaccine will also be developed by his will,” said Dhasmana.The BJP demanded an apology from the Congress over Dhasmana’s statement.“The statement shows how mentally bankrupt Congress has become. Lord Krishna came into this world to destroy the demons but by saying both corona and Krishna starts with ‘K’, Congress has compared him with the demon of corona in today’s world which is highly condemnable,” Devendra Bhasin, the BJP’s state unit vice-president, said. “It should have been better if he would have said ‘K’ for Corona and Congress. It would have been more apt with the kind of hindrances Congress is putting in the fight against corona. It’s an insult of Hindu dharma for which Congress should apologise,” Bhasin added. Dhasamana, however, refuted the allegations of the BJP.“I am a staunch devotee of Lord Krishna and have been organising Bhagwad Gita Katha in Dehradun for the last 25 years. I don’t want a certificate from the BJP on religion as I know how to honour and follow it,” he said.Uttarakhand has reported 2,831 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 39 patients have succumbed so far in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-congress-leader-says-corona-sent-by-lord-krishna-bjp-demands-apology-over-comparison/story-JWV7QCdJrGve5Q74b4uTlN.html
01-07-2020||India||Chhattisgarh forest department to launch campaign for using bio-fertilizers after deaths of 6 elephants||After the death of six elephants in northern part of Chhattisgarh in last one month due to toxicity and electrocution, the state forest department decided to launch an awareness campaign in northern plains to encourage the usage of bio-insecticides and bio-fertilizers.The forest department issued orders to divisional forest officer (DFO) of Dharamjaigarh in Raigarh district, where maximum elephants were electrocuted in last 10 years, to take necessary steps to contain such incidents.This month, total six elephants died in Chhattisgarh in four districts of the state. Carcasses of two tuskers were recovered from the Pratappur forest range in Surajpur district and another elephant was found dead in neighbouring Balrampur district.Later, two elephants were electrocuted in Dharamjaigarh under Raigarh district and a calf died after getting stuck in a marshland in Dhamtari district.“We are doing a research in Balrampur and Surajpur districts where three elephants died due to toxicity and we will start a campaign to encourage farmers of the that area for usage of bio-fertilizers and bio-insecticide, which is less harmful, if consumed by elephants. As per the crop pattern, most of farmers are engaged in sugarcane production hence the awareness could be easily done. Secondly, if farmers in some of these areas, are using chemical fertilizers/insecticides, we will ensure that it should be stored in such a way that whenever elephant raids the house, it should be beyond the reach of animal - storing it some higher place of the house or by digging the fertilizer in the ground,” said Arun Kumar Pandey, additional principal chief conservator of forest, while talking to HT.It is worth mentioning that a team of Project Elephant visited the state after the death of six elephants and also made similar recommendations to check such fatalities, officials informed.“Dr Selvan, a scientist of Ministry of Environment and Forest and Dr Prajana Panda , national coordination of Project Elephant , who came here after the deaths and enquired about each and every death, also believed that these deaths are accidental deaths not wilfully done. They have made similar recommendations to us, on which we are working,” said PCCF adding the department is also talking to Agriculture department for availability of bio-fertilizers.The officer further said that all the three deaths which took place due to toxicity were due to consumption something which was toxic and the department is investigating about it.However, wildlife activists believe that it is not easy for the forest department to make the farmers switch from chemical to bio-fertilizers.“Is there any market of bio-fertilizers from where the farmers of these areas can get it ? Is it easy for farmers to switch from chemical to bio-fertilizers? The forest department should made this clear since the awareness drive is going on in these areas for last few years,” asked Meetu Gupta, member of the State Wildlife Board and wildlife activist.The forest department has also written to the divisional forest about cases of elephant electrocution in that area.“About 40 per cent of the total electrocution deaths of the elephants took place in Dharmjaigarh forest division hence an order has been issued to the forest officers of the region to take measures in this regard,” said a senior forest officer.The order states that the forest department should ensure that 11 KV electric line, which has caused deaths of the elephants should be above 7.5 metres above the ground-level and insulated electric wires should be used in these areas.“The department has also directed the forest officers to coordinate with Chhattisgarh State Power Corporation and find out each and every illegal connection or live wire in these areas,” said senior official said.As per the Chhattisgarh forest department in the last 10 years, the state has recorded an increase in the population of wildlife, including elephants whose number rose from 225 to 290 during the period.In view of this, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel recently issued necessary guidelines for the monitoring of wild animals in the state forests and improving measures for their conservation.Notably, North Chhattisgarh is home to around 240 wild elephants, which roam in plains of the state. Several reports of human-elephant conflicts surfaced in last few years in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-forest-department-to-launch-campaign-for-using-bio-fertilizers-after-deaths-of-6-elephants/story-9R2gMfBkkt3LlMCwNpHq0O.html

As her condition deteriorated on Sunday, their neighbours called on 108 for an ambulance but there was no response from the other side. “It was when we decided to take her to the district hospital on a handcart. At the district hospital, the doctors declared her brought dead. When we couldn’t get ambulance we approached the municipal corporation office again for help but an employee said since it was Sunday no ambulance or other assistance could be provided to us,” Ramavtar Kol of Kotaha locality in Sidhi city said.“We didn’t have money for cremation. Hence, we took the body on the same handcart and floated it in the Son River,” he added.“We didn’t shoot any video of our act. It was done by some passers-by. However, on Monday, some officers came to my residence and gave financial assistance of Rs 5,000,” Mahesh Col, the woman’s husband, said. DP Barman, Sidhi’s additional district magistrate, said the “unfortunate incident” was true. “The family members didn’t have money to cremate the body and they were not aware of any government scheme too. Now, we have provided financial aid to the family. We are looking into the incident to see if there was any fault on the part of any official or employee,” Burman said.Chief municipal officer Amar Singh said they were not at fault.“Though it was Sunday, the municipal corporation officers and employees were taking rounds of the city. No one approached any municipal officer or employee. There is a possibility that they might have talked to some outsider outside the office and returned,” Singh said.Kamal Nath, the president of Congress’ Madhya Pradesh unit, launched an attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in general and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in particular.“Shivraj ji, when you were in Opposition you talked a lot about your government’s financial assistance to the poor for cremation but the reality is there for all to see. Where is your last rites scheme? A tribal family in Sidhi district had to float the dead body of its member in a river as it was neither given any financial assistance nor an ambulance,” Kamal Nath tweeted in Hindi.On its part, the BJP said the Congress was speaking without verifying the facts.“It’s unfortunate that the state Congress president indulged in politics even on such a sensitive issue without trying to know the facts. The fact is the district administration has made it clear that no one approached it for any help and when the administration came to know about the incident financial assistance was immediately provided to the family,” Dr Hitesh Bajpai, a state BJP leader, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribal-woman-s-body-dumped-in-mp-river-as-family-had-no-money-for-cremation/story-NakOCeCKE94OVnRZ42QjqN.html

The CM said the Changrabandha checkpoint on the Bangladesh-India border in Coochbehar district will be opened from Wednesday for normal business. “The Changrabandha land border is closed for a long time. Bangladesh is also requesting us (to reopen it) because several goods are taken through this border. So, we have decided to open it from tomorrow. We have also taken the locals into confidence,” she said. Later in an order, the state government stated that the lockdown measures in containment zones, known as affected areas in West Bengal, stand extended till July 31.

01-07-2020||India||Army moves 3 divisions, tanks to Ladakh sector||The Indian Army has moved three divisions, several squadrons of frontline tanks, additional artillery pieces and fully-ready mechanised infantry squads to the Ladakh sector, as part of its efforts to strengthen its deployments in response to fortified Chinese military presence in the region, four people familiar with developments said on Tuesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.The three army divisions sent to build the necessary military strength to deter possible aggressive moves by the Chinese forces deployed across the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) account for up to 30,000 well-trained soldiers, as high-altitude deployments are being bolstered with sharp focus on contingency planning, said the first person cited above.A large number of the troop reinforcements sent to Ladakh have been drawn from the army’s reserve formations, based in a mountainous region in north India and another state in the Hindi-speaking belt. These reserve troops have operated in the sector as part of their regular training, said the person quoted above. Soldiers may also have been pulled out from peace stations for the Ladakh role, he added.Hindustan Times is not revealing the location of the bases from where troops, weapons and equipment have been deployed to Ladakh because of security considerations.While the reserve formations have moved with their own integral artillery elements, the tanks and the infantry combat vehicles have been marshalled from multiple bases across the western sector for force augmentation in Ladakh, a second person said.Additional forces have been sent to Ladakh by road and air, he said. The Indian Air Force’s heavy-lift aircraft have also flown soldiers, tanks and other equipment from Chandigarh to Leh, as reported by HT on Tuesday.“Military equipment, including tanks, has been moved to Ladakh from areas in the western sector where very favourable combat ratios already exist to deal with Pakistan,” said the third person cited above. He added diverting this equipment from these areas would not make any “elemental difference” to the situation on the western front. Both India and China have significantly reinforced their deployments with thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems in the region, as attempts to reduce tensions have not yielded a breakthrough.If the stalemate persists, Indian and Chinese forces are likely to hold positions in the area till at least September, with the onset of winter making it virtually impossible for the two sides to stay forward deployed, said the fourth person cited above. “The deployment of additional forces became mandatory keeping in mind that the Chinese buildup is expected to last for the next three months,” he said.Experts believe that deploying essential and additional elements of combat power to the Ladakh sector is necessary as the continuing Chinese buildup calls into question the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) intent to restore status quo ante (early April) in strategic areas.“The Chinese military has flexed its muscle with its buildup at the point of impact, as also in depth areas on their side of the LAC. Due to China’s belligerence, it is axiomatic that we should have desired combat ratios to offset possible evil designs,” said Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd), a former Northern Army commander. He added that India’s military posture would enable it to talk to the Chinese from a position of strength.India has also deployed its air defence weapon systems to counter possible aerial threats from the PLA-Air Force in the Ladakh sector where tensions rose sharply after a brutal clash in Galwan Valley left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese troops dead on June 15. The IAF has raised its guard to deal with any military provocation by the Chinese forces and forward bases have been ordered to be on their highest state of alert, said the fourth person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-moves-3-divisions-tanks-to-ladakh-sector/story-rObj7wvAR6HtwbuJ5AdpXM.html
01-07-2020||India||Terrorists who killed boy, trooper shot dead in J&K||Two terrorists were killed in a gunbattle with security forces at Waghama in Jammu & Kashmir’s Anantnag district on Tuesday, four days after they fired at a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) patrol and left a trooper of the paramilitary force and an eight-year-old boy dead, a top police officer said. Inspector general (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said the two and their another accomplice, Zahid Daas, were involved in the killing of a policeman last year as well as the CRPF trooper and the boy. He appreciated the forces for exercising the utmost restraint and ensuring a clean operation with no collateral damage in Waghama.Police released Daas’s picture and said he was involved in the attack on the CRPF patrol on Friday.The gunbattle in Waghama was triggered after the two terrorists fired at security forces during a cordon-and-search operation that was launched following specific information about the terrorist presence in the village. “During the search operation, as the presence of terrorists got ascertained, they were given the opportunity to surrender. However they fired indiscriminately upon the joint search party, which was retaliated leading to an encounter,” said a police statement. The identities of the two slain terrorists were not immediately ascertained.The police statement said arms and ammunition were also recovered from gunbattle site. It added the bodies of the two were sent to Handwara, around 100 km away, for their burial after medico-legal formalities. “In case any family claims the killed terrorists to be their kith or kin, they can come forward for their identification and participation in last rites at Handwara,” the statement said.Slain terrorists have been buried away from their native places in Baramulla, Handwara, and Ganderbal due to Covid-19 restrictions over the last two months, which have coincided with an escalation of violence in the region.Security forces have stepped up operations and killed 128 terrorists this year mostly in South Kashmir. As many as 48 terrorists have been killed in June, the highest in a month since 39 were gunned down in November 2018. The Jammu & Kashmir police on Monday declared the Union territory’s Doda district “totally militancy free”, saying the region’s last surviving Hizbul Mujahideen commander was killed in a counter-insurgency operation along with two Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists in adjoining Kashmir Valley’s Anantnag district.Dilbag Singh, the Jammu & Kashmir police chief, said anti-terror operations were going at full throttle with the killing of 128 terrorists this year so far even as terrorist launchpads remained active and Pakistan was trying to push more militants into the region. “Our security forces have foiled their sinister designs and will keep doing so,” he said during a visit to Poonch along the LoC.He said of the 128, 70 belonged to Hizbul Mujahideen, 20 each to Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the remaining to other outfits. Singh called South Kashmir the epicentre of terrorism and added security forces have been successful in eliminating militants in large numbers there. He added only 24 militants remain active in the region. “The positive development is that naive and gullible youth, who used to be brainwashed by the terrorists and their OGWs [overground workers] are not taking up arms. Their number has come down drastically. They have been motivated by their families and security forces to lead a normal and productive life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorists-who-killed-boy-trooper-shot-dead-in-j-k/story-RJp0DzdmNsmUy1fYOhu1wO.html
01-07-2020||India||Govt depts, CMs exit apps after ban||When the ministry of electronics and information technology was sending out its public order banning 59, mostly Chinese, mobile applications, two government departments were tracking the note very carefully. One was the Press Information Bureau of India (and not because it had to disseminate the order) and the other was MyGov.in, the platform to crowdsource ideas about governance. As soon as the government announced that these apps pose a “threat to sovereignty and integrity of India,” both PIB and MyGov.in deleted their accounts on Tik-Tok and its regional version, Helo.Confirming this to HT, MyGov.in’s CEO Abhishek Singh said the action was in keeping with government policies. “We joined Tik-Tok and Helo in April because we are there on all platforms,’’ he said. “If the platform violates the law, then we will leave it. We have to abide by our laws.’’ In just the two months that PIB and MyGov. in were on Tiktok, they garnered more than a million followers and that may be a reason why many top politicians may miss the apps, which send out short videos and messages.A PIB spokesperson told HT: “We were not on Tik-Tok for the love of China, but because it has followers. We wanted to spread the word and it was very effective.’’It’s not just these central government departments. In the last few months, Tik-Tok and Helo have been hosting a formidable bunch of top leaders. From Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan to Punjab’s Amarinder Singh and Andhra Pradesh’s YS Jagan Mohan Reddy , they had all signed up for Tik-Tok and Helo accounts because of the sheer numbers that they saw as audiences.Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao’s team said that they got the idea to join Tik-Tok after seeing the Central government using it for its coronavirus disease messaging. “We were just toying with the idea of starting a Tik-Tok account for the CM when this order came,’’ saod Dileel Konathan, who handles social media for the Telangana CM. “At the moment, we just ran our Corona campaign on Tik-Tok.’’ According to Konathan, the app is appealing because it has a high captive audience, one which is much larger than that offered by Twitter and FaceBook. “The demographic is completely different. You get followers in rural areas who may be semi-literate and they are all consuming your content.’’In other words, they offer a means of communicating with grassroots citizens. Ankit Lal, who handles social media for Delhi chief minister Kejriwal, explained that they came to these apps very recently, just before February’s elections. At that time, Kejriwal gathered 912,000 followers on Helo and 179,000 followers on Tik-Tok. “The kind of followers you get here are 180 degrees different from any other platform. Also, while FaceBook and others have ad-based targeting, here you don’t have to do that,’’ he said. The Kerala government was exploiting that feature for not just the CM’s messages but also to run separate accounts for its police and tourism department as well. In fact, the police had almost a million followers on Tik-Tok. “We used to use sharechat for our Malayalee videos but we only got 51,000 followers in that. Comparatively, the Tik-Tok and Helo accounts get several times more. They really cater to the regional, tier two audience and every time we put out our videos, it engaged many more people,’’ said Appu Lenin, who handles Vijayan’s social media accounts. “It takes such little time for a new app to take over, that it doesn’t really matter,’’ said Lenin suggesting that TikTok may have been their engine to reach rural audiences for some time now, but they are sure that another app promising the same features is sure to come along soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-depts-cms-exit-apps-after-ban/story-lRiHO7d8bpvvTxfreifMaI.html

Access to Indian newspapers and media websites through VPN was stopped using a “technologically advanced firewall”, the statement added.Gupta “strongly urged” the Indian government to ban all access to Chinese media in India and call off collaborations made by China in Indian media companies forthwith.The statement came amid a stand-off between India and China and escalating tensions between the two neighb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ins-criticises-china-restrictions-on-indian-media/story-xhnH4mYmPsXyWelnTIKEZI.html
01-07-2020||India||TikTok offline after India app ban, says will follow directive||TikTok stopped working in India on Tuesday as the company appeared to comply with a ban announced a day before by the Union government, which said that the widely used video sharing tool and 58 other mostly Chinese apps were a threat to national security.Those who had the application were no longer able to use it, and it no longer came up in searches on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, while the company disabled the webpage. Some of the other prominent applications – such as WeChat and CamScanner – continued to work and were available on the application stores of both platforms till Tuesday night.“TikTok has been removed from both the app stores,” said an official from the ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY), asking not to be named. “The cyber cell is working to ensure the other apps are taken down as well.” A MEITY spokesperson confirmed that the TikTok ban had come into force. TikTok, according to Bloomberg data, had nearly 200 million users in India as of January this year and had become one of the most prominent social media tools used by young Indians. In a statement issued by TikTok on Twitter on Tuesday, the company’s India head, Nikhil Gandhi, said: “The Government of India has issued an interim order for the blocking of 59 apps, including TikTok, and we are in the process of complying with it. We have been invited to meet with concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications.”HT was not able to independently verify if there was a meeting planned since MEITY officials did not respond to requests for a comment on this.In addition to the app not being visible on the app stores, TikTok also appeared to disable access to Indians on its website, redirecting instead to a “notfound” page. The Chinese government said on Tuesday it was “strongly concerned” about New Delhi’s decision to ban the apps, adding that the move was against “India’s interests”. The ban follows what has been a period of hostility not seen for decades between the two neighbours over the disputed territory in Ladakh. “China is strongly concerned about the relevant notice issued by the Indian side. We are checking on and verifying the situation,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday.Zhao reminded New Delhi of its responsibilities towards foreign companies. “The Indian government has the responsibility to uphold the legitimate and legal rights of the international investors, including the Chinese ones,” he said.According to experts, the ban seems to have been enforced by a voluntary disabling of services in India by TikTok for the time being. “It does not work because the developers rerouted requests from Indian IP addresses to the error page. If it was blocked by ISPs, there would be a different message displayed,” explained Anand V, an independent cybersecurity researcher. The ban on the 59 applications was under discussion since early June but picked up pace following the fatal confrontation between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley in the middle of the month. MEITY cited complaints from agencies as well members of public that these applications were relaying data of Indian users to outside of the country. “The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures,” the ministry said in a statement on Monday while announcing the move. Experts said there must be more clarity on what legal provisions were used to put the ban in place, citing what they said were two particular ways this could be done and one did not require an inter-ministerial review committee: the emergency order route. “If tech platforms operating in India received an order directing blocking of access, they would normally do so. They should have asked under what process and legal authority that was being done, and why an emergency order was being issued -- and the channels to be able to push back in such review,” said Raman Jit Singh Chima, lawyer and Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, an international digital rights group.

In these difficult circumstances, I wish to express my steadfast and friendly support, along with that of the French armed forces,” Parly wrote in the letter.Parly also recalled that India is France’s strategic partner in the region and reiterated France’s “deep solidarity” in the letter.She also expressed her readiness to meet Singh in India, at his invitation, to follow up on their ongoing discussions, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Parly also conveyed her “heartfelt condolences to the entire Indian armed forces as well as to the grieving families” of the 20 soldiers.Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a months-old tense standoff along the LAC, especially in Ladakh sector, where both sides have deployed thousands of additional troops.France, a key supplier of frontline combat jets to the Indian Air Force (IAF) for decades, has stepped up its defence engagements with India in recent years and both sides are working on closer naval cooperation, including joint exercises and patrols, in the Indian Ocean region.Paris has also acted on a special request from New Delhi to speed up deliveries of 36 Rafale combat jets ordered by India in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in 2016, with six of the planes expected to land at the airbase in Ambala on July 27.France is reworking the calendar for supplying the Rafales to India at a faster pace, people familiar with developments said on Monday. IAF ordered the jets as an emergency purchase to arrest a worrying slide in its combat capabilities.Earlier, the first batch of Rafales to be delivered to India in 2020 was expected to comprise four jets. France has stepped up efforts to meet IAF’s immediate requirements.The people said around 10 Rafale jets are ready at manufacturer Dassault Aviation’s Merignac facility and six of them will be flown by IAF pilots to India via Abu Dhabi in late July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-defence-minister-writes-to-rajnath-conveys-steadfast-support/story-rBKVz2wKsVtPkOvJdYbCFI.html
01-07-2020||India||In EC’s plan, toothpicks to use EVMs||PATNA: With an eye on the safety of voters during the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the Election Commission (EC) is working on proposals to provide gloves and small sticks of the size of toothpicks to voters to press the button on electronic voting machines (EVMs) for contactless voting, officials at the state’s Chief Electoral Office said.Another proposal under consideration for maintaining safety at the polling stations is the use of disposable syringes to mark the fingers of voters with indelible ink to identify those who have already voted, the officials said. A move to install glass shields at the table of polling officers is being contemplated so that voters, when asked to identify themselves by taking off their face masks, do not come in contact with the staff.Bihar assembly polls are scheduled to be held in October-November in the first full-fledged state elections in the aftermath of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The elections are looming as a major test of the poll watchdog’s ability to ensure the safety of voters and polling staff from infection by the coronavirus disease. The state election office officials said the idea of applying indelible ink through disposable syringes was being considered as a safe option; the syringes can be disposed of after one use. Glass shields to keep polling officers apart from voters is required to minimise the chances of anyone catching the infection.“Even gloves and bamboo-made small sticks are being advocated for use of EVMs to press the buttons and signing the voter register as it will help in contactless voting. Sanitising the EVMs after every vote is not possible. We are not using any plastic-made items because there is scope of infection in it. Bamboo-made sticks are environment-friendly and disposable also,” said a senior Bihar EC officer, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised o speak on record to the media.State election officials said the proposals have been sent by the Chief Electoral Officer, Bihar, H R Srinivasa, to the Election Commission for approval. “We have sent a few proposals for safety of voters at the booths. We are working on it. Our objective is that voters do not come much in contact with any physical substance and there is more contactless method of casting votes during the polls,” said Srinivasa.To be sure, the implementation of the new innovative measures at the polling booths in times of Covid-19, when economic activity hs declined, would not be easy. It would mean procuring millions of gloves and bamboo sticks as well as disposal syringes. The state has a total electorate of 71.8 million voters; the proposal is 106,000 polling booths with the addition of 33,797 auxillary booths to cap the number of voters in each booth to 700 for maintaining social distancing norms.The state EC officials said the process had started for procuring these materials on a priority basis. “We have sought khadi gloves from the Bihar State Khadi board so that it can generate rural employment. Other materials would be purchased locally and district election officers will be authorised to buy them,” said another EC officer, who is privy to the discussion, requesting anonymity.State political parties are divided on the measured proposed by the electoral office. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United) said they would support any measure suggested by the EC to ensure the safety of voters. The opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal said any such moves would infringe on the rights of voters and defeat the purpose of elections.“If EC takes any steps for safety of voters in view of Covid, we will support {the steps}. But our thinking is that all steps of safety to be taken by the poll panel should be widely publicised as our larger objective is that there should be 100 % voting and all voters should exercise their franchise freely,” said Nikhil Anand, state spokesperson of the BJP. JD(U) state spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan said the party would support steps that the poll panel takes for the safety of voters . “We are in favour of safety measures for voters,” he said.RJD’s senior leader and state spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav criticised the proposals. “ In the name of Covid, there is an attempt being made to manipulate the polls. We will oppose any such moves of EC to provide gloves or sticks for use of the EVMs. We want the EC to conduct polls as they did in past. Even in South Korea, elections were held in Covid pandemic by using ballot papers,” he said.ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-ec-s-plan-toothpicks-to-use-evms/story-ZeBbj7GZ4o5QkjE3oGg5cN.html
01-07-2020||India||Centre issues fresh guidelines for blood transfusion services||Convalescent plasma therapy to treat the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) received boost on Tuesday when the Union health ministry revised blood transfusion guidelines to include the collection of convalescent plasma under the clinical trials protocol from people who have recovered from infection by the Sars-CoV-2 virus.“Systems should be in place to enable re-entry of cured Covid-19 patients as donors for convalescent plasma for treatment of Covid-19 patients. The treatment of Covid-19 patients using plasma therapy is under clinical trial and currently no evidence of the efficacy of the convalescent plasma as a treatment modality for Sars-Cov-2 is established… the use of convalescent plasma for routine treatment of Covid-19 patients is not recommended at present…,” say the revised health ministry guidelines.The Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) is working to create a database of potential convalescent plasma donors for hospitals treating Covid-19 patients.“We are creating a list of eligible convalescent plasma donors that we pass on to hospitals. You have to extensively counsel these people as these were sick patients who are sometimes not very comfortable with the idea of going back to a hospital even if it is to donate plasma. We find not many recovered patients approaching us directly, so we are dependent on hospitals to provide us the list as we don’t have a hospital of our own,” said Dr Vanshree Singh, director (blood bank), IRCS.The revised guidelines do not recommend testing of donated blood and blood components for Covid-19 or going in for more advanced pathogen reduction techniques, citing reasons such as financial impracticality and lack of enough evidence to support transmission of the virus though blood transfusion. “Testing of the blood supply for Covid-19 is not recommended in light of the risk of transfusion transmission being theoretical or lack of demonstrated infectivity of the Covid-19 virus in blood collected from asymptomatic persons. Routine practices of infectious disease testing for transfusion transmissible infections should not be changed,” the guidelines said.“Pathogen Reduction Technologies (PRT) require significant logistical and financial investment. PRT for whole blood is less widely available and studies of inactivation of coronavirus in whole blood are lacking. Introduction of PRT for the COvid-19 virus would not be cost-effective or proportionate and is not recommended,” the guidelines added.The document has cited studies that say respiratory viruses are not known to transmit through blood transfusion.“No cases of transfusion-transmission were ever reported for the other two corona viruses that emerged during the past two decades (SARS and MERS-CoV). Virus detection in blood has only happened in symptomatic patients with Covid-19 to date. American Association of Blood Blanks, USFDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US) are not recommending any additional action by blood collection establishments at this time because there are no data or precedent suggesting risk of transfusion-transmission for Covid-19… According to the USFDA, there have been no reported or suspected cases of transfusion-transmitted Covid-19,” experts said in the guideline document. Having said that, the government has asked blood banks to screen donors thoroughly for Covid-related symptoms, and discard or recall the donated blood if there was even slightest suspicion of Covid-19. The donors will have to wait for at least 28 days before they will again be eligible for donation. People who cannot donate blood are laboratory confirmed cases of Covid-19, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms; contacts of a lab positive case or those with travel history to a country where community transmission of the disease has been established. “The blood samples collected from a donor, who turns out to be Covid positive, or is unconfirmed case or even a close contact of a laboratory positive case within 28 days of donation, will be discarded. All known positive cases cannot donate for 28 days after the end of 7 day home isolation post discharge or when symptoms subside, or travel to a Covid-19 affected country,” the guidelines say.Dr RN Makroo, president, Indian Society of Transfusion Medicine, said thorough screening is good enough. “For regular donors thorough screening of history of the person is good enough. You cannot conduct blood test or PRT which is not just super expensive but also does not happen anywhere in India. We must strengthen screening of our regular donors, that’s the solution. The new guidelines are pretty comprehensive and should be followed,” said Dr Makroo. “The government guidelines say 28 days of deferral, but we go by six weeks to be cautious,” said Dr Singh from IRCS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-issues-fresh-guidelines-for-blood-transfusion-services/story-Z2xpZpBsnluzREqR6pwoJN.html
01-07-2020||India||Self-reliance, jobs focus of PM meet||New Delhi: Focus on the real estate sector to create jobs, strengthen electronics manufacturing to cut dependence on other countries, particularly China, and offer rebates to the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) were some of the suggestions made at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting last week with his ministers, said people aware of the matter. The meeting was called to address the twin concerns of job creation and strengthening of the economy.Modi was suggested to focus on strengthening the government’s ambitious project, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, which proposes housing for all urban poor and has a target of building 20 million affordable houses by March 2022.“As part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sithraraman, Rs 3 lakh crore collateral-free loans for MSMEs were announced. However, there is a need to address concerns that both the banks and the borrowers have. A minister made a suggestion that there is a need to build confidence for both sides so that banks can give loans without security and the MSMEs are encouraged to avail of the lower rate of interests,” said one of the persons on condition of anonymity.Modi announced the ₹20 lakh crore Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Movement) in May that combined policy reforms with fiscal and monetary measures.Another minister suggested India should be positioned as a manufacturing hub of electronics and said Chinese smartphone makers control India’s over 70% market.“There was a discussion on how India can also look at starting production in areas where we traditionally depend on other countries like aircraft... Going forward there is going to be a great demand for more air travel and India could explore tie-ups with manufacturers to set up plants here,” said a second person on condition of anonymity.Specific jobs and skill training for migrant workers, who want to stay back in their native states after losing their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic, was also discussed.The issue of collaborating with countries keen to move businesses out of China was also part of the discussions. The second person cited above said a suggestion was made for India and Australia to join forces to become the leaders in steel production. “Currently iron ores go from India and Australia and China is the largest manufacturer,” the second person said on condition of anonymity.In his radio broadcast Mann KI Baat on Sunday, Modi reiterated the need for self-reliance and encouraging local production. He said being “vocal for local” is also a way to strengthen the country and to serve it. “A self-reliant India would be a tribute to our martyrs in the truest, deepest sense,” Modi said while referring to 20 soldiers killed in a clash with Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. The first person cited above said a similar meeting was held in January when Modi chaired a two-day review of the five-year vision documents of various ministries and departments. “The PM had referred to the growth rate [that had fallen to 4.5% in the September quarter] and urged ministers to come up with suggestions to revive the economy. Now with the coronavirus pandemic, the situation has worsened and the PM is keen that all ministers suggest turnaround models,” said the first person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/self-reliance-jobs-focus-of-pm-meet-headline/story-d2cbJUEZa4cQfvHnBiwFQI.html
01-07-2020||India||PM Modi reviews preparations for large-scale Covid-19 vaccination exercise||A day after India’s first Covid-19 vaccine candidate received the central drugs controller’s approval for human clinical trials, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday reviewed India’s preparations for vaccinating its vast population against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) once a vaccine becomes available.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageVaccination must be affordable and universal, Modi said. At a high-level meeting, he directed officials to start work on a detailed plan for carrying out such large exercise in the country of 1.3 billion people and review preparations in place for vaccination against the viral disease that has infected at least 10 million and killed 508,876 across the globe. In India, the disease has infected 566,840 people and caused 16,893 deaths.On Monday, Bharat Biotech said it had received the drug controller’s approval for carrying out human trials on a vaccine it developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. The trials are expected to begin in July, the company said.ICMR-NIV researchers managed to isolate and culture 11 strains from swab samples in early February from initial Covid-19 patients in Kerala that could be used to develop vaccines and aid research. Vaccination of India’s vast and diverse population will need to factor in issues including those related to management of medical supply chains, prioritisation of at-risk populations, coordination between different agencies involved in the process, as well as the role of private sector and civil society, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said.The government has allocated ₹100 crores from the PM-CARES (Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations) Fund to support the initiative to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). There are as many as 25 vaccine development initiatives underway in India, across academic institutions, industry, and start-ups, according to the department of biotechnology that is one of the agencies spearheading the research work on Covid-19 management.The PM focused on four guiding principles that will form the foundation of this national effort: such as vulnerable groups should be identified and prioritised for early vaccination; vaccination of anyone anywhere should take place without imposition of any domicile-related restrictions; must be affordable and universal; no person should be left behind; and the entire process from production to vaccination should be monitored and supported in real time with the use of technology.Vulnerable groups include doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, non-medical frontline Covid-19 warriors, and vulnerable people among the general population.Globally, there are 13 experimental vaccines in clinical trials and another 129 in the preclinical evaluation stage, according to the World Health Organisation’s draft landscape of Covid-19 vaccines.The PM directed officials to evaluate available technology options that can form the backbone of the national endeavour to vaccinate all the population in the most efficient and timely manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-reviews-preparations-for-large-scale-vaccination-exercise/story-3HG9scCzlTKHZDGtknR81O.html
01-07-2020||India||HT Salutes: Braving Covid-19 to help Kolkata’s sex workers||Days after the nationwide lockdown was announced, sex workers at Sonagachi, Asia’s biggest red-light area located in Kolkata, realised that the empty lanes in their neighbourhood meant no wages and spelt doom for those who were retired had physical disabilities.Around 8000 sex workers live and work in Sonagachi and the adjoining bylanes of Sethbagan and Rambagan in North Kolkata, and for the duration of the lockdown – which began on March 25 and continued till June 15 – their work, and ability to earn, came to a grinding halt.In another part of the 300-year-old city, Dipali Bhattacharya, a retired principal of the Government College of Art and Craft, her friend Aditi Roy Ghatak, a veteran journalist and activist, and other friends understood the implications of the lockdown on vulnerable groups who depend on a daily income to feed themselves and their families. What followed, they said, was an experience of a lifetime, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Watch | HT Salutes: Kolkata group who helped sex workers in Sonagacchi amid lockdownOver the past two months, the group has distributed food and essential items like sanitary napkins, not only among residents of Sonagachi and south Kolkata’s smaller red light pocket in Kalighat, but also slum dwellers, migrants returning to their home state of West Bengal, and villagers in the South and North 24 Parganas and Hooghly districts.“We were looking for a supplier of glove and masks for distributing these among people when we came across an inter-state helpline run by Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, former Kolkata mayor and member of the Rajya Rabha. We joined his team, and soon, along with some (other) members of the helpline, started our initiative ‘Ektu Din’ (Give A Little),” said Bhattacharya.The former mayor had formed a team of lawyers and social workers in April to run a helpline for migrant workers stranded in other states and enable their return home.The efforts by Give a Little mattered. On May 17, academicians from Yale School of Medicine and Harvard Medical School released their findings of a study called Modelling the Effect of Continued Closure of Red-Light Areas on COVID-19 Transmission in India, which stated that Indians were at a much lower risk of getting Covid-19 if red light areas are kept closed after the lockdown, until an effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is developed.According to the National Aids Control Organization (NACO), there are over 637,500 sex workers in India, and over 500,000 customers visit the red-light areas daily. The study showed that if the red-light areas started operating, the disease would spread extremely fast and infect a very high percentage of sex workers and customers.If red-light areas are kept closed following the lifting of lockdown, there can be a delay in the peak of Covid-19 cases by 36 days in Kolkata, the study estimated. While the science behind the study was sound, it did not account for the deep economic crisis that the sex workers had been plunged into. Though Kolkata has emerged from the lockdown, business continues to remain tepid at Sonagachi, residents said.“Our business is badly affected and it has become very difficult to feed our children and the elderly who cannot move out. Basic groceries and hygiene products are a great help,” one of the residents, who did not wish to be named, said.“A resident, Moti Sur, did a quick survey and identified 250 people in need of help. Sur knows the area and the residents for years. There was no opposition from the police. They usually never stop charity work,” said Indira Kanjilal, an editor of a business magazine, and member of the core team.Sur took into account how many children and old persons were there in each household, as well as kept track of those who were extremely poor or unwell.Around five volunteers visited Sonagachi six times, each time with 250 kits comprised five kilos of rice, two kilos of flour, one kilo of lentils, besides salt and oil. All the volunteers worse masks as they went into the lanes, and the women would come out and collect it from them to maintain effective physical distance. “Packing rice, dal, cooking oil and other items in every packet and distributing these among residents of Sonagachi was not easy. More than 10,000 women live there. It was beyond our means to help them all,” Kanjilal said.Then Cyclone Amphan hit the coast of West Bengal on May 20, leaving 98 dead and a million people displaced.“Friends and acquaintances started donating funds the moment we spread the word on social media. Our work increased manifold after Cyclone Amphan ravaged south Bengal districts. So far we have helped around 10,000 people,” Bhattacharya estimated.“Our supporters have funded us to help everybody; from villagers in the Sunderbans to rag-pickers at Dhapa dumping ground in Kolkata. Help has come from across the world,” said Roy Ghatak.Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you 15 stories of HT Salutes.

01-07-2020||India||Sonia pressured govt to decide on scheme: Cong||Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to extend the provision of free ration to 800 million citizens till November, the Congress claimed that this was due to pressure by party president Sonia Gandhi and critiqued the PM for not doing more to tackle distress and evading issues in his speech. Party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate claimed that the announcement came in response to Gandhi’s letter to Modi on June 22 in which she had requested him to provide free food grains to the poor for three more months from July in view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation across the country. “It is important to remember that this extension of the scheme was suggested multiple times by the Congress president in her letter to the Prime Minister,” Shrinate said, addressing a virtual news conference. In her letter to the Prime Minister on June 22, Gandhi had also said that millions of Indians are at risk of slipping into poverty due to the strict nationwide lockdown for the past three months. She had written, “The union government must consider extending the provision for free food grains for a further period of three months i.e. from July-September 2020. Several states have requested for the same.” The Congress also critiqued the PM’s speech for not addressing critical issues. “We had hoped that he would look at China in the eye and gather the courage for some tough talk. We had also hoped that he will talk about substantive measures against corona pandemic. We were hoping he was going to speak about the economic ruin and a blueprint to resolve it,” Shrinate said. The Congress, she said, had also hoped that the government would announce an income transfer of ₹7500 to the poor. “But clearly, it was all much ado about nothing. Despite all the euphoria and the massive build up, in his 17 minute long speech, he made, what at best is an administrative decision.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nalin Kohli said, “It’s a miracle they haven’t still taken credit for the Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads, ayurveda and possibly everything good under the sun. Perhaps the only thing they will not take credit for is for inventing zero because it could be a self goal, bringing focus on the top leadership.”BJP yet to respond on PM remaining silent on critical issues||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-pressured-govt-to-decide-on-scheme-cong/story-lEfIIQe02b0IjyGooVhR8O.html
01-07-2020||India||PM Modi extends free foodgrain scheme for poor till Nov-end||New Delhi: With India in the middle of a long battle again Covid-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday extended for five months the free distribution of foodgrain to economically weaker sections under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana — a scheme that proved to be beneficial for many during the pandemic with more than 73 lakh million tonne (MT) foodgrain reaching beneficiaries in April and May, according to government data.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe extension will continue to benefit 800 million people, or more than half of the country’s population, giving them 5kg wheat or rice per month. “Along with providing 5kg free rice or wheat to each member of a family, 1kg free whole chana will also be provided to each family per month,” said a government statement that followed the PM’s address to the nation.The Prime Minister said that the government will spend more than Rs 90,000 crore for the extension of the Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, pointing out that if the money spent in the previous three months (April-June) is added to this, the government’s total expenditure for the scheme will be about Rs 1.5 lakh crore.Two senior official familiar with the matter said that the broad contours of extending the scheme were discussed in a meeting chaired by the PM on Monday in which some key officials and minsters were present. The scheme is a part of Covid-specific welfare measures announced on March 26, days after sweeping federal lockdown was imposed to check the transmission of the virus. The government also announced components such as insurance for health workers, money for women through Jan Dhan accounts, ex-gratia payments to the marginalised, and the front-loading of the PM Kisan scheme for farmers.One of the officials cited above said that on condition of anonymity that, in the meeting between the Prime Minister and chief ministers earlier in June, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had appealed to the government to extend the Garib Kalyan package for at least three more months. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, too, made a similar demand on June 22.A senior official, who was part of the consultations for the scheme, said, “UP received 37 lakh (370,000) jobless migrant labourers and Bihar received 30 lakh (300,000) labourers. By covering all major festivals, this programme also sends a right signal.”According to government data available till June 20, 113 lakh MT of foodgrain has been lifted by 36 States and UTs for April, and 37.01 lakh MT has been distributed, covering 740 million beneficiaries; while in May, 36.42 lakh MT of foodgrains have been distributed, covering 728 million beneficiaries.Out of 5.8 lakh MT of pulses allocated under the scheme for three months, 5.68 lakh MT has been dispatched to various states/UTs. Of this, a total 3.35 lakh MT has been distributed to 163 million household beneficiaries out of 194 million such beneficiaries.Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh quickly pointed out how UPA-era schemes have made the welfare programme possible. “Two laws, the MGNREGA of 2005 & National Food Security Act of 2013, a legacy of the Congress-led UPA is now the nation’s lifeline,” he tweeted. Former rural development secretary, Jugal Kishore Mohapatra, said, “I think the assessment is that the pandemic’s effect will continue for a much longer time. in that case, the relief for poor people has to continue as they are vulnerable and depends on government aid. It’s a very good decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-extends-free-foodgrain-scheme-for-poor-till-nov-end/story-L3RBihnET38tM7p7jdEwCN.html
01-07-2020||India||UK MPs cite India-China clash, demand review of dependence||London: Terming China’s recent actions on India’s border an example of Chinese ‘aggressive expansionism’, British MPs on Monday night demanded a review of the UK’s dependence on China and highlighting the issue of human rights of Uyghur Muslims in international fora.China was the focus of an extended debate in the House of Commons based on a new report by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China that said there is new evidence suggesting that China is pursuing a birth-prevention programme targeted at Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region.Iain Duncan-Smith, former Conservative leader, who tabled the urgent question, said it cannot be “business as usual” with China given what he called “bullying behavior” in relation to India, Hong Kong and elsewhere.Citing figures from the report of falling birth rates among the minorities in Xinjiang, he said: “Of course the world wants to deal with China, but we cannot continue with business as usual while this sort of blatant activity continues”.He added: “(Given) the Chinese Government’s appalling record on human rights, their attack on freedoms in Hong Kong, their bullying behaviour in border disputes from the South China seas to India, their blatant breaching of the rules-based order governing the free market and their delayed declaration on Covid-19, will the Government now initiate an internal review of the UK’s dependence on China, with a view to significantly reducing that dependence, and call on the free world to come together to ensure that this growing threat from China is dealt with together before, as history teaches us, it is too late?”Nigel Adams, minister for Asia, responded that the Boris Johnson government had raised concerns with China at many levels. Britain was pressing China for access to Xinjiang; the last time British diplomats visited the region was in November 2019.He said: “Our approach to China remains clear-eyed and is rooted in our values and interests. It has always been the case that when we have concerns we raise them, and that where we need to intervene we will”. “We have consistently led international efforts to highlight concern about the worsening human rights situation in Xinjiang, and I assure my right hon. Friend that the United Kingdom will continue to do so”.Labour’s Stephen Kinnock wanted the Johnson government to recognise that the actions of the Chinese authorities in Xinjiang “reflect a wider pattern of behaviour of increasingly authoritarian policies at home and aggressive expansionism abroad, including in Hong Kong, Ladakh and the South China sea”.Calling upon China to allow the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights unfettered access to the region, Adams reiterated that London had “concerns about the detention and human rights abuses, with more than a million Uyghur Muslims and other minorities detained in political re-education camps”.The Johnson government has recently strongly criticised Beijing for enacting a security law applicable to the former British colony of Hong Kong that, according to the British perspective, goes against international law and agreements signed before the 1997 handover to China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-mps-cite-india-china-clash-demand-review-of-dependence/story-rpW7eBsweSA8OGx6Uz3r5M.html
01-07-2020||India||Centre used IT Act powers to block apps||The central government has banned 59 mainly Chinese mobile applications such as Tik-Tok and WeChat, invoking its powers under section 69A of the Information Technology Act of 2000 and provisions of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules of 2009 to block the apps.This step was taken, according to government statement, because the Centre had information that the app companies are engaged in activities prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.The ban has raised a slew of legal questions.Section 69A of the IT Act provides for the central government to issue directions for blocking public access to any information through any computer resource. This is the provision which has been relied on by government agencies in the past to take down online content.The section also sets out the grounds on which such a step can be taken - - in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the country, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any offence relating to above. The provision mandates that the reasons for blocking such content have to be recorded in writing.The procedure to be followed for blocking such objectionable content is laid down in the 2009 rules.There are broadly two procedures prescribed under the 2009 rules.One is when the intermediary or person who has hosted the information is given a hearing before the content is blocked (Rules 6, 7 and 8). The procedure is initiated by a complaint sent by any person to a nodal officer, who is an officer appointed by the ministry or department of the central government or the state government/ union territory.If after examining a complaint received by the nodal officer, the concerned ministry or department is satisfied that the grounds provided under section 69A exist, the complaint is sent to a government committee through a designated officer. The committee which comprises the designated officer and officials of the law ministry, then gives a hearing to the originator of the information or intermediary who has hosted the information before giving the green signal to block the objectionable content.The second method is to deal with emergency cases in which the designated officer can issue an interim order blocking the content without giving a hearing to the originator or intermediary (rule 9). The hearing will have to be held subsequently after which the interim order passed by the designated officer is confirmed or revoked.“But the fact of the matter is that, even in cases where hearing is given before imposing a ban, the hearing is most times afforded only to the intermediary and not to the originator or content creator. So we cannot be sure whether a ban is under rules 6, 7 and 8 or under rule 9”, said Gurshabad Grover, research manager at the Centre for Internet and Society..How will the blocking be implemented?“It will be implemented in two ways. One, the government will ask Apple and Google to take down these apps from their online stores. So nobody can download the apps from now on. Second, it can ask Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block traffic to the apps. This will ensure that continued use of app is not possible”, Grover said.Where is the order blocking the apps?One crucial aspect which has been pointed out is that no details have been made available in the public domain on the ban except what has been stated in the government statement. The order issued by the government blocking the apps is not available publicly.Rule 16 of the 2009 rules mandate that strict confidentiality has to be maintained when it comes to complaints received and action taken regarding such a ban. “This is the reason why none of these government orders are publicly available. This, in turn, is a roadblock to challenge such orders particularly when it affects the right of citizens other than those directly involved”, Grover said.Since the order is not available, the exact reason cannot also be deduced except that it is on the grounds of national security.Brijesh Singh, inspector general of police, Maharashtra, cited the potential security issues associated with such apps.“During hostilities and conflict between China and other countries, data from these apps will put the Chinese regime to a great geopolitical advantage. It can have a real-time picture of various strategic and tactical initiatives undertaken by the other country for its defence and combat preparedness. Apart from the data gathered in due course of business, deliberate vulnerabilities left in the software and hardware of ubiquitous cheap Chinese smartphones can lead to severe compromise of individuals as well as organisational information. Ill-protected and insecure coding of Chinese operating systems and apps can also allow for further targeted attacks by providing an initial foothold into the victims’ devices. A rapid and thorough assessment of Chinese apps from the point of view of national security as well as individual privacy is the urgent need of the hour”, Singh said.Some have pointed out that such a ban affects freedom of speech of people who use such apps to voice their opinion or showcase their creativity. Concerns have also been raised that it stifles access to information.“Many of these apps are used by people to express their opinions and showcase their talent. A ban on them could be construed as affecting their right under article 19”, Grover said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-used-it-act-powers-to-block-apps/story-Fa6OjBUf0edcparI3xtOOK.html

Mehtab was rushed to the nearby Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Mehtab had been in prison since 2014 for the alleged rape, an investigating officer. “In July 2018, the 21-year-old was arrested for a rickshaw driver’s murder. He learnt Mehtab was also in prison. They were lodged in different jails then. He had been planning the murder since then. About a week ago, he was transferred to jail 8/9 [same jail complex] from jail number 5. He requested prison authorities to transfer him to the same ward as Mehtab. He was shifted after a fight with his fellow inmates in the previous ward. The 21-year-old was transferred to Mehtab’s ward and he stabbed him on Monday morning,” the investigating officer, requesting anonymity.A Tihar spokesperson said nobody knew they were connected in a case involving a family member. “Normally we segregate prisoners from rival gangs. A magisterial inquiry is in process.” Investigators said they will look into the source of the metallic strip because such sharp items are banned inside the prison compound.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inmate-kills-another-for-revenge-in-tihar/story-j82sf4x63lsj512h2RXJVL.html
01-07-2020||India||Mass surveillance risk real with Chinese apps: Experts||Software and hardware developed in China often pose the threat of being used for mass surveillance, cybersecurity researchers have said, citing data breaches as well as laws that indicate the presence of mechanisms that can be activated to collect and sift through troves of user data. One of the strongest hints came last year when Dutch cybersecurity experts discovered billions of messages of users of Chinese apps WeChat and QQ, which were stored in a manner that suggested they were part of a massive dragnet that was used to censor content on these platforms. “Every Chinese tech company has to comply with the Chinese cybersecurity law which allows the Chinese government to have access to the data these companies collect – this is part of the nationwide mass surveillance systems that are in place in China,” said Victor Gevers, head of research at the Dutch Institute of Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD), who discovered such databases in 2019.WeChat and QQ are among 59 mostly Chinese applications banned by the Indian government on Monday after complaints that these were collecting and sending data of Indian users outside of the country, a move that comes in the middle of increased hostilities between the two countries over the disputed border at Ladakh.“These data collections are not limited to only Chinese users but all users of a certain platform and the data includes every interaction,” contended Gevers, adding that the leaks in 2019 showed the inner workings of these mass surveillance systems for the first time. Gevers’s concerns were echoed by Anand V, an independent security researcher based in Bengaluru. “Generally, developers from China are used to looking at techno-cultural approach that all data belongs to the government. They believe that it is okay to collect data in such manner because it comes from such a mindset,” he said, while also adding that any user of such apps was at risk. Among the database were roughly 3.7 billion messages sent on one particular day – March 18, 2019 – on WeChat that had a common theme: they all contained some specific keywords that were likely to have been identified as triggers for censorship or action by law enforcement. The words included “Jinping”, “power”, “CCP”, “Tiananmen”, and “Dalai”. “It became very clear that they actually gather everything at some point and sift through it to see if there has to be any interception or human interaction. They copy all the data or take a stream of realtime data and use keywords to trigger a censor system that automatically removes content from applications or flag them for a review,” Gevers said.Indications of unlawful collection of data emerged afresh last week with another prominent Chinese company, TikTok, which was found to have been logging what people were typing on their iPhones. According to Gevers, logging keystrokes – what people type – may now become one of the key ways such companies intercept the data they are legally required to maintain as more apps deploy end-to-end encryption.“What we saw with TikTok is likely to happen with other applications,” he warned. The concerns stretch over to hardware as well, he added. “We have observed that China is investing in mass surveillance using not only CCTVs but also other interfaces. The big worries are Huawei with its 5G networks,” he said.The entry of Huawei in 5Gmobile communication has triggered concerns in some Western nations, predominantly the United States, that it may allow for a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to internet as well as phone data. Gevers as well as Anand said the risk in particular was because of how free applications work: they collect massive amounts of user data to sustain the business by offering ads. “Chinese developers often use the principles of data collection and data mining commonly used for advertising and uses it to train its mass surveillance system,” said Gevers.“Most of these applications collect far more data than required and that has been a very long-going concern. It is a giant dragnet of data,” added Anand.The two experts also said China was not the first country to carry out such intercepts, pointing to the disclosures in the documents leaked by American intelligence contractor Edward Snowden that showed similar mass data dragnets being created by United States’ National Security Agency.In a statement issued by TikTok on Tuesday, its India head Nikhil Gandhi said TikTok “continues to comply with all data privacy and security requirements under Indian law and has not shared any information of our users in India with any foreign government, including the Chinese government”. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing said China encourages companies in its country to function under legal obligations. “I want to stress that the Chinese government always asks the Chinese businesses to abide by international rules, local laws and regulations in their business cooperation with foreign countries,” said spokesperson Zhao Lijian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mass-surveillance-threat-real-with-chinese-apps-says-cybersecurity-experts/story-HphmVO6k2D8kiRMqoD4NgI.html
01-07-2020||India||Case exposes deeper problems: Experts||The alleged custodial torture and killing of Jayaraj and Bennicks in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district exposed deeper problems with police violence that need strict judicial overview and long-term reform, former police chiefs and legal experts said on Tuesday. Prakash Singh, a former director-general of police who filed a landmark petition for police reforms in the Supreme Court in 2006, called for an attitudinal change and reinforcing the architecture of state and district level “accountability commissions” that were mandated by the top court 14 years ago. “The response of the local police was disappointing; they should have prosecuted these policemen without any wait. There needs to be a mindset change; top officers cannot think, we have to save our own,” said Singh. In the 2006 case, the top court issued instructions to the government to carry out reforms to insulate police from external pressure and to ensure accountability.Another former police chief, Vikram Singh, said the entire police station is liable to be suspended because of violation of arrest guidelines. He called for a fast-track court to prosecute the accused. “Everyone was a willing accomplice and the court’s order to depute revenue officials to the station is a clear loss of trust in the uniform,” he added. Legal experts pointed out that a number of measures were recommended in the past – by judicial and law commission reports – but none were implemented thoroughly. Murali Karnam, a professor at the NALSAR University of Law in Hyderabad, pointed out that in many countries, governments set up truth and accountability commissions to probe large-scale violence by the state machinery. “But in India, there is a belief that everything can be resolved through force. Serious changes are needed in police training and police need to earn the confidence of people,” he said. Shamim Modi, a professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, said in addition to the police, accountability should be sought of the judiciary too. “There are many guidelines issued by the Supreme Court but you need to have an environment where the guidelines can be implemented. We need to punish illegal detention… but the lower judiciary does not seem to take this seriously.”S Ramadoss, a professor of criminology at the University of Madras, said Tamil Nadu police have been accused of several custodial violence cases in the past – the state was second to Gujarat in the number of police custody deaths in 2018, according to the National Crime Records Bureau – but cautioned that it will be a mistake to see the entire police force as one. “There are some erring policemen. Human rights are a component of police training. What we need is deeper study and fear of punishment acting as a deterrent against custodial violence.” What is the way forward? Raja Bagga, a programme officer at the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, explained that constant judicial oversight on the actions of the police can bring some accountability to policing.“Magistrates are duty bound to examine whether all safeguards mandated by law have been scrupulously followed - be it  ascertaining the reasonability of the arrest, verifying the medical examination of the arrestee, inquiring about legal representation and intimation to the family about the arrest, among others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/case-exposes-deeper-problems-experts/story-4ks87Zfjd6WP5xtVwXKRkO.html
01-07-2020||India||No camera footage available in Tamil Nadu custodial deaths, eyewitness claims victims were beaten all night||Inside the Sathankulam police station in Thoothukudi district of Tamil Nadu, the judicial magistrate who was investigating if father and son P Jayaraj (59) and J Bennicks (31) were tortured to death while in custody on June 19, found himself to be a victim of intimidation of the policemen, his report to the court stated. The four-page inquiry report submitted by Kovilpatti judicial magistrate M S Barathidasan to the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday, and accessed by the Hindustan Times, cited the testimony of a policewoman, the only eyewitness on record, who confirmed that both Jayaraj and Bennicks were beaten through the night. It also revealed that camera footage from that night was unavailable on account of the CCTV camera inside the station being set on auto-delete.The report pointed to the police staff’s insubordination and non-cooperation from the start. Also read | The inhumanity, illegality of custodial tortureWhen Barathidasan along with court staff walked into the station on June 28 at 12.45pm, senior police officers C Prathapan and D Kumar were present and did not acknowledge him. “Kumar was standing and flexed his body to show his physical strength,” the report stated. The magistrate began his investigation at 1pm which went on for 15 hours. Deputy superintendent of police C Prathapan, additional deputy superintendent of police D Kumar and Sathankulam station constable Maharajan, are currently facing a contempt case based on Barathidasan’s complaint that they had actively obstructed him from conducting the investigation. The two senior police officials have been put on wait while constable has been suspended. Maharajan had also reportedly abused the judicial magistrate during the questioning.Three other policemen of the station -- one inspector and two sub inspectors – were suspended from duty last week.Also read | ‘Our George Floyds’: Outrage at custodial deaths in Tamil NaduThe magistrate recorded the testimony of a woman head constable -- the only witness on record -- who was present on the night of June 19. She has testified that the father and son were beaten through June 19 night and into the wee hours of the morning. “There were blood stains on the lathis and a table,” she said and asked the magistrate to obtain them immediately. The witness, who asked the magistrate leave to maintain her anonymity, was afraid of other police officers overhearing her. A group of policemen gathered under a tree near the station premises and heckled the court staff accompanying the magistrate. “She was panicking and we gave her time to calm down,” said the report. In the report, the magistrate said that the station’s officials deliberately delayed bringing documents and records. In order to collect camera footage from that night, Barathidasan was accompanied by an assistant systems officer from the district court, a local journalist and an expert to retrieve the footage. However, they found no CCTV recording from the station from June 19 when P Jayaraj and his son Bennicks were arrested. “Despite enough storage of 1TB (terabyte), we found that the system was programmed in such a manner that the footage was auto-erased daily,” the report stated. “Everything was erased.” The team installed a new 500 GB hard disk to confirm that the system worked. The report also spoke of the intimidatory attitude of the police in the station linked to the alleged custodial deaths of the father and son duo. Following the eyewitness’ testimony, the magistrate asked everyone to submit their lathis. “But the policemen pretended like they didn’t hear me,” the report stated. “Constable Maharajan first said that his lathi was in his native district. Later he said that it was in the police headquarters. Finally he said that he doesn’t have a lathi at all.” Eventually, the policemen handed in their lathis. There are no details of how many lathis were obtained and if they were bloodstained. Through the course of the inquiry, the atmosphere inside the station was unpleasant, condescending and fearful. “The situation was not safe for us,” said Barathidasan as the policemen kept taking videos of the process and threatened the staff. The magistrate had emailed the registrar of the court on June 29 to report that Maharajan had made an abusive remark in Tamil mocking the magistrate that he can’t do anything. “He said it behind my back but said it in a way I could hear him.” A policeman even ran away from the station, during the questioning, the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/victims-beaten-all-night-eyewitness/story-leSfmM3A2qJsa7q9cIVTdL.html
01-07-2020||India||Madras HC paves way for murder charge in custodial deaths||There is prima-facie grounds to book policemen at the Sathankulam police station for the murder of P Jayaraj and J Bennicks, the Madras high court observed on Tuesday after reading preliminary post-mortem reports and a report by the local judicial magistrate, which said the father-son duo was thrashed through the night with lathis. The court also handed over the probe to the state’s criminal investigation department (CB-CID), fearing that evidence may disappear by the time the Central Bureau of Investigation took over the case. On Monday, the state formally asked the CBI to take over the probe in the controversial case that sparked nationwide outrage. The court stated that “the ante-mortem injuries found on the bodies of the deceased” and the magistrate’s report are prima facie enough to alter the case to Section 302 IPC against the Sathankulam police who were actively involved in the investigation of the case.The court observed that there were chances of evidence tampering and appointed CB-CID deputy superintendent of police Anil Kumar to handle the case. It said that the Sathankulam police “are taking advantage of the fact that the investigation of the case is in limbo and are attempting to cause disappearance of evidence. In fact, they were emboldened enough to even intimidate the judicial officer to put spokes in the wheel of his enquiry.” It further suggested to the government to “revisit” the idea of entrusting the matter to the CBI, if it is satisfied that Kumar is proceeding on the right line.“If we do not act now, it will become too late...” the bench said. On Monday, the court had ordered the Thoothukudi collector to depute revenue officials to collect evidence at the police station. Kovilpatti judicial magistrate M S Barathidasan’s four-page report to the court cited testimony indicative of torture, an attempted cover-up and an attempt to obfuscate the investigation. The report quoted an eyewitness, a head constable of the police station who wished to remain anonymous, who testified that both the father and son were beaten through the night, and the lathis used by the policemen, as well as the tables on which they were placed, had blood on them. The court has directed the Thoothukudi district collector to ensure the safety of the eyewitness as well as her family members. It suggested she may be allowed to go on leave as “we fear that there will be attempt to intimidate her and make her resile from her version” given to the judicial magistrate.Bennicks, 31, and Jayaraj, 59, died on June 22 and June 23 after undergoing hours of alleged torture at the Sathankulam police station on June 19. The First Information Report (FIR) filed by the police booked them under several sections, including Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 353 (use of force to deter public servant from duty). However, eyewitness accounts refute the claims in the FIR, stating that the duo was tortured severely by the policemen while in custody. On June 24, the Madurai bench of Justices PM Prakash and B Pugalendhi took suo-motu cognisance of the case.On Monday, the court initiated a contempt case against three officials of the police station: additional deputy superintendent of police D Kumar, deputy superintendent of police C Prathapan and constable Maharajan.The Kovilpatti judicial magistrate accused the three of obstructing his investigation and making an abusive remark. On Tuesday, all three appeared before the bench with the constable saying he was “overstressed” and made the remark “by mistake”.Last week, the Thoothukudi police had suspended the station inspector Sridhar, and two sub-inspectors P Raghuganesh and Balakrishnan in connection to the deaths. On Tuesday, the Tamil Nadu government put Arun Balagopalan, the Thoothukudi superintendent of police, on compulsory wait [removed from active duty, but not suspended]. S Jeyakumar from Villupuram district will take over this position. Dr S Murugan, inspector general of police, economic offences wing in Chennai will be the new inspector general of police of south zone in Madurai as the incumbent retires Tuesday.

01-07-2020||India||May be able to push peak until there is vaccine: Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar||The challenge ahead for India will be to strike a balance between managing the industrial impact and heath impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), says Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, who was one of the senior epidemiologists at the forefront of not just India’s fight against Covid-19 but also other recent outbreaks such as Nipah, Zika, Japanese Encephalitis and the Acute Encephalitis Syndrome. Gangakhedkar, who retired as the Indian Council of Medical Research’s head of epidemiology and non-communicable diseases division on Tuesday, spoke to Hindustan Times on his last day at work. Edited excerpts:You have been with the Indian Council of Medical Research for long. How does it feel to leave at such a crucial time in India’s fight against Covid-19?It is difficult to contain emotions when it’s the last day of your work in an organisation that you have had been associated with for 36 years. I had joined ICMR in 1984. It is indeed a long association, and all through these years I have had the opportunity to be a part of some significant projects, especially in the field of HIV/AIDS that was my area of specialisation. Last few months have been a roller-coaster ride; we manage to achieve many milestones that may seem small to others but have been quite significant in our fight against Covid-19. It may be time for me to move on but the fight shall continue. There are several able people who will continue this fight, and even I am not entirely saying good bye and will be around as a part of CG Pandit National Chairs of ICMR. In fact, now I will have more time at hand to think a problem through.You moved to ICMR headquarters in Delhi as head of epidemiology and non-communicable diseases division in 2018; how was the experience?I can’t tell how the experience was because I never got time to think. I was constantly firefighting during past 2.5 years. When I joined in 2018, Nipah outbreak struck in Kerala; then in the same year a highly contagious and life-threatening viral infection, Canine Distemper Virus disease, outbreak happened in Gir, Gijarat; later in 2019, Zika virus disease outbreak was reported from Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh; then Nipah again struck in Kerala in 2019; after that Japanese Encephalitis and Acute Encephalitis Syndrome cases were reported among children in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur; and then Covid-19 happened. There was literally no time as one thing after another came up that required immediate attention. There was no time to think, forget relax.How many work hours have you been putting in daily in the last few months?Like I said, it is not just about past few months but past 2.5 years that I have been putting in long hours; and was working even after the office time was over. During the past few months it has been around 17-18 hours officially in a day. Since I lived alone in Delhi, I could work long hours.What has your experience been like while dealing with Covid-19 so far? What did we do right?What has worked in India’s fight against Covid-19 is that there has been involvement of all stakeholders together from the very beginning. We have seen in the past that multi-sectoral response in an outbreak situation usually comes so late that much of the damage is already done. But in this case, from the most senior officials to the junior- most government functionaries, everyone came together much early when there was lots that could be done to save the situation from going out of hand later and that even led to early lockdown. We bought so much time and prepared ourselves much better, and well in advance. The risk mitigation that we see now happened only because of this. From the first test on January 22 to nearly 9 million tests so far, we have moved in a very short period. One needs to be realistic in their expectations; what we have achieved is no mean feat. What challenges do you foresee?The biggest challenge will be to achieve the balance between industrial impact vs. health impact of Covid-19. You have to take certain steps for the economy but at the same time be very cautious to not let the disease spiral out of control. India is a diverse country so the much talked-about peak may not be attained in one go; different peaks will occur in different regions because of the diversity and density of the population. We may actually manage to push it till there is a vaccine or a drug that should help. We shouldn’t only look at numbers but we have to see how to reduce death-related risks that is more crucial in our Covid-19 fight. Community mobilization is also crucial, and if we managed to increase that, then it will go a long way in successful implementation of containment strategies. What threats do we face in future in terms of diseases?We need to be very vigilant as infectious diseases are not going to go anywhere. It is not correct to say that only non-communicable (lifestyle-related) diseases are a part of the future; that’s not true. Infectious diseases will emerge and will keep continuing. After the second outbreak of Nipah in 2019, I had started to work on a multiple country project that included countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Mayanmar, Thailand, Indonesia etc. to work out a strategy to contain infectious disease spread because infectious diseases don’t recognize boundaries. We have to protect not just ourselves but work in tandem with our neighbours to achieve larger protection. We need to work across borders because today mobility is high because of porous borders. We had started with dengue but then Covid happened and other projects had to be stalled. Hope it is taken up again in future.How did you unwind? And what are the plans post- retirement?There was hardly time but whatever time I got, I used to spend talking to my family. Thanks to technology, these days you can video chat with all your family members together. It was fun. As for post-retirement, I intend to settle in Pune. I would want to work for science literacy, by which I mean to make understand complex concepts of science in a simple manner. To me, it is vital to provide biology/science related literacy to our current generation. We do not have enough good science communicators. I plan to contribute in the field.

01-07-2020||India||US lawmakers back India, slam China for conflict||Yashwant Raj Bipartisan support for India has been growing among the US lawmakers amid its military standoff with China. Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican-dominated US Senate, kicked off a floor debate on next year’s defense budget on Monday by slamming China for “picking deadly fights” with India.McConnell appealed for the chamber’s bipartisan support to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, 2021, with remarks highlighting recent threats from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.“China has resumed its submarine intrusions into Japanese contiguous zones and picked deadly fights with India at high altitude,” McConnell said.In a floor speech on June 18, McConnell said the Chinese military appeared to have “instigated the worst violent clash between China and India since those nations went to war way back in 1962.” The clash left 20 Indian soldiers dead on June 15. Also on Monday, another Republican senator, Marco Rubio, supported India. “Today I spoke to @SandhuTaranjitS to express our solidarity with the people of #India as they firmly confront unwarranted & lawless armed aggression by the Communist Party of #China.” He was referring to a conversation with Taranjit S Sandhu, the Indian ambassador to the US.“India has made it clear, they will not be bullied by Beijing,” added Rubio, who is a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, a congressional panel with oversight of the State Department and the country’s foreign policy.The State Department has also held Chinese aggression responsible for the borer clashes. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has referred to the clashes several times. “The [Chinese] PLA [People’s Liberation Army] has escalated border tensions--we see it today in India, the world’s most popular, populous democracy,” he said on June 18. He also conveyed his condolences over the killing of the Indian soldiers.President Donald Trump offered to mediate in May, but the offer was turned down by both countries.In a TV interview on Sunday, Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, who is a close ally of Trump, denounced China’s aggression on the border with India to illustrate the growing threat Beijing poses to the US and its allies. “The Chinese Communist Party is certainly using the [Covid-19] pandemic to try to assert claims and take very aggressive action against almost all of its neighbours,” Cotton said. “High up in the Himalayas, China has essentially invaded India, an ally of ours. And they have killed 20 Indian soldiers.”Cotton referred to China’s violation of its international commitment regarding Hong Kong, aggression against Taiwan, Vietnam, Philippines, and Malaysia. “China is becoming more aggressive than ever. That is why it is so important that we support all of our allies and partners.”The Democratic-led House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel denounced the Chinese aggression early June before the deadly border clash. “I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control on the India-China border,” Engel said. “China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbours rather than resolve conflicts according to international law.”“I am concerned by continued Chinese aggression along its border with India,” Ami Bera, Indian-origin chair of the Asia subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-lawmakers-back-india-slam-china-for-conflict/story-1Er8U9zWgp2ni0yIw2b9ZK.html
01-07-2020||India||Govt plans scheme for cashless treatment of accident victims||The government plans to unveil a scheme for the cashless treatment of road accident victims and create a motor vehicle accident fund to pay for their medical care, including during the so-called golden hour.Golden hour refers to the first hour after trauma when, if proper and timely first aid is given, road accident victims’ chances of survival improve. The transport ministry has proposed a cap of Rs 2.5 lakh for the victim’s treatment per accident and designated the National Health Authority as the nodal agency to implement the scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. All road accident victims of Indian or foreign nationality will be considered eligible under the scheme. The Centre has sought feedback on the proposed scheme from all chief secretaries by July 10. “The central government shall make a scheme for the cashless treatment of victims of the accident during the golden hour and such scheme may contain provisions for creation of a fund for such treatment…the National Health Authority being the nodal agency for PMJAY having footfall all across the country with more than 21,000 hospitals on board has been entrusted to implement the scheme of cashless treatment of motor vehicle accident victims and also a nodal agency for PMJAY,” the transport ministry said in its letter addressed to the states, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times.More than 150,000 people die per year due to road accidents in India. On average, 1,200 road accidents happen in India every day, and around 400 people lose their lives on account of them, according to the transport ministry.“It is envisioned to have a scheme by the central government for providing access to cashless trauma care treatment for road accident victims at the nearest appropriate hospital in the country, in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling, and by drawing its power from the Motor Vehicle(Amendment) Act 2019 (MV Amendment Act). Such cashless treatment shall be extended to road accident victims including during golden hour, as defined by the MV Amendment Act,” the ministry’s proposal said.Setting up of a road accident fund was one of the key provisions of the MV Amentment Act passed by parliament in September last year.“NHA’s robust IT platforms which are used for implementation of Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY may be leveraged to provide cashless treatment for victims of road traffic accidents for treatment including during the golden hour. Hospitals have to ensure provision of stabilization in case they refer the patient to an empanelled PMJAY hospital where the complete treatment may be provided,” the proposal said.Trauma and healthcare services for road accident victim will be financed through an account which will be established under the transport ministry for the implementation of the scheme.“The funds will have contributions from insurance companies through General Insurance Council (GIC) for insured vehicles and for hit-and-run cases, MORTH {ministry of road transport and highways}will pay for the accident of uninsured vehicles. The account will be managed by NHA for ensuring timely payments to health care service providers as per the defined process flows and stipulated timelines,” the ministry proposed.The vehicle owners will be liable to pay the cost of treatment as part of the compensation in case the vehicle is not insured.“The cashless treatment of road accident victims scheme proposed by the Union government as per the recently enacted Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act, 2019, is a pathbreaking development towards saving lives of road crash victims. Once issued and implemented, it will ensure treatment of road crash victims without delay and also drastically reduce refusals faced by victims at certain hospitals,” said Piyush Tewari, founder and CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation, which works to save lives on the roads and improve road safety.This is a welcome step. We hope that hospital infrastructure across India will also be suitably upgraded to reduce patient referrals and transfers to distant facilities,” said Piyush Tewari, founder and CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-scheme-for-cashless-treatment-of-accident-victims/story-bTTxCYZVmAR4BrlrugCLhJ.html
01-07-2020||India||LAC standoff: India, China hold talks at Chushul amid tensions||New Delhi: Senior Indian and Chinese commanders on Tuesday held a long meeting at Chushul in Ladakh as part of ongoing efforts at the military level to cool heightened border tensions that have soured bilateral ties between the two neighbours, even as the military build-up on both sides of the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) continues unabated, people familiar with developments said on Tuesday.The talks between the army delegations, led by corps commander-ranked officers, began at around 11am and were still on till the time of filing of this report. There was no official word from the army on the talks. A breakthrough is unlikely at this stage but talks will go on, said one of the persons cited above on the condition of anonymity. This was the third meeting between the delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region; and the second after the brutal clash at Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead. The Galwan Valley clash, which took place while a previous disengagement process was on, has created trust deficit between the two sides, said a second person who asked not to be named. The two delegations last met on June 22 when they hammered out a consensus on disengaging from friction points along the disputed border during an 11-hour meeting. The “mutual consensus to disengage” from all “friction areas” reached eight days ago has neither enabled any disengagement on the ground nor led to the thinning of military build-up by rival forces in the region, the second person said.With the senior commanders making no progress in implementing a disengagement plan aimed at gradually reducing tensions, it is now becoming increasing evident that both armies are preparing for a long haul and they could remain deployed in the sector till the onset of winter (September) , said the third person cited above. The two senior officers first met on June 6 to ease growing tensions along the LAC. The limited military disengagement that began in some friction areas after the first meeting was derailed after the bloodshed in Galwan Valley. The Indian side on Tuesday reiterated its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from the friction points and sought the restoration of status quo ante (early April) in key areas including Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and the strategic Depsang plains, the third person said. Experts were not optimistic about any fresh hope form the military-level dialogue, saying diplomatic channels would have to be worked to reach a breakthrough. Chinese military buildup continues to be observed on the ground and captured by satellite imagery, he said. The latest meeting took place at Chushul on the Indian side of the LAC, while the previous two meetings were held at Moldo on the Chinese side. China has not halted — and instead ramped up — its military activity in Finger Area near Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and Depsang Plains since the senior officers last met on June 22.India is especially concerned about the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) holding positions in the Finger Area where it has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes, tented camps and observation posts in areas New Delhi considers its territory, HT reported on Tuesday..The situation is equally critical from the Indian standpoint in the Depsang sector as the PLA has mobilised troops, weapons and other military equipment in sensitive areas, with its forward presence disrupting the army’s patrolling patterns there. Both India and China have significantly reinforced their deployments with thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems in the region. The Chinese buildup in other areas including Galwan Valley and the Gogra Post-Hot Springs sector hasn’t thinned either. Satellite imagery dated June 22, released by US firm Maxar Technologies, showed not only was the PLA holding ground in Galwan Valley but has also shored up its military positions in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3rd-lt-gen-level-talks-held-at-chushul-amid-tensions/story-ObUxdDhH1ah3DYgrwIda9K.html
01-07-2020||India||India wary of China investing, trading through a third party||India suspects that China could be engaging in unfair trade practices by supplying goods and investments through a third party such as Hong Kong and Singapore, but may not bar legitimate Chinese trade and investments in India while scanning them from the perspective of national interest, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.Data suggests significant indirect inflow of Chinese goods and investments through locations with which India has free trade agreements (FTAs), preferential trade agreements (PTAs) or other bilateral commercial arrangements. This is not only illegal but also injuring domestic industry, the people said, requesting anonymity.The development comes a day after the Narendra Modi govenment announced  ban on 59 mostly Chinese mobile applications such s Tik-Tok, UC Browser and WeChat, citing concerns that these are “prejudicial to sovereignty of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”Sino-Indian tensions have shot up after a violent brawl between Chinese and Indian soldiers on June 15 along the Line of Actual Control in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in which 20 Indian army personnel were killed.Data shows that total foreign direct investment (FDI) from China is minuscule, but many Indian firms have received Chinese investments. Similarly, imports from China have registered a minor decline recently, but at the same time imports from Hong Kong and Singapore have surged. These figures show that something is amiss and needs to be probed, one of the people cited above, who works in an economic ministry, said.According to the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), while India’s trade deficit with China narrowed by $6.05 billion to $51.25 billion in 2019, the gap with Hong Kong widened sharply by $5.8 billion in 2019, nullifying almost all the gains. Similarly, India trade deficit with Singapore was $5.82 billion in the previous financial year, the person mentioned above said. “The principal imports from Hong Kong, which have shown a significant increase, are electrical and electronic products where imports jumped from $1.3 billion to $8.6 billion between 2017 and 2019,” FIEO director general and chief executive officer Ajay Sahai said.The increase in imports is definitely a setback to domestic industry, he said. “If the goods made in China are re-routed through Hong Kong and Singapore, showing such origin of products, customs can always ask importers to provide the proof of adhering to the Rules of Origin,” he said.He advised the government to be extra cautious in case of imports from Singapore because of the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) as well as India-ASEAN {Association of South-East Asin Nations} Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that increase the possibilities of re-routing of Chinese products to India to derive a preferential tariff advantage. “Any increase in imports has an adverse bearing on domestic industry and thus on job creation,” Sahai said .“Many times, a product originally belonging to China enters from Singapore, Vietnam or even Hong Kong and we might lose the revenue which could come as tax. In simple terms, if consumers will get cheaper imports, market share and profit margins of the domestic manufacturer will get hurt,” Trade Promotion Council of India (TPIC) chairman Mohit Singla said.A second person working in another economic ministry said, “Even the Chinese FDI inflow also appears skewed.” The latest official data shows foreign direct investment from China between April 2000 and March 2020 was $2.378.71 billion, which is 0.51% of the total FDI inflow into the country in the two decades.The second person quoted above said, “Apparently the FDI figures do not capture actual Chinese investments in India and possibly some investments could have flowed into the country undetected, routed through a third country. All such suspicious Chinese inflows need to be scanned properly.”Email queries sent to ministries of finance and commerce did not elicit any response.Even before the current standoff with China over border issue, India in April clubbed FDI proposals from China with those from other hostile countries such as Pakistan, making prior government approval mandatory for any investment in the country to prevent opportunistic takeovers of Indian firms during the Covid-19 pandemic.Burgeon Law, which styles itself as new-age boutique law firm that caters to start-ups and emerging companies, said start-ups will have to scout for other avenues of investment from newer geographies.“With recent events of Indo-Chinese face off and developments of scrutinizing the FDI from nations that share a land border with India, the situation depicts a tightness between the neighbouring countries,” said Roma Priya, founder of the legal firm. “The immediate impact of this can be observed in business relations as well, with contractions, trade deficit and fundings being put on hold.”“Companies which fall under the portfolio of Chinese investors will also have to look for newer alternatives as their transactions will get delayed due to these macro events,” Priya added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wary-of-china-investing-trading-through-a-third-party/story-lSot0pUfeLNMCd50FHtOmJ.html

Over the next three months, till September, we would provide five kilos of rice along with an equal amount of flour to each family. We will provide free ration till June 2021,” said Banerjee while speaking to media persons at the state secretariat. The Bengal CM’s announcement came just minutes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the union government would distribute free food grains to 80 crore of the country’s poorest till November-end.“We give better quality rice than the Centre. Only 6.01 crore people or around 60% of the people in Bengal have been benefited from the Centre free ration scheme. We are providing to 10 crore people,” she added.The Bengal unit of the BJP said Banerjee’s free ration announcement till June 2021 is a political move to counter Narendra Modi in poll-bound Bengal. “Immediately after the Prime Minister announced that the Centre would provide free ration under Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana till November, the chief minster jumped into a political race to counter it. She has said the state will give free ration to people till June 2021. Does she have any credibility as far as social welfare is concerned?” said BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha. Referring to complaints of nepotism in distribution of compensation in Amphan-hit areas, Sinha said, “Even if her government arranges free ration for people it will go to TMC leaders. We saw this when ration sent by the Centre was distributed during the Covid-19 lockdown.”The state has also written letters to the union government to allow resumption of Kolkata Metro and stop flights from five hot spot states at least for the next two weeks, the chief minister added.The chief minister took a swipe at the union government on banning 59 Chinese apps, even though she said that her party supports the government on issues related to external affairs.“Banning some apps will not give any results. We have to be aggressive on one hand and on the other hand we have to be diplomatic. This is an external affairs issue and we don’t interfere. We fully support the government,” said Mamata Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/better-quality-rice-than-centre-cm-mamata-on-her-free-ration-announcement/story-1wfFV18Dor7H1oufUP9A1L.html
01-07-2020||Editorials||A reset in Kashmir policy | HT Editorial||Earlier this week, the hardline Kashmiri secessionist leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, quit the All Party Hurriyat Conference, the umbrella formation of separatist organisations in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). His resignation is being widely seen as a function of both his old age (he is 91) and internal factional differences — he also attacked the Hurriyat leaders based on the other side of the border in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many in New Delhi have viewed it as a setback for separatist politics in the Valley. It is true that Mr Geelani has been a staunch pro-Pakistan and Islamist figure; he has justified the violence and terror that has been wreaked on Kashmir for decades; and if he is forced to retreat from the political sphere — for whatever reason — this is good news. But it is important to recognise that Mr Geelani is not just an individual — but a thought. He represents a mindset that sees India as an “occupation force” and there are many other emerging figures, belonging to the same strand, such as Masarat Alam Bhat, who will seek to lead this school of thought. Delhi has to adopt a two-pronged approach. There can be no dialogue with those who advocate secession and violence. The might of the intelligence-security machinery must be used to deal with all such elements and a clear message that there can be no compromise on India’s territorial integrity and constitutional values must be sent out. At the same time, this is also a ripe moment to re-examine the Kashmir policy. The constitutional changes of August 5, 2019 — effective nullification of Article 370, re-organisation of the state, and its dilution into a Union Territory — and measures such as a crackdown on political activity and detention of leaders has alienated a large segment of moderates and pro-India people. Given the external situation — the stand-off at the India-China border, and the fragile situation on the Line of Control — it is crucial for India to get its house in order. For this, New Delhi must release democratic leaders still under detention (including Mehbooba Mufti); begin a process of political engagement with mainstream leaders, and, while making it clear that Article 370 is history, offer eventual restoration of statehood to J&K as a mechanism for bringing all pro-India forces on board; and pave the way for elections. To take on external adversaries, India must cover its domestic bases. And given its strategic location, Kashmir must rank at the top of this domestic reset.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-reset-in-kashmir-policy/story-ihe1A9VoeMiXoYSxHmmYzJ.html
01-07-2020||Editorials||Recognise the importance of forests | HT Editorial||A recent report in this newspaper, based on an analysis by Vijay Ramesh, a doctoral student at Columbia University, shows that forest land nearly equal to the size of Nagaland has been approved for diversion between 2014 and 2020 or is pending approval for infrastructure and developmental projects. Based on government data, the study found out that the proportion of forest areas cleared since 2014 is over 68% of what was cleared between 1975 and 2014; before 2014, most of the forest diversion was related to encroachments and mining while between 2014 and 2020, it has been mainly mining-led. While there is little doubt that India needs natural resources for industrial growth and to pull people out of poverty, the State must also consider the ecosystem services that these forests provide to the country, and evaluate whether such large-scale diversion will be beneficial in the long-run. This lack of appreciation of the unseen benefits of forests is also the reason why biodiversity-rich areas have been opened for mining, along with a strong push to rework the environment impact assessment rules.India’s first-ever Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region report revealed that the country’s average temperature is expected to rise by 4.4 degree Celsius by end-2100; and warned that this would increase stress on ecosystems, farms, and freshwater resources. This, in turn, will have a serious impact on biodiversity, food, water, energy security, and public health. The State needs to understand that forests can deliver economic benefits by mitigating the impacts of the climate crisis. Preserving forests is an effective method of building climate resilience, and realising India’s sustainable development goals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/recognise-the-importance-of-forests/story-afFGDXHYcq8Xmm43Efu9AK.html
