Educated urban-dwellers cringe at the display of casteism and sexism in matters of spouse-selection, often claiming that they do not abide by principles of caste endogamy (marriage within one’s group) and certainly desire to marry “modern educated” women.Denting this urban self-fashioning is the Netflix series Indian Matchmaking, which has held up a mirror to Indian society. It has not ventured deep into the hinterlands of India (like Amazon series Paatal Lok) to contextualise Indian’s obsession with “fair skin”, or “tall, slim, trim” as being hallmarks of a good match. Rather, it has shown how casteism and sexism merge with money, high-status, and modernity in the urban milieus of Mumbai, Delhi, New York, and Chicago.We are all too familiar with matrimonial newspaper advertisements that routinely describe the preference of a bride who is “fair-skinned”, “convent-educated” and “modern-yet-traditional”. What this series does is bring to prominence the problematic role of the matchmakers who not only promote caste or class homogamous (similar) marriages but, equally disturbingly, use a disciplining gaze on women, and preach to them the merits of adjusting and compromising in order to find a suitable “boy”.Traditionally, Indian marriages have been facilitated by matchmakers who run a “one woman or man” show, personally suggesting matches, and operate by word of mouth, and prefer to be addressed by a kin name (mami, masi).Crucially, they consider their role as not limited to suggesting matches but of also undertaking a maternalistic (paternalistic) approach by advising prospective brides and grooms to change their attitudes and expectations in order to have a happy married life.This series depicts all these characteristics quite accurately, and brings out, all too well, how matchmakers readily pronounce moral or character certificates to prospective grooms and brides by describing them as “difficult”, “stubborn”, “negative”, or “good”.Delay in a woman’s marriage or constant troubles in her matchmaking, for example, are conveniently blamed on her independent or strong-willed character, her wardrobe (in one episode a woman was chastised for having over 30 pair of shoes), or being too career-minded.Most important, this series has brought attention to an oft-repeated woe that the onus of sustaining the marriage squarely falls on women.Episode after episode, prospective brides are advised to adjust and compromise, to let go off their dreams of being a career-woman and attachments to their natal family, and instead be “accommodating” and “flexible”. Echoing these sentiments are also prospective mothers-in-law, one of whom firmly states, “The girl has to adjust many things rather that the boy. That is the value we have been brought up with.”Prospective grooms, on the other hand, are disconcertingly presented as reluctant men, who are to be cajoled and emotionally manipulated (by their mothers, sisters) into even agreeing to meet a prospective bride. When they finally come around, it is evidently on the basis of the woman’s physical attraction — a model no less (in one episode), and tall and beautiful (in another episode). No such reluctance, however, is shown on part of the women, who are mainly depicted as eager brides.This show has generated much debate on social media and has been criticised for promoting problematic standards in matchmaking. Given that my doctoral research was on the matchmaking practices of urban Indians, I can say that this show is not far from reality. We are perhaps uncomfortable and angry because this show has said it as it is, and has done so on a global platform, leaving little scope for pretence. This is, of course, not to say that there are no inter-caste, inter-class marriages, or marriages where women are happy along with having successful careers.A problematic aspect of this depiction though is that the onus of all-that-is-bad is entirely on so-called arranged marriages and the matchmaker. As a result, other media of matchmaking such as matrimonial websites and dating apps might be championed as progressive.It is important to remember that technology does not have the power to drastically transform personalities or cultures. It is also shaped by specific cultures.What otherwise explains the rise of caste-specific matrimonial websites? And while women may have more agency in choosing a match on Bumble or Hinge, what might be the tone of her interactions with the match?The problems of casteism, sexism, and ageism are not limited to arranged marriages but are entrenched in matchmaking, at large, in India and abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/matchmaking-illustrates-the-ills-of-indian-society-analysis/story-6YJNaptYn0Ue8fBqRLaDPJ.html

Officials, including the district chief medical officer (CMO), said that the private laboratory in question has not been authorised to carry out any seroprevalence studies in Haryana (or Gurugram), and that the data itself ‘did not have a scientific basis’.Arokiaswamy Velumani, founder and managing director of Thyrocare Technologies Limited — a chain of diagnostic laboratories based in Navi Mumbai — had published the survey data via his Twitter handle on July 17. In his tweet, Velumani said that for every Covid-19 related death in India, 10,000 people have been “silently immunised”, based on test results of 53,000 samples collected from 87 pin codes across India (including Gurugram).While nationally, Thyrocare’s data claims an average 15 percent seropositivity rate, the figures in Gurugram ranged from 16.8 percent (in Narsinghpur), to 18.4 percent (in Chakkarpur) and 20.8 percent (in Arjun Nagar) — all areas which have been classified by the district administration as ‘hotspots’. Health department officials, however, remained sceptical about these numbers.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “We cannot comment on the accuracy of the data. We do not know what sample size or design the lab has used in Gurugram, and we have not given permission to Thyrocare to carry out such kind of testing. There is a major ethical oversight in publishing data from commercial tests as part of a clinical study. If any private entity wants to carry out such an exercise, let them take permission and follow ICMR guidelines for sero-surveillance. We will refer this matter to the state government who will take further action, if necessary.”Velumani, however, has clarified that Thyrocare’s data is based largely on commercial tests. “About 85 percent of the tests carried out were done commercially, for corporate clients. It is not part of any study or clinical trial. The tests have all been carried out at our laboratory in Mumbai, which is accredited by ICMR and NABL. The samples are transported through an established cold chain system to maintain the integrity ,” Velumani said. Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram, said that the state health department is in the process of carrying out its own sero-prevalence study, in keeping with the ICMR’s guidelines. “Given that Thyrocare’s sample only consists of paying clients, the results would naturally be skewed. The sample population for sero-prevalence studies need to be carefully calibrated,” Sharma said.As of July 21, the state health department has tested 1,544 people as part of its ongoing sero-survey, which found that 11 percent had developed antibodies against the virus. The largest proportion of sero-positive diagnoses have been attributed to Sonepat, where 60 of 350 blood samples collected were sero-positive. The maximum number of antibody tests — 454 total — were done in Gurugram, out of which 56 were confirmed positive to have Covid-19 antibodies. Likewise, in Faridabad, 209 tests were conducted with 28 people testing positive. In Ambala, 176 people were covered under the survey, out of which 27 were found to be positive. Panchkula reported the least number of positive cases. Out of 355 tests conducted, nine were found to be positive for Covid-19 antibodies there.A senior epidemiologist based in Gurugram, however, was reluctant to dismiss Thyrocare’s data entirely. “The ethical considerations is for the government to comment on. As far as epidemiological value is concerned, it may be worth the health department’s time to look into what the data indicates. Narsinghpur, Chakkarpur and Arjun Nagar are densely populated areas that have reported a disproportionately high number of cases. Sero-prevalence of 16 to 20 percent in this areas is not implausible, if the sample size was big enough,” said the epidemiologist, who did not wish to be quoted as they had not seen Thyrocare’s raw data.Malini Aisola, co-convener of the All India Drug Action Network said, “ICMR has clarified that the utility of antibody testing at this stage is limited to sero surveillance. Can Thyrocare explain what permissions it had for the sero-surveys and why it was charging for tests? Who was leading the studies and what was the design? The commercialisation of antibody testing is a direct consequence of the absence of any governmental guidelines for private labs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pvt-lab-says-16-20-sero-prevalence-in-gurugram-health-dept-distances-itself-from-data/story-265qYKX4XhRPeMVc5HrKEO.html
21-07-2020||Delhi||HC notice to Delhi govt over stoppage of pension to 12,000 widows during lockdown||The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought the response of the Delhi government on a plea contending that the pension disbursed to around 12,000 widows has been discontinued during the Covid-19 lockdown period (March to June), with the woman and child development department offering no valid reason for the move.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan issued notices to the authorities seeking to know their stand by August 26. The plea, filed by social worker Harpal Singh Rana, has also sought that the pension amount of ₹2,500 per month be released urgently after due verification of pensioners.Rana said the reply to queries filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, showed that the pension of over 12,000 widows was discontinued on “on fake, flimsy and unfounded grounds”, like “address not found”, “Aadhaar card not linked with bank account”, and “updated pass book copies not on file”, among others.The plea contended that most pension beneficiaries have been residing at the same address that they had provided in their applications.The women are also being denied the one-time financial assistance of ₹3,000 that was being given to them under the Ladli Yojna for marrying off daughters. The plea sought that a fresh application for pension or any other financial assistance be disposed of within the stipulated 45 days and, if the application is rejected, the reasons be also communicated to the applicant.The plea filed through advocates Akhil Rana and Utkarsh Sharma also sought that the applicants seeking benefits under the Ladli Yojana as well as financial assistance for getting their daughters married, may be allowed to submit their applications online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-notice-to-delhi-govt-over-stoppage-of-pension-to-12-000-widows-during-lockdown/story-0BleSHCWHAURQSPYebB2GN.html
21-07-2020||Mumbai||Don’t take part in Opposition’s meetings, state directs officers||Maharashtra government on Tuesday issued a government resolution (GR) stating that it is not expected of the government officials to be a part of the meetings and officials visits organised by the leaders of Opposition (LoP) in the state legislature. The decision by the Uddhav Thackeray-led government overturned the decision taken by the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis-government in August 2018, which had made it compulsory for state officials to remain present in such meetings called by LoPs and member of parliament (MP), members of legislative Assembly (MLA) or members of state legislative council (MLC).The decision also comes after the leader of Opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis toured Raigad and Ratnagiri districts after Cyclone Nisarga and his visits to various parts of the state to review the Covid-19 situation. Leader of Opposition in the legislative council Pravin Darekar too has visited various Covid care centres and hospitals. The GR issued on Tuesday directed officials to follow the guidelines issued by the Fadnavis government on March 11, 2016. “The ministers in the government have the powers to oversee the administrative work of a department, organise meetings of the department-concerned, or call them for meetings, and give them orders or instructions after due consultation. However, leader of Opposition in the Assembly and legislative council, who have the rank of a minister, do not have these powers. Therefore, government officers are not expected to be a part of the meetings or visits organised by such non-governmental members, MPs, MLAs, MLCs,” the GR stated.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has criticised the decision and said it is akin to strangulating democracy. BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that instead of taking the Opposition along at a time of such a calamity, the government has decided to “ban” the meetings organised by the Opposition.In a statement, the BJP spokesperson targeted chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and said, “In these times [of pandemic], it was expected of the ministers to tour the state and check the ground realities. But the chief minister is not showing the courage to even roam in Mumbai. In this scenario, the Opposition has to see the measures adopted and bring its shortcomings before the government. It seems that the chief minister fears that the shortcomings of the government will come to light by the tours of Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, therefore, the government has taken the decision that would dent the democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/don-t-take-part-in-opposition-s-meetings-state-directs-officers/story-M1rTO8ELawBpK0d8SfqnyJ.html
21-07-2020||City||UP govt issues revised discharge policy for Covid patients||The Uttar Pradesh government late on Tuesday night issued fresh guidelines for discharge of different categories of Covid-19 patients — those under home isolation, mild asymptomatic patients in Covid facilities, patients having mild symptoms and those having moderate and severe symptoms.The directions issued by Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health), said that asymptomtic patients in home isolation will be considered as recovered if they do not show any symptoms in 10 days. Such patients will be shown as recovered on UP portal and will further have to remain in home isolation for eight more days.“In case they show any symptoms they will be referred to a Covid facility. The other category of mildly asymptomtic patients in Covid facilities will be discharged on tenth day from the date of initial test or seventh day from the date of admission, whichever is later, if they do not show any symptoms,” the guidelines, said.The guidelines for mild category patients — who suffer from mild fever, cough — state that a follow up test of such patients will be taken on eighth day (of the first sample) with the help of TrueNat machine.Such patients will be discharged if found negative in the follow up test, under any of the three conditions – tenth day of the first sample, tenth day of the symptoms or if such patients remain without fever for three consecutive days.“But, after discharge, such patients will remain under home isolation for seven days,” the guidelines, said.The followup of mild as well as severe category patients will be taken up after three days if they show no symptoms or on twelfth day of the first diagnostic sample. In case the follow up sample turns negative, such patients may be discharged but they will have to remain in home isolation for seven days.The guidelines also said that patients will be discharged if they fulfil certain conditions of not showing any symptoms; if they remain without fever for three consecutive days and if they have oxygen saturation level of above 94%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-govt-issues-revised-discharge-policy-for-covid-patients/story-WandxR4DDan36qSf2GexgP.html
21-07-2020||Mumbai||Decision on subsidy to dairy farmers soon: State||The state government is likely to launch a subsidy scheme to provide relief to milk producer farmers in the next few days, following protests by them across the state. The meeting held by the dairy farmers representatives with the dairy development minister Sunil Kedar on Tuesday, however, did not lead to any firm assurances or announcements by the government.As a result of the lockdown and commercial-industrial shutdown, more than 20 lakh litre milk in the state remains unsold daily. It has resulted in fall in the procurement price, below the government rate of ₹25 a litre for cow milk. Milk producers and the organisations representing them have been protesting across the state over the last two days, demanding cash subsidy of ₹5-10 for a litre of milk and ₹50 a kg for the export of the skimmed milk powder (SMP) produced out of the excess milk.Farmer organisations have been protesting by emptying the milk containers on roads, demanding government subsidy in the wake of the dropped rates and fallen demand owing to the lockdown.“We have been purchasing the excess milk from the farmers to ensure that they do not suffer any losses due to the fall in the demand. We have purchased 5.80 crore litres milk in more than three months and have converted it into 3500 metric tonnes of SMP by spending around ₹200 crore. We have heard the demands of the milk producer farmers and are positive about relief to them. The final decision over the new scheme for the milk producer farmers will be taken by discussing it in the state cabinet,” said Kedar.The organisations representing the farmers were divided over the demands. The per litre subsidy ranged between ₹5 and ₹10, while some of them demanded subsidy on SMP. “The subsidy never reaches the farmers. The milk unions, federations and private brands get benefited out of such schemes. We have demanded the SMP produced out of the excessive milk be distributed to the poor people through the fair prices at rationing shops,” Raghunath Patil, state chief of Shetkar Sangathana said.Ajit Nawale of milk producers Sangharsh Samiti said that they have demanded the subsidy of ₹10 be credited directly into the accounts of the farmers instead of giving it to the milk collecting bodies. He said that they also have demanded an intervention scheme to ensure that the farmers get at least ₹30 a litre as procurement price. Nawale said that the protest will continue until the firm decision is taken by the state government.Previous Fadnavis government had announced a subsidy of ₹5 a litre for procurement of the milk and ₹50 a kg for the export of the SMP. The farmers have, however, alleged irregularities by the milk collecting unions, federations and private brands depriving farmers of the benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/decision-on-subsidy-to-dairy-farmers-soon-state/story-K07f2HvuowvoCa9ILOd9hJ.html
21-07-2020||Noida||Jaypee homebuyers want work on stuck projects expedited||The Jaypee Group homebuyers demanded that top officials intervene to finish stuck housing projects as the state-owned NBCC India is unable to get the flats delivered. The NBCC India, which has been finishing the incomplete flats, has stopped the work since March, troubling flat buyers.The homebuyers have written to NBCC executive director Yogesh Sharma, resolution professional Anuj Jain and other officials concerned seeking their attention to buyers’ grievances.“The corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) of Jaypee Infratech Limited was one of the longest insolvency litigation since Indian Bankruptcy Code, 2016, came into being. The CIRP against JIL started in August, 2017 and the permissible time was extended several times by the Supreme Court till March 2020. Even during the time of this process, the finishing or construction work and sub-lease deed work continued. But now since NBCC came into management, construction and sub-lease deed work has stopped,” said colonel (retired) SK Nagrath, president, Jaypee Aman owners’ welfare association.On March 3, 2020, the national company law tribunal approved state-owned NBCC’s resolution plan, a blue print that has details as to how it will finish and deliver the stuck flats. NCLT also noted that ₹750 crore, deposited with the Supreme Court by the Jaiprakash Associates Limited, should also be used for construction purposes.Since then, the NCLT appointed resolution professional Anuj Jain, NBCC officials and other top officials involved are busy handing over the control of debt-ridden realty major from resolution professional to NBCC, said officials.“Our grievance is that since this process of handing over control started in March 2020, construction work and sub-lease deed work stopped without any valid reasons. We are running from pillar to post but nothing is happening. Those buyers who want to execute their sub-lease are suffering and delivery is getting delayed further,” said Raghwendra Pratap Singh, a buyer of Jaypee Aman.According to the NCLT officials, at least 2,200 flats are ready for registry (sub-lease deed). But since March, only four or five sub-lease deed has been taken place, said the officials quoted above.“Nobody is there to inform us as to what is happening and why the construction is not happening. The contractors have not been paid for a long time. As a result, buyers are suffering because our flats will get delayed further,” said Sachin Sharma, a buyer of Wish Town project’s Classic tower. “Since the control of the realty firm is being transferred to NBCC, it takes time to decide and appoint a new authorised person who will execute the sub-lease deed on behalf of the developer with buyers and the respective authority. Reading, documentation and formation of new rules take long time. The sub-lease deeds stopped in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. And later, even buyers were afraid to execute the sub-lease due to infection fear. And our staff are also reluctant,” said an NCLT official, requesting anonymity.NBCC executive director Yogesh Sharma did not reply to repeated calls seeking his comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/jaypee-homebuyers-want-work-on-stuck-projects-expedited/story-ugon3opRc3KWOB8Wgd868M.html
21-07-2020||Noida||Noida waterlogged as authority scrambles to clean main drain||Most of the low-lying sectors in Noida are waterlogged since Sunday when it started raining as the Noida authority is yet to clean the main irrigation drain ahead of the monsoon. Tuesday’s showers did not cause much inconvenience as it was not as heavy as on Sunday.After missing the June-end deadline to clean the drain, the Noida authority on Tuesday started the de-silting work on war footing, but by then most areas have been inundated since Sunday when it began raining.“On Sunday, it rained heavily and led to severe water-logging, exposing once again the Noida authority’s tall claims that it had de-silted big and small drains to ensure that no water-logging takes place this monsoon. Rain water entered houses in sectors 28, 29, 31, 34 and 12, among other low lying areas. The sad part is that the authority is yet to de-silt the main irrigation drain that causes water-logging as it remain choked with plastic and silt,” said Sanjeev Kumar, Sector 51 residents’ welfare association and vice-president of the Federation of Noida Residents’ Welfare Association (FONRWA).The 17km Irrigation drain, also known as Kondli drain, begins from Delhi’s Ashok Nagar and merges with Yamuna at Sector 168 after passing through multiple residential sectors in Noida. the city’s smaller drains are connected to this main drain that carries sewage as well as storm water from Delhi and Noida areas. Slum clusters and vendors throw plastic and other kinds of waste into the drain causing it to choke and thereby causing water-logging in the city.“Most drains that empty into irrigation drain are full of filth, plastic waste and mud due to poor cleaning. When it rained heavily on Sunday, the rain water could not drain away into Yamuna and instead caused water-logging, to the extent that water entered several houses in low-lying areas,” said Arun Singh, a resident of Sector 34.There are 75 main drains and 44 small drains across Noida, which works to about 300km of drain length that the authority has to maintain. The authority started de-silting of drains on June 9 with a deadline to finish the job by end-June. But the cleaning work could not be finished within the stipulated deadline due to a delay in tendering amid the Covid 19 pandemic, said the Noida authority officials. “Every year, the Noida authority has the same excuse -- that the tenders got delayed. It spends a huge amount on cleaning drains but water-logging still ends up troubling residents,” said NP Singh, president, Gautam Budh Nagar district development RWAs (DDRWAs).The Noida authority has sanctioned ₹5 crore this year to de-silt the irrigation drain and a similar amount is spent annually for cleaning this drain.“It will take 20 more days to clean the irrigation drain and the work is on in full swing. We aim to de-silt it by August 10. Water-logging took place on Sunday because the irrigation drain was choked. But we had properly cleaned all smaller drains. We have also placed pumps to empty out the water from 25 low-lying areas. I am sure residents will not witness water-logging in the future as our staff are on standby,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer, Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-waterlogged-as-authority-scrambles-to-clean-main-drain/story-aMQNRkQzmJGhhOp81gAshJ.html
21-07-2020||City||Uddhav will attend Ram Mandir ceremony: Raut||iShiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will go to Ayodhya for the bhoomi pujan ceremony of the Ram temple, Sena leader Sanjay Raut said on Tuesday. The Rajya Sabha MP added that Thackeray has received an invitation and the final decision would be taken by the Sena chief.Raut also refuted rumours that there are differences over the Ram temple issue with the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi allies in the state. He said that NCP chief Sharad Pawar has not criticised the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and three parties have different ideologies, but work on a Common Minimum Programme (CMP).“The moment that we all were waiting for has come, but due to coronavirus [outbreak], not many people would attend. Around 250-300 people are going to be invited. The Prime Minister is going to be there for the first time. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will attend, but so far, the details of the programme have not come. It is known that the bhoomi pujan is in the first week of August.”Raut added that Shiv Sena shares a “sentimental, religious and national ties” with the Ram Mandir movement.Thackeray attending the foundation-laying ceremony of the Ram Mandir could create issues with the MVA. On Sunday, Pawar took potshots at the Centre. “Eradication of Covid-19 is the priority of the Maharashtra government, but some people think constructing a temple will help in its mitigation,” Pawar had said. Echoing Pawar, Maharashtra minister and Maharashtra Congress president Balasaheb Thorat alleged that the BJP was using the issue to divert attention from the Modi government’s failure to take effective measures to combat the Covid-19 situation.Dismissing the rumours about a rift over the issue, Raut said, “Sharad Pawar has not criticised the construction of the Ram Mandir. When the Supreme Court gave its judgement, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi [Vadra], Sharad Pawar had welcomed it. He (Pawar) has expressed his opinion on what should be the priority in the current Covid-19 situation. This is a government of three parties, and nowhere in the MVA’s formation, it is written that we have to have a consensus on an issue. As a government, it has to be run with unanimity to implement the programmes for the people as per the CMP.”Raut said that there are no issues within the MVA over Thackeray’s plan to visit Ayodhya. “This is not a political or a religious issue, but a matter of national pride. It is being implemented after the Supreme Court’s orders. The CMP will remain our guiding light to run the government. Whether to go to Ayodhya or not is not an agenda in the government,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uddhav-will-attend-ram-mandir-ceremony-raut/story-I5Ug5ZFcDhZvDtnQKKNSYI.html
21-07-2020||Noida||Covid-19 home isolation in Noida only after clinical assessment, separate help desk soon||With the Uttar Pradesh government allowing asymptomatic Covid-19 positive patients to remain in home isolation, the district administration said it is setting up a separate home isolation desk to identify such patients.The separate desk, for which officials are being deputed, will assist and guide asymptomatic patients on home isolation do’s and don’ts, as well as provide them regular consultations, including the schedule for retaking the Covid-19 test.The state government on Monday allowed home isolation of asymptomatic patients, while earlier any positive patient had to get admitted to government hospitals, paid private Covid hospitals or remain at paid facilities in hotels.One of the major Covid-19 affected district in the state, Gautam Budh Nagar has 979 active cases as on Tuesday, while 3,274 patients have been discharged and 40 had died. The city has over 3,000 beds facility in different designated Covid-19 hospitalsHowever, officials said they will not be taking any risks, and that a rigorous assessment of patients will be done before a call is taken on allowing them to remain in home isolation. Health officials also said unlike the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s guidelines, which allows even mildly symptomatic patients to isolate at home, only asymptomatic patients shall be allowed in to remain in home isolation in Noida – as per the state government orders -- and that too after rigorous clinical assessments.“We are implementing a new model, taking into account all risk factors and each individual’s health. We are setting up a separate home isolation desk at out integrated command and control centre. A team of nine officials will man the desk. We are also exploring technological solutions to help qualifying patients. We have received several ideas on this, and will look into all of them,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.Now, there will be two types of Covid-19 monitoring in the city, to be done by two different teams. While the first team will continue monitoring containment zones, the second will focus on home quarantined patients.Currently, the district administration is brainstorming the clinical evolution of patients in a bid to ratify the eligibility of those who turn Covid-19 positive.“We are brainstorming to get the right model on deling with patients. What’s most important here is that we need to assess the symptoms, we need to understand the risk factors involved and then take a call. That means after a person tests positive, a thorough clinical assessment will be done by doctors, who will consider all symptoms and risk factors before deciding on whether that person is eligible for home quarantine,” Suhas said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-home-isolation-in-noida-only-after-clinical-assessment-separate-help-desk-soon/story-iK8T4fW3JyYNq9vdK0E8qM.html

After the accident, the driver of the mini-truck abandoned the vehicle and fled the spot.The injured were identified as Pawan and Virendra, who were on their way to Pari Chowk for work when the accident took place. Police said according to eyewitnesses, their motorcycle was hit from the side by the mini-truck after which they both fell of the motorcycle. They were rushed to a nearby hospital by onlookers.“The vehicle had Delhi Police written on the front and appears to be registered with that force. However, we will know more once we receive details from them. Everything is being documented and details will be shared with the Delhi Police after which we would be able to find out more about the vehicle and the driver,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.He said when the police team reached the accident spot, the driver had abandoned the vehicle and fled. It was seized and brought to the Surajpur police station. Police suspect that the driver was alone in the vehicle and was probably returning after dropping off inmates at Luksar jail. Police said they are waiting for the Delhi Police to confirm the details. A spokesperson for the Delhi Police said they will look into the matter once they receive more details from Noida police.Police is also verifying the cause of the accident by going through the CCTV footage. Both victims sustained head injuries and are in the intensive care unit.

21-07-2020||Mumbai||Status of mangrove land in Goregaon changed in 2018 to facilitate development: State||The state government informed Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday that the status of 400 acres of land with mangroves at Pahari village in Goregaon was modified to allow development, as per modifications made in April 2018 to the Development Control Regulations (DCR) of 1991. Certain portions of the reserved land have been allotted to the Metro car shed and the Maharashtra National Law University’s (MNLU) campus. The matter will be heard next on August 5.A public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Conservation Action Trust (CAT) drew attention to 400 acres that are reserved as residential and special development zone in the Development Plan of 2034.CAT’s advocate Sharan Jagtiani informed a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Madhav Jamdar on Tuesday that in 1996, the ministry of environment and forest had given clearance to a residential and recreational project in the area, which led to large-scale destruction of mangroves between 1996 and 2002. Following this, a committee confirmed in 2003 that debris had been dumped on the mangroves. A second committee submitted in 2018 that no mangroves had been destroyed after 2005. The PIL sought directions to restore the land to a green zone by replanting mangroves.Advocate Dr Milind Sathe appeared for an intervenor who owns the land and submitted that the PIL was not maintainable as DCR 1991 had been modified in April 2018, opening the land up for residential and development purposes. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni concurred with Dr Sathe and said changing the status of the land parcel was a legislative decision over which the court did not have jurisdiction.In light of the submissions, the court has asked all parties to file affidavits regarding their stand within a week and directed the petitioner to file a rejoinder in three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/status-of-mangrove-land-in-goregaon-changed-in-2018-to-facilitate-development-state/story-01vWiz6zLfjwXNr5XUrWNN.html

21-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad moots bed pooling in Meerut division to reduce deaths due to Covid-19||Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the district administration has written to the state health department for allowing pooling in intensive care unit (ICU) beds for Covid-19 patients in Meerut division. Under the new concept, the medical colleges will be identified where the patients requiring ICU beds can be shifted if they find no bed available in home district. The officials have sent a proposal for inclusion of other districts such as Hapur, Gautam Budh Nagar and Meerut, which are all part of Meerut division.According to the officials, Ghaziabad may need about 100 to 150 ICU beds as cases are rising in the district. At present, the district has only 33 ICU beds in government facilities and another 13 ICU beds reserved in private hospitals, they said.“We have written for allowing bed pooling system under Meerut division so that patients requiring ICU beds can be shifted to the medical colleges where beds are available. During the recent visit of Niti Aayog member, Dr VK Paul, we requested for allowing us to reserve some beds in Delhi hospitals for our patients. We will follow it up. As per our estimates, we require about 100-150 ICU beds so that there is no fatality as Covid-19 cases are rising,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate.The Ghaziabad district till July 21 reported 64 Covid-19 related deaths, of which 51 have taken place in June. According to official records, the case fatality rate went up to 3.9% in June, while it came down drastically to 0.2% during July 12-20. The present mortality rate in the district is 1.55%.On Tuesday, Ghaziabad reported 79 new cases, taking the total to 4,126. The number of active cases is 1,282, according to the state health bulletin.According to official figures, of 63 deaths till July 20, 39 were male patients. The officials said that one fatality took place in age group 0-20 years, while 14 deaths were in 21-40 years group. However, maximum 30 deaths took place in age group 41-60 years while 18 patients aged over 60 years had died.“We have made an analysis of the deaths. The prime reason for most deaths in age group 41-60 years is that most of them were suffering from comorbid conditions. Overall, about 90% cases suffered comorbid conditions which resulted in fatalities. Overall, 16 cases also suffered influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) conditions,” Pandey said.“To counter the fatality rate, we have also streamlined testing, early detection and speedy referral. With rising number of cases, we require more ICU beds and we expect that bed pooling system will be given go ahead soon,” he added.According to official figures, till July 19, age group 0-20 years had share of 11.67% in the total 3,978 positive cases, 21-40 years had 46.91%, 41-60 years had share of 31.86% cases while those over 60 years had share of 9.56%. “The age group 21-40 years has major share in number of positive cases as this age group is the one who moves out frequently for offices and attending other works outside,” said an officer from the district health department who wished not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-moots-bed-pooling-in-meerut-division-to-reduce-deaths-due-to-covid-19/story-0PWRElXFVp7EBbFEcBTkxM.html
21-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad prepares plan for implementing home isolation; hotel isolation may take a beating||A day after the Uttar Pradesh government allowed home isolation for asymptomatic patients of Covid-19 under specific conditions, the Ghaziabad administration on Tuesday started preparing an action plan to implement the new isolation system in the district. District administration officials said that they will chalk out finer points related to communication with patients, referral system in case of health complication and enforcement of home isolation guidelines. The officials said that the action plan for home isolation will be rolled out by Wednesday.According to the officials, the move is also likely to release burden on L1 category hospitals while there will be need for more L2 hospitals which the district has only one at present. “The government has given broad guidelines and now we are trying to fine tune different services and probable outcomes of home isolation. The entire plan will be drafted by Wednesday, and then we will start with home isolation. As per our estimates, those admitted to L1 category facility will opt for home isolation instead of hotel isolation which was recently allowed. Today, three-four hotel owners arrived and withdrew their offer for hotel isolation,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate.The state government on July 17 had rolled out the hotel isolation scheme for asymptomatic patients, with Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 per day charges. The scheme was launched in Ghaziabad and Lucknow. The government named two hotels in Bajaria area of Ghaziabad for the purpose. With home isolation scheme now rolled out, the hotel association members feel that hotel isolation will take a hit. “We feel that there will hardly be any takers for hotel isolation scheme. People will rather opt to stay at home isolation rather than spending money on hotel isolation. We were expecting that it would provide us some income as our customers have drastically reduced to 5-10% in the past two months,” Manoj Gupta, general secretary, Bajaria Hotel Owners’ Association.“Even if patients opt for hotel isolation, they will be very less in numbers,” he added.Meanwhile, the district officials also held a detailed meeting on Tuesday and discussed several proposals. According to sources, the officials have planned that several teams of doctors aged over 55 years, who are not allowed active Covid-19 duties as per government directions, will be formed in the district control room to take up health status of home isolated patients on daily basis.“Each team will be assigned a group of patients in home isolation for taking up their health status daily. Further, we are also considering that a patient will be called for physical examination to ascertain his health status. He/she will also have to disclose history of his/her previous ailments and details of the care giver,” said an officer from the health department.“The patient is also expected to click photograph of his house on his mobile phone. We may also seek details of about three-four of his neighbours to ascertain if the patient has available facilities in his house or not,” the officer, requesting anonymity, added.The state government has allowed home isolation with certain conditions -- an undertaking of compliance of guidelines will be submitted by the patient; consulting doctor will declare patient as asymptomatic; patient to ensure 24 hours availability of care giver; minimum two separate toilets and separate home quarantine facility should be available at home and patient will have to purchase a medical kit having pulse oxymeter, thermometer, mask, gloves, among other things.The officials expect that the number of patients in L1 category hospitals will also come down as the home isolation is implemented. “In this context, we will now be converting our L1 facility at ESIC Hospital, Sahibabad, into L2 category hospital. The facility has 76 beds. The health department will make arrangements,” Pandey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-prepares-plan-for-implementing-home-isolation-hotel-isolation-may-take-a-beating/story-4TFCfcBAM9libJmEBThkvN.html
21-07-2020||Chandigarh||HC dismisses bail plea of suspended SHO Jaswinder Kaur||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of Jaswinder Kaur, a suspended station house officer of the Chandigarh police under Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) investigation in a case of alleged corruption. Kaur had moved the high court after a Chandigarh trial court dismissed her bail plea and issued non bailable warrants against her last week.The police officer with a conduit, Bhagwan Singh, was booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act on June 29 for allegedly seeking a Rs 5 lakh bribe from Manimajra resident Gurdeep Singh for not lodging an FIR against him in a cheating case.“Being a member of a uniformed service, the conduct of the petitioner... leaves a lot to be desired. It is for the petitioner to face the investigation and prove her case. The failure of the petitioner to join the investigation and her reticence in coming forward even now disentitle her from seeking relief at this stage,” the bench of justice Sanjay Kumar said while dismissing her plea.The bench also observed that the allegations levelled against Kaur were serious in nature and her interrogation and cooperation with the CBI would be ‘utmost necessary’.The court said it would be premature to go into the merits of the matter at this stage when investigations were yet to be completed. “Suffice to state that the admitted conversation between the petitioner and Bhagwan Singh, the co-accused, is enough to warrant investigation into the allegations made against the petitioner.” The court also took note of CBI’s submissions that Kaur, who was asked to attend the CBI office on June 30 but did not turn up and made a false entry in the Daily Diary Register at Manimajra police station stating she had returned from the office. CBI also claimed that Kaur was untraceable.On Monday too, the high court had sought a personal affidavit from the Chandigarh director general of police (DGP) in an alleged false case of drug dealing filed by Chandigarh police against a witness in a graft case involving Kaur. An FIR had been registered at the Sector 39 police station on June 19 against the witness in the case filed in 2017, involving the suspended SHO. The petitioner had demanded CBI probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-dismisses-bail-plea-of-suspended-sho-jaswinder-kaur/story-EtZBNMRGE0z2fsCB689WTN.html
21-07-2020||Chandigarh||Token system at Sukhna, other popular spots likely||In a bid to stop overcrowding of public spaces such as the Sukhna Lake, parks and shopping malls, the UT administration is exploring the feasibility of starting a token system for restricted entry.Health and administrative officials are getting jittery with the heavy rush at the lake, especially on weekends, and parks following easing of lockdown restrictions imposed after the Covid-19 outbreak, with social distancing and other safety norms going for a toss.Confirming the UT move, Manoj Parida, UT adviser, says, “We will discuss in the war room meeting the restrictions that can be imposed on the number of people and might introduce a coupon system for people’s entry.”Ruling out a complete ban on crowds, however, Parida adds, “These are open spaces, better suited for social distancing. If we ban this than people don’t have any alternative for exercise, as gyms and other indoor exercise spaces are already banned. Also, a ban on parks, open spaces hasn’t happened anywhere in the country or even the world after lockdown restrictions have been removed.”Medical experts to be consultedThe administration will first consult medical experts on the number of the people that can be allowed at public areas after which it will regulate entry. “At the entry, officials will issue one coupon per person, on a first come first serve basis, till the stipulated limit is exhausted,” adds Parida.Local area councillor Maheshinder Sidhu, a regular at the Sukhna Lake, says the crowds have doubled since the period before the Covid-19 outbreak. “The number of youngsters coming to the lake has increased as gyms are shut. They do strenuous exercises and rarely wear masks. Even while jogging they don’t cover use face masks,” he adds. “Since people are walking in both directions it is also hard to maintain a six-foot distance,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/token-system-at-sukhna-other-popular-spots-likely/story-6YHOuY75lzRjMagoFmy0OP.html

A youth was also shot at in Buttar village recently, but no arrests were made. Due to police’s unprofessional approach, a constable was killed in an exchange of fire at a village here last month,” Kamal added.The police had on Monday arrested over 50 shopkeepers for staying open past 8pm and issued fines of ₹2,000 each. This had sparked a row between the MLA and SSP after the latter refused to release the shopkeepers on the Kamal’s request.Stating that the police used abusive language against the shopkeepers, Kamal said, “I condemn the police’s behaviour. The shopkeepers could not close on time due to harsh weather.”“The MLA had contacted me on Monday and all the shopkeepers were released,” said Moga deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans.Despite repeated attempts, SSP Gill could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-mla-hits-out-at-moga-ssp-over-shopkeepers-arrests/story-kn71X177YcMXW5hphcYk8I.html

The councillor and the residents of Prem Nagar, Durga Colony, New Durga Colony and nearby areas of Dhandari Khurd in ward 28 said that they have been forced to live in unhygienic conditions due to lackadaisical approach of the municipal corporation (MC) in dealing with the problems of choked sewer lines.A resident of New Durga colony, Kundan said, “The MC has failed to act despite several complaints by the residents. We have been facing the same problem for the last two years. Dirty sewer water remains accumulated in the streets and there is always a fear of water contamination. The roads are in pathetic condition but authorities are not paying any heed to the problem.”The residents said that the health department had found a ‘huge’ amount of larvae of Culex mosquitoes, which can spread Japanese encephalitis (an infection of the brain) and West Nile Virus, in stagnant dirty water at different locations of ward number 28. Councillor Paramjit Singh said, “I had asked the mayor to visit my ward and look at the pathetic conditions in which the residents are forced to live in. The authorities have failed to find a solution to the problem despite repeated complaints and requests given by the residents. A disposal point needs to be established in the area so that the accumulated water could be pumped out. I have also asked the mayor to establish a railway underpass for connecting Dhandari Khurd with Dhandari Kalan as residents in a bid to cross the tracks, put their lives at risk by scaling the safety walls established around the railway tracks.”Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “I have directed the MC officials to find a solution for the problem at the earliest. Also, a disposal point would be established as demanded by the councillor.”Mayor, MC chief inspects ongoing work of Jagraon BridgeSandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal also inspected the ongoing work of Jagraon bridge reconstruction on Tuesday. Sandhu said, “The officials and the contractor have been asked to expedite the work on the project and the work of constructing the retaining wall and approach road by MC would be completed by mid-August.As per the MC officials, the bridge would be opened for movement of traffic by September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mayor-inspects-ward-no-28-after-residents-complain-of-sewer-overflow/story-QvK286oxP9k6Nm4a4ZuK4I.html

However, the SIT still conducted an investigation and submitted a challan. Two agencies can’t launch a parallel probe in an FIR, the petitioner has said, also leveling allegations of malafide and claiming that the SIT probe has been done to please the political bosses in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2015-sacrilege-case-hc-notice-on-plea-against-challan-by-punjab-police-sit/story-UZZWNvPoPle7MeggdHqg0L.html

We are even ready to get the nullah cleaned, but PPCB should help us to come up with a solution.”“We are also ready to set up a treatment plant and have demanded that PPCB should get us a subsidy like that being provided to dyeing owners within the city limits for setting up Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETP). But the PPCB officials are not providing any help, said Khaneja adding that they are filing a petition against the PPCB in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stop-dumping-waste-in-buddha-nullah-by-sept-30-or-face-action-ppcb-tells-dairy-owners/story-OEVYPTHWw2VZ9UjifEWyJM.html
21-07-2020||Chandigarh||Look into threat of life to two female live-in partners: High court to Mohali SSP||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday directed the Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) to look into claims of security threat to two women putting up as live-in partners.They had approached the high court alleging threat to their life and liberty at the hands of their parents.The duo told the court that they were both aged above 18 and liked each other. “They are in a live-in relationship for the last six months and residing in a common accommodation. They are well aware of the fact that their relationship is not in the nature of marriage as they belong to the same sex,” their lawyer told the court, adding that now both of them were receiving serious threats from their family members. An application in this regard was sent to SSP Mohali, but the official had not acted, it was further informed. “Social ethos, outlook and the philosophy appears to be evolving amongst gay couples so as to gather courage and openly come out of their closets, even though gay marriage is not yet legitimate as per the applicable marriage laws in the country,” the court said adding that therefore, they opt for live-in relationships.The court said whatever the case may be, the women were entitled to protection of their lives and liberty as envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, regardless of the nature of relationship between them. “Assuming, they were living simply as friends together, even then they are constitutionally entitled to live in peace. Legitimacy of their relationship with each other, therefore, is of no consequence vis-à-vis their right to life and liberty,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/look-into-threat-of-life-to-two-female-live-in-partners-high-court-to-mohali-ssp/story-IVJny6wG0eqAPFD0SHP0WI.html

If they do not, we will lodge FIRs against them. The government can even take over their hospitals, along with their staff and doctors and force them into treating Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Chaudhary.Among the 18 private centres the Patna district administration had asked to keep isolation beds for Covid-19 patients are Hitech Emergency, GS Neuroscience (10 beds each), Arvind Hospital (13), Medical Magadh Hospital, Dr Bimal Hospital & Research Center (25 beds each), Heart Hospital (14), Murlidhar Memorial Hospital (10), Anup Institute of Orthopaedic, AS Nursing Home (4), Paras HMRI Hospital (30), Curris Hospital (18), Mahavir Vatsalya Hospital (14), Palm View Hospital, Midversal Hospital (12 each), Ruban Memorial Hospital, Patliputra Colony (40), Tara Hospital, near Gandhi Maidan (9), Buddha Cancer Centre (7) and Nestva Hospital (12).These hospitals have 1,254 beds in total, with 343 ICU beds, of which 72 had ventilator facility in them, according to the order issued by the Patna civil surgeon.“As of now, we have asked private hospital to allot 25% of their total beds for management of Covid patients. Going ahead, if need arises, we will ask them to convert the entire hospital into dedicated Covid facility,” said Dr Chaudhary.Despite the Patna district administration having issued the order on Monday, with explicit instructions to the management of private hospitals to begin Covid-19 isolation facility with immediate effect, most of these facilities were yet to begin admitting such cases on Tuesday.Earlier, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), which has large facilities Bihar, had complained firsrt to the Bihar government, and a week later to the Centre, that private hospitals emplanelled by the PSU were refusing to treat its employees who had tested postive for Covid-19.In addition to better management of its healthcare facilities, the central team, which was here for two days beginning Sunday, had asked the state government to increase the number of beds in view of the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases.As on Tuesday, Bihar reported 28,564 Covid-19 cases, with case doubling rate of 12 days. If infections were to grow at this rate, Bihar could cross 1 lakh cases in less than a month, for which the state had to be prepared, the team had pointed out during its discussion with senior state functionaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-cracks-whip-on-pvt-hospitals-refusing-covid-patients/story-WkNh3Aq49SfEjXHMpSodxN.html
21-07-2020||City||Rahul’s tweet raises heat in poll-bound Bihar||PATNAA tweet by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday, claiming the Covid-19 pandemic had spiralled out of control in Bihar and taunting the NDA government in the poll-bound state on its “good governance” claims, set off a war of words, with the ruling JD(U) and BJP attacking the former Congress president and asking him to set his “own house in order”.Assembly polls in Bihar are due later this year.“The coronavirus pandemic situation in Bihar is critical and has spiralled out of control of the state government. Unattended bodies lying in hospital wards expose the claims of good governance ofBihar,” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi while tagging a Hindustan Times report that undelined how a central team had flagged gaps in Bihar’s infection control policy during its two-day visit to the state that ended Monday.A member of the three-membet team led by Luv Agrawal, joint secretary in union helath ministry, said he was aghast to see free movement of people in the Covid wards at Patna’s NMCH, a dedicted hospital to treat Covid-19 patients. “This is like creating super spreaders. The hospitals must not allow spread of infection, else it will become a dangerous cycle,” he was quoted as saying during his interaction with a healthcare professional at the NMCH.Dr Neeraj Nischal of AIIMS-Delhi, who was also part of the central team, said foremost importance had to be given to the hospital’s infection control policy and for this arrangement be made for proper training to staff and doctors.Meanwhlile, enraged by Gandhi’s tweet attack, deputy chief minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said, “Rahul Gandhi should think about the tag of political tail that his party carries in Bihar.”“As far as Corona is concerned, Bihar government is alert on this front. Now more than 10,000 tests are being done and beds have been increase,” said Modi.BJP’s spokesperson Nikhil Anand said, “Rahul Gandhi is spreading Verbal Corona in India.”JD (U) spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan said, “He (Rahul) should first go and assess the situation in Congress-ruled states,” said .The Congress and its allies in Opposition, however, defended Gandhi. “Bihar is paying the price of complete negligence by the state government .For the past four months, the state machinery is into the election mode and people have been left to the mercy of God. People are running for pillar to post for tests; patients are left unattended. Videos going viral clearly suggest health facilities of Bihar and situation of hospital where people are dying because of lack of food and oxygen. Bodies are left lying in the hospital unattended with the patient,” said state Congress president Madan Mohan Jha.Opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav alleged that the state government was concerned more about holding elections on time and less about lurking threat to life to one and all.The RJD leader had also tweeted a video of the NMHC, where body of a Covid victim was lying in the isolation ward along with those undergoing treatment.This is not the first time that Gandhi has targeted Bihar government. During his virtual meeting with state Congress leaders on July 4, he had said that people of Bihar have become fed up with Bihar government’s work and policies. “People want change. The need of hour is that all opposition forces get united so that people of state can live a peaceful life,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rahul-s-tweet-raises-heat-in-poll-bound-bihar/story-0Hbz1rBEGOJops4sxNPXKL.html

However, due to Covid-19 scare, only 250 appointments are being made in a day now.After the Union external affairs ministry’s direction, the passport office had reduced appointments for application submission by 50%, limiting the same to 390 applications, owing to the pandemic.A passport officer said despite appointments, sometimes applicants do not turn up for submitting documents or fees and reschedule their visits for later dates. This is probably because of the restriction on the number of times an appointment can be rescheduled has been relaxed to three times per appointment, beyond which fresh payment has to be made for an appointment, the officer added.“These days, we have been receiving 250-270 appointments every day. People are scared to come out of their homes and that is a prime reason behind the steep dip in passport applications in Jalandhar,” said regional passport officer Raj Kumar Bali.He said due to the low footfall at Sewa Kendras, some staffers have been deputed at the main office to clear the pending workload.Officials said lesser applications were received this year as tours were cancelled following the coronavirus outbreak and students postponing their plans to study abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-fear-passport-appointments-see-70-decline-in-jalandhar/story-CcE0nCO80igfWCPArDjmWL.html

Already, only 6% of agriculture produce is being purchased by government agencies while the rights to pick up 94% of it have been given to private players. Due to this, the yield is being bought on low rates as compared to the MSPs.”KMSC state general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “The government is planning to sell the assets of the Mandi board by privatising the agriculture sector, but we will never allow this.”The farmers demanded revocation of the ordinances, besides loan waiver for all. During the protests, they also asked the Centre to implement the Swaminathan Commission report.Meanwhile, MP Aujla said the farmers’ demand is genuine. “I will raise this in parliament. Congress has already been opposing the ordinances. Farmers should protest outside the residences of Akali-BJP MPs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agri-ordinances-protests-held-outside-cong-mps-houses-in-amritsar/story-OYDyjpu4Hb55ducqVTyhOM.html

The nodal officers will be coordinating with willing hoteliers so that all guidelines are followed and proper security arrangements are made at the hotels.A health department official, requesting anonymity, said the decision has been taken as some financially well-to-do patients do not want to be stationed in government isolation facilities. “We have been facing this problem a lot as the patients belonging to high income groups have been pressuring us in one or the other way to avoid getting isolated in government facilities. They want the health department to allow home isolation, but that is not a good idea, as we won’t be able to monitor them,” the official said.GLADA ACA Bhupinder Singh said, “We are coordinating with hotel owners and a few have also shown interest. The willing patients will be shifted to isolated rooms in hotels and will have to pay for their stay. They will be provided three meals a day.”The administration had started the exercise few months back as well, but the facility could not be started. Now, hoteliers are also showing low response to provide the facility as restaurants and hotels have been allowed to operate by the government and regular customers will avoid visiting the hotel if positive patients were staying there. President of hotels and restaurants’ association, Amarvir Singh, said, “The administration had approached us around two months back, and at the time, many hoteliers were ready to offer their premises as isolation facilities. But, the officials did any follow up. Now, hoteliers will not be willing to provide the facility, as regular customers would not visit the hotels and restaurants if positive patients were staying there. No official has approached us regarding the same till now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/plans-afoot-to-rope-in-hotels-for-isolating-asymptomatic-covid-19-patients-in-ludhiana/story-Ge1N9wG3LL0nSOfvOCFinK.html

21-07-2020||Pune||Water for Wagholi: Rs 22-cr pipeline project kicks off||The work for laying a dedicated water supply line for Wagholi has started after a follow up of more than two years by local residents. The Rs 22 crore worth 5 million litres per day (MLD) water pipeline project will solve the decade-old water crisis in the area.HT had highlighted the crisis two years ago, despite paying taxes to the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) the residents of Wagholi were subject to buying water and the residential societies’ total expenditure for water was more than Rs 50 crore annually.This included the bills of private water tanker owners.The water crisis issue was taken up with the previous government by the Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA) who presented tabulated data of purchase of water from private water tankers at exorbitant costs. The WHSA pointed out that when residents were paying taxes regularly, then a dedicated water supply line must not be denied to them.WHSA had even complained to the police department that the citizens were being forced to buy water at a very high cost from private sellers and had demanded that their problem be solved at the earliest.Despite an approved work order, no progress on the construction was made for eight months. The villagers, elected representatives and residents of housing societies had demonstrated outside the Pune Metropolitan and Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) office seeking an early start of the project. The PMRDA authorities said that 5 MLD water supply scheme would cater to the rising needs of the burgeoning population of the area.WHSA director Sanjeev Kumar Patil said that the water crisis had created lot of difficulties for the residents of over 200 residential societies in the area.“The water tanker operators were charging huge sums and each of the society has been bearing an amount ranging between Rs 5 to 6 lakh per month as water bills. The residents thought that when they were paying over Rs 60 lakh as taxes then why was a dedicated water pipeline being denied to them. We took up the issue with the highest level of government and the work was finally sanctioned and now has started,” he said.Wagholi gram panchayat rural development officer Anil Kumbhar said, “ The PMRDA has sanctioned Rs 22 crore for the water supply line laying project and the work is likely to be completed in the next one and half year time.”The Wagholi gram panchayat is entrusted with supervisory and executive control exercised by the Pune Metropolitan and Regional Development Authority (PMRDA), the parent body looking after the gram panchayat. The area residents require 2, 70, 00,000 litres per day while the water supplied by panchayat is only 20, 25,000 litres per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/water-for-wagholi-rs-22-cr-pipeline-project-kicks-off/story-Mtdcpe2SJubD8bmRfiIxyI.html
21-07-2020||Pune||Shut for four months, fitness industry struggles to stay afloat in Pune||Gymnasiums and fitness centres in the city have been shut since March 2020, which has left trainers and coaches unemployed for the past four months.There are almost 3,000 gyms among which 1,500 are micro gyms in Pune which has remained shut, having a huge impact on the financial status of the owners of the gyms and fitness trainers. The sports fraternity and fitness lovers are waiting for the gyms to reopen. The fitness industry has suffered a total loss of approximately Rs 30 crore in the past four months. The monthly revenue of a small gym is Rs 1.5 to 2 lakh per month while the large fitness centres earn Rs 8 lakh to 12 lakh per month.Nilesh Kale, president of the Pune fitness association said, “I have appealed to the government to give us guidelines which we can follow and reopen gyms but we have been ignored for months. PMC is not responding to our appeals and requests. We also pitched them with necessary guidelines and asked them to modify them according to their norms yet there was no response. We will protest soon if they do not allow gyms and fitness centres to reopen.”Kalyani Jada, the owner of AJ’s Warriors fitness claims her request to reopen the business was treated as a joke at the PMC office.“I went to the PMC office and when I requested for the fitness industry to be back in business, the PMC officials overthrew our request with humour. Many gym trainers and owners are committing suicide due to zero income. We have to extend member’s subscription as they have paid for a quarter or annual membership even though we suffered the loss of 15 lakh rupees in the last four months. We are ready to reopen with all the precautions,” Jada said.Kaustubh Shegde, gym trainer said he has had no income for the last five months“The fitness industry focuses on mental and physical health and yet it is categorized in the entertainment industry by the government even when mental and physical immunity should be on the highest priority in the Covid-19 situation,” Shedge said.The owner of RC fitness club Rupesh Chavan in Wagholi said that survival is a basic challenge at the moment.“I think gyms and fitness centres definitely help increase immunity hence should be permitted to reopen as salons and hotels are now open. We are helpless and also out of money and hence for us, survival is a basic challenge that we are facing every day. Gyms in Pune are paying Rs 3 crore for light bills hence we are worried about the losses we will have to face in future,” Chavan said.“I am eagerly waiting for gyms to reopen as working out from home is not giving me satisfactory results. However, I will not join a gym unless and until I feel safe. I have paid Rs 4,500 for three months and I have been assured that my membership will be extended after Bios gym reopens,” said Kunal Korad, a member of Bios gym.Chinmay Chavan, La fit gym member, “I have not received any update from the gym and I paid for a six-month membership for which I paid Rs 8,000 in March I am hoping for an extension in membership”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/shut-for-four-months-fitness-industry-struggles-to-stay-afloat-in-pune/story-2gk2aROU4WQZYxBeb49XkM.html
21-07-2020||Pune||Milk protests intensified in Kolhapur, Sangli||The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) chief Raju Shetti commenced the second day of protests against low milk price in the state by pouring milk over the Shiv Ling at a temple in Udgaon village in Kolhapur.Besides Udgaon, the protest was observed in multiple forms at Shirase, Dhamod, Koulav, Bargewadi, Bhopalewadi, Ghotawade, and Awali villages of Kolhapur in response to the protest started by Shetti.“We prayed to god to help milk traders out of this recession. We prayed to god to bless the Centre with the sense to suspend GST on dairy and products. We also prayed that the government cancels its decision to import 10,000 litres of skimmed milk. We hope the Maharashtra government takes the decision of giving help of Rs 5/litre directly to the accounts of milk traders,” said Shetti while speaking to media representatives.In Sangli district, protesters spilled milk from tankers along the Pune-Bengaluru highway as a mark of protest. The action was replicated by protesters in Shirase village and various other parts of Kolhapur and Sangli.When questioned about the spillage as a wasteful form of protest, Shetti put the onus on the protesters and justified the action.“What is waste really? A bottle of drinking water is Rs 20 per litre while milk, which is considered to be ambrosia among food, costs Rs 17 per litre - Rs 3 per litre less than water. That way, the rainwater - which is the purest form - that flows in gutters should also be considered as wastage of resource,” said Shetti.“At any point of time, the milk business is of no benefit to the farmer. It is hardly a source of livelihood. Milk prices has been a long-standing issue among farmers. The price, moreover, is not controlled by the farmer, but by the customer and the supply-demand. Fortunately, large-scale milk trade is highly organised compared to grains and vegetables. It is Rs 60,00,000 crore business. What ails the industry is a problem much deeper that demands long-term solutions like market intervention operation and not short-term solutions like providing subsidy. It is high-time the government takes up the issue else these protests will keep happening regularly. If the Gujarat government is giving Rs 160 lakh crore subsidy to one of the biggest players in the country like Amul, it is disappointing. For such a big and established organisation, why did the need for subsidy even arise? That is the question,” said DV Ghanekar, managing director of Gokul Dairy.Of the 10,81,000 litres supply of Gokul Dairy on a daily basis, 39,000 litres of milk could not be sent out due to various reasons including the protest. The tankers going to Mumbai and Pune were granted police protection, according to Ghanekar.“At any given point, there are 50 tankers in Mumbai, 50 on roads and 50 in the dairy. The ones on the roads have been given police protection,” said Ghanekar.On Monday, a group of political parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Republican Party of India (Athawale) (RPI(A)), Shiv Sangram, among others and members of Ajit Navale-led All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) had also held protests in parts of Ahmednagar and Sangli on Monday. The members of Ajit Navale-led All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) had also held protests in parts of Ahmednagar and Sangli on Monday.According to a statement issued by the group of parties led by the BJP, on Monday, BJP Pune city chief Jagdish Mulik demanded Rs 10/litre as remuneration in the bank accounts of milk traders as against Rs 5/litre demanded by Shetti.When asked about the difference in the demand of two groups of protestors for direct benefit for the farmers, Mulik said, “We are asking for Rs 10/litre and Rs 50/kg of milk powder to be given directly to the farmers. I do not know about the others, but we have spoken to the farmers and stakeholders to come up with the figure. We have given them a time of 10 days to come up with ways to make it happen or else we will intensify our protest.” However, Mulik said that the party has not yet decided the mode of expressing intensity of their protest.The BJP members have warned of intensified protests on August 1 if their demands are not met by July 31, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/milk-protests-intensified-in-kolhapur-sangli/story-62hRGI3hzJg0f3COQ6x4SK.html

Banerjee accused the BJP of using money to win state elections or overthrow opposition governments in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. She also accused the Centre of introducing “kaala kanoon” (dark laws) and destroying the country’s economic and democratic structure. “Do not think that just because the Covid-19 pandemic is on right now people have forgotten how you (BJP) want to divide people using the National Register of Citizens and National Population Register. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians are all citizens of India,” said Banerjee while addressing the TMC’s annual show held in memory of the 13 youth Congress workers killed in police firing in Kolkata on July 21, 1993.Railways, Air India, Coal India Limited et al are being sold off. I am sorry that you are in power at the Centre. You have destroyed the economy and the democratic structure. Gujarat [model] cannot rule Bengal. If Gujarat has to rule all states then what is the use of the Election Commission of India, the judiciary, the other parties. Let there be one party and a Presidential form of government,” said Banerjee.“The TMC government has increased the employment rate in the state by 40 % while the unemployment rate in the country has touched 45%. If we come back to power then poor people will get free ration, medical treatment and education for their lifetime,” said the chief minister.“I invite those who joined other parties to come back. If they have made mistakes, then please remember that the TMC is the only party that can give good governance. I am inviting dedicated youths to join us and work on the field. We want the next line of leadership,” said Banerjee. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh reacted by saying Banerjee has started making promises a year in advance because she is aware that her party will not win the next election. “I could feel the fear in her voice,” said Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/gujarat-model-will-not-rule-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-messages-centre/story-6a69KHxEeYV7enOJlpq4kO.html

21-07-2020||Pune||Covid impact: PCB suffers Rs11.52 crore revenue loss||The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) has reported a loss of Rs 11.52 crore in revenue starting from lockdown 1.0 to the current lockdown. The PCB is hit with the worst financial crisis in the past three years and is now facing another major shortfall of revenue generation in three major categories comprising property tax, Vehicle Entry Tax (VET) and pay and park fees during the lockdown.This total sum of revenue loss has been reported at an aggregate of Rs 11.52 crore.According to the data provided by PCB chief executive office, the PCB generated a revenue shortfall of Rs 5 crore in VET from April to June. Similarly, the PCB recorded a loss of Rs 29 lakh in terms of pay and park fees.Also, the revenue from the Chhatrapati Shivaji market has gone down by Rs 5 lakh. Another major revenue loss of Rs 6.18 crore has been reported from the property tax collection department.PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar said that the losses have been calculated chiefly related to VET, pay and park scheme and property tax earnings of the cantonment board.“The PCB has sustained serious losses during the three month lockdown period. We are not getting shop rent from our market, and property tax. We are losing additional revenue of Rs 20 lakh from hoarding advertisements. We have sustained these losses and the requisite income has not been generated. The Covid-19 crisis has also put an additional Covid expenditure on the board budget. We are already on a very tight budget and these losses are compounding our problems further,” Kumar said.The development projects estimated to be worth Rs 200 crore have been hit as the PCB has not received its share of goods and service tax (GST) funds from the state government since July 2017. Neither the state government nor the central government has taken up the PCB-GST issue despite the ongoing Covid crisis wreaking havoc on the cantonment board’s finances. Through the available reserve funds, the PCB can pay salaries to its employees.The developmental projects that have been hit include a state of the art commercial complex at Dhobi ghat, construction of staff quarters, construction of a multi-level parking facility, remodelling and sewage improvement project, replacement of water supply lines, construction of road and drainage, beautification of gardens and some new developmental initiatives needed to enhance the civic infrastructure of the cantonment area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-impact-pcb-suffers-rs11-52-crore-revenue-loss/story-IDleQ7EzgmzmOVInE1PiXP.html

The attack comes days after Vikram Joshi, who works with a local daily, lodged a complaint at Ghaziabad’s Vijay Nagar police post against some people for harassing his niece on July 16. Joshi was returning home in Vijay Nagar area with his two daughters on a motorcycle when he was waylaid by over half a dozen armed men at around 10.30 pm on Monday, officials said. The journalist was shot in the head by one of the accused, who then fled the spot, leaving him severely injured. He was taken to a hospital where he is in a critical condition, they said. Senior Superintendent of Police, Ghaziabad, Kalanidhi Naithani said nine people, including two of the three named in the FIR, have been arrested while the local police post in-charge was suspended in the wake of the incident. “The FIR was registered under Indian Penal Code sections 307 (attempted murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (act done by several people with a common intention) on complaint by Joshi’s brother Aniket Joshi,” Naithani said. The FIR had three named suspects – Chhotu, Akash Bihari and Ravi besides some unidentified people. Chhotu and Ravi have been arrested, while searches are underway to nab Akash and six police teams are working on the case, he added. The police have also arrested Mohit, Dalbir, Akash, Yogendra, Abhishek, Abhishek and Shaqir based on evidence in connection with the case, Naithani added. In his complaint lodged at the Vijay Nagar police post, Joshi had named Chhotu, Ravi and Akash, his family said. The journalist was given a life threat by the accused men, according to the allegations made in the FIR. “The family has alleged inadequate action by the local police post in-charge, who has been suspended with immediate effect considering the gravity of the matter. A departmental inquiry has been ordered and the local Circle Officer will probe the matter,” SSP Naithani said. Meanwhile, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the Uttar Pradesh government over the law-and-order situation in the state following the incident.“Ghaziabad falls in NCR. Going by the state of law and order here, one can get an idea of the situation in the entire state of UP. A journalist was shot at because he complained to the police against molestation of his niece. How will common man feel safe in such a jungle raj,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-journalist-shot-at-in-front-of-his-daughters-9-held-in-the-case/story-AP9ay5XQ40WV5gfiq7IMuJ.html
21-07-2020||Chandigarh||Bathinda turns Venice after downpour, residents bring out boat in protest||Bathinda: Residents of Parasram Nagar in Bathinda took to boating on inundated streets in protest against the municipal corporation’s ill-preparedness in resolving the problem of waterlogging during the monsoon every year.Led by Vijay Kumar Sharma, a former municipal councillor, the residents made their way on a boat and waded through waist-deep water and said the authorities had not learnt a lesson from last year’s monsoon when parts of the city had remained inundated for days.“Residents of six localities, including Parasram Nagar, are low-lying and bear the brunt of flooding. There is no accountability of officials and elected representatives as residents continue to suffer,” Kumar said.INCESSANT RAIN TO BLAMEThe Punjab Agricultural University’s local observatory at the regional research Centre recorded 104 mm of rainfall in Bathinda on Tuesday.Agrometeorology scientist Raj Kumar Pal said in July, Bathinda has already received 214 mm of rainfall against the average rainfall of 120 mm.It rained incessantly since midnight, inundating many parts of the city.Several localities such as the area around the district administrative complex that houses the official residences of the deputy commissioner, inspector general of police (IGP) and judicial officials were under three feet of water.Residential pockets in Sirki Bazaar area, on Mall Road, Power House Road besides Parasram Nagar, Ganesha Basti and Vir Colony were among the worst hit.“A single spell of heavy rain exposes the unpreparedness of the authorities. Though Sirki Bazaar is in the heart of the city, it is prone to waterlogging due to lack of maintenance,” says Rinku, who deals in paints.COVID FIGHT TAKES TOLL ON MAINTENANCEOfficials say Bathinda also lacks a dedicated storm water drainage network and sewage lines are used to drain rainwater. They blame the Covid-19 outbreak behind the slow progress of maintenance before the monsoon.“Haphazard development in the last decade has left little room for the wastewater disposal system. Bathinda’s geographical condition is such that rainwater accumulates only at certain natural depressions. Due to mushrooming residential and commercial spaces, the corporation has to use high-powered pumps to drain rainwater out of streets,” said an MC official.Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said the administration has taken steps to expedite rainwater drainage. He said two ponds with a water holding capacity of 1.5 lakh metric cubic metre were opened at Mansa road and Sanjay Nagar. Another old pond near DAV College that has been reworked to store 1.25 lakh cubic metres of water is in the works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bathinda-turns-venice-after-downpour-residents-bring-out-boat-in-protest/story-EZVYNdyDbnxdw67wfq1fMJ.html

Raut also said lakhs of Lord Ram devotees would have turned up for the ceremony had there been no Covid-19 crisis prevailing.The Rajya Sabha member on Monday claimed his party paved the way to the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and removed roadblocks in the temple construction for the cause of Hindutva and not for politics.It needs to be seen how many people will be invited for the temple’s ground-breaking ceremony next month and what social distancing measures will be taken at the event (in view of the Covid-19 outbreak), Raut said.“What ‘political social distancing’ they will observe remains to be seen,” he said.After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court on November 9 last year paved the way for the construction of Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya.The apex court directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-will-definitely-go-for-ram-temple-bhoomi-pujan-claims-sanjay-raut/story-6WGIIxZVJORuG3bDwsw1SI.html
21-07-2020||Chandigarh||Two liquor contractors shot dead at Chautala village in Sirsa||Rohtak: Two liquor contractors were shot dead by four assailants outside a vend at Chautala village in Sirsa district on the Rajasthan border on Monday night.Mukesh Godara, a resident of Bharukhera village, and Jai Prakash Punia of Chautala village died on the spot, police said on Tuesday.In his complaint, Vijay Kumar said that his cousin Mukesh and Jai Prakash had got the tender to run the liquor vend at Chautala village this year.“Four unidentified men reached the restaurant near the liquor vend on Monday evening.

21-07-2020||Gurugram||Only motorcycle thieves allowed: Police bust exclusive Gurugram ‘club’||During a routine check near the city’s upscale Galleria Market (in DLF 4) on Saturday, Gurugram police arrested two men they suspected of being vehicle thieves — and stumbled into a rabbit hole that led them to a gang of motorcycle thieves. It was large enough and specialised enough to focus on various customer groups, joyriders,those who wanted to use the bike for a crime, people in the spare parts business, or those simply looking to buy a second-hand bike.The gang, or club as the members themselves referred to it, even has a name: Bikers Gang — Hum Sikander (which roughly translates as We The Conquerors). And its members, the police claimed, are behind around 500 motorcycle thefts in the National Capital Region over the past six years.The police added that based on the information provided by the two people they arrested, one 18 years old and the other 22, they have identified 30 more, and are conducting raids to arrest them as well as garage owners who helped them fence the bikes. They said that around 60 members of the club are juveniles.The club was born in prison, said city police commissioner KK Rao. Some of its members met in jails and became friends. The club itself was formed in October 2014 by a Nuh resident who is still serving time in Bhondsi jail — for vehicle theft. “All of them are not habitual offenders. Many educated men in need of money have also been part of this gang. They end up stealing to lead a lavish life. The crime teams are monitoring the movement of habitual offenders, garages, and shops dealing in second-hand spare parts.” Like other associations, the club met once a month, according to Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime). Requirements (of motorcycles) were posted on a WhatsApp group, as was the availability of bikes. The administrator of the group and its name keep changing, he explained. In February, for instance, a new group was formed after six members of the gang were arrested from Gurugram and Nuh.The two arrested men revealed that they travelled more than 700 kilometres to Jammu and Kashmir to sell stolen motorbikes recently, after the lockdown was lifted, and have sold a bike for as low as ₹2,000, the police said. On March 25, India imposed a lockdown to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease. The lockdown, which placed severe restrictions on movements, especially across state boundaries, eventually lasted 68 days.The two also said that due to increased checking in the district after the lockdown, the gang’s members were repainting stolen bikes and changing number plates immediately — and selling them as soon as they could in other states, even if it meant taking a lower price.The police said that the gang found itself jobless during the lockdown. “Most of the people working in companies were away during the lockdown. These gang members were anxiously waiting for victims to park their bikes in Sector 29 and in DLF Phase 4 again,” said Sangwan. The end of the lockdown saw their business revive. Sometimes, Sangwan said, the thieves would speed away with a bike minutes after it had been parked.Police said the gang was trained by mechanics in UP and Nuh and could unlock a bike in minutes — without keys. They added that members carried a small kit with tools to open any kind of bike lock. Sangwan said that sometimes, the bikes are stolen for parts. Engines sell for ₹6,000, lights for ₹300 and brake assemblies for ₹300. The gang’s preferred hunting grounds were DLF Phase 4, Sector 29, MG Road, Sector 14 market, Palam Vihar, the district courts and Sector 5, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/only-motorcycle-thieves-allowed-police-bust-exclusive-gurugram-club/story-snr40J7HcBrG0GAbhqiG4L.html

21-07-2020||Delhi||Over 23% of Delhi’s population exposed to coronavirus, shows sero-survey results||More than 23% of Delhi’s 1.9 crore population showed evidence of past exposure to Sars-Cov-2, which causes the coronavirus disease, in almost six months and that a large number of infected people remain asymptomatic, the result of the sero-prevalence study conducted in the national capital shows.The Union health ministry said in a statement that 21,387 samples were collected in accordance with laboratory standards and were tested between June 27 and July 10 to determine the extent of the spread of the coronavirus disease in Delhi.“Nearly six months into the epidemic, only 23.48% of the people are affected in Delhi, which has several pockets of dense population,” the Union health ministry, which commissioned the study, said in a statement.Also Read: Delhi records less than 1,000 cases for first time in 7 weeks, Bihar a concernThe seroprevalence study was conducted jointly by the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Delhi government “following a rigorous multi-stage sampling study design.”Blood samples were taken from randomly selected people as part of the survey, which involves rapid tests for antibodies, to study the scale of undetected infections. The samples were tested to ascertain the population-level presence of the IgG antibody, which indicates past infection.“This can be attributed to the proactive efforts taken by the Government to prevent the spread of infection including prompt lockdown, effective containment and surveillance measures, including contact tracing and tracking, as well as citizen’s compliance to COVID Appropriate Behaviours,” the health ministry said in the statement.Also Read: As cases drop in Delhi, CM Kejriwal says ‘don’t be complacent’The ministry, however, warned that a significant proportion of the population is still vulnerable. “Therefore, the containment measures need to continue with the same rigour. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing, use of face mask/cover, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoidance of crowded places etc, must be followed strictly,” it added.A diagnostic method, serological tests are used to identify antibodies, which are created by the immune system when someone is infected with the virus, and antigens in a person’s blood.Serology (antibody) tests are largely used for surveillance among communities and can be used on people who have already been tested positive for the virus or even those who are asymptomatic.Epidemiologists often use serological surveys to determine who has antibodies and find out who has been infected with the virus, even if someone never reported a positive test or experienced symptoms. Also Read: Oxford Covid-19 vaccine’s first human trial shows promise, more phases underwayA serological survey includes IgG Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test. It estimates the proportion of the population exposed to Sars-Cov-2 infection. The IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infections but it indicates episodes of infections that has happened in the past. The test is approved by ICMR for its high sensitivity and specificity. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had conducted a pilot sero survey across 83 districts in 21 states in May.

21-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi cabinet okays doorstep delivery of ration||The Delhi government on Tuesday approved doorstep delivery of ration to eligible beneficiaries, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced, adding that the scheme will be fully implemented in the next six-seven months. “The Delhi cabinet today cleared the scheme on doorstep delivery of ration. It will be named Mukhyamantri Ghar-Ghar Ration Yojana. Under the scheme, ration will be processed, packed and delivered at the doorstep of beneficiaries,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing.The CM said the scheme will take another six months to be put in place as that is the time needed to float tenders and engage agencies which would help in implementation.Kejriwal further said with this scheme the Delhi government will also implement the central government’s ‘one nation, one ration card’ policy, which makes the whole ration system more portable, especially for beneficiaries who migrate between states.This flagship scheme of the Aam Aadmi Party government has been in the pipeline for more than two years.Delhi currently has around 7.5 million ration beneficiaries and 2,028 designated fair price shops, government records show. That ration beneficiaries, the CM said, will have to choose between doorstep delivery and the traditional way of collecting ration from the designated fair price shops. “Those who opt for the doorstep scheme will get processed flour instead of wheat,” said Kejriwal, calling the scheme a “revolutionary step” in governance.He further said, “Along with the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, we will also implement the central government’s scheme of one nation one ration card.”The Delhi government was supposed to launch the doorstep ration delivery scheme in March 2018 but could not do so because of administrative issues. “Later, in 2019, the government initiated a pilot project of doorstep delivery in around five (out of 272) municipal wards in the city and some glitches were identified. All issues have been resolved now and we are in a position to launch the scheme at the earliest,” said a senior official in the food and civil supplies department who did not wish to be identified.The Delhi government, on Monday, directed all fair price shops in the city to update their contact details and Aadhaar number for the doorstep ration delivery scheme to be implemented. The order, which HT has seen, further said the government also plans to re-introduce the electronic point of sales (e-PoS) system for ration distribution.In May, HT published a report saying Kejriwal had directed the food and civil supplies department to restart the Delhi government’s flagship project of doorstep delivery of ration using electronic point of sale (e-PoS) devices. The direction came after Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan wrote to Kejriwal, urging Delhi to implement the Centre’s ‘one nation, one ration card’ policy.‘The one nation, one ration card’ policy would also ration beneficiaries registered in Delhi to avail ration in other states and vice-versa. Paswan’s letter came at a time when the national capital witnessed large-scale reverse migration of the labour force in the light of the lockdown that was imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19.As per the plan, e-PoS devices are to be given to all the 2,028 fair price shops in Delhi and also to agents who would deliver the monthly ration to the doorstep of card holders. The process includes entering the ration card number into the device, followed by the biometric (fingerprint scanning) of the beneficiary or entering the Aadhaar card details. Once the details are matched with the database, the ration is disbursed to the beneficiary.The Delhi government had stopped using e-PoS since April 2018, in the light of large number of complaints concerning inconvenience in availing ration owing to technical glitches that also entailed a tussle between the elected government and top bureaucrats in the food department. “By now, we have got all e-PoS machines checked and the technical glitches have been resolved. Delhi has 100% Aadhaar seeding of its ration card holder. We can start using e-PoS again,” said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cabinet-okays-doorstep-delivery-of-ration/story-eE9wslrVrg9fCRyqy07DvL.html

21-07-2020||Jaipur||In Rajasthan crisis today, hearing in high court and Congress party meeting||Rajasthan High Court on Tuesday resumed hearing a petition by Sachin Pilot and 18 Congress legislators backing him challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by Rajasthan assembly Speaker CP Joshi for their rebellion against the party.Their disqualification will bring down the majority mark in the assembly—101 in the 200-member house making it easier for chief minister Ashok Gehlot to win a floor test. Gehlot has claimed he has the support of more than 100 members of legislative assembly (MLAs) and Pilot is being backed by 18 legislators.Also Read: ‘More concocted allegations coming’: Sachin Pilot after MLA’s bribe chargeA third meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) will also take place at Fairmont Jaipur, a luxury hotel on the outskirts of the state capital where the legislators supporting Gehlot have been staying since last week. In its previous hearing last Friday, the high court had directed that no action can be taken against Pilot and 18 other Congress MLAs until 5.30pm on Tuesday.The hearing, which remained inconclusive on Monday, resumed in the court of chief justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice Prakash Gupta on Tuesday morning.The disqualification notices to Pilot and the MLAs were served after the Congress party complained to Rajasthan assembly speaker CP Joshi that they defied a whip to attend two CLP meetings on July 13 and July 14.Also Read: ‘Who knew person with such innocent face will…’: CM Gehlot roasts Sachin PilotAbhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Joshi, said on Monday that the petition, which was filed on July 15, was premature and that the court should not intervene until the speaker had taken a final call on disqualifying the rebel MLAs from the House.The Pilot camp, however, argues that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.Singhvi said the Speaker was well within his jurisdiction to issue notices to the petitioners.Pilot and other rebel MLAs have maintained that they never had the intention to leave the Congress party and were merely exercising their right to criticise party leadership and the functioning of the chief minister.“Pulling down a government and pulling down a chief minister was not the same thing,” Harish Salve, representing the petitioners, said.Pilot was sacked as the Rajasthan deputy chief minister and the president of the state Congress unit after he rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/in-rajasthan-crisis-today-hearing-in-high-court-and-congress-party-meeting/story-4z2U2CcscpLxkb5cMctNrM.html

21-07-2020||Bhopal||Elusive monsoon makes farmers jittery in 18 districts of Madhya Pradesh||Farmers in 18 districts of Madhya Pradesh, who have sown their kharif crops, said they are staring at a huge loss if the monsoon continues to play truant for the next one week or so.The deficient rainfall witnessed in the districts, mostly in the Gwalior-Chambal, Bundelkhand and Mahakoshal regions, varies from minus 7% in Guna to minus 45% in Gwalior, data from meteorological department’s Bhopal unit shows. The districts having deficient rains include Gwalior, Bhind, Datia, Guna, Shivpuri, Chhatarpur, Damoh, Sagar, Tikamgarh, Balaghat, Jabalpur, Narsinghpur, Katni, Dhar, Mandsaur, Shajapur and Hoshangabad.Madhya Pradesh had recorded heavy rains in July last year at 643.1mm against the normal rainfall of 371.6mm for the month. As of now, the state has had 318.6mm of rains in the entire rainy season so far beginning June 1.The entire Bundelkhand, except Panna, and one-third of Gwalior-Chambal regions are parched whereas as many as 13 districts out of the total 52 have witnessed excess rainfall of 20% or above. Most of the districts with excess rainfall fall under Malwa-Nimad region.Sowing of kharif crops—paddy, millet, soybean, arhar, mung, urad, groundnut—is done in June and July in the state, as per agriculture department officials.“I sowed soybean on 25-acre land and urad on 5-acre land. Since the sowing on July 2, there is no rainfall in our area. The result is the surface in the agriculture field has started showing cracks and crop withering,” Vinod Tiwari, a farmer from Bobai village in Sagar district in Bundelkhand region, said.Tiwari said the leaves of his soybean plants have started turning yellow and the growth of plants is affected by about 30 to 40%. “If I don’t have rains in the next four to five days the crop can hardly be revived. So far I have invested Rs 1.66 lakh in my Kharif crop spent on the purchase of seeds, ploughing, labourers engaged for sowing, pesticide etc. If the crop fails this will be a huge setback to me and my family,” he added.Dayaram Ahirwar, a farmer from Dhana village in Sagar, also said if they don’t get rainfall in the next few days his entire crop will be damaged.“I sowed one quintal of soybean and 25 kg of urad. So far I have invested around Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 for my Kharif season crops. There has been rainfall just once after the sowing. The plants are withering,” he said.Mahendra Singh Yadav, a resident of Borai village in Gwalior, said, “I have sown paddy in 5 beegha of land and Urad in another 5 beegha of land. Borewell is of no use as the groundwater level has plummeted. Hence, if there is no rain in the next week and my crops are damaged I will suffer a loss of more than Rs 75,000.”The agriculture department has said sowing in kharif season this year has been done in 118.05 lakh hectare of land against the target of 146.31 lakh hectare.Shivmohan Singh, the media in-charge of Narmadapuram division of RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, said deficient rains aren’t the only worry for the farmers.“While want of rains has caused troubles to the farmers they are equally harassed by erratic power supply as they can’t use motor pumps properly to irrigate their land. The government must look into the problem of the farmers at the earliest to ensure farmers don’t suffer a huge loss in the event of no rains,” Singh said.Kamal Patel, the state minister for farmers welfare and agriculture development, said the government is keeping a close watch on the situation. “Reports about deficient rains have been received from 13 districts. We are going to review the situation in the next couple of days.”(With inputs from Anupam Pateriya in Sagar, Mahesh Shivhare in Gwalior and Jitendra Verma in Hoshangabad)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/elusive-monsoon-makes-farmers-jittery-in-18-districts-of-madhya-pradesh/story-uqH65J369VpI46Ia7iqD6I.html

As per information, the state government has also released part payment of over ₹4 crore for the Focal Point CETP and the dyers are in talks with the government seeking release of the pending payment. PDA general secretary Bobby Jindal said, “The state government was not releasing the pending ₹12 crore subsidy (₹6 crore for each CETP) due to which we were not able to get the pending grant of ₹24 crore from the Union government. We had moved the NGT as the delay in releasing the subsidy was delaying the construction of CETP. The NGT had on June 30 directed the government to release the subsidy in three weeks. The next hearing of the case has been scheduled for July 23. Now, we have received the state’s share and the Union government will also release its share soon.The project will now be made operational by October this year.”The two CETPs are being established for the dyeing industry in the Tajpur road complex and the Focal Point at a cost of ₹130 crore. The government had earlier assured a subsidy of ₹45 crore (₹22.5 crore for each CETP), out of which a sum of ₹15 crore has to be paid by the MoEF and CC, while the rest ₹7.5 crore has to be borne by the state government. The rest of the amount has to be spent by the industry.The CETPs are being constructed to stop the dumping of untreated waste from the dyeing units into the Buddha nullah through the MC sewer lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pending-6-crore-subsidy-released-for-ludhiana-s-tajpur-road-cetp-project/story-0ve9r4uF2EsfaiFlO3QfKL.html

21-07-2020||Chandigarh||A month on, 4,384 Chandigarh residents challaned for not wearing masks||Either out of reluctance or a casual approach, the residents of Chandigarh despite a hike in the number of Covid-19 positive cases are still moving around without masks on.Evidently, since June 23 the police have challaned 4,384 residents for moving in the public without masks and collected a fine of ₹22.22 lakh. Besides, 278 FIRs were registered in different police stations of the city against 318 persons for the same offence. All of them were later released on bail.However, cases are not registered against all who are caught. “If a person fails to pay a fine on the spot or if a person is caught after 10pm, an FIR is registered,” said a police officer. The violators are then arrested and released on bail later. “The National Disaster Act authorises enforcement agencies to register FIRs if a person is not able to pay the fine on the spot under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code,” added the official.Meanwhile, residents continue to move about in markets, parks and other public places without the protective gear, which is mandatory. The violation elicits ₹500 in fine, which must be paid on the spot.The most number of challans, 526, were issued by the Sector 26 police station, near the Bapu Dham Colony—a Covid hotspot. The Sector 3 police station, near Sukhna lake, has issued 499 challans.“Check the people moving around at the lake without masks and they will say masks come in the way of fresh air. Some even say that while exercising, their masks fell off,” said a police official posted at the lake. The IT Park police station has registered a maximum number of 64 FIRs against 66 people.“We are using all resources to enforce the wearing of masks. Even traffic policemen are issuing challans,” said Chandigarh Police public relations officer, DSP Charanjit Singh.INCREASE FINE AMOUNT: MARKET BODIESThe market associations of the city have asked their members not to allow anyone without a mask inside the markets, but only politely.“I have already told my staff not to sell anything to a mask-less customer. There is no need to argue, a polite refusal is enough,” said Tarsem Kumar, a wholesale karyana store owner in Sector 26.“The challans should be linked to Aadhaar cards to maintain a record and double the fine if anyone is caught again. Only then will the people learn,” he added. Balwinder Singh, president of the Sector 46 market welfare association, said, “It is mostly the youngsters who move without masks. And when caught, they offer only excuses.”Diwakar Sahoonja, president of the Sector 11 market welfare association, said “Just like sanitizers at entrance, shopkeepers should also keep masks and give them free to people coming to the market without one.”DON’T HESITATE TO CHECK PEOPLE WITHOUT MASKS: RWAAmarjeet Maken, former president of the Sector 47 RWA, said, “We do not allow anyone to enter our locality without a mask.”Colonel Kulwinder Singh, president of Sector 10 RWA, said, “People are lax and reluctant and will give you lame excuses for not wearing masks. If anyone is caught not wearing one, police should take them to the police station and let them pay fine there. Strict enforcement is the only way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/a-month-on-4-384-chandigarh-residents-challaned-for-not-wearing-masks/story-iqicOIalqC2t0T0ByPAeLP.html

Another order has been passed that notes that nurses should visit the office of the medical superintendent to prevent spread of coronavirus.This is the height of indiscrimination,” Satyaveer Dagur, president of one faction of the nurses’ union said.Shinder Pal Kaur Lidder, president of another faction, said that the recent orders by the administration will adversely affect the morale of the workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-2019-pay-hike-order-put-in-abeyance-pgimer-nurses-to-face-salary-cut/story-Gsqcq6w46i6WeCcpOUCtoO.html

Sidhu said that the civil hospital and the medical college under construction were located on the other side of the city, making it difficult for the senior citizens to access them.Phase 3B1, however, was the focal point of the city and was much easier to access. He said that the Mohali civil surgeon had been instructed that there should be no shortage of staff and the proposal for the posts to be created should be prepared and sent within two days.The health minister said that the covered area of the community health centre would be 40,000 square feet and a cost of ₹10 crore would be incurred on the upgrading work. Sidhu added that the entire focus of the government was on strengthening the infrastructure of the public healthcare sector.Sidhu said the Punjab cabinet had approved to fill about 4,000 posts in the health department and about 250 posts in the medical education and research department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/green-signal-to-upgrading-phase-3b1-primary-health-centre-into-community-health-centre-health-minister-balbir-singh-sidhu/story-IzxmIxW4f9J5PHmWOCdbDK.html
21-07-2020||City||1,415 patients recovered from Covid-19 in Mumbai daily this month, up from 803 in June||Along with the flattening of the Covid-19 infection curve, the city is also witnessing a rise in the number of recovered patients. On an average, 1,415 patients recovered daily between July 1 and July 19, compared to 803 during the same period in June, according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data. By June 30, the average number of patients who recovered daily stood at 903.Since the outbreak in March till June 1, 16,987 patients have recovered from the infection, which rose to 32,257 on June 19. While 15,270 patients recovered in the first 19 days of June, the number was 26,898 from July 1 to July 19.“This has been possible because of early diagnosis and timely treatment. Earlier, we noticed several delays in treatment, which led to health complications, resulting in higher fatality rate,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “Now, with the availability of more advanced and promising drugs, we have been able to send home patients who were earlier on ventilators.”The doubling rate has increased to 55 days in Mumbai. “In a pandemic, two things matter the most— the curve of the spread of the infection and recovery rate. We have been able to achieve both. Along with the flattening of the curve, almost 70% patients are getting recovered which is a promising sign,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, part of the Covid-19 state task force.As of July 19, the P-N ward, which covers Malad, has the highest number (2,030) of active Covid-19 cases. This is followed by the R-S ward which covers areas like Kandivli. The ward has 1,573 active patients. Borivli which comes under the R-C ward has the third highest number of active patients with a cumulative number of 1,486.“A pandemic doesn’t flatten everywhere at the same time. It spreads in a wave-like pattern, similar to that of an earthquake. It starts with its epicentre and gradually spreads. Within the next two weeks, the situation in these wards will also improve,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-415-patients-recovered-from-covid-19-in-mumbai-daily-this-month-up-from-803-in-june/story-OiV5XawZgCTIFm6rgXy4xM.html

Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Aswant Dhaliwal, the investigating officer, on Monday said they approached Proton Mail on July 10 to provide the IP (internet protocol) address from where an email by unidentified hacker was sent to the university informing them about the hacking.“We were anticipating help from the service provider, but to no avail. Since the server of Proton Mail is based in Switzerland and it does not operate from India, the company is legally not liable to share cyber details required by Indian investigating agencies,” said the DSP. He said the cyber team will now collect details from ‘dumps’ (digital data) from the university server to analyse who had accessed the question paper bank. The DSP said the digital examination may give a lead to the one compromised the servers. On July 8, the CUP found that its online examination system was accessed by hackers.A hacker had sent an email from Proton Mail, an end-to-end encrypted and a highly sophisticated cyber platform, to the vice-chancellor and some faculty members, where a link was given. Clicking on it gave access to all questions.V-C Prof RK Kohli said the server has been sealed for police probe. “We have constituted a team of technical experts, including two external members, to see where our online system lacked,” he said. Exams from July 24The V-C said examination for second-year students will restart from July 24 as the faculty members reworked on setting question papers.A section of students raised a voice against the online examination due to poor signal and other issues amid the pandemic outbreak.Kohli said the process to take test semester test for first-year students is being analysed. Though the online examination is optional, the varsity has resolved not to promote students on the basis of their previous year’s academic performance, he added. “Our priority is to equip the final-year students with their degrees so that they could decide their next plans without any delay. Of the second-year 484 students, 483 have opted to take the online test,” said the V-C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/question-bank-hacking-police-to-examine-varsity-server-as-swiss-service-provider-fails-to-respond-to-plaint/story-24Aum978QSr5n8EPAxw4fO.html

Fifteen of the crew members are from Vasai taluka. Nallasopara legislator KshitijThakur earlier wrote to external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on 20 June (a copy of the letter is with Hindustan Times) to make arrangements for the crew to fly back to India. “Some of the crew members stranded on the ship are from my constituency and hence I appealed to the Centre to help them,” said Thakur. The ship was anchored at Marseille,France, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the members contacted a man, Rosley Gonsalves, who worked on another cruise and returned to Vasai in January. Gonsalves then informed Thakur about the crew. “An arrangement is being made under the Vande Mataram Mission to bring them home. I want to thank CM Uddhav Thackeray who kept in touch with the external affairs ministry over the issue,” said Gonsalves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/200-stranded-indians-to-return-from-rome-today/story-UBmCVY97O94K8YMXY3k6VK.html

Therefore, it was decided to rope in an external agency. The appointment of an agency will be done through a tendering process, the GR added. A panel will be appointed which will carry out the tendering process.

The seven dera followers accused in the 2015 case involving the theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib had filed a petition in a Faridkot court. In the application, they said the chargesheet filed by the CBI in a Mohali court was sub judice and thus the probe conducted by the SIT as well as its the chargesheet are illegal.The SIT has claimed to have no information of any ongoing investigation in the sacrilege cases that were entrusted to it. “We have submitted the reply in the court. We are ready for the arguments,” said DIG Khatra. Judicial magistrate Chetan Sharma also extended the judicial custody of five accused dera followers till August 3. On July 4, the SIT arrested seven dera followers in the ‘bir’ theft case. But two of the accused, Sukjinder Singh and Shakti Singh, were released as they had already got bail from a Mohali court.

While a permanent employee’s kin will receive ₹10 lakh, the airline will pay ₹5 lakh to the family of fixed-term employees hired directly by Air India. The family of casual employees who worked for upto a year for the airline will receive ₹90,000.The airline, however, clarified that the ad- hoc payment is applicable from April this year to March 31, 2021, and that the employees hired by any contractor or service provider will be paid an amount equivalent to the gross emoluments of two months of salary drawn by them, provided they have worked for a minimum continuous period of one year.An internal letter (accessed by HT) to the executive directors of all the four regions (east, west, north and south) by the airline’s industrial relations department read, “In view of the prevalent Covid-19 outbreak, many employees are testing positive and some also succumbed to this pandemic. To safeguard the interest of the families, it had been decided to make an ad-hoc payment to the family/ legal heir of employees who die of Covid-19.”Officials from the airline refused to comment on the development when HT contacted them.According to airline sources, 16 Air India staffers died, while more than 200 employees, including 55 pilots, tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-rolls-out-compensation-package-for-kin-of-staffers-who-die-of-covid-19/story-C22FCbiLidcRJuB9uYd74M.html
21-07-2020||City||Students can give entrance test from home: TISS||The Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) tweaked its admission process for its bachelors courses, allowing candidates to take the exams from their locations. The institute announced that the Bachelors Admission Test (BAT) will be held between August 2 and 10. In view of the safety of the candidates, the institute has done away with the test centres. TISS is allowing candidates to take the exam from their homes on a device of their choice. Moreover, the exam duration has been halved, and the 40-mark descriptive exam (Part B) cancelled. Part B had earlier accounted for 40% weightage in the overall selection process.Instead, applicants will get 45 minutes to take a multiple-choice-question exam on general awareness, mathematics and English. There will be a total of 40 questions for 14, 14 and 12 marks for each of the subjects respectively. In the final selection, the BAT scores will carry a 70% weightage and the rest 30% weightage will be given to Class 12 marks.The decision was taken considering the safety of the prospective candidates amid the pandemic, said institute officials. “The exam will be through the remote proctoring method, where applicants can take the test from their homes. They can access the multiple-choice test on their phones or laptops. There will be no need for applicants to go to a test centre,” said PK Shajahan, dean, academics.The test will be a part of the selection process for 140 seats for bachelors courses across the five campuses of TISS.Earlier, the institute had restructured its admission process for Masters programmes by doing away with any physical visits by candidates to the campus. The institute had also done away with the pre-interview test (PIT) and candidates were interviewed online.The test had earlier been scheduled on April 25 at 25 cities across the country. However, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, the entrance exam had been deferred indefinitely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-can-give-entrance-test-from-home-tiss/story-4VNVZw4xjVDjmnkYzu6RAN.html

Officials from the education department did not respond to HT’s calls and messages on the issue. “When the lockdown began, the government announced the closure of coaching classes along with schools and colleges. We complied with the norms and closed the classes as a precautionary measure. But as the government plans to physically reopen schools in the coming months, it has not given any tentative dates for coaching classes,” said Sachin Karnavat, president, MCOA. Officials from the education department did not respond to HT’s calls and messages. Class owners also said they were struggling to teach students without proper information on the syllabus for the current academic year. “All the other boards have given clarity on what is omitted and what stays, except for the state government. Students and parents are already under stress and so if an announcement is made soon, it would benefit everyone,” added Karnavat. Several representatives of classes in the city said they had faced business losses by around 60-70% as many students who would have otherwise enrolled in the classes, have not been able to do so owing to financial problems at home due to the lockdown. “Those who are dependent on the classes for a livelihood, such as teachers, local vendors near classes, food stalls are also affected,” said Prajesh Trotsky, secretary, MCOA. MCOA has also written to the government, requesting a reduction in the 18% GST that coaching classes have to pay at the moment. “If this additional burden is reduced, we can further reduce the fees of students,” said Karnavat. Currently, most coaching classes are teaching students online and are providing e-learning content. Many have also started using several mobile applications to conduct tests online. They have, however, requested the government to allow them to open at least partially, as teaching complex subjects such as physics and mathematics is becoming a challenge in an online-only mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/need-clarity-on-reopening-classes-maharashtra-s-coaching-class-owners-tell-government/story-oNRDRZY9m1ZwmqtibzbybJ.html

The report also stated that 62% flights were cancelled owing to commercial reasons (low passenger load and clubbing of two flights). DGCA however, does not put the total number of complaints received from passengers, in public domain.Of all the Indian air carriers, the most passenger complaints in June were against Air India, followed by TruJet and SpiceJet. HT tried to contact the three airlines, but none of them responded to the queries on the report.“It is an unfair business practice to not refund passengers for cancellations owing to unavoidable circumstances, amid the Covid-19 restrictions,” said Vipul Saxena, former pilot and aviation expert, adding that DGCA should extend its refund order, as air travel in Unlock-2 is a non-essential sector and airlines are being allowed to operate only in restricted mode.According to industry experts, travel is expected to return to normalcy only by the year-end.“Airlines refused to refund passengers for their booked tickets, and instead converted them as open tickets that can be used for travel till March 2021. Despite airlines offering schemes to attract passengers, the demand has been low, as only stranded passengers may want to travel,” said a senior official from the commercial department of an airline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/79-plaints-in-june-from-fliers-over-refund-dgca/story-u0WrAIvWivAdKpJEJy0YsN.html

An application seeking Baljit’s arrest in the FIR number 192 registered in 2015 in the Kotkapura firing was filed in the court of duty magistrate Ekta Uppal, who has listed the matter for Tuesday.The SIT had summoned Baljit for questioning on a couple of occasions but he had failed to appear. Fearing arrest, he had moved an anticipatory bail petition in the district and sessions court last week but it was dismissed.Officials said they have moved the court for arrest warrants of Baljit as he played a key role in the Kotkapura conspiracy and now he is evading the SIT. Also, Baljit was named as an accused in another FIR (number 129) registered in 2018 in connection with the Kotkapura firing episode but was granted bail in the case. The case was registered on August 7, 2018, under Sections 307, 323, 341 of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act against unidentified cops. Later, the SIT added more sections to the FIR.SIT gets ex-SHO’s production warrantOn an application of SIT, the court of judicial magistrate Chetan Sharma on Monday granted production warrant of then Kotkapura station house officer (SHO) Gurdeep Singh Pandher in the Behbal Kalan firing case.

In this period, the city’s total case count rose from 65,265 to 1,01,224.BMC on June 22 launched a campaign Mission Zero, in five of these suburbs (barring Andheri) to bring down the number of cases. The ward-wise figures are available for 33,520 of the 35,959 cases. Andheri that comes under K-East and K-West ward reported 4,133 cases, followed by Malad (P-North ward) reporting 2,734 cases. Borivli that comes under R-Central ward reported 2,544 cases, Bhandup that comes under S ward reported 2,398 cases, Mulund that comes under T ward reported 2,359 cases. Kandivli that is under R-South ward reported 2,104 cases. Dahisar and parts of Borivli, which were part of the Mission Zero campaign and fall under R-North ward, recorded fewer cases at 1,104.BMC officials believe that the rise in numbers is owing to the aggressive testing, including the use of rapid antigen kits. Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner of zone 7 that covers Dahisar, Borivli and Kandivli, said, “ We have screened over 30,000 people in the past one month as part of Mission Zero. We are using antigen kits that have helped increase our testing numbers. Also, the base total number of cases here is lower than other areas.’’Sandhya Nandekar, assistant municipal commissioner of Dahisar, said they recorded over 1,100 cases over one month, the most coming from high-rises. “Our testing has increased. We are testing around 100-150 samples daily, excluding the samples being tested in private labs, compared to 30-50 samples earlier,’’ she said.Vinod Mishra, BJP corporator from P-North ward that covers Malad, said, “BMC has focused and screened over 50,000 people. The count in terms of positive cases has gone up owing to the aggressive screening. However, if you see the data of the past one week, the cases are going down.”BMC data also shows that earlier Covid-19 hot spots are now reporting fewer cases. For example, Worli and Prabhadevi, part of G-South ward, reported 1,381 cases, G-North ward that covers Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim reported 1,658 cases. M-East and M-West ward that cover areas like Chembur, Govandi and Mankhurd also reported 849 and 736 cases, respectively. In L ward covering Kurla, 1,029 cases were reported, while E ward covering Byculla, Mumbai Central and Mazgaon reported 512 cases.Experts said BMC must release ward-wise testing data on the lines of ward-wise cases and deaths. Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant, said, “We know where maximum cases are being reported in the last one month, but BMC should also release the data on ward- or area-wise testing. This will help us analyse if the number of tests is sufficient and why a particular area is seeing a spike or otherwise.’’Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, however, said it is not possible to keep a tab on ward-wise testing, as it would have to include data from private labs. “The mechanism can be developed by asking patients to give their pin codes for private lab tests, but not everyone knows their pin code. We have had many cases where people have given false addresses. However, to analyse the testing trends, we are going to keep a tab on the areas when it comes to usage of rapid antigen kits. We are currently testing around 600-700 samples using these kits, but we are scaling up it to 1,500 to 2,00 tests that will help us analyse better.”Meanwhile, on Monday, Mumbai recorded 1,035 fresh cases followed by 41 new deaths, taking the city’s case tally to 102,423 and toll to 5,755. The number of discharged patients is 72,648, with a recovery rate of 70%, and the total number of active cases is 23,728. The fatality rate in the city as of Monday was 5.61% and doubling rate stands at 57 days. Dharavi, one of the critical hot spots in Mumbai that has seen improvement in the past three weeks, reported 12 new cases on Monday, taking the total count to 2,492.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/16-272-of-36k-covid-19-cases-from-6-suburbs-in-mumbai/story-0dtH5QjvqF47vPES2IVLhK.html
21-07-2020||City||Malls petition Maharashtra government, say they should be allowed to reopen||Promising to keep numbers under control and enforce social distancing, mall owners have approached the Maharashtra government, asking that they be allowed to reopen their establishments. Malls, along with theatres, schools, event halls and other places of indoor public gathering, have been shut for going on four months, amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“Our industry has suffered estimated losses of over ₹100,000 crore so far, and it is time to reopen,” said Amitabh Taneja, chairperson of the Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI). “Earlier, these were hang-out and indulgence spots. Now it will be about making products available to people in real time. That’s it,” Taneja added.The SCAI is petitioning for food courts — the biggest revenue earners for most malls — to be allowed to open to a capacity of up to 50%.“There will be QR codes for every food outlet. People can scan the code, view menus and place orders online. And go to the counter only to pick up their order,” said Manoj Agarwal, CEO of Viviana Mall in Thane.In its detailed report on the rest of the standard operating procedure (SOP) that malls would follow, the SCAI said only one person per 75 sq ft would be allowed in; all visitors would enter through sanitiser tunnels; floor markers would ensure distancing; only digital payments would be accepted; and foot traffic within would be rerouted so it was all unidirectional, to minimise the chances of accidental contact.“Children under 10, people over 65 and pregnant women are requested to not visit until a vaccine is available,” said Mukesh Kumar, chairperson of the SCAI SOP Committee and CEO of Infiniti Malls.The SCAI undertaking and appeal have been submitted to state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, son of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, as well as to the state labour and industries departments.“The state is yet to consider the demand,” said principal secretary Valsa Nair Singh.Brihanmumbai municipal commissioner IS Chahal added: “We will allow reopening of malls and gyms only after the situation in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region improves and is similar to Mumbai’s situation today.”RISK FACTORSThe risk, in a mall or any such establishment, comes from the fact that large gatherings of people, coupled with enclosed spaces, air-conditioning and the resultant poor ventilation, have been shown to hasten the spread of the novel coronavirus. People contract it, and then also return to their neighbourhoods, where they may spread it.“Controlling the quality of air in a closed space is very difficult. With several smooth surfaces around, one will be at constant risk of inviting the virus,” says Sandeep Patil, chief intensivist and physician at Fortis Hospital, Kalyan, a Covid testing centre. The SCAI is arguing that given the risk to jobs and sustainability, opening up the malls within the restrictions of the SOPs would be justified, especially since markets and standalone shops across the state, including those selling non-essential items, have long since opened up. Agarwal added that over 400 malls have reopened in other parts of the country and “there isn’t anything adverse happening as a result”. “In case of any suspicion that a person at a mall is infected with Covid-19,” he said, “there will be two isolation spaces and a pandemic response team trained to act as per the government’s guidelines for suspected cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/malls-petition-maharashtra-government-say-they-should-be-allowed-to-reopen/story-czIYpf8aKEq51AnwRtEJSO.html
21-07-2020||Chandigarh||COVID-19 VICTIMS’ BODY SWAP: HC issues notice to govt as Hoshiarpur man’s sons say their father is still alive||Two day after bodies of Covid-19 victims got swapped at Amritsar’s Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), the Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday issued a notice to the Punjab government seeking a detailed reply on Wednesday, observing that “the matter not only exhibit sheer negligence, but also causes apprehensions in the mind of kin of one of the deceased”.According to GMCH authorities, Pritam Singh, 93, of Tanda Ram Sahai village in of Hoshiarpur district, died of complications after he tested positive of Covid-19 at the hospital on July 17 night, but his family received mortal remains of a woman, identified as Padma, 37, of Amritsar. Padma’s kin, on the other hand, got Pritam’s body, which they cremated on July 18. Meanwhile, Pritam’s family returned Padma’s body and her kin performed her last rites on July 19. Following this, Pritam’s sons Gurcharanjit Singh and Dalbir Singh filed a writ petition through lawyers Rajiv Malhotra and Satinderdeep Singh Boparai in the Punjab and Haryana high court. Taking cognisance of the case, the court issued a notice of motion to the state asking it to verify the facts and file a detailed response on July 22. “The petitioners are hopeful that their father is still alive and even as per the standard operating procedure, before the cremation, the face of the deceased is required to be shown to the relatives. It has been stated that father of the petitioners is alive and still admitted as a Covid-19 patient at the GMCH,” reads the order. The petition reads the Pritam’s son Dalbir was also admitted to the hospital along with his father. As per the petition, on July 13, doctors informed Dalbir that his father expired two days back. He rushed to the ICU, where Pritam was admitted, just to find him alive. This issue was raised with the authorities, after which Dalbir was abruptly discharged from the hospital, the petition reads. On Saturday afternoon, Dalbir’s daughter received a call from the hospital that their father breathed his last on July 17 at 11pm, said the lawyer, referring the petition. The petitioners stated that there was considerable difference in the physical appearance of both the persons and family of the Amritsar woman must have noticed the difference. “The reasoning explains the apprehension of the petitioners as they fear that something wrong is going on behind the scene and it’s just not the case of exchange of dead bodies…. it is a matter of urgent nature and a committee should be formed to unearth the whole scam/racket going on under the garb of corona pandemic,” reads the petition.Seeking a criminal case against the erring officials, the petitioners also urged the court to form a commission to probe the lapses. A magisterial probe has already been ordered into the case. The GMCH officials have also written a letter to state medical education and research department for suspending four staff members of the hospital for negligence in handling the bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-victims-body-swap-hc-issues-notice-to-govt-as-hoshiarpur-man-s-sons-say-their-father-is-still-alive/story-yojfvlTCJWxaim5PTNKetK.html

The court directed the state to decipher the report and submit it in typed format on Wednesday, after which it will take up the hearing the next day.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice PV Tavade, while hearing the bail application of Bharadwaj through advocate Ragini Ahuja, was informed that the plea in the HC was pending since June 11, and as Bharadwaj is not in good health, the hearing of her bail application should be expedited.Complying with an earlier direction of the court, the state, through public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, submitted a report by the superintendent of the Byculla women’s jail on Bharadwaj’s health and the condition in the jails.After being unable to read the report, the bench directed the state to provide a legible copy, preferably in a typed form, for which Thakare sought a two-day time to comply. The court Thakare the two-day period and also directed the state to provide the copy to Bharadwaj’s advocates, as they did not receive the copy.In an earlier hearing, the NIA, which took over the investigations from Pune Police earlier this year, opposed Bharadwaj’s bail application, stating that she was suffering from the ailments mentioned in the application from the past 20 years, and was being provided the prescribed medication regularly. NIA submitted that Bharadwaj was using the directions of the Supreme Court to decongest jails to get bail, even though the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) did not have any provision for bail.Bharadwaj, along with 10 other activists, were arrested and kept behind bars for their alleged role in the Elgar Parishad conclave on December 31, 2017, which led to the Bhima Koregaon violence the next day, as well as and their alleged link with the banned CPI (Maoist) outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/submit-typed-report-on-bharadwaj-s-health-hc-to-state/story-wXBgHFPRrWnkt6Y3y2oWHN.html

21-07-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Respond to plea by Gonsalves, Teltumbde for Covid tests, HC asks state, NIA||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday asked the state and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to respond to a petition filed by activists Vernon Gonsalves and Dr Anand Teltumbde, seeking directions to the authorities to test them for Covid-19, as they were in close contact with Telugu poet Dr P Varavara Rao, who was tested positive for the virus last week.The three are booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention (UAP) Act for their alleged links with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) outfit and making inflammatory speeches at the Elgar Parishad conclave in Pune on December 31, 2017, leading to violence at Bhima Koregaon the next day.Gonsalves and Teltumbde are lodged in Taloja jail, while Rao, who was also in the same jail, is currently undergoing treatment at Nanavati Hospital. The two activists said that as they were in close touch with Rao while he was unwell in the jail, for their safety as well as for the safety of other inmates, they wanted to be tested for Covid-19.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice SP Tavade, while hearing the application of Gonsalves and Teltumbde, was informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai that the two were not seeking interim bail but only a limited plea of getting tested.The petition filed by the two through advocate Devyani Kulkarni said that as both the activists ail from various health issues and as they are senior citizens, they have an apprehension that they may have contracted the virus from Rao.Gonsalves helped Rao with his daily activities as the latter was turned quite feeble, while Teltumbde sought to be tested as he was in the same jail hospital where Rao was kept when the latter’s health condition deteriorated owing to comorbidities and electrolyte imbalance in body.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted that the government did not have any difficulty in granting the request of both the inmates, but it needs to follow the testing norms laid down by various court orders passed previously. He, however, sought time to take instructions in on the matter.While initially the bench remarked that the request of the two could be easily complied with, it sought to know if the duo would be willing to confine themselves in isolation units if their test reports came positive. However, as Kumbhakoni sought time to take instructions from the state, the court said it would not pass any orders and issued notices to the state and NIA to respond to the plea and posted the matter for hearing on Thursday. Gonsalves was arrested by Pune Police in August 2018, while Teltumbde was arrested in April this year. Nine other activists, including Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Shoma Sen, Surendra Gadling, Sudhir Dhawale and Gautam Navlakha are also booked in the same case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-respond-to-plea-by-gonsalves-teltumbde-for-covid-tests-hc-asks-state-nia/story-aeqWEAfF168Qx2uBka4MGM.html
21-07-2020||Chandigarh||Sonam Wangchuk holds ice stupa contest in Ladakh||Education reformist Sonam Wangchuk, who took it upon himself to reinvigorate the rapidly depleting glaciers in Ladakh by making ice stupas, in a Facebook on Monday announced that the ice stupa contest was held and its winners had been announced on Sunday. The event was delayed this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The annual ice stupa awards were organised in Tarchit village as it was one of the winners, he said.“Tarchit is a small village, 75 km from Leh in the Rong area on the Nyoma road. It is a beautiful village where some 30 families live in harmony with nature. This year the villagers built a huge ice stupa, an artificial baby glacier measuring 8.3 million litres of frozen winter water,” he said. “The winning team of the 2019-20 ice stupa competition is Igoo, who built a 8.5 million litre stupa, followed by Tarchit, who secured the second position and Phyang securing the third position by building a 6.5 million litres stupa,” Wangchuk posted. In 2017, ice stupas were only built by Phyang village. In 2018, 12 villages participated in the contest. This year,16 villages across Ladakh took part in the contest that was held for the second time this year. Every year, on the occasion of world water day, ice-stupa competition results are announced. However, this year, due to Covid-19, the event was delayed and the results were announced on Sunday in association with the villagers of Tarchit, he said. The top three stupas won a cash prize of Rs 5 lakh, three lakh and two lakh,respectively.“Stongdey village was also felicitated with Rs 1 lakh for their marvellous effort in building an ice stupa,” he posted on his wall. The preparation of the upcoming ice-stupa competition this winter has already started year, he said. Wangchuk came into the spotlight in 2009, when his story inspired Aamir Khan’s character Phunsukh Wangdu or Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Rancho) in the Rajkumar Hirani directed film ‘Three Idiots’. WHAT IS AN ICE STUPA?Ice Stupa is a form of glacier-grafting technique that creates artificial glaciers that are used for storing water in the form of conical ice heaps. During summer, when water is scarce, the ice stupa melts and the water is used to water crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sonam-wangchuk-holds-ice-stupa-contest-in-ladakh/story-IzRaBVN0zOi3DynpI0MqUN.html

The Panvel city Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will also install CCTVs on each floor of the 18-storey buildings to monitor those entering the premises.PCMC commissioner Sudhakar Deshmukh has constituted a seven-member committee to come up with ideas to upgrade security at the Indiabulls Covid-19 care centre (CCC) in Kongaon. The committee is chaired by Rama Bhosale, a college principal; a representative from Navi Mumbai police; an advocate; a women protection officer and three PCMC officials. On Thursday, a 25-year-old man had sexually assaulted a 40-year-old homemaker after entering her room.

21-07-2020||Chandigarh||How Himachal lost steam in battle against Covid-19||In the first one-and-a-half months of the Covid-19 outbreak, Himachal seemed to be doing better than other states, recording only around 40 cases, but the situation consistently went downhill from there.The first case was reported in the hill state on March 20 and the surge ceased on April 23. For the next 10 days, there were no cases and the state was on the verge of becoming Covid-free with only one patient in the hospital.Jubilant over the ‘short-term’ success, the government took a baleful but humanitarian decision to open the state borders for stranded residents. The entry gates to Himachal were chock-a-block as people returned in huge numbers. This, however, resulted in a second wave of spike in cases that hit the state on May 4. Since then there has been no let-up in the spurt.RETURNEES BRING SPIKE IN JUNETill May end, the situation seemed to be under control as only 290 new cases were added in a month, taking the state’s tally to 330. However, the state witnessed a spike as people continued to return from other states. In June, as many as 623 infections were reported in the state—an increase of almost 200% in a month. Most patients were the ones returning from Delhi and Mumbai. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had justified the government move stating, “We could not have left our people to their fate.” GOVT’S FLIP FLOPSGiven the surge in cases, the government again closed the state borders on June 23. The deputy commissioners were given the powers to take action as per requirement in their districts concerned. Entry to the state was allowed only in exceptional circumstances such as the death of a relative or medical emergency at home.During this time, the Centre was gearing up for Unlock 2.0. On June 29, the Centre issued new guidelines, asking the states to allow inter-state travel. Himachal asked the Union government for special permission to keep its borders closed, which was denied.Hence, not only were the state borders opened but the condition of institutional or home quarantine was also waived off for industrial workers, managers and project promoters. Industrialists were allowed to bring labour from anywhere by just registering on the government portal.MIGRANTS WORKERS RAISE THE BURDENWith the influx of industrial workers to Himachal in July, the state is witnessing another spike in infections. The Baddi-Barotilwala-Nalagarh (BBN) industrial belt in Solan district has emerged as a new Covid-19 hotspot. In July, Solan district alone had recorded 222 cases, which constitute over 36% of the total of cases in the state. Most people found positive are migrant labourers working in factories in BBN areas. Some migrant labourers who arrived to work in apple orchards have also tested positive.The state witnessed the steepest single-day spike on July 13, with a total of 78 cases. A record 69 cases were reported from BBN. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur also admitted that arrival of migrant labourers has led to a spurt in Covid-19 cases but the economic activities also need to be revived.QUARANTINE MUST FOR MIGRANT LABOURERSThakur said that given the surge in cases among industrial workers, the government has revised the guidelines and made institutional or home quarantine a must for the labourers coming from other states. “Now, quarantine is a must for industrial workers. Big industries will make arrangements for quarantine of their workers while smaller units may pool the facilities,” he said. For migrant labourers coming to work in orchards, the responsibility of quarantine lies with the owners. Covid-19 negative report has also been made mandatory for labourers entering the state. TOURISTS ALLOWED BUT WITH RESTRICTIONSThe state government has allowed tourists to enter the state but on the condition that they have a five-day hotel booking and a Covid-19 negative report, not older than 72 hours. However, there have been many instances where people entered the state without requisite documents.The chief minister said that for now there is no change in the guidelines for tourists. “The government has increased the vigil at the borders and people flouting the norms will be dealt with strictly,” he said. However, locals have been resenting the decision stating that allowing the tourists to visit the state may result in a bigger outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/how-himachal-lost-steam-in-battle-against-covid-19/story-UnkAnidSYmjNHZHzEh2FmI.html

21-07-2020||Lucknow||Vikas Dubey’s alleged financier arrested||Slain gangster Vikas Dubey’s alleged financier Jai Bajpai and an accomplice were arrested on Monday, the Kanpur police said. The arrests were made on charges of criminal conspiracy and helping Dubey in his nefarious design by providing him with cash and cartridges hours before the Bikru village ambush of July 3, in which eight police personnel were killed and seven others, including a civilian, left seriously injured, the police said in a statement issued here. Dubey, the prime accused in the ambush, was killed in a police encounter on July 10.A police probe revealed that Dubey had made a phone call to Bajpai on July 1. The next day, along with his aide Prashant Shukla alias Doublu, a resident of Kohna, Bajpai went to Bikru to hand over Rs 2 lakh cash and 25 cartridges of .32 bore revolvers to Dubey, the statement said.The police statement confirmed that Bajpai and Shukla were booked under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 395 (punishment for dacoity), 412 (dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of a dacoity) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment (CLA) Act read with section 120B (criminal conspiracy), IPC.A separate FIR under sections 29 and 30 of the Arms Act has also been registered against Bajpai for providing cartridges to Dubey illegally, the police statement said.Bajpai, however, claimed he was innocent and he was cooperating with the police. He told reporters he knew Vikas Dubey and had given him a loan of Rs 11 lakh, claiming that he hadn’t spoken to the gangster in the last three months.The police have also seized the licensed pistol and passport of Bajpai, an affluent businessman. Dubey had briefed Bajpai about his plan to launch an attack on the police party that had gone to the village to arrest him. He had also asked Bajpai to arrange at least three cars for him and his gang.Bajpai took three cars to pick up Dubey and his men and take them to safer places, but failed to do so due to intensive police patrolling, the statement said. On July 4, Bajpai left his cars, registered in names of other people, in Kakadeo area of Kanpur and went underground, a police official said.Soon after seizing the three vehicles, police raided the possible hideouts of Bajpai and nabbed him within hours, a senior official said on the condition of anonymity.Subsequently, he was handed over to the Special Task Force (STF) of the Uttar Pradesh police and taken to its headquarters in Lucknow, where he was kept in detention for 15 days, the official said.Bajpai was handed over to the Nazirabad police of Kanpur on Sunday and subsequently let off, another official said, adding that he was arrested again following frequent tweets and posts on social media platforms about his release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/vikas-dubey-s-alleged-financier-arrested/story-OO7b8UN9Xqkkfz3UuJHXCL.html
21-07-2020||City||Centre’s agri ordinances: Haryana farmers, arhtiyas take out tractor rallies||Hundreds of farmers took out tractor rallies in various parts of Haryana on Monday to protest against the agriculture-related ordinances, recently promulgated by the Union government. Protesting under the banner of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, farmers and arhtiyas took out district-level rallies on their tractors, bikes and cars and raised slogans against the Centre.Referring to the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, the protesters said these were “anti-farmer” ordinances that would allow big corporate houses to purchase the produce at their own prices.“These ordinances would allow private traders to purchase agriculture produce directly from farmers which would only end up benefitting big corporate houses owned by the likes of Ambani and Adani,” alleged BKU state president Gurnam Singh Chaduni, who was leading the protest in Kurukshetra.He said that the ordinance will end the competition in market, thus forcing the farmers to sell their produce to these private traders at their own prices, he alleged.The farmer leaders also alleged that the government wants to shut mandis and end the Minimum Support Price system and this will encourage black-marketing of food grains and essential items. They demanded the government to immediately withdraw the ordinances and ensure that all the crops of the farmers are purchased on the MSP.The farmer leaders threatened to intensify the agitation if the government fails to withdraw the ordinances. They have called a state-level Mahapanchayat on July 30 at Kaithal to decide the further course of action. SOCIAL DISTANCING GOES FOR TOSSSocial distancing took a backstage as the farmers came out in huge numbers at protest sites at Karnal, Kuruksehtra, Yamunanagar, Kaithal, Bhiwani, Hisar, Jind, Sirsa, Ambala and Fatehabad districts, even as the cops and administration officials remained mute spectators. The protests, however, remained peaceful as the farmers did not block rail or road traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-s-agri-ordinances-haryana-farmers-arhtiyas-take-out-tractor-rallies/story-aKAQmXS7yoVVn5moVClbpL.html
21-07-2020||Chandigarh||War of words between SMHS doctors, patients in Srinagar||With doctors facing the brunt of public anger due to lack of facilities at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital amid the Covid-19 pandemic in Kashmir, frontline health workers are blaming the administration for not doing enough to enhance infrastructure and manpower amid the lockdown period. However, many locals and experts have blamed the doctors’ ‘behaviour’ for the mess. Patients’ attendants beat up three resident doctors, including a woman, in different incidents last week at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh(SMHS) Hospital, one of the premier tertiary care hospitals in Kashmir. Two doctors were seriously injured in the assault. While one doctor suffered a cervical vertebra fracture, another reported shoulder dislocation. The beatings also led to seizures in one of the health workers. The hospital, earlier this month, had set aside four wards for people infected with the coronavirus after a surge in patients at Covid-19 designated hospitals in Kashmir. The assaults prompted the doctors to go on strike, which affected patient care for some time. The incidents and the subsequent strike triggered a debate and war of words between doctors and the common people on social media.‘WE ARE HELPLESS TOO’The doctors blamed the administration for not doing enough to mitigate the dismal scenario at hospitals.“This is the complete failure of the administration. They got three months to plan for Covid-19 response but nothing happened. People want us to provide them the best care but they don’t realise that we are as helpless as they are. When there is no infrastructure like oxygen ports and ventilators what will we do?” said a doctor, working in the casualty unit of the SMHS.Another doctor said the hospital was lacking essential staff like doctors, nurses and orderlies. “One nurse is catering to 50 patients while a nursing orderly has to take care of three wards at SMHS. We all are overburdened. Ideally, every ward should have four nurses and two nursing orderlies,” she said.The doctor said people get agitated when they don’t find oxygen and ventilators. “In wards, we only have oxygen ports for one-third beds while it should be available for each bed. We have 19 ventilators but require double the number. Monitors are also not available,” she said.In terms of security, the doctor says, the hospital is a mess: “The Covid wards are packed with not just patients but even suspected cases and their attendants. All of them are huddled there. A few days back, a Covid positive patient went out of the ward unnoticed and attended congregational Friday prayers and came back,” said the doctor.However, locals are pinning the blame on behaviour and carelessness of doctors. “Doctors, paramedics and hospital authorities deserve what they were given by attendants. My mother who tested Covid-19 negative died on Tuesday at SMHS ward 3, bed 17 because of doctors’ behaviour and carelessness,” Haroon Kar, a doctorate in English literature, said on Twitter.“She didn’t die of anything, she died of carelessness, she died of not having doctors and paramedics around and she died because of SMHS hospital,” Kar said. Doctors Association Kashmir president Nisar ul Hassan said that the overall environment at the SMHS was appalling.“I would not even like my dog to get treated in SMHS Hospital such is the environment there, not to talk of taking my father or mother there. One can’t sit in the casualty for more than 15-20 minutes. Patients go to the hospital with hope but they return dissatisfied,” he said.‘SENIOR DOCTORS NOT TAKING LEAD’He also blamed senior doctors for not taking the lead in patient care. “You have one doctor catering to 50 patients and that too a junior doctor. Emergencies are taken care of by trainees and postgraduates, they are students. Senior doctors who are supposed to be there, especially in emergency medicine, are found missing while junior doctors, being inexperienced, have attitude problems,” he said.He said patients get no dignity and respect at the hospital. “There is a lack of empathy and compassion from doctors or nurses toward the patient. The attendants do most jobs, which hospital authorities or hospital staff, have to do. What do you expect in such a scenario?” he said.Director Health Services Samir Mattoo refused to comment saying that it was the domain of Government Medical College, Srinagar. A call to principal GMC, Srinagar Saima Rashid did not elicit any response.Divisional Commissioner Kashmir, Pandurang K Pole also did not respond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/war-of-words-between-smhs-doctors-patients-in-srinagar/story-c9TJ6UaQGXzJUVq5HwStyH.html
21-07-2020||Chandigarh||Another plea in HC challenging social media gag in Haryana||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday issued notice to Haryana government on second plea filed challenging social media gag issued in different districts of Haryana.Earlier, a Sonepat administration order on banning social media news portals was challenged. The fresh petition has been filed by Samachar Express Broadcasting News Private Ltd, a Karnal-based social media news portal, challenging the July 10 order of the local administration.The court was told that a blanket ban on use of social media platform for circulation of news has been notified, ostensibly to prevent circulating incorrect or undesirable news or information concerning the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. “But it is violative of the Citizens Fundamental Right to Freedom of Expression. If the purpose behind passing of the impugned order had been to restrict circulation of fake, incorrect or otherwise undesirable news pertaining to the pandemic, the same could have been specified in the operative portion,” the court was told, adding that but an absolute bar has been imposed on any kind of news, even if not related to Covid-19 pandemic directly or indirectly.The court has issued notice for August 14 while allowing the petitioner firm to use the social media platform for disseminating information concerning any general developments. But on Covid-19, it said, information should be based on what is provided by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/another-plea-in-hc-challenging-social-media-gag-in-haryana/story-sHe8pmDDhxckL1tAUkaZSJ.html

The converted ambulances, which have dedicated drivers, will help transport mild, moderate, asymptomatic and severe Covid patients to Covid hospitals and quarantine centres.“There was a shortage of ambulances in Ulhasnagar. The 26 new ambulances will help bridge the gap. As per the directions from the Thane collector, we decided to transform school buses and private vehicles into ambulances as they are currently not functioning,” said Yuvraj Badhane, public relations officer, UMC. Earlier the civic body had only 12 ambulances for Covid patients.The Kalyan Regional Transport Authority transformed the buses and vehicles into ambulances which have ventilator support and oxygen facility.

21-07-2020||City||Scores from Maha turn up for ‘job interview’ at NMMC HQ||Hundreds of job aspirants from across the state assembled for job interview at the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s (NMMC) headquarters on Monday after being misled by a private website that had given wrong information. This comes amid loss of jobs in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown.NMMC health department had recently advertised 5,381 vacancies which included requirements for MD medicine, medical microbiologists, intensivists, junior medical officer, nurses, lab technicians, pharmacists, data entry operators among others. The candidates were asked to apply online on www.nmmc.gov.in, whereas a private website — mahasarkar.co.in — wrongly asked the candidates to go for “walk-in interview directly with bio-data and all academic certificates on July 20, 2020”.After a large number of youths assembled at NMMC headquarters with their degrees and certificates following information on the private website, they were refused entry to the building. However, this led to disappointment and anger among the candidates, most of whom wanted to apply for posts of data entry operators. Pandurang Dhane who had come from Dhulia said, “I have spent more than ₹4,000 to make it here on time and now they are saying that there is no interview. What do I do now?” Another aspirant, Akshay Gaikwad from Nasik, said, “I hired a private vehicle to come here for which I spent a lot of money. Why are we not being interviewed or even allowed entry?”As the crowd swelled, NMMC additional municipal commissioner Sujata Dhole came over and spoke to the candidates through a megaphone explaining that they had been misled. She also gave clarification about the job posting and the proper procedure.Dhole said, “The candidates were misled by a website — mahasarkar.co.in — which is not even an Indian website, let alone an official one. It is being run from the United States and they simply collect information and post on their site. The language used in the advertisement posted by the site is a mix of Hindi and Marathi, which is indicative that it is not an official advertisement. The site gave today’s date for interview.”She said, “We had advertised only on the official NMMC website. Our advertisement clearly stated that the applications have to be made online and that the candidates would be informed of the date and time for interview online and through SMS. There was no question of walk-in interview.”The additional municipal commissioner also explained the situation to the candidates. “While the deadline for applying is over, we have decided to accept online applications for data entry operators on Tuesday to give these candidates a chance,” she said.She has also appealed to the people to verify about job interviews and check if it is specifically mentioned on the NMMC website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/scores-from-maha-turn-up-for-job-interview-at-nmmc-hq/story-U1vW22jNlxr8WjETfrt97K.html

21-07-2020||Mumbai||HC freezes properties of man for failing to pay maintenance to wife, daughter||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday restrained a city businessman and his parents from creating any third-party rights in the movable or immovable properties held by them either independently or jointly, as he failed to clean the pending dues of interim maintenance to his estranged wife and minor daughter.The bench of justice Prasanna Varale and justice Milind Jadhav also directed the businessman, owner of an elevator manufacturing firm, to submit an inventory of all the movable and immovable properties belonging to him and his parents.The directives came on a petition filed by his wife complaining about non-compliance of an order passed by a metropolitan magistrate court on June 30, 2018 directing the businessman to pay monthly interim maintenance of ₹75,000 per month to his minor daughter and ₹1.50 lakh to his wife.The order was passed by the magistrate on a complaint lodged by the petitioner woman invoking provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.In the petition filed through advocate DP Singh, the woman complained that her husband had not complied with the magisterial order, and as of June 2020, he had not clears arrears of more than ₹44 lakh. Counsel for the petitioner, advocate Amogh Singh, on Friday pointed out that earlier on June 9, another division bench had directed the Andheri-based businessman to clear the arrears by the next date, but he has not complied with the order.The businessman responded to the petition by pointing out that he has already paid sum of ₹15 lakh to his wife, and he could not pay the balance amount as he himself was facing financial difficulties on account of partial closure of business due to Covid-19 lockdown. He also offered to deposit ₹5 lakh more in his wife’s bank account in a week.The offer, however, failed to impress the bench, which took note of the reference made by the woman to certain movable and immovable properties held by her husband and his parents in her application under provisions of the Act, and issued the restraining order.HC has also observed that the non-compliance on part of the businessman may amount to wilful breach of HC order, inviting action for contempt of the court, and has kept the issue pending for future consideration.The matter will now come up for further hearing after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-freezes-properties-of-man-for-failing-to-pay-maintenance-to-wife-daughter/story-gBwn5Zi25zpaSc1Cc0WK0H.html
21-07-2020||Mumbai||Cyber fraudster dupes sound designer of ₹5.99 lakh||A 69-year-old sound designer, Hitendra Ghosh, was recently duped by a cyber fraudster to the tune of ₹5.99 lakh. Following the incident, Ghosh lodged a complaint with Juhu police station, based on which a first information report (FIR) was filed against the unknown fraudster on July 15. Ghosh is a two-time national award winner for best audiography for Ek Pal (1985) and Game (2011). He also won a national award for best sound recording in 1978 for the movie Junoon.According to the statement, “During the coronavirus-induced lockdown, he wanted to transfer money from one account to another, but was unable to personally go to the bank. He then searched for the customer care number and called up the number on July 7. The person who answered his call introduced himself as Rahul Kumar working as a bank’s customer care executive.” A police officer said, “Ghosh shared all his bank account details with him, and later the accused asked him to share the CVV number of his debit card which he refused to share. After this, the accused made another attempt to dupe him and instructed him to download an application called AnyDesk.”Ghosh followed the instruction, thus giving the accused access to his device. Soon after that, he lost around ₹8 Lakh in a series of eight transactions worth ₹99,999, said officers.The sound engineer approached his bank and managed to recover ₹2 lakh while efforts are being made to recover the rest. Ghosh then approached Juhu police station and lodged a complaint. Pandharinath Wavhal, senior inspector, Juhu police station, said, “We have registered the offence against unknown cyber fraudster and are investigating the case.” The case has been registered under sections 419 (personation), 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 66(c) and 66(d) of the Information Technology Act. “We are advising everyone not to share bank account related details with any unknown caller or download any applications (which the caller instruct you to download) on your phone,” Wavhal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyber-fraudster-dupes-sound-designer-of-5-99-lakh/story-MLWjszy4eJ1bU4gaUlDVOM.html
21-07-2020||Mumbai||Loan waiver: ₹5,653 crore sent to 8.5L farmers in two weeks||More than three months after the process of farm loan waiver disbursement was paused owing to the cash-crunch in the wake of the lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, the state government disbursed ₹5,653 crore to about 8.5 lakh farmers in the past two weeks. The remaining 5.52 lakh eligible farmers are expected to get the amount over the next couple of weeks. Including the disbursement done earlier in February and March, the total disbursement has touched ₹17,646 crore covering 27.38 lakh farmers. Owing to the drop in revenue receipts, two schemes announced for farmers — one for those with pending loan of more than ₹2 lakh and another for those who pay loans regularly — have been put on hold. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government comprising the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress announced loan waiver to farmers with pending amount of less than ₹2 lakh in December. The disbursal for the same began in the last week of February after verification of loan accounts. The state government identified 32.9 lakh eligible farmers for the scheme with outstanding loans worth ₹21,467 crore. After the disbursal of ₹11,993 crore to about 19 lakh eligible farmers, the scheme was put on hold after the nationwide lockdown was announced in view of Covid-19, in March. However, as revenue receipts improved in June, the scheme was resumed and ₹5,653 crore has been disbursed since.“We are disbursing the loan waiver to all the remaining farmers so that they become eligible for fresh farm loans during the ongoing kharif season. We expect all remaining farmers to complete their authentication by visiting the local centres or banks in the next few days. The scheme has been implemented in record time after it was launched,” said Abha Shukla, principal secretary, cooperation department. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed all the district collectors to complete the disbursement at the earliest. State government had, on March 6, also announced a one-time settlement scheme for farmers who have pending loans of more than ₹2 lakh wherein it offered to pay ₹2 lakh once the remaining amount was repaid by farmers. In another scheme, the government had announced an incentive of up to ₹50,000 for farmers who are repaying loans regularly. Deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar had announced that the government may incur ₹15,000 crore more for the implementation of these two schemes. However, in the wake of revenue losses, these schemes have been put on hold. “The decision about their implementation is unlikely to be done anytime soon,” said an official from the finance department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/loan-waiver-5-653-crore-sent-to-8-5l-farmers-in-two-weeks/story-wpAVi4b3viv2z2PPo0LVUP.html
21-07-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand’s Covid curve takes a turn for the worse, active cases surpass recoveries||The dimension of Covid-19 pandemic has once again altered in Jharkhand, which, for the first time in more than a month, is witnessing a higher number of active infections than the recovered cases. On Monday, there were 2,889 active cases in the state compared with 2,835 people who have recovered.With 178 new cases reported during the day, the tally has now gone up to 5,777, according to a government bulletin. The higher number of active cases comes at the time when in some states, the recovery count is more than the count of active cases. For instance, in Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, those recovering from Covid-19 are more than those testing positive. On June 14, Jharkhand had 900 active cases and 816 recoveries. However, the very next day the active cases went down to 848 while recoveries climbed to 905.Since then, the state had maintained the same status--recoveries being higher than active cases-- till July 17. On July 2, the state had the maximum gap between the recovery count (1,988 cases) and active cases (582).However, the steep surge in cases in July has swelled up the tally of active cases. During this period, the daily discharge of patients after they recovered remained less than the daily detection of cases. This resulted in the narrowing of gap between the total recovery count and active case count.The rate of recovery then started declining and came down to 49.32% on July 18 from its peak of 76.90% on July 2.On July 18, the state had again seen a reversal when the active cases (2,681) were more than the recoveries (2,656).According to the health department’s bulletin issued on July 19, Jharkhand has a total of 5,552 cases, including 2785 active cases, 2718 recoveries and 49 deaths.Health experts, however, opine that the increased testing in the state is the real cause of such reversal. “The three T formula (Tracing, Testing and Treating) is the only solution to contain the spread of the pandemic. Acting on this, the state has increased its testing capacity by setting up new laboratories and diagnostic machines. We are now testing an average of 5,000 samples daily,” said Praveen Karn, state epidemiologist.He added, “The more you test, the more cases will be reported. The rise in active cases is, therefore, obvious. But, on the other hand, an infected Covid-19 patient requires at least 14 days for recovery. So, the pace of recovery can’t be increased as it is time-bound.”The state has ramped up sampling and testing in the last 15 days. The average daily testing of samples has been raised to 5,000 from 2,500 during this period. On July 16, 17, and 18, over 6,000 samples were tested per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-s-covid-curve-takes-a-turn-for-the-worse-active-cases-surpass-recoveries/story-cxVRZqb0fUZ1ktlHMAGZTO.html
21-07-2020||Mumbai||Woman’s body found inside drum in Palghar house||The decomposed body of a 20-year-old woman was found inside a plastic drum in a home in Palghar’s Boisar, around 117km from Mumbai, police said on Monday.The police have registered a case of murder against four people — the victim’s husband and her three in-laws — who are in Bihar. The police suspect Bulbul Jha was murdered as she refused to take back a complaint she had filed against her husband and that the murder is likely to have taken place in February 2019.According to the Boisar MIDC police, room number 26 in Ganesh Nagar chawl was locked since February 2019 after its tenants — Pawan Jha,50; Bachudevi,45; their son Deepak, 25 and his wife Bulbul — apparently left for their home in Bihar and told the landlord, Lokesh Jain, 34, not to give the room on rent to anyone else. They continued to pay a monthly rent of ₹4,000 online through Pawan’s daughter, Nitu Mukesh Thakur, 30, till February this year, after which Jain tried contacting them. After getting no response, he decided to break the lock on Sunday evening and throw out the family’s belongings to make way for a new tenant, which is when he found the body inside a 200L drum kept in the loft above the house’s toilet.“After Jain informed us, we went to the spot, recovered the body and sent it for a DNA analysis to Kalina laboratory. We have registered a case of murder against four [Pawan, Bachudevi, Deepak and Nitu] and have sent a team to Bihar to catch them,” said Pradip Kasbe, inspector, Boisar MIDC police. The police said they identified the body as Bulbul’s after preliminary investigations on the basis of the ornaments and clothes found on the body and that only Pawan, Bachudevi and Deepak were seen leaving the room in February last year.According to Kasbe, the Jhas had been living there since 2015 before they left in February 2019. “From March 2020, Jain had stopped receiving the rent and whenever Jain called Pawan or Nitu, there was no response, so he found another tenant and on July 19, he decided to break the lock and throw out the Jhas’s belongings, which is when the body was found,” said Kasbe, adding that the neighbours said they did not get any foul smell from the room.“In February 2019, Deepak set Bulbul on fire and she sustained burn injuries. He was arrested and later released on bail. Deepak wanted Bulbul to withdraw the complaint, which she refused to. It is possible that Deepak murdered Bulbul and fled,” said Kasbe, adding that Pawan and Deepak would work at various industrial units in Boisar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/woman-s-body-found-inside-drum-in-palghar-house/story-oLkNHEudwnWrMAv2OU1OwI.html
21-07-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 tally up to 318,695: Has community spread begun in Maha?||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case count on Monday reached 318,695 after 8,240 new cases were reported, even as an official opined that the state could have already entered the community transmission stage — when the source of infection is not known.However, Maharashtra’s health minister Rajesh Tope denied community transmission has started. “We have been able to trace all contacts so far and also ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] has not said anything on that, as of now. Let them say, then we will look into it,” he said. Earlier in the day, Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading the communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state , felt that community transmission has started in Maharashtra. “Community transmission has started, especially in cities like Mumbai and Pune. Earlier, we used to trace some connection for a Covid-19 infection, like travel history of a patient or someone who came in contact with those having travel history, but now the situation has changed. The people found infected have no such connections. We will have to admit that it [Covid-19] has spread into to the community,” said Dr Salunkhe.Later, Salunkhe said he commented about community transmission going by their own definition as all sources of infection are local now. “There is no outside source left for infections. All the sources of infections are local now,” Salunkhe said.Monday was the fifth day the state recorded over 8,000 cases in a day, including its highest single-day spike of 9,518 on Sunday. Two days after Mumbai crossed the 1 lakh cases mark, the rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) crossed the same to touch 100,847 infections. As of Monday, the state has 131,334 active cases, the health department said. With over 9,000 cases in a day, questions are being raised if community transmission has started in the state as the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Saturday said that the exponential growth in cases showed that the country has reached community transmission stage.Maharashtra crossed the grim milestone of 3 lakh cases in 19 weeks (on July 18) since the first Covid-19 case was reported on March 9.Meanwhile, the death toll of the state also crossed 12,000 after 176 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. Death count stands at 12,030, according to state health department data. The highest toll in a day was reported on July 4 with 295 cases. Mumbai has maintained its stability with respect to number of fresh cases with 1,035 new infections reported on Monday. Its case count stands at 102,423. Of them, active cases are 23,728.On June 27, Mumbai reported its highest single-day spike of 2,077 cases. In July, the highest single- day spike in the city was recorded at 1,552 on July 2.The city’s toll stands at 5,755 after 41 deaths were reported in a day.Maharashtra crossed the 3 lakh mark within 14 days after it breached 2 lakh on July 4. It took the state 96 days to cross 1 lakh cases on June 12 and 22 days to cross the 2 lakh mark. Going by statistics, Maharashtra has recorded 143,936 cases in 20 days of this month as against 302 cases in March, 10,196 in April, 57,157 in May and 102,172 cases in June. On an average, it comes to 7,196 cases a day.With over 318,695 cases, Maharashtra, if it were a country, would have joined a list of 10 countries having over 3 lakh cases. In the index, Maharashtra would have been at 9th position as it has surpassed Spain, which has 307,335 Covid-19 cases, as per data available at worldometers.info.To deal with surge in cases, the state government has decided to augment health infrastructure in each and every district. It has developed field hospitals in Mumbai and similar field hospitals are now coming up in other eight satellite cities — Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Mira-Bhayander, Ulhasnagar, Panvel, Vasai-Virar and Bhiwandi-Nizampur — of the MMR.But a major problem the state is facing is shortage of health staff, which includes doctors, nurses, paramedical staff etc. The issue was discussed in a meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to review the Covid situation in the state on Saturday. The officials informed that they are facing a serious problem of health staff, including doctors. “With rising cases in small cities and rural areas, the chief minister was told that the health infrastructure there needed to be augmented, but the actual problem is availability of health staff. The infrastructure can be developed but from where do we get health staff, including doctors, is a major problem,” said a senior official, who had attended the meet.Dr Salunkhe said availability of health staff is a major issue before the state. “To deal with this, we will have to rope in private doctors, all doctors other than allopathy and NGOs, as almost 85% Covid-19patients are asymptomatic and don’t need doctors, but need health staff to be taken care of,” he said.The number of cases in 19 cities that were declared as red zone reached 250,075 on July 20 against 67,885 cases on June 3 when the state decided to relax lockdown restrictions in these red zones, comprising nine cities of MMR, Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Malegaon, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur.However, their contribution in total cases has reduced to 78.46% from 90.68% on June 3, which indicates surge in cases in areas other than red zones. Along with spike in cases, the state is also facing a large number of deaths on a daily basis. In the last 20 days (since July 1), it has recorded 4,024 Covid-19 casualties.With 12,030 deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded as 3.77% on Monday. It continued to be the second highest in the country after Gujarat where CFR is 4.43% with 2,142 deaths (48,355 cases) till Sunday, according to statistics shared by the state medical education department.Maharashtra still has highest number of deaths across states in the country.Its positive rate against total number of tests is also increasing. On Monday, it recorded 19.91% against 15.05% on June 3. So far, the state has tested over 16 lakh people (1,600,667 tests), of which, 12,81,972 tested negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-tally-up-to-318-695-has-community-spread-begun-in-maha/story-4JLz9rgrXTgh3Uzp1BOYGM.html
21-07-2020||Chandigarh||MC exploring plan to auction dhobi ghats||If the municipal corporation has its way the dhobi ghats (enclosures for washermen) in the city will soon be auctioned.A committee constituted to generate revenues from dhobi ghats on Monday approved open and e-auctions for the sites. The issue will now be tabled in the MC’s general house meeting for its approval.“The members suggested that dhobi ghats in various sectors should be provided with modern facilities and latest technologies. We are also looking at offering them bids through open auction or e-tendering subject to the house’s approval,” said Shakti Parkash Devshali, committee chairman and BJP councillor.The ghats were transferred to the civic body from the UT administration in 2005. A monthly rent was paid to the administration earlier, but the MC failed to collect rent from the ghats which are at present run by private societies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-exploring-plan-to-auction-dhobi-ghats/story-0Xd43Gfw9z1465FSGJI5jK.html
21-07-2020||Delhi||Moderate rain warning for Delhi||Some parts of Delhi received light rain on Monday, but meteorological conditions are favourable for moderate to heavy rain according to the Regional Meteorological Centre, Delhi.Safdarjung and Lodhi Road received “trace” rain on Monday afternoon, while Ridge and Palam received 0.4mm rain. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday morning said a cluster of convective clouds was approaching Delhi from the west and north-west directions. “Moderate rain/thundershowers with some intense spells is likely to begin over Delhi...” an IMD statement read.“The monsoon trough is passing very close to Delhi and for the next couple of days it’s likely to oscillate in the region. We are expecting moderate to heavy rain late Monday night or early Tuesday morning and later again on Tuesday. The monsoon trough is passing along Amritsar, Ludhiana, Meerut, Gorakhpur, Bhagalpur and the Himalayan foothills in the east. Because the western side of the trough is likely to oscillate around the region, Delhi may get light rain for a few days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre. There could be traffic disruption and waterlogging in low-lying areas on Monday and Tuesday, the Regional Meteorological Centre said.Some parts of Delhi received spells of “heavy” monsoon showers for around three hours early Sunday morning. Safdarjung, Delhi Ridge and Lodhi Road recorded 74.8mm; 86mm and 81.2mm of rain respectively. Safdarjung recorded the highest rain in a day for July since 2015.“The reason for this heavy spell on Sunday is that the monsoon trough is just north of Delhi. Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh have also received widespread rain. This kind of rain is likely to occur again and again until July 21,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.Delhi has had a rain deficiency of 55% since June 1 as on Saturday, which reduced to 43% on Monday following the heavy showers on Sunday.The western part of the monsoon trough is north of its normal position, and the eastern part is along the foothills of the Himalayas. In addition, the convergence of moist southerly/southwesterly winds from Bay of Bengal over the north-east and the adjoining east of India and from the Arabian Sea over the north-west of India at lower tropospheric levels will continue for the next two or three days, IMD said in its Monday bulletin.Under the influence of these meteorological conditions, widespread and extremely heavy rain is likely over Bihar, the sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura in the next four or five days.Widespread and very heavy rain is likely over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in the next two days, the IMD bulletin said.The Brahmaputra is in the ‘severe to above normal’ flood situation all along its course from Dibrugarh to Dhubri. Downstream of Tezpur, the river has started rising in Guwahati. Due to forecasted rainfall, there is a likelihood of ‘Severe to Extreme Flood Situation’ in main Brahmaputra from Dibrugarh to Dhubri districts, the Central Water Commission warned on Sunday. On Sunday, 27 stations (13 in Bihar, 11 in Assam, 2 in Uttar Pradesh and 1 in West Bengal) are flowing in ‘Severe Flood Situation’. Severe flood is declared when the water level is touching or exceeding the danger level but is below the highest flood level (HFL).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/moderate-rain-warning-for-delhi/story-2ySCW0gxO8FN3ZQ72AbDWO.html
21-07-2020||Gurugram||Government colleges in Gurugram await clarity on admissions||Government colleges in the district are yet to receive any guidelines on the admission process for undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) courses for the next academic session, although according to officials of the higher education department, the admission process, which has been delayed this year due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, might start by the first week of August.While the city-based Gurugram University and some private universities have initiated their admission process last week, state government colleges said that they were still awaiting guidelines to be issued by the department of higher education and are receiving inquiries from anxious students who are slated to take admissions this year. The admission process to colleges usually starts in June every year with classes beginning in August. Centralised admissions for colleges across the state are regulated by the department of higher education. There are seven government colleges in the district in addition to Gurugram University that offer both UG and PG courses. Pooja Khullar, principal, Dronacharya Government College, said that the college was awaiting directions from the directorate of education regarding the admissions process. “There has been no update on the admission front so far but we are expecting the admission portal to be open within the next few weeks. We have been receiving many calls from parents and students who wish to apply since the admission process in other universities and some private colleges have already started,” said Khullar. She said that the college had written to the higher education department, seeking guidelines on the admission process but had not received any response so far. Vijay Adlakha, principal of Government Girls College, Sector 14, said that initially, the plan was to begin registration of students from July 16 but the process has been delayed. “I have been receiving a lot of queries from students inquiring about the admission process. We share whatever information we can to the best of our knowledge. We expect the admission process to start soon,” said Adlakha.Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that one of the factors behind the delay in the admission process was the ambiguity surrounding the terminal examinations of students in the final year. “The UGC has said that examinations need to be conducted for final-year students. These exams need to be conducted by September as mandated by the UGC. We expect the admission process to conclude by then. The admission portal, however, will stay open for at least a month and students will have sufficient time to apply. They need not worry,” said Yadav.Hemant Verma, deputy director, higher education department, said that the admission process this year has been delayed this year due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.“The admission process is yet to start for this year. Due to Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdown, the admission cycle got delayed this year. Colleges are shut and results are also yet to be declared. We don’t want students to come out of their homes yet. However, we are hoping to start the admission process by the first week of August,” said VermaFor several college aspirants, however, the uncertainty surrounding the process is proving to be worrisome. Kajal, who recently graduated high school, said that the uncertainty surrounding the admission process was worrying for prospective applicants like her. “Other colleges and universities have started their admission process whereas there is no update about government colleges in the city. I am not sure if I should apply elsewhere or wait for the admission process to start. Applying to multiple colleges as a safety net is also not feasible. Most colleges have a registration fee ranging from ₹500-₹1,000,” said Kajal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/government-colleges-in-gurugram-await-clarity-on-admissions/story-YHZ7eLUAqRB6vhLJSSvCmN.html
21-07-2020||Gurugram||Sero survey: 1,544 tested, 180 found with Covid-19 antibodies in Haryana||In Haryana, out of the 1,544 people covered under the ongoing serological survey to detect the prevalence of Covid-19 infection across five districts, at least 180 people have been found to have developed antibodies. The five districts covered by the survey include Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat, Ambala and Panchkula. At least one-third or 60 cases were reported from Sonepat — the highest among the five districts. The data shared by the health department shows that at least 12% of the people covered by the survey had developed antibodies. The first round of serological survey started in late June across the five districts. A serological survey is an epidemiological tool that helps in detecting unreported or past cases of Covid-19 and in understanding the prevalence of the disease in communities. In the survey, blood samples are randomly collected from various high-risk population groups — based on the categories identified by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) — to look for antibodies against Covid-19. Antibodies are generated in the body as an immune response to fight against the infection and provides protection against contracting the same infectious disease again.The serological test is not prescribed to diagnose active Covid-19 infections as it takes one to three weeks for the body to develop antibodies after getting infected. Studies are ongoing to ascertain if people who recover from the infection can get infected again.The serological survey showed that the maximum number of positives for Covid-19 antibodies were traced in Sonepat. Out of 350 blood samples collected, 60 were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. A maximum number of 454 antibody tests were done in Gurugram, out of which 56 were confirmed positive Covid-19 antibodies. Likewise, in Faridabad 209 tests were conducted with 28 people testing positive. In Ambala, 176 people were covered under the survey, out of which 27 were found to be positive. Panchkula reported the least number of positive cases. Out of 355 tests conducted, nine were found to be positive for Covid-19 antibodies.“The serological survey is a surveillance mechanism to estimate how much of the population has been infected over time. People might have been asymptomatic, without showing any signs or symptoms, and did not get tested as a result. They develop immunity against the infection. Such people are covered under the serological antibody tests that help in figuring out the incidence of infection,” said a senior state health official of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). Under the survey, people who have a higher exposure to contract the coronavirus are covered. It includes population groups, such as shopkeepers, drivers, police personnel, health workers, pregnant women among others, as directed by the ICMR guidelines.According to the official, the remaining 17 districts will be now be covered under the serological survey, where districts will have to conduct at least 400 antibody tests each month. “About 1,800 IgG Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Elisa) kits have been provided to all the districts, including the five districts earlier covered in the serological survey, to conduct 400-600 tests every month,” said the official.“In Gurugram, the next round of serological survey with a larger sample size is likely to start from next month,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), adding that the plan is being prepared. It is likely that the district health department will take the assistance of a private healthcare company to conduct at least 1,800 antibody tests in the city to be conducted over the next four to five months. Despite repeated attempts, Dr B K Rajora, chief medical officer, Sonepat, could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sero-survey-1-544-tested-180-found-with-covid-19-antibodies-in-haryana/story-k7DUZ8WH4jYqAzCsUmXkEJ.html
21-07-2020||City||G Noida: Wife among 5 held for man’s murder||Noida: Two days after a 27-year-old man was found dead in Rabupura, the police on Monday arrested five people, including his wife and brother-in-law, for allegedly plotting the murder to acquire his property.The deceased, Deepak, was a resident of Faleda village, the police said. His body was found near a stream outside the village on July 18. According to the police, the deceased’s wife was the one who had approached the police, after which an FIR under Section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code was lodged at Rabupura police station.The police said that Deepak, who had inherited around 18 bighas of land, had a turbulent relationship with his wife. His parents had died earlier, while his only sibling, a sister, was married to Balbir Singh, 32, in adjoining Bulandshahr district.“Deepak and his wife had a troubled relationship and could not have a child after four years of their marriage. He would often get drunk and beat his wife. She had narrated her ordeal to brother-in-law Balbir and they had also got into a relationship,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida.“During the probe, Balbir was questioned by the police and he confessed to plotting Deepak’s murder with the wife. He had got Deepak drunk on the evening of July 17 during their meeting in Rabupura town and had hired three of his known men to kill him,” Pandey added.Three other men hired by Balbir for the crime have been identified as Monu Sharma, Naresh Kumar and Gullu, all residents of Bulandshahr. The men were promised a bounty of Rs 1 lakh each to kill Deepak, of which Rs 60,000 each was paid in advance by Balbir, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/g-noida-wife-among-5-held-for-man-s-murder/story-YvgSOb80ZS0dtkaxCjrFfK.html
21-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Woman falls to death from fifth floor, kin point murder finger at partner||A 25-year-old woman, who formerly worked as a cabin crew member with an international airlines, allegedly fell to her death from the fifth floor of a condominium in sector 67 on Sunday night. Police have booked a man, who was allegedly in a relationship with her, on charges of abetment to suicide after the victim’s sister alleged ‘foul play’ and said that she had a ‘strong suspicion that her sister was murdered’.According to the police, the woman and her partner had gone to a common friend’s house in the condominium for a get-together at 4pm. In the police complaint, the victim’s sister said that the woman had been in a relationship with the 26-year-old man for three years, but for the past four weeks, he had not been talking to her.“My sister had tried all means to get in touch with him over the last month but he had blocked her on all social networking sites and she had to resort to emails to reach out to him. She sent him long emails but he ignored them and instead sent abusive replies. He also called her names for playing mobile video games with his friends. On Saturday, after weeks, surprisingly he sent an email to my sister inviting her for a get-together at his friend’s place,” said the woman’s sister in the FIR.She added that at 10.25pm on Sunday, she received a call from her sister’s partner asking her to come to a hospital stating that she had ‘fallen down from the building’. “At 11.30pm, when I reached the hospital, I noticed that my sister’s partner had scratch marks on his neck. My sister had bruises over her lower body, left forehead and a cut on her lips. Her body did not look like it had fallen from the fifth floor of a building. It is suspicious that he had not bothered to contact her for four weeks and that this happened on the day he asked to meet her,” she said.Police said at the time of the incident, four people, including the victim, were in the house. The incident was reported to the police around 11pm. The victim’s body has been kept in the mortuary and a post-mortem will be conducted on Tuesday.Dinkar, station house officer (SHO), sector 65 police station, said, “It is not certain if the woman committed suicide or there is foul play involved. We are verifying the allegations. The cause of death will be established after the post-mortem report comes out. Prima facie, on the statement of the woman’s sister, a case of abetment of suicide has been registered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-woman-falls-to-death-from-fifth-floor-kin-point-murder-finger-at-partner/story-6UC0VjCoS0y8WLfIBPbIAP.html
21-07-2020||Gurugram||Ardee City residents complain of delay in registration of properties||Owners of nearly 300 properties in the Ardee City have complained to the department of town and country planning (DTCP) that, despite directions by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to register their properties, no progress has been made so far in this regard. The property owners said they had lodged a complaint with the district administration early this year. Their complaint was also heard in the monthly grievance meeting chaired by the CM in February. However, since then, no progress has been made. The property owners also alleged that whenever they request the developer to facilitate the registration of their properties, they asked to pay a variety of charges, including composition fees, registry fees and others, which add up to a total of ₹3 lakh or more for each property. “In the grievance meeting chaired by the CM, directions were issued to the DTCP to initiate registration immediately and complete it within one month. The department had asked us to submit all the necessary documents of the plot owners. On March 2, we submitted four boxes of folders, containing documents of 62 property owners. But nothing happened thereafter. The property owners are also harassed by the developer, who ask for money in order to register their properties,” said Chaitali Mandhotra, a resident of the colony. Praveen Kumar, president, residents’ welfare association (RWA), Ardee City, in a letter submitted to the DTCP, said that they had been pursuing the matter for the last several months but no action has been taken. The RWA also said that the most of the apartments in the locality were bought in 2000 and the possession was given between 2003 and 2008. Despite the long delay, the registration of their properties has not been carried out. When asked about the matter, Anil Hasija, vice president, Ardee Developers, said that registration of properties was underway. “The residents, however, must clear their dues in terms of maintenance and other fees before the registration process can be initiated. In the monthly grievance meeting of the CM in February, we had taken the same stand. The owners must clear their dues and get their properties registered,” he said.The DTCP officials, however, said that they have asked the developer to share all the details of the unregistered properties and the dues with department so that registration can be carried out. “A notice is being issued to the developer that they must share the details with department within seven days failing which a case would be registered against them as this matter has been delayed for too long,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ardee-city-residents-complain-of-delay-in-registration-of-properties/story-IJbfIC8SrWfQTz4Wllc4II.html
21-07-2020||Gurugram||Sunday night rainfall leads to two cave-ins in Gurugram||Following a spell of heavy overnight rainfall, portion of roads in two major stretches of Gurugram caved in early on Monday morning. The first cave-in was reported from below the IFFCO Chowk flyover, less than 50 metres from the IFFCO Chowk bus stop — one of the busiest stretches in the city with buses heading to Rajasthan and southern parts of Haryana stopping here. In addition, traffic heading from MG Road towards Delhi on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway also pass through this stretch before taking the u-turn flyover located 250 metres ahead.The other cave-in was reported on a stretch of road that connects sector 46 with sector 50, near Bakhtawar Chowk. Traffic heading towards Sohna Road, Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Golf Course Extension Road, and internal sectors of 46, 47, and 50 use the stretch. At both the sites, Gurugram police barricaded the caved-in areas and also cautioned commuters over social media. Pardeep Attri, superintending engineer, GMDA said that a pipeline burst below the surface of the road leading to the sector 46/50 cave-in. “A pipeline running below the road had developed leakage. The accumulated water from the overnight rainfall further weakened the top-surface due to which a portion of the road caved. We have fixed the pipeline. However, due to rainy conditions expected in the next 3-4 days, we will start bitumen work only over the weekend and then subsequently open the affected portion for traffic. In the interim, the caved-in portion will remain barricaded,” said Attri.Both the cave-ins are at least five-foot wide and six-foot deep, said GMDA officials. Officials further said that there was no major impact on traffic since both the cave-ins occurred in the corner most lanes of the carriageways that vehicles could avoid and instead take the other two lanes.As per NHAI officials familiar with the matter, a cave-in at IFFCO Chowk had occurred last monsoon as well. “The cave-in had occurred during monsoon last year as well. The space between the road and the underground pipeline below is hollow due to which the stretch caves-in whenever there is heavy rain. This usually happens when the road is dug for inserting underground cables but not properly filled up properly when work is completed. Although this is GMDA’s fault and it is their scope of work, it is likely that we will receive a request from them for repairing it. Due to rainy conditions, we will start bitumen related work after 48 hours, and ensure the gap is properly backfilled,” said the senior NHAI official.Attri said that the cave-in occurred on NHAI road and it comes under their jurisdiction. Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI meanwhile said that GMDA would be responsible for carrying out the work.Sunday night’s rainfall started around 11.30 pm and went on till around 1am on Monday. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) website, the city received 12mm of rainfall and is forecasted to receive more showers till July 26.The spell of rainfall also left a few stretches — such as IFFCO Chowk, CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, Kherki-Daula-Narsinghpur, sectors 4, 5, 56, 31, Sohna Road — waterlogged with civic officials installing motor pumps in several locations to divert rainwater towards the nearest drainage outlet. Officials said that by noon, water had receded in most parts of the city.“Despite heavy rain, most roads were largely clear of waterlogging. Even the ones which reported waterlogging were due to localised reasons. In a few spots, we used motor pumps to draw out rainwater. However, barring a few spots, by noon almost all roads across the city were free of rainwater,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG).Devendra Bhadana, executive engineer, horticulture wing, MCG said that the civic body cleared out eight trees from across the city such as Udyog Vihar, sectors 28, 31, all of which had uprooted due to strong winds and heavy rains on Sunday night.He said that the MCG received information of four trees falling onto the roads from the police control room while locals contacted them about the others. Bhadana said that all trees fell in open areas and did not result in injuries or cause any damages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sunday-night-rainfall-leads-to-two-cave-ins-in-gurugram/story-ywqaS9N5JKtyjoziKJsMrK.html
21-07-2020||City||Mercury drops as Noida receives more rain||Noida: Light rains lashed the city on Monday for the second day in a row, bringing down the day temperature by more than two degrees Celsius. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted moderate rainfall for the next three days.Noida received light rain in the morning hours with an average rainfall of 6.3mm, IMD said. The rains and cloudy sky, along with cooler easterly breeze, bought the mercury down by 2.5 degrees Celsius, IMD officials said.On Monday, the maximum temperature in Noida was recorded at 32.6 degrees Celsius, two notches below the season’s average, against 35.2 degrees a day earlier. The minimum temperature, however, saw a rise, with Monday recording 25.6 degrees Celsius, against 23.4 degrees a day earlier due to moderate rains on Sunday night at 50.7mm. The rainfall below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5mm is moderate and above 64.5mm is heavy. The humidity levels oscillated between 69 to 79%, the IMD said.The Met department expects the rains to continue for the next three to four days. Tuesday’s maximum temperature is likely to hover around 33 degrees Celsius, an IMD official said.Weather analysts said that the monsoon line of trough – a low-pressure line that oscillates around Delhi and brings rains to the region – is now passing through Delhi and is expected to oscillate around national capital region for the next three days leading to rains across NCR, including Noida and Ghaziabad.“The temperature will fall by a few degrees due to rain. There are chances of moderate to heavy rainfall on late Monday night to Tuesday morning,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.According to IMD records, Gautam Budh Nagar is one of the most rainfall deprived districts of the state. So far, since June 1, Noida has seen about 93% and Ghaziabad has seen 74% deficit, while the western Uttar Pradesh saw only 36% deficit till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mercury-drops-as-noida-receives-more-rain/story-8B7ALQLGZsyGkesBDE80zK.html
21-07-2020||City||Noida: Man’s body with disfigured head found||Noida: A man’s body with the severely disfigured head was found along a road in Noida on Monday, the police said, adding that they are trying to identify the deceased based on the tattoo on his hand.According to the police, the body was spotted by the passersby dumped at a service road in the Sector 94 police post area. The police were alerted around 9.30am.Deputy commissioner of police Sankalp Sharma said prima facie it appeared that the man was killed somewhere else and his body was dumped here.“Our primary focus is to establish the identity of deceased, and then legal proceedings could be initiated in the case. There is a tattoo on the right arm with ‘Vicky’ inscribed on it, and we are taking that as the lead,” Sharma said.The age of the deceased could be around 27 years old, the police said, adding that the head of the man was severely disfigured making it very difficult to establish the identity.“There was no other injury mark on the body,” Sharma said, adding that the body has been sent for post mortem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-man-s-body-with-disfigured-head-found/story-yaQNqDrxePqK1DT1OH1sVP.html
21-07-2020||City||Domestic helps, waste collectors should be tested for Covid-19 on priority, demand residents’ bodies||NOIDA: Apartment owners associations (AOAs) and other social groups in the Gautam Budh Nagar district on Monday demanded that all domestic helps working in residential sectors and housing societies should undergo Covid-19 tests on priority to prevent the spread of infection. The demand comes after seven domestic helps working in an upscale housing society in Noida recently tested positive for the infection. The residents’ bodies said that waste collectors and sanitation workers should also be tested for coronavirus as they are more vulnerable to the infection.“There is a dire need that all waste collectors and domestic helps should be tested so that they can be identified early and get adequate treatment on time. We got the test of 235 suspects done at our society camp on Saturday, of which seven domestic helps working in our society have tested positive,” said PVS Prakash, president of Grand Omaxe apartment owners association.Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations, said that the federation has written to the district administration in this regard.“We have demanded that the administration should test all the waste collectors and domestic helps so that they can be identified and provided with the treatment on time. They are more prone to the risk of infection. At our society camp, a waste collector tested positive out of 75 who underwent the test. We also request that if a waste collector/domestic help is found positive, he/she should be treated with dignity,” said Singh, who is a resident of King’s Court, Sector 50.There are about 150 residential sectors and 1,200 housing societies in the district, where thousands of domestic helps work. Also, at least 5,000 sanitation workers are engaged in waste collection, transportation and sweeping job.“We have been demanding that all sanitation employees should be tested at camps because they can become a carrier easily due to nature of their job,” said NP Singh, president of GB Nagar District Development Residents Welfare Associations (DDRWA).District officials said that they have been organising testing camps at housing societies, sectors, and villages to detect cases. “We have asked various residents’ bodies to come forward to help us organise camps and get all suspected tested properly. Our motive is to test everyone who is suspected and then start treatment of those who are found positive,” said Narendra Bhooshan, nodal officer for Covid-19 preparations in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/domestic-helps-waste-collectors-should-be-tested-for-covid-19-on-priority-demand-residents-bodies/story-WAFMGiChimJWoOHbxGMiXN.html
21-07-2020||City||Gurugram: Health dept expresses concern over spillover of infection to adjoining districts||Gurugram: Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram, the health department has expressed concern over the spillover of viral infection to adjoining districts of Rewari and Nuh.With the reopening of industries and other economic activities, inter-district movement of the industrial workforce may help increase the positive cases in the two districts, health officials in Gurugram said, adding that they are currently analysing the situation to prevent inter-district transmission of virus.According to the state health bulletin, Rewari reported 1,092 Covid-19 cases till Monday, while Nuh’s count stood at 440. Compared to both the districts, Gurugram has much higher number of positive cases. On Monday, Gurugram reported 109 new cases, taking the total count of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus to 7,857. Of these, 1,048 are active cases while 6,693 patients, including 90 on Monday, have recovered, the health bulletin said. The Covid-19 toll in the district stands at 116.“The districts sharing borders with Gurugram are noticing an increase in the Covid-19 cases, which can be a concern for Gurugram in the time to come,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. “There is an inter-district movement of workforce, be it industrial or rural, among the three districts. We are keeping an eye on their rising numbers to prevent transmission of coronavirus infection. The number of testing has also increased in the industrial areas where there is maximum movement of the workers,” said Yadav.Notably, Daruhera in Rewari and Manesar in Gurugram are big industrial towns.Yashendra Singh, deputy commissioner, Rewari, said, “Nearly 70% Covid-19 cases of Rewari are clustered in Dharuhera, where people commute from Gurugram and Bhiwadi (Rajasthan) or vice versa. Coronavirus cases have increased in Rewari which we are trying to control.”A two-day sanitisation drive started in Dharuhera on Monday, Singh said, adding that contacts of confirmed cases are being put in quarantine and testing has been increased. The Nuh health department also confirmed that their emerging hotspots share proximity to Gurugram. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, Nuh, said that Covid-19 clusters are emerging in areas bordering Gurugram.“Emerging hotspots are centralised in areas like Tauru and Nuh having high inter-district movement. The health department has intensified testing using antigen kits in these hotspots. Also, people who work in Gurugram and have tested positive, their immediate contact tracing is done and suspected cases are being put in four quarantine centres set up in Nuh,” said Punia, who has served as Gurugram’s chief medical officer before Yadav took over in June.A senior health department official in Gurugram said that coronavirus cases are increasing in rural parts of Rewari and Gurugram. “Factories are operational now. A lot of people do daily movement between the two districts, due to which cases are now increasing in peri-urban and rural areas,” said Dr Aruna Sangwan, senior medical officer of Pataudi block that touches border with Rewari district.“The rise in the Covid-19 cases in Rewari and Pataudi can be attributed to this unrestricted inter-district and inter-state movement,” said Sangwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-health-dept-expresses-concern-over-spillover-of-infection-to-adjoining-districts/story-mOaTZS3V0OarSWGMp2E2wL.html
21-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s bus ridership still a fraction of pre-Covid volume, no additional routes for now||Ridership on the city bus service has shown a steady daily increase ever since operations resumed on July 2 — after a three months hiatus — owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.Since then, the bus service has ferried close to 100,000 passengers, mainly on long-distance routes to Sohna and Manesar, said officials in the Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Ltd.From 5,265 passengers on July 2 (when the service formally resumed partially), ridership too has more than doubled, with at least 12,300 passengers taking the bus service on July 16. Even so, the past week’s average ridership figures (about 10,000 passengers a day) is only a fraction of the service’s pre-Covid operations. Gurugram was ferrying between at least 80,000 and 90,000 passengers on any given weekday in March, as per data available on the company website, before the Covid-19 pandemic started raging. While the plan was to roll out Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Ltd’s entire fleet of 200 buses by August, officials on Monday said that no additional vehicles (or routes) will be relaunched for the time being. “We have received a tepid response and ridership is still quite low. It has been decided to keep only 65 buses operational on six routes for the time being, till ridership increases,” said Vanita Akhaury, spokesperson, GMCBL.“As expected, our flagship route, Route 212, to Basai via Huda City Centre and back, is not doing so well because the Metro is shut and many offices along the route have not yet opened up. Our ridership now comprises industry workers travelling to Manesar and back on Route 134B, and there is also a lot of movement between Sohna and Gurugram on Route 218. Route 122, from Sikanderpur Metro to Gurugram bus stand, is also doing a little better than Route 212,” Akhaury added.GMCBL officials also stated that the ongoing pandemic has put considerable financial stress on the organisation, with revenue losses running to at least Rs. 8 crore, till June 15. “Our target revenue in March was about Rs 70 for every kilometre travelled. At the moment we are operating at about Rs 10 per kilometre, while the number of kilometres plied themselves are much lower than before,” said a senior official. Akhaury added that no overcrowding has been observed on any routes so far, and officials are keeping a close watch on the buses’ cycle-times to ensure that social distancing is maintained among commuters. “Only 18 passengers are allowed to board any bus at one time, so we have had to run the buses on schedule. Without much traffic this has been easy, and the wait time for passengers has improved to between 12 and 15 minutes on each route,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-bus-ridership-still-a-fraction-of-pre-covid-volume-no-additional-routes-for-now/story-ScaHeOF1kuBQBqByoOTumJ.html
21-07-2020||Noida||70% Covid fatalities in GB Nagar were males, shows data||Data on the number of deaths due to Covid-19 in Gautam Budh Nagar till Sunday, indicates that female patients in the district have shown better immunity to the virus than their male counterparts. Out of 39 fatalities in the district till Sunday, 27 or nearly 70% were males.Not only this, data released by the state health department also shows that of the 4,155 total positives in the district till Sunday, the number of male patients were 2,327 or 1.27 times more than the number of female patients, which stood at 1,828.District surveillance officer Dr Manoj Kushwaha said that even the speed of recovery was faster among women. “As per our rough estimate, most female patients turn negative in just five to seven days. On the other hand, their male counterparts take 10-12 days in shedding the virus,” he said.Kushwaha added that the youngest male patient, who succumbed to the virus so far from the district, was 29 years old. “On the other hand, more than 20 female positive patients – who were over 65 years and had some other ailments – managed to beat Covid-19. Though it has yet not been established as a fact, but blood running in a male body has higher levels of a key angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is believed to be used by the virus to infect body cells. This enzyme is found in the heart, kidneys and other organs and we believe it plays a vital role in the infection,” he said.However, micro biologists did not place much trust in the enzyme theory. Dr Dalip K Kakru, head of micro-biology in Sharda institute of medical sciences, said that more exposure and vices make males more susceptible to the virus when compared to their female counterparts. “It is a contagious disease and men often have more exposure. Perhaps, that’s why the number of fatalities and number of positives is higher in makes,” he said.Even Dr AK Gadpayle, the former director of central government health scheme (CGHS), seemed to share the belief and said that men have more medical complications when compared to women.“Ailments like diabetes and hypertension are more common among men. Had the ACE2 enzyme been the cause of vulnerability, then the male to female positivity ratio would not have varied much. While in the US it’s 4:1, Italy has a ratio of 1:1,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/70-covid-fatalities-in-gb-nagar-were-males-shows-data/story-iO9opbIVYquzCxvAtsi54J.html
21-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Special containment exercise ordered for 21 localities having over 10 Covid-19 cases||Ghaziabad: To curb the rising Covid-19 cases, the district administration on Monday directed for strict containment protocols in 21 different residential areas which have more than 10 active cases. Officials said that the 21 areas will be subjected to sealing and police officers will be deputed to ensure restrictions and delivery of essential supplies.“Under the micro plan, we have identified 21 different areas which will be subjected to strict containment exercise. This will amount to sealing in order to break the chain of infection. There will be static magistrates and police officers who will be deputed. The containment zones will be under 100% restrictions, except for essential supplies,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.The district magistrate on Sunday had said that the administration is working on a micro plan for containment of areas where Covid-19 cases are increasing.According to the officials, the 21 areas include Brij Vihar, Shalimar Garden Extension, Lajpat Nagar, Sector 2 of Rajendra Nagar, Shyam Park, Nyay Khand in Indirapuram, Ahimsa Khand-I in Indirapuram, Gyan Khand-I in Indirapuram, Rjendra Nagar, Chiranjeev Vihar, Arthala, Shipra Sun City and VVIP at Raj Nagar Extension, among others.The move comes after there is an increase in category-2 containment zones (with two or more cases) in the district. According to official figures till July 19, the district has 139 category-1 zones and 178 category-2 zones.In the 21 identified areas, two teams have been deployed for ensuring 100% testing of suspected cases and will also distribute pamphlets advising residents to adopt guidelines of the health protocols.“There will be a special drive in such areas. Those not wearing masks or following social distancing will be penalised. Under the containment zones, door step delivery will be ensured. The RWAs will also be roped in to ensure that every household is sanitized,” Pandey added.The municipal corporation has also been directed by the district magistrate to ensure that proper sanitization is taken up in the containment zones. Besides, incident commanders have been appointed for each of the containment zones.Along with the containment exercise, the administration has also planned that recommendations of the Ministry of AYUSH will be publicised widely so that residents can take help of immunity boosters to prevent the infection.According to guidelines, category-1 zones are created in a radius of 250 metres where a single Covid-19 case emerges. The category-2 zones, on the other hand, have a radius of 500 metres with additional 250 metres of buffer area. These are created in areas having more than one Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-special-containment-exercise-ordered-for-21-localities-having-over-10-covid-19-cases/story-oBs4hXqVWFGWUAlDmwPUoL.html
21-07-2020||City||Ghaziabad authorities revamp Covid-19 patient referrals||The Ghaziabad district administration is revamping its system of referring patients to different category of Covid care facilities in order to provide necessary treatment to coronavirus patients on time.Under the new system, the district administration has appointed three in-charges officer for every hospital in the district, while respective district in-charges have also been appointed for L1, L2 and L3 category hospitals to facilitate speedy referrals. Patients will also be allotted single referral number for easy identification across all hospitals. Under the state government’s three-tier structure, while L1 hospitals treat with asymptomatic patients, L2 hospitals treat patients with moderate complications, and L3 hospitals deal with patients who require critical care.“Apart from other aspects related to Covid-19 patients, we are also focussing more on referral issues which can get complicated with allowing home isolation for asymptomatic patients in the state . For now, I have directed that every patient will be assigned a single number for his/her referral to L1, L2 and L3 hospitals which will help his/her identification across all facilities. We have also fixed roles and responsibilities of each in-charge of different hospitals for ensuring smooth process of referrals. The need for referring a patient from L1 hospital to L2 or L3 hospitals or from L2 to L3 hospitals can arise ar any point,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said.“Further, for better referral, we have assigned a mobile number to each Covid facility which will be provided to three in-charges who will work in shift of eight hours each. This mobile number will be used between different facilities to get in touch with other hospital in-charges for referrals. If the calls are not picked up, the chief medical officer will be held responsible. Even if the call is not received, the referral process should not suffer and the hospital in-charge must ensure that patient is referred to an advanced category facility any how,” he added.The issue of timely referral becomes vital as different facilities are spread across the district. Sahibabad, Niwari and Modinagar each have an L1 category hospital. It has one L2 hospital at Sanjay Naga, while one L3 facility is near old bus-stand. These are facilities apart from the eight private hospitals which provide paid Covid treatment for patients requiring L2 and L3 category care. The paid hotel isolation facility in the district is at Bajaria near Ghaziabad railway junction.INQUIRY ORDERED INTO WRONG REFERRAL FOR 30-YEAR-OLD PATIENTThe revamping of the referral system comes in the backdrop of the alleged referral made wrongly in the case of a 30-year-old woman admitted to the L1 category hospital in Modinagar. The woman was wrongly referred to the L3 facility in Ghaziabad city on Friday and an inquiry has been initiated in the matter, the DM said.“The woman, admitted to L1 hospital at Modinagar, complained of respiratory issues and the centre in-charge referred her to L3 hospital. When the chief medical officer came to know about the referral he spoke to the patient and directed her to take some medicines. However, after a couple of hours, she was still referred the L3 facility. When the patient arrived there, she was found having no complications that would require critical care,” an officer of the health department, who did not wish to be named, said.DM Pandey said that initial prone into the incident has found that the in-charge of the L1 facility made a wrong referral. “ The incident at Modinagar was a one-off incident, but we have revamped our processes to ensure keep the Covid-19 death rate in check,” he said.Ghaziabad has so far reported 63 Covid-19 related deaths.In an earlier incident, the district magistrate directed for a magisterial inquiry into the death of a 66-year-old Covid-19 positive woman who was allegedly referred from a private hospital to L3 category Covid hospital in an ambulance which allegedly had no life support equipment. She was found dead by the doctors who examined her in the ambulance when it reached the L3 Covid hospital on June 16.According to official records, till July 17, the ESIC Hospital at Sahibabad (L1) has a referral rate of 19% while the Divyajyoti Hospital at Niwari (L1) has referral rate of 23% patients.The SRM Covid care centre (L1) at Modinagar has about a 10% referral rate.Officials said that to facilitate the referrals, Ghaziabad district has 19 dedicated ambulances, including two life-support ambulances, which are running round the clock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-authorities-revamp-covid-19-patient-referrals/story-eq17dyw4hw12gGUO9u9STN.html
21-07-2020||City||UP allows home isolation of asymptomatic Covid-19 pateints||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday finally gave its nod for asymptomatic patients of Covid-19 to be isolated at home. The move, which spells relief for residents and will help in reducing the stress on the healthcare facilities in the state, however, comes with a stringent bunch of guidelines.Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home), on Monday stated that chief minister Yogi Adityanath has issued directions to allow home isolation of patients with no symptoms, while adding that asymptomatic patients who have HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), cancer or have had an organ transplant will have to mandatorily be admitted to hospitals if they test positive for Covid-19.“Those who are allowed to be in home isolation should ensure that comply strictly with all guidelines to ensure that their family members as well as others do not get infected. Although, we have sufficient number of L1, L2 and L3 category beds available in UP (about 1.51 lakh), we are allowing home isolation after receiving requests from several people,” Awasthi added.Till now, anyone, with or without symptoms, who had tested positive for Covid-19 was needed to get admitted to either an L1 (for asymptomatic cases), L2 (for cases with mild symptoms) or L3 (for critical cases) category hospitals, paid private Covid hospitals or paid isolation facilities in hotels.The new directions require asymptomatic patients to remain at home with certain conditions – an undertaking promising compliance with all norms needs to be submitted by the patient; a consulting doctor will declare patient as asymptomatic; patient to ensure round-the-clock availability of a caregiver; minimum two toilets at home and separate isolation room at home. Patients will also have to purchase medical kits equipped with pulse oximeter, thermometer, mask, gloves, among others, for themselves.State officials hope that with home isolation now being allowed, many people who were earlier scared of being isolated institutionally and were reluctant to give their samples will come forward to get tested.“Earlier we allowed home quarantine for contacts of Covid-19 patients, but we found that many people were concealing their contact history, and were not coming forward to get tested fearing institutional isolation,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). Ghaziabad officials said many people who were tested positive for the virus had given wrong information about themselves to authorities. There were around 500 such patients who had misreported their personal information to authorities, all of who have now been traced and sent to isolation facilities, they said.“These people had provided wrong addresses or mobile numbers. Ghaziabad police’ electronic surveillance was used for tracing such patients and by Monday all of them had been traced and sent to isolation facilities. Even during our testing drives, about 2% of people had provided wrong addresses or mobile numbers,” said a senior health official, who did not wish to be indentified. “In localities like Indirapuram and Vaishali, where we deployed teams for rapid antigen testing, hardly 20-40 persons had come forward to give their samples. Each of our team have a capacity to conduct 200 tests per day,” he added.Residents in Ghaziabad have welcomed the state government’s move. “People were not coming forward for testing and were even making arrangements in Delhi, where home isolation is allowed. So, we had written to the state government officials to allow home isolation Now we expect that people will come forward and shed their fears for getting admitted to government facilities. About 10 apartment owners’ associations (AOAs) have also shown their willingness to come up with isolation facilities in their community halls,” said Alok Kumar, founder member, federation of association of apartment owners.The Ghaziabad district magistrate, however, said that the state government order has not mentioned anything on isolation centres in high-rises and will not be allowed for now.“There is no mention of home isolation services by RWAs or the AOAs. So, it will not be allowed. At present, we are aiming at about conducting 3000-3500 testing per day. Now the home isolation is allowed, we expect that people will turn out more for getting themselves tested,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.“Apart from the district control room, the role of mohalla nigrani samitis and gram nigrani samitis will now be vital to keep an eye on patients who stay in home isolation. One our part, we are also fix responsibility of nearby houses to be sort of custodian of a positive patients and inform us in case the patient violate home isolation conditions,” the DM added.On July 17, the state government had given allowed of paid isolation for asymptomatic patients as well as patients with very mild symptoms in hotels.With the latest order, Ghaziabad officials said, the load on district’s L1 category hospitals is likely to reduce by around 70%. According to official estimates, out of total Covid-19 1,360 active cases in Ghaziabad (till July 20), the district has about 70% asymptomatic patients, 20% who treatment at L2 hospitals, and rest 10% who require critical care in L3 category hospitals.In Ghaziabad, officials at present have identified about 4,816 L1 category beds, 1,026 L2/L3 beds, 117 ICU beds and 1,096 beds with oxygen facilities. Out of these, 876 L1 beds, 1,026 L2/L3 beds, and all ICU and beds with oxygen are fully operational.ADHERING TO HOME ISOLATION GUIDELINES IMPORTANT, SAYS GB NAGAR DMWith home isolation allowed in the state, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said the asymptomatic patients will be allowed be at home, only if they strictly adhere to all the guidelines.“It is mandatory for the patients their family members to comply with the standard operative protocols (SOPs). Use of masks and social distancing norms have to be followed by one and all in the district,” he said.Stressing that better immunity is most important for checking the infection, he said that several awareness camps will also be organised, particularly in rural areas.“Our volunteers will make people aware about the methods of increasing immunity. The volunteers will also help the residents in downloading the applications like Arogya Setu and Ayush Kavach,” he said.He also said that since door-to-door survey and medical screening being conducted in the district, have yielded very encouraging results in identifying the infected people, the extended surveillance will continue.“We have decided to held testing camps in all the areas. Our target is to test at least 3,000 persons in a day, through rapid antigen kits,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-allows-home-isolation-of-asymptomatic-covid-19-pateints/story-gTZZa3DkMJCbu0aNcBymfM.html

21-07-2020||Delhi||Engineers survey 200-year-old Old Delhi mosque which was damaged in rain||A team of engineers on Monday surveyed the 200-year-old Masjid Mubarak Begum in Old Delhi’s Hauz Qazi chowk, whose central dome was reduced to rubble due to heavy rain a day ago. Technicians and engineers of the Delhi Waqf Board, which maintains the mosque, said the loss is “irreparable” in terms of its heritage. Entry to the prayer hall beneath the dome has been restricted. Prayers were offered in the courtyard on Monday. “It is tough to reach the roof, which has become vulnerable, and collect the rubble. The rubble has not been cleared as we are waiting for it to be inspected by experts, whom we are trying to get in touch with. We will preserve the malba (rubble) for research and see if it could be used for restoration,” Mehfooz Mohammad, section officer, Delhi Waqf Board, said.Mohammad said it was not just the lightening and rainfall that led to the damage, but the dome and the roof had started developing cracks over the past few years. Also read: In a first, free entry for women at ticketed monuments on International Women’s Day“For the past few years, cracks were observed here, which could possibly be because of construction carried out discreetly by shopkeepers on the ground floor and also because of digging work for construction of a Delhi Metro station. During the digging work, many old structures, including houses, had developed cracks,” said Mohammad. The official said the board has contacted the Archaeological Survey of India’s Delhi chapter to seek its expertise and help in restoration. “We plan to write to ASI-Delhi formally tomorrow to help us. We do not have any experts or architects within the board as such and would like to appeal to conservation agencies if they would like to come forward to help us with the task,” he said. Officials from ASI, Delhi said the mosque does not come under their purview. According to historian Rana Safvi, the double-storeyed mosque was built in 1822 and is one of the many mosques built by women in that era. Heritage activist and author Sohail Hashmi said the mosque has historical and architectural importance. “The 1958 Act under the provisions of which the ASI functions needs to be amended to bring all such structures of immense historical importance under its purview. The mosque requires the attention of experts, who could lead its restoration,” said Hashmi. Hashmi said historically it is important as it was built by a courtesan at that time. Mubarak Begum was a courtesan married to David Ochterlony, the first British resident in Delhi in the Mughal court. The mosque was mentioned in the list of 3,000 heritage structures that existed in Delhi, which was prepared in 1920 by historian Maulana Zafar Hasan for the then British-ruled ASI to study. “She was the senior-most of the 13 wives of the British resident. She was sharp and ambitious and Ochterlony would often seek her advice in various matters,” he said. The design of the mosque is similar to those from the times of Shah Jahan. “The design would typically have three domes, of which the central dome is larger than two others. The structure needs to be preserved well to retain its heritage value,” Hashmi said. Abu Sufiyan, a local who runs a group named ‘Purani Dilli Walo ki Baatein’, which conducts heritage walks and cultural programmes in the area, said, “The mosque was not being maintained properly for years. It had been developing cracks from long before but it wasn’t looked into even once. I have got many messages from random people asking to contribute money for repair. We will help as much as we can to restore it,” said Sufiyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/engineers-survey-200-year-old-old-delhi-mosque-which-was-damaged-in-rain/story-m2WLTUKV2kMdqeOpaJeHWK.html
21-07-2020||Delhi||Why does Delhi flood every Monsoon?||Three hours of rain on Sunday -- the first heavy spell of monsoon showers -- inundated several arterial roads, underpasses, nearly a dozen hutments were washed away in a flooded drain and two people were killed in rain-related accidents. Several areas that witnessed flooding featured in the list of 100 waterlogging-prone areas prepared by different agencies over the past few years, however, a lasting solution to the problem is yet to be found. Officials and experts blame multiplicity of agencies and the lack of a comprehensive drainage plan for the annual mess. In 2016, the Delhi government had commissioned a study of the city’s drainage system by IIT-Delhi. Following the study, a drainage master plan was compiled which had also pointed out to the fact that the city had no single agency to manage and maintain drainage. The last drainage master plan was drafted by the Delhi government in 1976.Also read | Waterlogged since 1950s: Why Minto Bridge is Delhi’s flooding constantAt least 11 agencies — PWD, the three civic bodies, Delhi Development Authority, irrigation and flood control, New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment Board — are responsible for de-silting of drains alongside roads under their jurisdiction, said a senior South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) official.“With so many agencies managing stormwater drains in the city, it is difficult to coordinate and ensure that the drains are cleaned ahead of monsoon every year. Due to the multiplicity of agencies, fixing accountability is difficult. There has to be one nodal agency for cleaning and maintenance of drains in the city so that disasters such as the one that happened at Minto Bridge do not take recur,” a senior official PWD official said.A tempo driver had drowned at the flooded Minto Bridge underpass on Sunday. Experts agreed with the assessment, saying there should be one agency responsible for cleaning the stormwater drains and their maintenance. Sarvagya Srivastava, former engineer-in-chief of Delhi PWD, said, “The most important thing is that the city should have a proper sewerage system in place. Currently, sewer waste flows in stormwater drains in most areas. Like earlier, there should be just one agency responsible for desilting of drains.”Another SDMC officials also pointed out the faulty designs of the drains for stormwater flooding roads. Also read | Delhi flooding: Govt fixes responsibility, blame game onThe official said that for instance on Najafgarh-Uttam Nagar stretch, an inadequate cross-section of roadside drains is unable to flush out water quickly from the road. “While constructing the road the PWD designed drain cross-section taking into account only roadside water but they did not calculate possible water outcome from unauthorised colonies located on both sides of the road. They should have constructed drains taking into account the whole catchment area,” the official said. Similarly, at the Okhla underpass, the slope is such that water from all the roads accumulates in the underpass, the same official said. “Inadequate drain cross-section and gradient cannot handle heavy intensity rain. It leads to water accumulation which takes time to recede. This happens at several underpasses in the city,” he said. Rajeev Goel, head of bridge engineering and structure at Central Road Research Institute (CSIR-CRRI), said the problem can be addressed with some design changes. “Construction of wide stormwater drain at the beginning of the slope to the underpass can help. Also, such drains where heavy water flow is expected should be connected to the main drainage. This can be done at the starting and endpoints of a flyover too. But the most important thing is to improve the drainage system along the roads,” he said.While the Delhi PWD manages around 2,064 km length of drains along 1,260 km roads, the three civic bodies collectively manage over 520 km length of drains mainly in colonies or along roads less than 60 feet width. NDMC manages around 321 km drains while DDA manages 251 km drains.When HT individually asked the PWD and the MCDs, officials said the shortage of workforce was one of the biggest challenges faced by them this year.“Normally, the desilting process of big drains takes around 2.5 - 3 months. It used to begin in March. Our priority has always been to clean drains by May 31 or latest by June 15, before the arrival of monsoon in the city. But this year, most of the desilting work was completed only by the first week of July. Around 1500 labourers are engaged every year in desilting process, but this year the workforce was down by half,” a senior PWD official said on condition of anonymity.He said that site inspections also could not be conducted on time due to the lockdown this year. The PWD manages around 2064 km length of drains along 1260km roads across 17 divisions in the city.“We majorly rely on contract labourers. In April and May, we witnessed around 50% shortfall in the workforce. Contractors were unable to bring labourers as they had gone to their home towns due to the coronavirus outbreak. Many of those who had gone to their villages in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to celebrate Holi had refused to return. Hence, getting labourers for the desilting process in April and May was a tough task. It was only by June that the project gained momentum when we got an adequate workforce,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-does-delhi-flood-every-monsoon/story-8HtJzpawW71WsNYydaL6qN.html
21-07-2020||Delhi||Municipal corporations demand dues, Delhi govt says paid already||The three municipal corporations have asked the Delhi government to release the entire fund for the first two quarters of this financial year. The Bharatiya Janata Party-governed civic agencies claim that the government has released just 16% of the Rs 4,000 crore (approx.) due for the first two quarters.A media advisor to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “The court made it clear last month that Delhi government has no dues left.”BJP leaders say that it has become impossible to carry out routine works and salaries are due for months. With the start of the monsoon, corporations say additional staff has to be hired to carry out fogging as large numbers of domestic breeding checkers are deployed on Covid-19 duty.The corporations are feeling the pinch more this time, as their revenue from advertising, property tax, toll, parking, etc has gone down due to the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease.According to the three civic agencies, of the Rs 3,928 crore (for the first two quarters), they have received just Rs 624 crore from the Delhi government so far. South Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Anamika Singh said of the Rs 1,157 crore, the corporation has just received Rs 145 crore from the government. The North corporation officials said of Rs 1,571 crore for the first two quarters, the Delhi government has released just Rs 388 crore for the first quarter. Officials of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation said it was the worst affected as it has got just Rs 91 crore against the scheduled payment of Rs 1,200 crore.North civic body mayor Jai Prakash said he had raised the issue with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. During the monsoon, Jai Prakash said, the civic bodies have to step up the drive to check on mosquito breeding to ensure there is no outbreak of malaria and dengue.“But most of our DBCs are deployed on Covid-19 duty. We urgently need money, as we will have to hire additional people to check breeding and do fogging. Despite repeated requests, the government has not released the entire funds. Our revenue has also dropped due to Covid-19. This has made the situation very tough for us. There are other development works such as road repair after the monsoon etc which we have to do. For this we need money,” said Jai Prakash.Officials of the East Delhi civic body said, “We have paid salaries only to sanitation workers so far. We are yet to pay salaries to other employees,” said Nirmal Jain, EDMC mayor.The BJP has hit out at the Delhi government for not supporting the three civic agencies, which are equally involved in Covid-19 management, in this “hour of crisis”.“We have requested the government several times to release the funds on time. Like the central government helped the Delhi government to bring the Covid-19 situation under control, the Delhi government should also help the civic bodies in this hour of crisis,” said Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly. In an interview to HT, Kejriwal had said on Saturday, “Last month the Delhi high court in its order made it clear that the MCDs do not have any pending dues from the Delhi government. Whatever we had to give has been given to them from our end.”He added, “But, I acknowledge that in this pandemic even the MCDs, like other authorities and administrations, are badly hit financially. So, in all the meetings that were held, I specifically also sought money for the MCDs. Keeping the politics aside, if MCD workers do not get their salaries on time, it will lead to a big mess in Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/municipal-corporations-demand-dues-delhi-govt-says-paid-already/story-WIrZMIHLt7usLORuo1vjsL.html
21-07-2020||Delhi||Pumps to drain water installed at Anna Nagar, traffic still chaotic||A day after 10 houses along the banks of a stormwater drain (Dr Sen Nursing Home Drain) in Anna Nagar slum behind ITO were washed away with torrential rainfall in the national capital, 14 pumps were installed at the site on Monday to drain the stagnated water in the area. The residents of the washed away houses of the JJ cluster were temporarily moved to tents set up near the IP Estate metro station. The water from the drain affected vehicular movement on Bhairon Marg and adjoining roads for most of Monday as well.One carriageway of Bhairon Marg—from Mathura Road towards Ring Road—remained closed for vehicular movement all of Monday as large volumes of water had covered hundreds of metres of the road around the drain, including as far as ITO and IP Flyover, said Taj Hassan, special commissioner of police (Delhi Traffic Police).“The PWD and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) engineers are pumping out the water and repairing the affected roads,” said Hassan.Also read: Why does Delhi flood every Monsoon?While the Bhairon Marg carriageway remained closed, vehicles from Laxmi Nagar were diverted towards Rajaram Kohli Marg and Akshardham side, the traffic police said. Vehicles coming from Akshardham and Ashram side towards central and north Delhi were requested to move towards Mathura Road, Barapulla and Noida Link Road.According to officials of SDMC, under the jurisdiction of which the stormwater drain is, said that they have been trying to pump out the water and the work would take until Monday evening. “We have placed 14 pumps here, but the basement that was dug up to build a parking lot here by an agency is full of water. There is water up till Ring Road and it may take us until Monday evening to drain it,” said a senior official in charge of operations at the site, who did not wish to be named. A 16-storey World Health Organization (WHO) building is being constructed on a 7,000 square metre plot in the area by the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC)—a government of India enterprise—for which the basement was dug up. He added that the drain is about 1,200-1,500 metres long and 3-5 metres deep. The corporation cleaned it during the desilting process. “The houses built just along the embankment were almost level with the water in the drain, which kept rising due to the heavy rainfall, and were washed away. The houses had extended their area near the drain,” the official said. Another official at the site, requesting anonymity, said that the embankment on one side was breached because of the digging work. The foundation was weakened, and the soil was eroded due to the heavy flow of water.Also read: Engineers survey 200-year-old Old Delhi mosque which was damaged in rainHowever, NBCC officials said they had been following all norms and constructing as per approval of the SDMC. “The force of the water was so tremendous that it destroyed all barricades we had set up and submerged the entire parking lot that is about 12 metres deep. There is about 25 lakh cubic feet water on our premises now,” said an NBCC official. According to experts, there are several such drains in the city, whose embankments have been encroached upon by clusters of kuchha and pucca (brick and mortar) houses as well as shanties. “Almost all drains have some kind of encroachment. The bigger drains are mostly along the sides of key stretches, not leaving much space for houses to come up. But since stormwater drains are relatively smaller in size and flow between colonies, they are more prone to such kind of encroachments,” said RS Tyagi, advisor to the NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee, who has been tasked with inspecting city drains. He added that the Dr Sen Nursing Home Drain is a historic natural drain, which was engineered to function as a stormwater drain. Some of the other stormwater drains with unauthorised houses on both sides include the Brahmpuri, Shahdara, Gokalpuri and Palam (Janakpuri to Dwarka) drains. “There are houses until the boundary erected along the drain. People keep extending their backyards up to the drainage area, as unauthorised growth in the city continues unchecked. The drains are full of garbage, also thrown in directly by the residents living there as well as sewage. Even during desilting, the drains are not cleaned well,” said Tyagi. A K Gosain, Professor Emeritus, the department of civil engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-Delhi) said that the houses along drains in the city are invariably encroachments “... just like the majority of floodplains of the Yamuna river are encroached upon. Every drain has a drainage area, which is required to be left untouched. But in most cases, houses invariably come up just adjacent to it. Similar incidents like the one at ITO could take place at other places as well. The government must remove the encroachments. Besides, the drains need to be cleaned well to check blockage. The government needs to fix the responsibility for the upkeep of the drains with a single agency, which can help resolve the issue to a large extent.” Vishal, a 42-year-old flower seller, whose house was washed away, said that the drain had been around for the same time that the slum has been in existence—about five decades—but it never caused any problems. “In monsoon, the drain would overflow—sometimes as high as five feet more than usual—but the water never entered our homes. We never had to rush out of our homes or even remove our belongings,” said Vishal, who goes by a single name.The slum includes people from the North as well as South India and its residents are involved in all kinds of work— ranging from MCD to railway employees and drivers to daily wagers.Padam Kumar, another affected resident, laid the blame squarely on the construction of the three-level basement parking lot of the WHO building being constructed on the other side of the drain. He said that the deep construction had caused the soil to erode because of which the drain water entered the basement and got accumulated there. “Because of that, a large tree near the WHO basement was uprooted. That caused the water to sweep away our houses,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pumps-to-drain-water-installed-at-anna-nagar-traffic-still-chaotic/story-IBnXUqt9UDQWvRXttkjMIN.html
21-07-2020||Mumbai||Varavara Rao fell from bed, unable to do anything on his own; allow us to help: Family to state||The family of 81-year-old Telugu poet P Varavara Rao, booked in the Elghar Parishad case, asked the state government for regular updates on the veteran’s health and to allow a family member to assist him with his activities, as he is unable to do anything on his own.“While he was shifted from Taloja Jail to JJ Hospital to St George Hospital to Nanavati Hospital during the last one week, the family got an official information only when he was tested Covid positive. All the other information is known to the family through secondary sources,” read the statement signed by Rao’s three daughters P Sahaja, P Anala and P Pavana. “Not sharing health updates of a person in judicial custody with his family is illegal, unconstitutional and inhuman,” the petition further said.“The information of shifting him to Nanavati Hospital and worrying news of health status and deterioration for the last two days, including Nanavati finding a head injury, was known to family through friends in media and civil society only. In the absence of official and transparent information, various speculations, rumours and half-truths are also being spread causing further anxiety to family and friends,” the statement added.The family demanded that the entire process related to Rao’s treatment should be made transparent and the family should be informed officially by the authorities. The family also asked for Rao’s test reports and a contact from the authority and hospital for regular update on Rao.Meanwhile, the Bombay high court (HC) asked the state and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to take instructions on whether Rao’s family can see him from a distance at Nanavati Hospital, as his condition is said to be extremely critical. Rao suffers from neurological issues, and was transferred to Nanavati Hospital from the state-run St George Hospital early on Sunday morning.Pasbola informed the court that Rao could be “on the doors of death”, and hence, his bail application should be expedited. The court asked the state and NIA to respond by Wednesday, after which they will hear the bail application on Thursday.“Mr Rao is in an extremely critical condition and it can be said that he is almost on the verge of death. Hence, his wife, through an affidavit filed on July 15, requested permission to see him,” submitted Rao’s counsel Sudeep Pasbola. He added that in the light of Rao’s critical condition and the request made by his wife, the court should decide on his bail application expeditiously. Pasbola informed a division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice PV Tavade that Rao’s health was declining since the time he was in Taloja jail, and worsened after he was shifted to Sir JJ Hospital last week. Pasbola said that even as Rao was tested positive for Covid-19, his other ailments were also getting aggravated. He further said that owing to his deteriorating health, Rao also fell from the hospital bed at JJ Hospital and suffered injuries to his head.Owing to the gravity of Rao’s health, the issues raised in a petition filed by advocate R Satyanarayan, seeking an inquiry against the Taloja jail superintendent, did not come up for hearing. Satyanarayan’s petition alleged that the jail authorities did not comply with the prescription issued by Sir JJ Hospital doctors when Rao was admitted there in May, as a result of which his condition deteriorated and he became delirious and confused – a fact which was confirmed by his wife and daughters after they spoke to him on July 11.However, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for NIA, submitted that after it came to light that Rao suffered head injuries after falling from the cot, he was rushed to the multispeciality Nanavati Hospital, where he is getting the best possible treatment. Singh added that Rao was being taken care of as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines.After hearing the submission the court observed, “We are not doubting your bona fide but please take instructions if family members of Rao can visit or see him at the hospital from a reasonable distance,” the bench said.However, Singh submitted that as far as the guidelines are considered, no such visits to Covid-19 patients are allowed. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare submitted that the video-conferencing facility could be utilised if the family wanted to interact with Rao. Both Singh and Thakare informed the court that they would take instructions and hence the hearing on the bail application and petition should be adjourned to a later date.The court after accepting the statements by NIA and state’s counsels said it would not be passing orders on merits and directed Singh and Thakare to take instructions and posted the matters for further hearing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/give-us-updates-on-health-allow-kin-to-help-him-varavara-rao-s-family-to-state/story-a2Mv5dYQTma8tokaPVQVeK.html

We will lodge an FIR after investigating the doctor’s complaint.”According to information revealed by the chairperson of the society, who requested anonymity, the woman and her husband are residents of the UAE, and the woman was in Pune without her husband.The woman, aged in the below-30 category, underwent the test at the Aditya Birla Hospital and was declared positive on July 11.“Because she was asymptomatic, she was under a 14-day home quarantine,” the chairperson said.A statement from the Aditya Birla Hospital said: “She got herself tested on July 11. She had to go Dubai, so she wanted to do the Covid test. She tested positive, but since she was not showing any symptoms we advised her home quarantine.”The woman flew to Sharjah on July 18.Her home isolation was to end on July 24.Several calls to the woman in the UAE by HT have gone unanswered.“Housing society members found her missing on the night of July 17, and got to know her location when she sent a text message from Sharjah airport on July 18 noon,” the chairperson said.The message, a copy of which is with HT, reads: “your covid-19 test on 18/7/2020 at Sharjah International Airport reported that your result is negative. Please stay safe and healthy”.“She left the building filling out wrong information at the gate. Only her message on July 18 gave us the details,” said a member of the society who received the message.“We lodged a complaint the same day we received her message,” said the chairperson, adding that Vision Indramegh Cooperative Society is under the society cluster containment zone.“While the woman left for Dubai, we are still not allowed to go to our offices. We don’t know when we will be out of the cluster containment zone,” the chairperson said.Dr Amit Mane, from the health department of the Pimpri Cinchwad municipal corporation (PCMC), said, “I have already complained to PCMC police commissioner Sandeep Bishnoi and the Hinjewadi police station. Action will be taken against the woman.”Shravan Hardikar, PCMC commissioner said, “People should not behave in this manner. What if she had tested positive at Sharjah airport, it could have caused many problems. She should have completed her home isolation before going to the UAE.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/asymptomatic-covid-positive-woman-escapes-home-quarantine-to-fly-to-hubby-in-uae-hinjewadi-cops-probe-case-for-fir/story-6kXD7fs3SxB2KoEx3mcR9O.html

Political leaders from all the parties in the city have raised concern over the issue.On Monday, leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) held a protest at the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) municipal commissioner’s office to highlight the issue of shortage of beds and the plight of residents who are unable to find beds in spite of the dashboards showing vacant beds.Abhijit More, AAP leader, said, “We have demanded that the civic body should acquire maximum beds in private hospitals as the Covid-19 crisis is worsening day-by-day in the city.”“We want the municipal commissioner to look into the issue of hospitals and nursing homes not updating real-time dashboard on bed information,” said More.Ajay Shinde, city unit president, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, said, “Though on records, the administration is claiming that they have enough infrastructure, on ground residents are facing a lot of problems.”“They are not getting ambulance service on time and they have to run from pillar to post to get a patient admitted. Some people have lost their lives due to lack of immediate medical attention,” said Shinde.Nilesh Nikam, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, said there have been cases where residents were unable to get a bed at private hospitals.“Residents have to check at various hospitals in case there is a need for ICU bed. The situation is deteriorating day-by-day,” said Nikam.Siddharth Shirole, Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) MLA too has raised the concern over the shortage of beds in the city hospitals and appealed to the central government to interfere in the crisis.Opposition party leader Deepali Dhumal, Congress leader Aba Bagul, Shiv Sena leader Prithviraj Sutar and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader Vasant More had jointly written a letter to the municipal commissioner to dissolve the fix deposits of the civic body and purchase ventilators and other medical equipment amid the rise in cases where patients were unable to get beds at hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-s-aam-aadmi-party-leads-protests-over-shortage-of-beds-at-city-hospitals/story-Wq0NcYoRXUk8yhtGu0KTjP.html

As the BJP is in power in PMC, the state government is intentionally not giving funds to Pune city.”“Instead of classifying over the corporation’s grade, the state government should consider the criteria of positive patients in the municipal corporation while issuing the funds,” he said.Meanwhile, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Deepali Dhumal who is also opposition party leader in PMC has criticised the BJP government over the issue.Dhumal said, “BJP city unit president should raise the same question to the Central government.”“BJP leaders from PMC donated their salary to the Prime Minister’s fund, then also the central government did not give any sizable grants to the city. BJP has six MLAs and MPs in the city. They should ask the central government for help here,” said Dhumal.Dhumal said, “Maharashtra government has released GST grant which is more than Rs600 crore. During the BJP’s tenure at the state level, the government had reduced the GST share of the city.”“Earlier it was Rs140 crore per month, but the state government increased it to Rs152 crore per month, which the state has released for April, May, June,” said Dhumal.The progressive positive count of the city is 37,386, while the death count is 976 as of Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-spike-sparks-mva-vs-bjp-blame-game-over-funds-for-pune/story-4jWOrxFldegVDJucrhogaK.html

MC would issue notices giving four days to owners to remove the unipoles, frame structures mounted atop a single steel pole or column, failing which these would be brought down later, warned Jain.The illegal sites were being sold to advertisers for an estimated Rs 60,000 per month, because of which, the MC, which was meant to get revenues from such advertising, was losing around Rs 1 crore every year.Unipole owners would be given four days to remove the unipoles as they had paid around Rs 60,000 for one, said Gurmeet Singh, superintendent of MC Kharar.MC allots tenders for 40 sites in Kharar every year, but in 2020 it contracted the work for Rs 3.25 crore for nine years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/illegal-hoardings-removed-in-kharar/story-WSCG20D8DvlsF7Jh6KwAYP.html

21-07-2020||World||Donald Trump excluding those in US illegally from reapportionment||President Donald Trump signed a memorandum Tuesday that seeks to bar people in the U.S. illegally from being counted in congressional reapportionment, a move that drew immediate criticism from Democratic officials.The Supreme Court blocked the administration’s effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form, with a majority saying the administration’s rationale for the citizenship question — to help enforce voting rights — appeared to be contrived.Trump said in the memorandum that he had determined that “respect for the law and protection of the integrity of the democratic process warrant the exclusion of illegal aliens from the apportionment base, to the extent feasible and to the maximum extent of the President’s discretion under the law.”The presidential memorandum is expected to draw legal challenges.“There is no end to Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. First, he tried to put a citizenship question on the census but got blocked by the Supreme Court. Now he’s back at it with an unconstitutional order that has no purpose other than to silence and disempower Latino voices and communities of color.”The Census Bureau said last month that more than 90 million households had already responded to the 2020 Census with the majority doing it online. People can still respond on their own online, over the phone or by mail — all without having to meet a census taker. Only this week, door-knockers started heading out to households in six areas whose residents hadn’t yet answered the questionnaire.Opponents of the citizenship question said it would discourage participation by immigrants and residents who are in the country illegally, resulting in inaccurate figures for a count that determines the distribution of some $675 billion in federal spending and how many congressional districts each state gets.Trump’s efforts to add the citizenship question had drawn fury and backlash from critics who alleged that it was intended to discourage participation in the survey, not only by people living in the country illegally but also by citizens who fear that participating would expose noncitizen family members to repercussions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-excluding-those-in-us-illegally-from-reapportionment/story-SqvSIcgB1h9E8QFvINquwJ.html
21-07-2020||World||WHO warns new Ebola outbreak in Congo faces funding gap||The World Health Organization said Tuesday it is facing a “serious funding gap” to battle the new outbreak of Ebola in remote corners of northern Congo amid the global Covid-19 pandemic.The $1.75 million raised so far will only last for a few more weeks, the WHO warned, adding that the response effort is particularly expensive because of how difficult it is to get health teams and supplies into the densely forested area.Already there have been 24 deaths since the outbreak was declared on June 1. The emergence of Ebola in Congo’s northern Equateur province came just as the world’s second deadliest Ebola outbreak was nearing its end.“The response to Ebola in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic is complex, but we must not allow Covid-19 to distract us from tackling other urgent health threats,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.The funding shortage threatens to unravel early gains in this epidemic. When Equateur province last had Ebola cases in 2018, it took health officials two weeks to start vaccinating people. This time around, vaccination teams were mobilized within four days of the outbreak declaration, Moeti said.No licensed vaccine existed when Ebola killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa between 2014-2016. After Ebola cases emerged in eastern Congo in August 2018, health teams eventually were able to combat the disease with two different vaccines.Still, misinformation about those vaccines flourished in a region long wracked by armed militias. Communities fearful of outsiders in some cases refused to allow health teams in, allowing the virus to spread.At least 2,280 people died of Ebola over the nearly two-year span of the epidemic in eastern Congo before it ended on June 25.Previous outbreaks in northern Congo have been more limited — the 2018 one killed 33 people before it was brought under control within months.Congolese health officials have determined through genetic sequencing that the new outbreak in the north is unrelated to the epidemic in the east,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-new-ebola-outbreak-in-congo-faces-funding-gap/story-A9tKS3g91EiDPSqwXShKaI.html
21-07-2020||World||Mike Pompeo urges ‘entire world’ to stand up to China||US secretary of state Mike Pompeo urged “the entire world” Tuesday to stand up to China but denied forcing Britain’s hand in its decision to ban the communist superpower’s private telecoms giant Huawei.Pompeo met prime minister Boris Johnson in the heat of an emerging crisis in relations between London and Beijing over everything from China’s treatment of Hong Kong to its persecution of more than one million ethnic Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities.The top US diplomat used a press conference with his UK opposite number Dominic Raab to air a host of grievances President Donald Trump’s administration had built up against Beijing.He accused China of engaging in “a cover-up and co-opting” the World Health Organization by allegedly suppressing early details of the “preventable” coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 610,000 people globally.The Chinese Community Party’s “exploitation of this disaster to further its own interest has been disgraceful”, he said.Pompeo also castigated China for claiming disputed areas of the South China Sea “you have no lawful claim to” and trying to “threaten and bully” its neighbours.“We think that the entire world needs to work together to ensure that every country, including China, behaves in the international system in ways that are appropriate and consistent with the international order,” he said.‘Right thing to do’Pompeo’s last visit to London in January came just days after Johnson ignored Washington’s warnings and allowed Huawei to take a leading role in building Britain’s next-generation mobile data network.This trip was announced just a day after Johnson last week decided to risk drawing the wrath of China and phasing out Huawei from the speedy new system.The Chinese foreign ministry responded by accusing Britain of becoming “America’s dupe”.But Pompeo and Raab both tried to dispel suggestions the White House was dictating British affairs.“I think that decision was made not because the United States said it was a good decision but because the leadership here in the United Kingdom concluded (that it was) the right thing to do,” Pompeo said.Johnson is keen to avoid being too closely associated with Trump -- whose approval in Britain is languishing at around 20 percent -- despite the “special relationship” between the two historical allies.The UK government stresses it only ditched Huawei after new US sanctions imposed in May endangered the safety of future 5G equipment produced in China.“The reality is it is a result of US sanctions,” Raab said.Washington argues that the Chinese Community Party can force Huawei to either intercept UK data or shut down the British network in times of war.Huawei has always denied this and Britain had previously concluded that it could mitigate any security flaws.‘Golden decade’But the range of steps taken by Johnson in the past month threaten to bring an early end to a “golden decade” in cooperation that former British finance minister George Osborne promised on a visit to Beijing in 2015.London has also outraged Beijing by offering nearly three million residents of Hong Kong a pathway to UK citizenship in response to a highly controversial security law that China imposed on the former British colony last month.Britain followed that up on Monday by suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and extending an arms embargo of “potentially lethal weapons” that had previously applied only to mainland China.Pompeo’s visit includes a sideline meeting with exiled Hong Kong protest leader Nathan Law aimed at further stressing the seemingly new understanding about Beijing.The UK parliament’s release of a delayed report that took the government to task for failing to properly look into any Russian meddling in the 2016 Brexit referendum also hung over Pompeo’s visit.The report was commissioned in response to concerns that Moscow attempted to help Trump win the presidency in 2016.Trump and Pompeo reject suggestions that Russia played any meaningful role in the vote.Raab said Britain viewed Russia as “a top national security priority” but Pompeo did not address the issue in his public remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-urges-entire-world-to-stand-up-to-china/story-QVnX49Qe3DFWP7Vq9uKY3J.html

21-07-2020||World||US House of Representatives passes NDAA amendment slamming Chinese aggression against India||The US House of Representatives has unanimously passed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), slamming China’s aggression against India in the Galwan Valley and its growing territorial assertiveness in and around disputed areas like the South China Sea.The NDAA amendment, moved by Congressman Steve Chabot along with Indian-American lawmaker Ami Bera and passed on Monday, said that India and China should work towards de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control.The troops of India and China are locked in a standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead.Passed unanimously by the House of Representatives along with scores of other amendments, it said that the expansion and aggression of the People’s Republic of China in and around disputed territories, such as the Line of Actual Control, the South China Sea, the Senkaku Islands, is of significant concern. The bipartisan amendment states Congress’ opposition to Chinese aggression against India in the Galwan Valley on the India-China border, and expresses its concern toward the growing territorial assertiveness of China. China has used the distraction of the coronavirus to attempt to seize territory belonging to India, as well as to press its territorial claims in the South China Sea, it said.China claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.China has impeded commercial activity like fishing or mineral exploration by countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.Ties between China and Japan have been strained by a territorial row over a group of islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China. “India is a critical, democratic partner in the Indo-Pacific,” Chabot said in a statement after the House passed the NDAA amendment.“I am a strong supporter of our bilateral relationship, and I stand with India, and all our partners in the region, as they confront China’s hostile acts of aggression,” he said.“I am proud to be joined by Congressman Ami Bera, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, to bring this important amendment to the floor in a bipartisan manner,” he added.The Chabot amendment said that in the months leading up to June, 15, along the Line of Actual Control, China reportedly amassed 5,000 soldiers; and is believed to have crossed into previously disputed territory considered to be settled as part of India under the 1962 truce.China and India have reached an agreement to de-escalate and disengage along the Line of Actual Control, the Chabot amendment said, adding that on June 15, at least 20 Indian soldiers and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers were killed in skirmishes following a weeks-long standoff in Eastern Ladakh, which is the defacto border between the two countries.Following the deadly violence, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India stated, ‘‘whenever there have been differences of opinion, we have always tried to ensure that those differences never turned into a dispute,” the amendment said.Another bipartisan amendment moved by Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi along with eight others urging Beijing to de-escalate the situation at the border through existing diplomatic mechanisms and not by force is slated to come up for vote before the House on Tuesday.The two resolutions comes days after the House of Representatives Caucus on India and Indian-Americans in a letter to India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, said that over the last few months, the Chinese authorities have been acting with impunity and have attempted to transgress on the LAC, which resulted in diplomatic discussions to implement a process for de-escalation along the LAC on July 6.It was led by Congressmen Holding and Brad Sherman and signed by seven other lawmakers.“It is my hope that they scale back on their excessive weaponry and infrastructure at the Line of Actual Control and uphold both their longstanding and new founded agreements with India,” said the lawmakers who offered their condolences to the families of the fallen soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-of-representatives-passes-ndaa-amendment-slamming-chinese-aggression-against-india/story-yIZgq1EAjj97mQaQf0TlbO.html
21-07-2020||World||China reiterates it has border dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector||China on Tuesday reiterated its stand that it has a border dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector, adding that Beijing and Thimphu were in communication on the issue.Beijing’s claim is significant as the area in question borders Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as part of south Tibet.Beijing had made the claim regarding Bhutan in June while stalling a request from Bhutan to develop the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in the eastern sector’s Trashigang district during a virtual meeting of the US-based Global Environment Facility (GEF).Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks between 1984 and 2016 to settle their border issue and, according to discussions in the Bhutanese parliament and other public records of these meetings, the discussions have only centred on disputes in the western and central sections of the boundary.Answering a query on a media report on the GEF meeting and China’s objection to funding the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary, Chinese foreign minister spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said China and Bhutan have border disputes in the middle, western and eastern sectors.“China’s position has been consistent and clear. The boundary between China and Bhutan is yet to be demarcated, and the middle, eastern and western sections of the border are disputed,” Wang said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday.“China has proposed a package solution to these disputes. China is opposed to making an issue of such disputes at multilateral forums and China remains in communication with the relevant parties regarding this issue,” he added.“I already made China’s position clear. The China-Bhutan border has not been demarcated. The middle, eastern and western sections of the boundary are disputed between China and Bhutan,” he said.Earlier in July, in an exclusive statement to the Hindustan Times, the Chinese foreign ministry had put on record its claims in the eastern sector.The Chinese foreign ministry had then said the China-Bhutan boundary has never been delimited and there “have been disputes over the eastern, central and western sections for a long time”.The statement in Mandarin added “a third party should not point fingers” in the China-Bhutan border issue – an apparent reference to India.Without elaborating on the actual areas of dispute, the Chinese foreign ministry’s statement said: “The boundary between China and Bhutan has never been delimited. There have been disputes over the eastern, central and western sectors for a long time, and there are no new disputed areas.”At the GEF meeting in June, the Chinese representative’s attempts to formally record his country’s objections through an amendment of GEF’s documents did not receive consensus. Bhutan’s views were also made part of the record: “Bhutan totally rejects the claim made by the Council Member of China. Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary is an integral and sovereign territory of Bhutan and at no point during the boundary discussions between Bhutan and China has it featured as a disputed area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reiterates-it-has-border-border-dispute-with-bhutan-in-the-eastern-sector/story-IlwvqRvqyOL6oYNz21oIvN.html
21-07-2020||World||Phase II trial finds Chinese Covid-19 vaccine is safe, induces immune response||A phase II clinical trial of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate, conducted in China, has found that it is safe and induces an immune response, a study published in The Lancet says.Scientists, including those from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the trial sought to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate.They said the results provide data from a wider group of participants than their earlier phase I trial, including a small sub-group of participants aged over 55 years and older.However, the researchers cautioned that no participants in the current trial were exposed to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, after vaccination. So they said it is not possible for the current study to determine whether the vaccine candidate effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.In the trial, the researchers used a weakened human common cold virus (adenovirus, which infects human cells readily but is incapable of causing disease) to deliver the genetic material which codes for the novel coronavirus spike protein into the cells. The scientists said these cells then produced the coronavirus spike protein, and travel to the body’s lymph nodes where the immune system creates antibodies. They said these antibodies then recognise the spike protein and fight off the coronavirus.“The Beijing approach is based on the backbone of a conventional human, common-cold virus to which some people have pre-existing antibodies and they therefore make a lower response in some people to the vaccine because people have pre-existing antibodies to their vector, so may clear it before it has a chance to work properly,” explained Danny Altmann, Professor of Immunology at Imperial College London in the UK, who is unrelated to the research team. According to the scientists, 508 participants took part in the trial of the new vaccine candidate. Of these, they said 253 people received a high dose of the vaccine, 129 received a low dose, and 126 received a dummy treatment, a placebo. The study noted that about two thirds of the participants were 18-44 years old, a quarter were aged 45-54 years, and 13 per cent were 55 years or older.The participants were monitored for immediate adverse reactions for 30 minutes after injection, and were followed for any injection-site reactions within 14- and 28-days post-vaccination, the study noted.It said serious adverse events reported by participants during the whole study period were also documented, and blood samples were taken from them immediately before treatment, and 14- and 28-days post-vaccination to measure antibody responses.The findings revealed that 95 per cent (241/253) of the participants in the high dose group, and 91 per cent (118/129) of those in the low dose group showed either T cell or antibody immune responses at day 28 post-vaccination.According to the researchers, the vaccine induced a neutralising antibody response in 59 per cent (148/253) and 47 per cent (61/129) of the participants, and binding antibody response in 96 per cent (244/253) and 97 per cent (125/129) of participants, in the high and low dose groups, respectively, by day 28. The study noted that the proportion of participants who had any adverse reactions like fever, fatigue and injection-site pain were significantly higher in vaccine recipients, than those who were given the placebo.However, the scientists said, most adverse reactions were mild or moderate. They said the most common severe reaction was fever. The researchers cautioned that pre-existing immunity to the human adenovirus which was used as the vector (the Ad5 vector) for this vaccine, and increasing age could partially hamper the specific immune responses to vaccination, particularly for the antibody responses. “Since elderly individuals face a high risk of serious illness and even death associated with Covid-19 infection, they are an important target population for a Covid-19 vaccine. It is possible that an additional dose may be needed in order to induce a stronger immune response in the elderly population, but further research is underway to evaluate this,” said study co-author Wei Chen from the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology in China.Since the trial participants were not exposed to the coronavirus after vaccination, the scientists said it is not possible for the current study to determine the efficacy of the candidate vaccine. They said it is also not possible to say from the current research if there are any risks associated with the antibody induced by vaccination when exposed to the novel coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/phase-ii-trial-finds-chinese-covid-19-vaccine-is-safe-induces-immune-response/story-AXEVVhR5aNxfzC4PfNHf8H.html
21-07-2020||World||Pakistan bans live streaming app Bigo, gives final warning to TikTok||Pakistan has banned live streaming application Bigo and issued a final warning to China-based video-sharing service TikTok over “obscene and immoral” content on these platforms.In a statement, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said that numerous complaints were received from different segments of society against immoral, obscene and vulgar content on social media applications particularly TikTok and Bigo.“PTA had issued necessary notices to the aforementioned social media companies under law to moderate the socialisation and content within legal and moral limits, in accordance with the laws of the country,” the statement from Pakistan’s telecom regulator said.The PTA said the response of these companies was “not satisfactory”.A civil miscellaneous application was filed in the Lahore High Court earlier this month demanding an immediate ban on TikTok. The petitioner said that the app was a “great mischief of modern times” and had become a source of spreading pornography for the sake of fame and ratings on social media.The country’s digital rights groups, however, said that they will challenge the ban as there is no legal basis for it.TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, is already currently facing problems with authorities in a number of countries including in Australia, India, and the United States due to security and privacy issues.Both TikTok and Singapore-based Bigo Technology, which owns the live video streaming app Bigo Live, have not made any public comment regarding Pakistan’s move.TikTok is one of the world’s most popular social media apps, with over 2 billion downloads globally.In Pakistan, it has been downloaded almost 39 million times and is the third-most downloaded app over the past year after WhatsApp and Facebook, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.Bigo Live has been downloaded over 17 million times in Pakistan and is the 19th most downloaded app in the country.In July, the PTA had banned PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) platform, with over 16 million users in Pakistan, because it had received complaints “that the game is addictive, wastage of time and poses serious negative impact on physical and psychological health of the children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-bans-live-streaming-app-bigo-gives-final-warning-to-tiktok/story-ILgBKNRxab9agOTKEHM6eJ.html
21-07-2020||World||China warns UK of ‘forceful counter-attack’ after London axes HK extradition treaty||China on Tuesday warned the UK of a “forceful counter-attack” after London suspended an extradition treaty with Beijing-ruled Hong Kong weeks after the mainland implemented a controversial security bill in the former British colony.“China will make a forceful counter-attack to the UK’s wrong actions,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, said at the daily news conference in Beijing.“China urges the UK to give up its fantasies of continuing colonial influence in Hong Kong and immediately correct its mistakes,” Wang said, adding that London’s decision violated international law and norms.The two countries have had testy exchanges over the new security law for Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Ties have been further soured after the UK banned Chinese technology giant Huawei from taking part in the rollout of 5G network. Calling the decision to suspend the treaty an interference in China’s internal affairs, Wang added that the Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal affairs, and no foreign country has the right to interfere. He added that the Chinese government is unwavering in its determination to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and in its determination to fully and accurately implement the “one country, two systems” policy. In London, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy said that recently London has repeatedly made wrong remarks on the national security law for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to interfere in China’s internal affairs.“The Chinese side has lodged solemn representations to the UK side on many occasions to express our grave concern and strong opposition,” the spokesperson said.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new law “violates Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and is in direct conflict with Hong Kong Basic Law,” the de-facto constitution of Hong Kong that came into effect in 1997.Beijing had responded strongly to Johnson’s offer to extend residency rights and a path to citizenship for up to 3 million people in Hong Kong after the law was ratified.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian had then urged countries to “stop making use of Hong Kong issues to interfere in China’s internal affairs”.Zhao reiterated in a statement that China is “…Nobody and nothing could shake the Chinese government and people’s resolution and will to safeguard national sovereignty and security and uphold Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability.”His statement concluded: “Any attempt seeking to undermine China’s sovereignty, security and development interests is doomed to fail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-uk-of-forceful-counter-attack-after-london-axes-hk-extradition-treaty/story-KsnZF65aDDY8kg83wVDc6L.html

He didn’t say when Phase 3 large-scale trials would take place or when production of the vaccine may begin.The Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tests of the vaccine are continuing, the Interfax news service reported, citing the Health Ministry in response to the statement.“They’re all getting ahead of themselves,” said Sergei Netesov, a former executive at Vector, a state-run virology center in Novosibirsk that’s also working on an inoculation. “The third phase has not started yet, or even been announced. The reason they’re in such a rush is completely incomprehensible.”The army is developing a vaccine with the state-run Gamaleya Institute in Moscow and the Russian Direct Investment Fund. Phase 3 trials, which will include thousands of people in Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are scheduled to begin Aug. 3 and distribution of the vaccine could start as early as September, RDIF’s head Kirill Dmitriev said last week.Russia could make 30 million doses domestically in 2020, and 170 million abroad, with five countries expressing interest in producing the vaccine and others willing to produce it, according to Dmitriev.Russia, which has the fourth-most coronavirus cases in the world, has accelerated the testing process and is funding production even before the vaccine is known to work, amid a global race to find defenses against the deadly pandemic that has wreaked economic havoc. In developed economies, Phase 3 trials typically take months to run in order to better understand a drug’s effectiveness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-covid-19-vaccine-phase-2-trials-complete-claims-it-s-ready-for-use/story-aozmsj1Z5nxE20HQGEIFHI.html
21-07-2020||World||Mandatory for all foreign arrivals to carry negative Covid-19 report: China||Passengers on China-bound flights from abroad will need to carry a negative Covid-19 test report, the civil aviation authority announced Tuesday as the Chinese government steps up measures to control “imported” coronavirus cases.The nucleic acid tests would have to be carried out within five days before the scheduled flight at institutes vetted by Chinese embassies in the host countries, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced on Tuesday.The new rule will apply to both Chinese citizens and foreigners travelling to China amid a graded increase in international travel.“Passengers who are Chinese citizens are required to take photos of and upload the nucleic acid test results via an epidemic prevention mini program on the Chinese instant messaging platform WeChat,” the announcement said.Foreigners have to contact the Chinese embassy to get the process started.“Overseas travelers need to apply for a declaration of health status from the Chinese embassy with a valid written report of a negative test result,” the announcement added.Local Chinese embassies have been tasked with assessing the testing capacity of host countries and formulate travel procedures when testing conditions are met, CAAC said.According to Reuters, the CAAC has allowed more foreign airlines to resume services in China and add flights to the country as the economy recovers.“Deutsche Lufthansa AG on Friday said it would double the number of flights to and from mainland China in coming weeks, and Air France KLM SA said it has received approval to add more China flights,” the news agency reported.Last week, health authorities announced that all overseas arrivals still need to undergo quarantine and medical observation at designated sites.However, entry with diplomatic, service, courtesy or ‘C’ visas were not affected, the ministry of foreign affairs had announced.According to the national health commission (NHC), by the end of Monday, a total of 2,015 imported cases had been reported on the mainland.As of Monday, the overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 83,693, including 242 patients who were still being treated, with seven in severe conditions.The death toll remains at 4634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mandatory-for-all-foreign-arrivals-to-carry-negative-covid-19-report-china/story-e8ehCZLKub5JlR3TEb1A3H.html
21-07-2020||World||US adds 11 companies to economic blacklist over China’s treatment of Uighurs||The US Commerce Department on Monday added 11 Chinese companies implicated in what it called human rights violations in connection with China’s treatment of its Uighurs in Xinjiang in western China to the US economic blacklist.The department said the companies were involved in using forced labor by Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups. They include numerous textile companies and two firms the government said were conducting genetic analyses used to further the repression of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.Blacklisted firms cannot buy components from US companies without US government approval.It was the third group of companies and institutions in China added to the US blacklist, after two rounds in which the Trump administration cited 37 entities it said were involved in China’s repression in Xinjiang.“Beijing actively promotes the reprehensible practice of forced labor and abusive DNA collection and analysis schemes to repress its citizens,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.The Chinese Embassy in Washington declined to comment.In May the Chinese Foreign Ministry criticized US entity list additions, arguing the United States “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures, violated the basic norms governing international relations, interfered in China’s internal affairs.”The companies added to the blacklist include Nanchang O-Film Tech, a supplier for Apple’s iPhone, which hosted Apple chief executive Tim Cook in December 2017, according to O-Film’s website. It is also a supplier to Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft, according to an April congressional letter. The US companies did not immediately comment.The list includes two subsidiaries of Beijing Genomics Institute, a genomics company with ties to the Chinese government, Senator Marco Rubio said.He said the additions will “ensure that US technology does not aid the Chinese Communist Party’s crimes against humanity and egregious human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, including the forced collection of DNA.”Also added are KTK Group Co, which produces more than 2,000 products used to build high-speed trains, from electronics to seats; and Tanyuan Technology Co, which assembles high thermal conductive graphite reinforced aluminum composites.Another company is Changji Esquel Textile Co, which Esquel Group launched in 2009. Esquel Group produces clothing for Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss.In a letter to Ross on Monday, Esquel Chief Executive John Chen asked its unit be removed from the list. “Esquel does not use forced labor, and we never will use forced labor. We absolutely and categorically oppose forced labor,” Chen wrote.Efforts to reach other companies in China for comment were unsuccessful outside of normal business hours.Also on the blacklist is Hetian Haolin Hair Accessories Co. On May 1, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it was halting imports of the company’s hair products, citing evidence of forced labor.On July 1, CBP seized in Newark a shipment of almost 13 tons of hair products worth over $800,000 with human hair that it said originated in Xinjiang.Commerce previously added 20 Chinese public security bureaus and companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology in connection with China’s treatment of Muslim minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adds-11-companies-to-economic-blacklist-over-china-s-treatment-of-uighurs/story-Wuedsz34tvo6DBRR6BceLJ.html
21-07-2020||World||How was AZD1222 made, when is first dose expected: Things to know about Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine||The researchers on Monday announced the results of the first phase of a Covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford. The vaccine appears safe and induces a strong immune response within the body, the results published in leading scientific journal The Lancet show.The results are based on the doses given to 1,077 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 in five UK hospitals in April and May as part of the phase one clinical trial. The results show they induced strong antibody and T-cell immune responses for up to 56 days after they were given. T-cells are crucial for maintaining protection against the virus for years.Here are the main details about AstraZeneca’s experimental vaccine:• The shot, AZD1222, is a recombinant viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University. It is licensed to British pharma giant AstraZeneca. It is a chimpanzee adenovirus viral vector (ChAdOx1) vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.• The experimental vaccine uses weakened version of a common-cold virus that infects chimpanzees which are given encoded instructions for making proteins from the novel coronavirus to build immunity. It is likely to provide protection for about a year.• An AZD1222 shot would cost about 2.5 euros ($2.8) per dose in Europe, according to Italy’s health ministry. AstraZeneca does not expect to profit from it during the pandemic.

It says the additional figures brought the country’s total to 13,816 with 296 deaths.The agency says 20 of the newly recorded cases were locally infected patients while the rest 25 were associated with international arrivals.South Korea on Monday confirmed 26 new virus cases, four of them domestic infections and the rest 22 coming from overseas. Health officials said it was the first time for the number of daily local infections to come below 10 since May 19.South Korean officials consider imported cases as a lesser threat than local transmissions because the country is mandating Covid-19 tests and enforcing two-week quarantines on all people arriving from abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-new-covid-19-cases-bounce-back-after-drop-on-monday/story-qYzWwSYutqsSFQym7byfRI.html
21-07-2020||World||Decoding Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine results and why they offer hope||A coronavirus vaccine in development by the University of Oxford and British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc showed promising results in early human testing and is now set to move into larger trials. The data was released on Monday, raising hopes that the world could soon find a way to stop the virus that has taken an unprecedented human and economic toll across the planet.The data was published in leading medical journal The Lancet based on the study done on 1,077 health adults. The AZD1222 vaccine did not develop any serious side effects in them.The OutcomeA single dose led to antibodies by Day 28 and there was a marked increase in Sars-CoV-2 spike-specific T-cell response as early as day 7, peaking at day 14 and maintained upto day 56.The vaccine caused minor side effects, which could be reduced by taking paracetamol.What This MeansThe fact that the vaccine also triggered a T-cell response is an encouraging sign. A T-cell response means the vaccine was able to stimulate the part of the immunity that ‘learns’.“We hope this means the immune system will remember the virus, so thatg pour vaccine will protect people for an extended period,” said Andrew Pollard, University of Oxford professor.AstraZeneca has late-stage trials underway in the UK, Brazil and South Africa and aims to start studies in the United States, where the coronavirus prevalence is higher. Results can be accrued much more quickly in regions with high rates of active infection.AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said the company hopes the vaccine will be available this year depending on how quickly late-stage trials can be completed.A coronavirus vaccine under development by CanSino Biologics Inc and China’s military research unit, likewise showed that it appears to be safe and induced an immune response in most of the 508 healthy volunteers who got one dose of the vaccine, researchers reported.Both the AstraZeneca and CanSino vaccines use a harmless cold virus known as an adenovirus to carry genetic material from the novel coronavirus into the body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decoding-oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-results-and-why-it-offers-hope/story-ayguteU5ndf0ehTn5iV7WK.html
21-07-2020||World||Canadian PM Trudeau skips opening session of parliament as WE Charity debate intensifies||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau skipped the opening day of a session of Parliament that his Government had scheduled even as discussions in the House of Commons were dominated by the controversy over the grant of a contract worth nearly a billion dollars to a charity with close links to his family.The contract to WE Charity has already been cancelled after an outcry and revelations that Trudeau’s mother, brother and wife was paid fees by the organisations at various times. This has already led to a formal investigation being launched by the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioners while two Parliamentary panels are also looking into the matter.Also Read: WE Charity controversy: Trudeau’s finance minister to be investigatedThe new sitting on Monday was to discuss legislation to extend a sweeping subsidy package to businesses in the country to help them retain employees in the wake of the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Trudeau was missing and his official schedule said that he had taken a personal day.While one Opposition party Bloc Quebecois has already asked Trudeau to step aside and for Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland to take charge in his place, on Monday, the leader of principal opposition Conservative Party Andrew Scheer said the onus was on Liberal MPs to seek Trudeau’s resignations. In a press conference in Ottawa, Scheer said, “If they allow him to continue, if they don’t demand that he resign, then they are telling Canadians that they are comfortable with his corruption.”Freeland, in fact, bore the brunt of questioning in the House of Commons, and her response was, “Obviously, the way this unfolded was regrettable, and that is why the charity is no longer administering the project.”The Opposition attack came after Liberal members of the House of Commons Ethics Committee prevented the resolution of a motion to examine the contract and question some of the parties involved by resorting to the tactic of a filibuster, which meant taking up the prescribed time for the meeting with long-winded speeches. As the outlet CBC News reported this included “30-minute long monologues on various topics — their personal resumes, democracy, ancient Greece, French political theory and the virtues of the University of Sherbrooke, among others — that pushed the committee meeting’s duration well past its scheduled end time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-trudeau-skips-opening-session-of-parliament-as-we-charity-debate-intensifies/story-2OQkbkm9svMqt32jNGkRgP.html
21-07-2020||World||Double-shot Covid-19 vaccine tests raise new pandemic challenge||When it comes to protecting the world from the coronavirus, two doses of a vaccine may be better than one. But doubling the number of jabs each person needs could complicate efforts to immunize billions of people.The latest results from front-runners in the sprint to come up with a vaccine, including the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca Plc partnership and Moderna Inc., highlight that prospect. Both efforts are conducting final-stage testing with two doses.Producing vaccines and deploying them to the world’s population in the midst of a pandemic would be a massive challenge even if researchers are able to deliver one-dose inoculations. A need for two would make manufacturing and logistics even more complex.Those challenges would get even tougher if -- as some experts think is possible -- a vaccine’s efficacy wanes over time and repeat doses are needed, potentially every year.“A one-shot vaccine would be ideal, but the first vaccines are highly unlikely to meet this very high threshold,” said Michael Kinch, a vaccine specialist and associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis. “As we hopefully move from whether there will be a vaccine to how to apply this, logistics are going to become the absolute most important topic.”AstraZeneca gained 21% this year through Friday in London, then rose 10% at one point Monday as investors looked for breakthrough results from its phase 1 study. The shares faded, finishing the day with a 1.5% gain after Oxford researchers said that further studies would prioritize a two-dose regimen. The US-traded shares fell 4% in New York.In China, the two-shot approach is also looking increasingly likely. One front-runner vaccine developed by Tianjin-based CanSino Biologics Inc. and the Chinese military does not seem to elicit a strong response in people with pre-existing immunity to the adenovirus used as the vector, and researchers are exploring a booster shot three to six months later to shore up the immune response.Surest ApproachEarly study of more than 1,000 participants receiving the Oxford vaccine achieved the strongest immune response in 10 who received two doses, according to research published Monday in The Lancet medical journal, indicating that it might be the surest approach. The university’s researchers noted that some recipients may get protection from just one dose, and that ultimately the data may show that the majority of people are protected by a single shot.“We are actually really pleased we get a stronger immune response with two doses than we can with one,” Sarah Gilbert, a vaccinologist who leads the work at Oxford, said in a briefing. “We don’t know what we’re aiming at. We don’t know how strong the immune response needs to be to protect people.”AstraZeneca officials also highlighted the logic of a two-dose strategy. The company is exploring other regimens, but the first readout of its final-stage tests will almost definitely be from two doses, Mene Pangalos, Astra’s head of biopharma research, told reporters.The company has committed to delivering first of 30 million doses to the U.K. by September and 100 million by the end of the year.“I think we want to right now maximize our chance of getting an efficacious readout,” Pangalos said. “The last thing we want is to miss because we haven’t dosed enough, so the safest approach and making sure we hit efficacy is doing two high doses.”But a two-shot vaccine will not be easy to distribute widely, and likely disadvantage developing nations even more.“Years of experience in disease eradication in resource-limited countries show you may only get a single chance to vaccinate a large population,” said William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School researcher who chairs non-profit Access Health International. “Many people may not be available for economic or other reasons for a second chance. Therefore it’s a great advantage to have a cold chain-insensitive, cold chain-independent single-shot vaccine.”Leaning to OneYet not all vaccine developers are leaning that way. From the outset of its search for viable coronavirus vaccine candidates, US drug giant Merck & Co. made a point of only pursuing one-dose shots. Those can more easily and seamlessly be deployed across the world in a global vaccination campaign, Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier told Bloomberg in May.It is “extremely important,” he said then, that “these have to be vaccines we have reasonable confidence could be effective with just a single dose.”Merck’s Covid vaccine has yet to enter human trials.Even a perfect inoculation could take weeks to raise immunity to protective levels. That presents the risk that people might return to normal life after just one dose, while the immune system is still processing the vaccine, Washington University’s Kinch said. In that time, they might become infected and potentially pass the virus on to others.“This will be a particular problem if two shots are needed,” Kinch said.Vaccine experts have warned that the first shots to gain approval against Covid-19 might not be the most effective or efficient. In fact, history shows two doses is a more likely scenario. Almost all standard vaccines are multiple-shot regimens, according to Tony Moody, an immunologist at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.“We would like to do better, and we are all working to get to those better vaccines,” Moody said, “but having something effective soon is the top priority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/double-shot-covid-19-vaccine-tests-raise-new-pandemic-challenge/story-mceWUlyEwaVOtN9BUFzXuO.html
21-07-2020||World||China expands amphibious forces in challenge to US beyond Asia||China launched its military build-up in the mid-1990s with a top priority: keep the United States at bay in any conflict by making the waters off the Chinese coast a death trap. Now, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is preparing to challenge American power further afield.China’s shipyards have launched the PLA Navy’s first two Type 075 amphibious assault ships, which will form the spearhead of an expeditionary force to play a role similar to that of the US Marine Corps. And like the Marines, the new force will be self-contained - able to deploy solo with all its supporting weapons to fight in distant conflicts or demonstrate Chinese military power.The 40,000-tonne Type 075 ships are a kind of small aircraft carrier with accommodation for up to 900 troops and space for heavy equipment and landing craft, according to Western military experts who have studied satellite images and photographs of the new vessels. They will carry up to 30 helicopters at first; later they could carry fighter jets, if China can build short take off and vertical landing aircraft like the US F-35B.Also read| ‘We are a battleground now’: In Southeast Asia, US-China tensions flare on social mediaThe first Type 075 was launched last September and the second in April, according to reports in China’s official military media. A third is under construction, according to the May edition of a Congressional Research Service report.Eventually, the PLA Navy could have seven or more of these ships, according to reports in China’s official military press.Chinese military commentators quoted in official media say China’s shipyards are now building and launching amphibious ships so rapidly it is like “dropping dumplings” into water.The military rivalry between China and the United States is only growing sharper. Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared most of Beijing’s claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea illegal, throwing Washington’s weight behind the rival claims of Southeast Asian nations over territory and resources in the strategic waterway that were supported by international law. China said the US position raised tensions in the region and undermined stability.China’s nascent amphibious forces still lag far behind those of the United States, but the speed of China’s military rise has already shifted the balance of power in Asia. Over the past two decades, China has deployed an arsenal of missiles and a massive surface and sub-surface fleet to deter potential enemies from sailing in its coastal waters. Now, as part of an accelerated modernization of the PLA since Chinese President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, these new amphibious ships and the specially trained marines they carry will boost Beijing’s firepower and political influence far from its shores, according to Chinese and Western military analysts.As shipyards churn out amphibious vessels, China is expanding its force of marines under the command of the PLA Navy. These troops are being trained and equipped to make landings and fight their way ashore. China now has between 25,000 and 35,000 marines, according to US and Japanese military estimates. That’s a sharp increase from about 10,000 in 2017.“Without an amphibious force, any military force is greatly constrained in where and how it can conduct operations,” said Grant Newsham, a retired US Marine Corps colonel and researcher at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies. Newsham advised the Japanese military on the formation of Tokyo’s own Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, formed in 2018. “Jets can drop bombs and ships can fire missiles at the shore - but you might need infantry to go ashore and kill the enemy and occupy the ground.”China’s Ministry of National Defense and the Pentagon did not respond to questions from Reuters.At home, too, the PLA marines have become an important tool in the ruling Communist Party’s efforts to showcase China’s increasingly powerful military to its domestic audience. The state-controlled media regularly reports on the gruelling training and military skills of the Jiaolong, or Sea Dragon commandos - a unit from the marines special forces brigade based on Hainan Island off southern China.“We should be the point of the sword in joint operations to strike terror into the heart of the enemy,” said Gong Kaifeng, a Jiaolong commandos company commander, in a report last year on the unit’s training broadcast on state television.When the Type 075 ships enter service, China will have the capacity to combine them with its other new amphibious and support vessels, Chinese and foreign analysts say. These self-contained fleets can be sent to distant conflicts, deployed as a show of force to deter potential enemies or to protect Chinese investments and citizens abroad. They would also allow the PLA to provide disaster relief and humanitarian assistance, competing with the US for prestige and soft power.INVADING TAIWANFor Beijing, these amphibious forces will also contribute to the PLA’s mounting capacity to make a landing on Taiwan or seize other strategically important or disputed territory in China’s offshore regions, according to specialists in amphibious warfare.Beijing regards self-governing Taiwan a province of China. Xi Jinping has said unifying Taiwan with the mainland is a vital step in realizing the Chinese people’s dream of a powerful, rejuvenated nation. In a key speech early last year calling on Taiwan to open talks on peaceful reunification, Xi warned that this long-standing dispute could not be deferred indefinitely. “We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,” Xi said.China has this year stepped up military operations and exercises around Taiwan, according to US and Taiwanese military analysts. PLA Air Force jets, including at least one bomber and a fighter, briefly entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone on June 22, before being warned off by the Taiwanese air force, the island’s military said. It was the eighth such encounter in two weeks, the military said.Taiwan launched its annual Han Kuang defense exercise on July 13 with an emphasis on joint operations between land, sea and air forces to defend the island from attack, according to the island’s military. The exercise also involved an expanded role for reservists as the military strives to boost its firepower, senior Taiwan government officials said.“Our military is always working hard to prepare for war, closely monitoring the dynamics of the Chinese Communist’s military and the development of the situation in the Taiwan Strait,” Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in response to questions from Reuters. “We have a complete defense plan and appropriate actions to deal with the threat of the Chinese Communists attacking Taiwan and the seizure of offshore islands, which can ensure national security.”Experts on amphibious forces note the PLA already has powerful army units that are trained and equipped to make the kind of landings necessary for an invasion of Taiwan. In expanding the marines, they argue, PLA military planners are looking at operations across the globe, in places where China has extensive offshore investments. These commercial interests are likely to multiply as Beijing presses ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious bid to put China at the center of global trading routes.China’s marines will also be important to man what is expected to become a network of strategic military bases around the world, including fortifications on territory Beijing has seized in the South China Sea, according to Chinese and Western military commentators.Beijing has already deployed marines and their armored vehicles to its first overseas base at Djibouti on the Horn of Africa, according to Pentagon reports. Marines are also deployed on the flotillas China sends on naval anti-piracy missions to the Gulf of Aden, these reports said.“We are currently only seeing the tip of the iceberg,” said Ian Easton, the senior director of the Project 2049 Institute, an Arlington, Virginia-based security research group. “Ten years from now, China is almost certainly going to have marine units deployed at locations all over the world. The Chinese Communist Party’s ambitions are global. Its interests are global. It plans to send military units wherever its global strategic interests require.”Short of war, capable amphibious forces will also become a powerful diplomatic or coercive tool for Beijing, military analysts say. So far, Washington has had a monopoly on this type of engagement with other governments, routinely sending marine expeditionary units abroad for port visits, joint training exercises and disaster relief.US expeditionary flotillas, packed with marines, all their heavy equipment and air support, are a potent reminder of American power. A raw demonstration came in the tense period in 1999 when an Australian-led United Nations peacekeeping force intervened to stop violence in what was then Indonesian-controlled East Timor. American forces didn’t become heavily involved on the ground. But the presence of the USS Belleau Wood, a 40,000-tonne amphibious assault ship carrying 900 marines and heavy lift and attack helicopters, served as formidable back-up as the UN troops restored order without any significant resistance from Indonesia.SEIZING ISLANDSChina’s first two Type 075 amphibious assault vessels are now berthed together undergoing final fit-out at a state-owned Shanghai shipyard, China’s official military media has reported. Photographs in the official media and commercial satellite images show that the 250-meter-long vessels appear similar to flat-top amphibious assault ships in service with other advanced navies, including the US fleet. America currently has a fleet of eight Wasp and two America-class amphibious assault vessels.However, in a blow to US efforts to blunt the challenge from China, the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard caught fire on July 12 while tied up at its home port in San Diego. The ship was extensively damaged in the fire which burned for four days. It was unclear if the ship would be salvaged, the US Navy said.Since 2005, China has also built a fleet of six Type 071 amphibious ships, according to a 2019 report from the US Defense Intelligence Agency. These vessels can carry up to four air-cushion landing craft, similar to the hovercraft carried on US amphibious landing ships, as well as four or more helicopters, armored vehicles and troops on long-distance deployments, the report said. A seventh Type 071 is under construction, according to Western military analysts.China’s official shipbuilding industry journals have reported the 29,000-tonne Type 071 has command and control capabilities, a medical unit and accommodation for hundreds of marines. The 210-meter long vessel has a range of 10,000 nautical miles and reached a speed of 25 knots in trials, these reports said.To build the force that will embark on these ships, China began a rapid increase in the size of its marine force in 2017, according to Pentagon reports. Earlier, marines had been a low priority in the decades when China’s military built a massive ground force to defend the mainland. A regiment of marines was formed in 1953 and expanded to a division but then disbanded in 1957, according to an official timeline of major events in PLA history. It was reformed in 1979, the timeline shows.The US Defense Intelligence Agency report said China’s marine force is now organized into seven brigades, each with armor, infantry, artillery and missiles, and is the strongest force of this type among the rival claimants to disputed territories in the South China Sea. China’s marines “can simultaneously seize multiple islands in the Spratlys,” the report said, referring to a contested group of islands and reefs in the South China Sea. They could also rapidly reinforce China’s outposts in the Paracel Islands, another disputed territory in the same waterway. China does not publish detailed accounts of the disposition of its forces.Amphibious warfare specialists say these marines would also be useful for seizing other disputed territory, including the uninhabited group of isles in the East China Sea that are claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing - known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China.Selected army units are being transferred to the marines to boost the force’s capability, according to reports in the official Chinese military media and Western defense analysts. China’s official military newspaper, the PLA Daily, reported in April that two army units trained in aerial assault had been transferred to a marines brigade dedicated to helicopter landings.The Pentagon’s annual report on Chinese military power in 2018 revealed that a newly established headquarters under the command of the navy was responsible for staffing, training and equipping the expanding force. And, the report said, a new commander had been appointed to lead the marines. China’s state-controlled media has identified him as Major General Kong Jun, a former army officer who transferred to the marines in early 2017.Despite this build-up, the Pentagon and other Western military experts argue the PLA marines remain far less capable than the 186,000-strong US Marine Corps, with its extensive experience of amphibious and land operations.In its 2019 report on China’s military power, the Pentagon said most of the new PLA marines brigades were not yet manned and equipped to be fully operational. It said China’s marines lacked sufficient armored vehicles, helicopters and training to conduct complex amphibious operations.Some Western military experts suggest one reason for this: The top priorities for the PLA brass are the army amphibious units and air force airborne troops that would spearhead an attack on Taiwan. So, the marines “don’t have priority when it comes to things like amphibious tanks and helicopters,” said Easton of the Project 2049 Institute, who has written a book, The Chinese Invasion Threat, on the PLA’s preparations to conquer Taiwan.The ruling Communist Party has long wanted control of Taiwan for political reasons. The island also has huge strategic importance. It would give the PLA a key foothold in the so-called first island chain, the string of islands that run from the Japanese archipelago through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China’s coastal seas. From bases on Taiwan, Chinese warships, strike aircraft and missiles would dominate the sea lanes vital to Japan and South Korea. And Taiwan would be an ideal jump-off point for operations aimed at seizing further territory in the island chain.Newsham, the retired US Marine colonel, said the PLA had assembled a formidable army amphibious force and sufficient ships, military and civilian, to probably land enough troops on Taiwan as part of a full-scale attack that includes air, missile, naval and cyber assaults. “The PLA already has a lot lined up,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expands-amphibious-forces-in-challenge-to-us-beyond-asia/story-2iZc6whAtgSJ4gZGxQB3GJ.html
21-07-2020||World||‘We are a battleground now’: In Southeast Asia, US-China tensions flare on social media||Tensions between the United States and China over the South China Sea have erupted into a war of words on social media, in what analysts see as a change in US strategy amid a burgeoning superpower rivalry in Southeast Asia.After Washington last week hardened its position by explicitly rejecting Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea, US embassies in the region produced an unprecedented flurry of op-eds and statements criticising Beijing’s actions.China’s response was fiery, accusing Washington of “defaming China with untrue words so as to mislead the public” in the region.“We are a battleground now,” Renato de Castro, an analyst with the Albert Del Rosario Institute for Strategic and International Relations in the Philippines, told Reuters by phone. “It will be a long game.”A week ago, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Beijing’s claim to about 90% of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea “completely unlawful” and accused Beijing of seeking a “maritime empire”.US embassies in Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Cambodia followed up with comments on Facebook and in editorials in local news outlets saying that Beijing’s actions fitted a pattern of encroachment on others’ sovereignty.The US ambassador to Thailand accused Chinese dams of holding back water from the region’s Mekong river during a drought last year.The embassy in Yangon drew parallels between the South China Sea and ways it said China was interfering in Myanmar, citing investments it said could become debt traps, the trafficking of women to China as brides, and the inflow of drugs into the country.In a swift counterattack, China’s ambassador to Thailand accused Washington of “attempting to sow discord between China and other littoral countries”.In a Facebook post that twice referred to the United States as “dirty”, China’s Myanmar embassy said its agencies abroad were doing “disgusting things” to contain China and showed a “selfish, hypocritical, contemptible, and ugly face”. The statements attracted thousands of regional social media comments, many attacking China while questioning the motives of both countries.“Thank you USA for doing what is the law requires,” commented Chelley Ocampo under the U.S embassy in the Philippines’ Facebook post. After someone wrote on the US embassy in Malaysia’s page, “Imperial Yankee Go Home !!!!!!”, American diplomats replied, “Are you saying that you are ok with the PRC’s bullying tactics in the SCS?”‘CLARIFICATIONS AND REBUTTALS’Wang Wenbin, China’s foreign ministry spokesman, told a news conference in Beijing it was the “US that first published comments attacking and condemning China” and its diplomats were issuing clarifications and rebuttals in response.The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the apparently coordinated social media offensive.The war of words marks a strident new tack for U.S diplomacy in the region, analysts said.The US statements aimed to tie the South China Sea to local concerns “to depict Beijing as an unequivocal threat to the sovereignty of the Southeast Asian nations”, said Sebastian Strangio, author of an upcoming book on China’s regional influence.Meanwhile, China’s response was consistent with “pugnacious ‘Wolf-Warrior’ diplomacy” since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, he said, referring to increasingly nationalist Chinese rhetoric.Strains have become more evident in the South China Sea recently, with US and Chinese navies holding simultaneous exercises in a waterway that China claims over smaller rivals, including the Philippines and Vietnam, on the basis of history.China “couldn’t afford allowing the U.S to make appreciable gains in turning regional opinion”, said Collin Koh Swee Lean, a research fellow at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.“At least some of the Southeast Asian governments... may secretly, if not publicly, welcome the latest Pompeo statement and thereby possibly be emboldened to resist its moves in the disputed waters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-a-battleground-now-in-southeast-asia-us-china-tensions-flare-on-social-media/story-qK6ZEXVXtncwGYf6rHTUmJ.html
21-07-2020||World||Joe Biden campaign pitches Indian American voters as key to White House||Indian Americans have mostly voted for Democrats in the presidential elections. On November 3, they can do more, Democrats believe, and put former Vice-President Joe Biden in the White House.“The Indian American vote — the AAPI more broadly — can be an absolute difference maker,” Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said at a power-packed pitch to them at a virtual ton-hall recently, pointing to their demographics in the three Rust Belt swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that put Donald Trump in the White House in a stunning upset in 2016. The broader group AAPI in Perez’s remarks, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, include people of Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese and Indonesian descent.President Donald Trump won these three states narrowly by 0.2, 0.7 and 0.8 percentage points, respectively — 10,704, 46,765 and 22,177 votes. Together, they gave him their cumulative 46 electoral votes, a 304-227 victory over Hillary Clinton and the White House. (There are in all 538 electoral votes that decide a presidential elections in the US, not the popular vote, which Clinton won, in this instance by more than 3 million; 7 electors voted against their pledges).Indian Americans of voting age are in sufficient numbers in these states to obliterate Trump’s lead and put Biden across the finishing line, Democrats have argued. There are 125,000 Indian American voters in Michigan, 156,000 in Pennsylvania and 37,000 in Wisconsin, according to an analysis by AAPI Victory Fund, a Democratic group dedicated to ensuring the victory of AAPI candidates that had hosted the town-hall.The number of Indian Americans who voted in these three states in 2016, or did not, could not be immediately ascertained. But the countrywide turnout for the community was 62%, according to AAPI Data, the study cited by AAPI Victory Fund. It was the highest among AAPI communities with Japanese Americans, and was 6 points above the national turnout of 56%. There are an estimated 4 million people of Indian origin in the United States, but only about a third are eligible to vote — 1.3 million, according to AAPI Data. The rest are not, because they are either still on Green Card or are awaiting the completion of their naturalization process.Notwithstanding Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal, both Republican governors; and Ami Bera, Raja Krishnamurthi, Ro Khanna, Pramila Jayapal and Kamala Harris, members of US congress, and many state and city officials, Indian Americans are not a major factor in US elections yet. But they can play an outsize role in closely contested battleground states, also called swing states, that are neither deeply committed Democratic (such as New York and California) nor Republican (Texas and South Carolina) and who determine presidential elections.Apart from Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the Biden campaign is eyeing five other states that they believe are in play — Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas where Indian Americans can help the effort with their votes of 66,000, 193,000, 150,000, 111,000 and 475,000 respectively.“We know that there are important sectors of the Indian American community through out our country, throughout our battleground states,” said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign, and added, “And we want to make sure we were engaging and connecting directly” with them, their key leaders in these battleground states. And the key radio stations, newspapers, whatever else outlet it is that are speaking to them.Vinay Reddy, a new addition to Biden’s team of campaign speech writers, chipped in at the virtual town hall with an appeal to “uncles and aunties”, deploying a playful inside-joke among second generation Indian Americans about their parents, their “distant” relatives and their friends.The most poignant moment of the town-hall was Dr Murthy’s recollection of his swearing in as Surgeon General, after a brutal confirmation process. He choked up.“I will always remember what he did at that swearing in before it started when the cameras were off, in the back room behind the stage,” Murthy started, in a controlled and steady monotone that has become so familiar from his appearances on the Covid-19 epidemic on national television news networks.“I was gathered there with my mother, my father, my sister, my wife Alice, and my grandmother, who I was fortunate to still have with me and is still here about 15 feet away from me here in my house today. She was in a wheelchair. “When the Vice President walked in, he immediately saw her and went straight up to her. He got down on the floor on one knee and he took her hand in his hand and he looked into her eyes and said, ‘Grandma, look at what you’ve done’.“And he pointed to all the people who had assembled there.

The Chinese tech giant has however denied reports that alleged it as a threat to any country’s security.Shortly after the ban was announced, British government officials on Thursday met representatives from Japanese government bodies, including the National Security Secretariat as well as the National Centre of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, to seek cooperation.The Japanese side also acknowledged the need to collaborate with British companies in developing 5G technology.Three companies, including Huawei, Ericsson, and Nokia, control nearly 80 per cent of the global 5G base station market. NEC and Fujitsu control less than 1 per cent. Although Ericsson and Nokia are dominant in Britain at present, Japanese companies may be able to expand their market share in the country if they can meet their quality demands and offer low-cost products.A source from NEC told Nikkei that the company is already “in discussions” with the British side, while a source from Fujitsu said it is seeking opportunities to sell its products in Europe.The Japanese government has already decided to invest 70 billion yen (USD654 million) to support companies such as NEC to develop base station equipment and backbone networks. The funds come from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation, an independent administrative agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seeks-japan-s-help-to-develop-its-5g-wireless-networks/story-OKTwbrhEzxuvlPBvqxCanK.html
21-07-2020||World||Donald Trump tweets image of himself wearing mask, calls it ‘patriotic’||US President Donald Trump on Monday took to social media to post an image of himself wearing a face mask and indirectly called the act “patriotic” -- a clear pivot away from his earlier reluctance to wear a facial covering in public.“We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance,” the President wrote on Twitter with a photo of himself wearing a Covid mask-- nearly three months after the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended wearing masks in public.“There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favourite President!” he added.The image shows Trump wearing a mask with a presidential seal during his visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre earlier this month -- his first and only time so far donning a facial covering in public after months of refusing to be seen doing so in public amid the coronavirus pandemic.The shift to encouraging mask-wearing was primarily motivated by floundering poll numbers, a source close to the President told CNN.  We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance. There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President! pic.twitter.com/iQOd1whktNFor months, aides tried to get Trump to wear a mask, saying they could have “MAGA”, “Trump-Pence 2020” or even the American flag printed on them. But he steadfastly refused and only wore a mask once in public.But it wasn’t until a meeting with campaign aides at the White House last week, where aides bluntly told him even internal numbers showed Americans did not approve of his response to the contagious outbreak, according to an official who attended that meeting.Trump’s agreement to don a mask in public at Walter Reed came after heavy “pleading” by aides, according to a presidential adviser, who urged the President to set an example for his supporters by wearing a mask on the visit.On a trip to a Ford plant in May, for example, Trump said he wore a mask on parts of the plant tour where reporters were not allowed, saying he “didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.”But as the number of coronavirus cases grew across several states, more Republicans publicly endorsed mask-wearing in an attempt to depoliticise it as well as ramping up efforts to convince the President to support wearing a mask.Earlier in the spring, Trump had mocked Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden for wearing a mask, and during a press briefing in April, he suggested that it wouldn’t seem presidential.“(S)omehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk ... I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens. I don’t know, somehow I don’t see it for myself. Maybe I’ll change my mind,” Trump had said then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tweets-image-of-himself-wearing-mask-calls-it-patriotic/story-sZLmYdTWWeVK2z0anCctOM.html
21-07-2020||World||Melania Trump delivers lunch to firefighters and families in DC||Lunch was on the first lady during the coronavirus pandemic. The White House delivered lunch and possibly some reassurance to people in the nation’s capital who could use a helping of both.Melania Trump made some of the deliveries herself in her first public appearances in a face mask.Mrs. Trump had been making regular visits to schools, hospitals and other venues to promote her youth welfare initiative, “ Be Best. ” But after the pandemic forced classrooms to close and hospitals to bar visitors, it appears she turned to the White House kitchens for inspiration.The first lady showed up unannounced to visit with District of Columbia firefighters and emergency medical services personnel last week.She brought White House-prepared boxed lunches, tote bags, reusable face masks and hand sanitizer, her office said. She also met with police officers.The courtesy call came as President Donald Trump has made it clear that he stands with police and other law enforcement amid the nationwide calls for racial justice and changes to policing sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.She echoed her husband’s message — minus his finger-pointing blaming unrest on Democratic city leaders.“The president and I will continue to support our dedicated firefighters, police members, EMS personnel and other critical first responders who put their lives at risk each day in order to keep our neighborhoods safe,” Mrs. Trump said afterward in a written statement.A week earlier, the first lady slipped out of the White House on a surprise visit to deliver lunches, tote bags and other unspecified items to The Mary Elizabeth House, her office said.The center provides comprehensive family support to single mothers and their children.Video shared on her Twitter and Facebook accounts show the first lady in a yard at The Mary Elizabeth House and speaking through a face mask with women, some holding young children.She’s also seen handing out lunch boxes stamped with “Be Best,” and tote bags.It was the first public glimpse of the first lady in a face covering, in keeping with federal and local coronavirus guidelines.Mrs. Trump has offered the public a more consistent message about mask-wearing than the president, who flouted the guidelines before allowing himself to be seen wearing a mask in public on a visit earlier this month to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.In May, the first lady sent White House executive chef Cris Comerford, pastry chef Susie Morrison and other staff to deliver 150 boxed meals of chicken macaroni and cheese and broccoli florets to patients and staff at Children’s Inn at the National Institutes of Health.She has spent every Valentine’s Day since 2018 doing arts and crafts with children who stay at the inn while they receive medical treatment.In an accompanying letter addressed to her “dear friends” at the inn, Mrs. Trump said the meals were a “token of my sincere gratitude for your tireless work.” The lunch boxes were delivered cold, but with “perfect reheating instructions,” Javin Smith, the program operations manager at Children’s Inn, said in an email through a spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melania-trump-delivers-lunch-to-firefighters-and-families-in-dc/story-OSwCfXHmWV3VyGXWUabNcL.html

Moderna, which is among biotech’s hottest stocks, was also down as much as 18% as JPMorgan downgraded its rating to the equivalent of a hold. AstraZeneca data “fail to impress” in a competitive context, “the titers from immunized patients were lower than convalescent patients, whereas BioNtech and Moderna vaccines both elicited IgGs substantially higher than convalescent controls,” said Bernstein, Ronny Gal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-data-fails-to-impress-some-experts/story-kLiKahWVvipJnpbtorAO1O.html
21-07-2020||World||CanSino’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate shows promise||A Covid-19 vaccine developed by CanSino Biologics Inc and China’s military research unit has shown to be safe and induced immune response in most of the recipients, researchers said on Monday.The CanSino candidate, named Ad5-nCOV, is one of a handful of vaccines that have shown some promise in human testing and are gearing up for late-stage trials, along with projects involving Moderna Inc, BioNTech SE and Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.While CanSino’s vaccine has yet to start late-stage large-scale clinical trials to assess how well it works to prevent people from becoming infected, it has received the green light to be used in China’s military.The results from the mid-stage study, published in the medical journal Lancet, supports the testing of the vaccine candidate in a large trial, the study authors said.The vaccine candidate uses a virus called adenovirus to carry genetic material from the new coronavirus’ protein into the human body, a method also used by researchers at the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca for their vaccine candidate.The immune responses elicited by the vaccine might be undermined if the inoculated person has already developed high-level adenovirus immunity from a previous infection, Chinese researchers said in a peer-reviewed paper.CanSino counts Lilly Asia Ventures, backed by US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co, as its top shareholder, according to Refinitiv data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cansino-candidate-shows-promise/story-CkHQ7279kkOUCNCCYcyQYL.html

Human trials for the vaccine candidate in India are set to start in August this year. Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer, Serum Institute of India (SII), which is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by number of doses produced and sold globally, spoke to deputy health editor Rhythma Kaul about his company’s plans to manufacture the vaccine in India to ensure equitable access to low- and middle-income countries.How promising are the initial clinical trial results of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine?The trials have shown promising results and we are extremely happy about it. We will be applying for the licence for trials to the Indian regulator in a week’s time. As soon as they grant us permission, we will begin with the trials for the vaccine in India. In addition, we will soon start manufacturing the vaccine in large volumes.When do you expect to start human clinical trials of the vaccine candidate in India?We are planning to start human trials in India around August 2020.How many doses of vaccines will be produced in your Pune facility?We plan to produce at one billion doses of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine over the next one year.What kind of partnership exists between Serum Institute of India and AstraZeneca?At present, the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine is undergoing Phase-III clinical trials in different countries. The Serum Institute of India has entered a manufacturing partnership with AstraZeneca to produce the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine in India. Is it just for India, or are you also looking at markets outside the country?The vaccines will be for India and middle- and low- income countries across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/august-target-for-trial-of-oxford-vaccine-adar-poonawalla/story-0JpubqKQFkPyamopN4begJ.html
21-07-2020||World||Ray of light enters dark Covid tunnel||In the race for a vaccine for Covid-19, the Oxford University team was seen to be miles ahead in a fray that now includes 165 teams of researchers. While the first peer-reviewed study of its early-stage trials was published only Monday (two others beat it to that milestone earlier), the advantage the researchers have is in volumes – the Oxford team will have involved thousands of people in the trials by next month, a point at which others are likely to only be starting recruitment of such numbers.“It’s the most advanced vaccine anywhere,” Bloomberg Businessweek quoted Kate Bingham, chair of the UK government’s Vaccine Taskforce, as having told a parliamentary committee in early July. Behind this feat, however, is research that has spanned over two decades in search for a vaccine – first for Malaria, before it was tweaked to target Mers and Ebola. In particular, it involves two Oxford University professors: Adrian Hill and Sarah Gilbert. The two are part of Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, and Hill – who heads the institute – has worked with the particular technology behind the Covid-19 vaccine for decades now. The technique involves bioengineering a familiar virus (in this case, it’s a chimpanzee virus) to make it mimic the pathogen against which the researchers want inoculation. Also read: Vaccine results shot in the arm for Covid fightAccording to a New York Times report, Hill worked on this with Malaria as his target, and the first breakthrough came in 2014 when a vaccine based on the chimp virus that Hill tested was manufactured in a large enough scale to provide a million doses. Around the time, Gilbert tweaked the same chimpanzee virus – technically called an adenovirus -- to make a vaccine for Mers, which was also a coronavirus, the report said. This would lay the foundation on which the Covid-19 vaccine was built, and lessons that allowed the Oxford team to short-circuit some parts of the trial process.  This is because most other teams first start with small clinical trials of a few hundred participants to demonstrate safety. But since the platform was already tested, the Oxford researchers let ahead and enrolled thousands of people from the beginning – merging Phase 1 and Phase II. “We know the adverse event profile and we know the dose to use, because we’ve done this so many times before,” Bloomberg Businessweek quoted Gilbert as saying. “Obviously we’re doing safety testing, but we’re not concerned,” she added, according to a report published on July 15.In addition to being poised to complete late-stage trials sooner than the others, the Oxford vaccine is also likely to race ahead because of the ease with which it can be manufactured, the funding and collaborations involved, and the support it has received. Usually, traditional vaccines use a weakened version of a virus to trigger an immune response. But this technology comes requires painstaking precautions as well. Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe technology used in this case involves a virus that does not infect humans, making it safer and easier to scale up in the production stage. The pandemic, which has exacted a near-unprecedented human and economic toll, also led to a never-before-seen mobilisation of vaccine funding and development efforts. AstraZeneca has inked a $750 million deal with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to manufacture and distribute 300 million doses of the vaccine by the end of 2020, the drugmaker said in early June. It also agreed to a licensing deal with the Serum Institute of India to provide one billion doses of the vaccine to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the goal of 400 million produced by year’s end. In total, the deals will bring AstraZeneca’s overall supply capacity for Oxford’s vaccine candidate to more than two billion doses per year, the drugmaker said. The agreement will task CEPI with manufacturing the vaccine, while Gavi will handle procurement.While several countries, such as the United States and Russia, have struck separate deals with AstraZeneca, it remains to be seen how the licensing arrangement will work for India, which is among LMICs. Seventy-five countries have submitted expressions of interest to protect their populations and those of other nations through joining the COVAX Facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide, according to a statement by WHO last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ray-of-light-enters-dark-covid-tunnel/story-q4za3fF6YrkUVPGcE3e32J.html
21-07-2020||World||Vaccine results shot in the arm for Covid fight||A vaccine for Covid-19 developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca was safe and produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials, data showed on Monday, raising hopes that the world could soon find a way to stop the virus that has taken an unprecedented human and economic toll across the planet.Published in The Lancet, the peer-reviewed report showed that the 1,077 healthy adults who were given the AZD1222 vaccine did not develop any serious side effects, and their bodies developed an immune response that could protect people for a significant amount of time. The results came separately as two other vaccine candidates – one being developed in China and the other in Germany – reported positive results from their studies. The Oxford vaccine candidate is largely considered the front-runner since it has carried out trials on the widest set of people among all.Also read: Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate is safe, early results showAdrian Hill, the head of the Oxford University’s Jenner Institute that invented the vaccine candidate, said that it was possible that the vaccine would become available by the end of the year, news agency Reuters reported. “There might be a million doses manufactured by September: that now seems like a remarkable underestimate, given the scale of what’s going on,” said Hill, referring to the manufacturing capability of partner AstraZeneca.“Certainly there’ll be a million doses around in September. What’s less predictable than the manufacturing scale-up is the incidence of disease, so when there’ll be an endpoint,” he added. The widely followed Oxford vaccine trial is currently at an advanced stage, with studies being carried out in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. A collaboration has already been reached between Oxford, UK government and biopharma major AstraZeneca to produce the vaccine on a mass scale if the final results are also positive.  The Serum Institute of India is one of the global partners for its production, a deal that would involve the Pune-based facility producing 400 million doses that will be distributed across dozens of lower and middle-income countries such as India.The head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO) hailed the findings about the vaccine as “good news”. “We now need to move into larger-scale real-world trials,” Dr Michael Ryan told reporters at a news conference in Geneva, while warning: “there’s a long way to go”. “But it is good to see more data and more products moving into this very important phase of vaccine discovery.”“There is still much work to be done before we can confirm if our vaccine will help manage the Covid-19 pandemic,” vaccine developer Sarah Gilbert said, according to Reuters. “We still do not know how strong an immune response we need to provoke to effectively protect against Sars-CoV-2 infection,” she said, adding researchers needed to learn more about Covid-19 and continue late stage trials which have already commenced. More than 165 possible vaccines are in various stages of development with US drugmaker Pfizer and China’s CanSino Biologics also reporting positive responses for their candidates on Monday. Last week, another US company – Moderna – had its successful first phase trials reported in the journal NEJM.To date, Covid-19 has killed about 610,000 people worldwide and infected over 14 million in 196 countries since the outbreak first emerged in China late last year.Also read | Initial human trial of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine brings hope, found safe: All you need to knowExplaining how the Oxford vaccine works, study lead author Andrew Pollard said: “It uses a common cold virus (adenovirus) that infects chimpanzees, which has been weakened so that it can’t cause any disease in humans, and is genetically modified to code for the spike protein of the human Sars-CoV-2 virus.”“This means that when the adenovirus enters vaccinated people’s cells it also delivers the spike protein genetic code. This causes these people’s cells to produce the spike protein, and helps teach the immune system to recognise the Sars-CoV-2 virus,” he added.The immune system, Pollard explained, has two ways of finding and attacking pathogens: antibody and T cell responses. “This vaccine is intended to induce both, so it can attack the virus when it’s circulating in the body, as well as attacking infected cells. We hope this means the immune system will remember the virus, so that our vaccine will protect people for an extended period,” he said. According to The Lancet, an ideal vaccine should be effective after one or two shots, work in target populations including older adults and those with other health conditions, confer protection for a minimum of six months, and reduce onward transmission of the virus to contacts.The Lancet said the current trial is too preliminary to confirm whether the new vaccine meets these requirements, but Phase 2 (underway in the UK only) and phase 3 trials to confirm whether it effectively protects against Sars-CoV-2 infection are happening in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.“This is very positive news. A huge well done to our brilliant, world-leading scientists & researchers at the University of Oxford. There are no guarantees, we’re not there yet & further trials will be necessary – but this is an important step in the right direction,” said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“We are encouraged by the Phase I/II interim data showing AZD1222 was capable of generating a rapid antibody and T-cell response against Sars-CoV-2. While there is more work to be done, today’s data increases our confidence that the vaccine will work and allows us to continue our plans to manufacture the vaccine at scale for broad and equitable access around the world,” said AstraZeneca’s Mene Pangalos.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-results-shot-in-the-arm-for-covid-fight/story-E1trn7Ptg1EwCNnwTyrWVI.html

The timing of the hajj is determined by the position of the moon, in accordance with the Islamic lunar calendar.Last month, Saudi Arabia announced it would hold a “very limited” hajj, a decision fraught with political and economic peril as it battles a surge in coronavirus infections.It has seen some 253,349 cases so far including 2,523 deaths -- the highest toll among the Arab Gulf states.Although hajj officials said the pilgrimage would be restricted to 1,000 people already present in the kingdom, 70 percent of them foreigners and the rest Saudis, some press reports have said that 10,000 people may take part.The ritual will be restricted to medical professionals and security personnel who have recovered from the virus, the hajj ministry said.- Heavy blow -The decision to exclude pilgrims arriving from outside Saudi Arabia is a first in the kingdom’s modern history and has sparked disappointment among Muslims worldwide, although many accepted it was necessary due to the pandemic.The pilgrims will be tested for coronavirus before arriving in Mecca and are required to quarantine at home after the ritual, according to health officials.Saudi Arabia has seen an uptick in both confirmed infections and deaths from COVID-19 since easing movement restrictions in late May. It has yet to restore international air links.The hajj -- a must for able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lifetime -- could be a major source of contagion, as it packs millions of pilgrims into congested religious sites.The Saudi-based Muslim World League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation have backed the government’s move for the health and safety of pilgrims.But the decision still risks angering hardline Muslims for whom religion trumps health concerns.A scaled-down hajj represents a major loss of revenue for the kingdom, already reeling from the twin shocks of the virus-induced slowdown and a plunge in oil prices.The smaller year-round umrah pilgrimage was already suspended in March.Together, they add $12 billion to the Saudi economy every year, according to government figures.Hosting the hajj is a matter of prestige for Saudi rulers, for whom the custodianship of Islam’s holiest sites is their most powerful source of political legitimacy.But a series of deadly disasters over the years, including a 2015 stampede that killed up to 2,300 worshippers, has prompted criticism of the kingdom’s management of the pilgrimage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scaled-down-hajj-pilgrimage-to-start-july-29-saudi-officials/story-s3C0YXAORmF8cH1ZYNfBWP.html

Bridger, a native of Wyoming, US, according to his aunt, got bit on his face “several times” when he stood in the way of a dog attacking his younger sister.   My nephew is a hero who saved his little sister from an attacking dog. He, himself, took on the attack so that the dog wouldn’t get his sister. He later said, "If someone was going to die, I thought it should be me." He got home from the hospital last night. I know it’s a long shot, but I’m reaching out to the Avengers and other heroes so that they can learn about this latest addition to their ranks.

Bridger’s heroic saga has gone viral, ever since his aunt shared the account on Instagram, and many on screen superheroes have praised the young boy. “People who put the well beings of others in front of themselves are the most heroic and thoughtful people I know. I truly respect and admire your courage and your heart,” actor Mark Ruffalo, who portrays the role of Hulk/Bruce Banner in the Avengers film franchise, commented on the post. “Real courage isn’t dominating people or fighting against people or walking around like a tough guy. Real courage is knowing what is right to do and doing it even when it might end up hurting you somehow. You are more of man than many, many I have seen or known. With Admiration… Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/Hulk/Professor),” he wrote further.   I’m not an Avenger, but I know a superhero when I see one. I can only hope I’m half as brave in my life as you are in yours, Bridger.

The mine was leased by a labourer who does odd jobs to earn a living.Thirty five-year-old Anandilal Kushwaha owns the lease of the 8m X 8m shallow mine in Ranipura area of the district where the diamond was found, according to the officer. Usually, such a shallow diamond mine of 64 square metres is awarded on a lease for Rs 200 for six months, as per the officer.Mineral resources department officer at Panna, RK Pandey said, “Anandilal Kushwaha deposited the 10.69 carat diamond to our office and it may fetch about Rs 50 lakh when it is auctioned in the coming days.”He said, “The quality of the diamond is good and it is palm shaped which will require less cutting. A royalty tax of 11.5% and 1% TDS will be deducted from the amount of money received through the auction.”This is the second time that Kushwaha has found a diamond in his mine.“I was excited to have this diamond during Covid time and lockdown restrictions. It’s all due to God’s grace. This is the second time when I have found a diamond but earlier the size of the diamond I had dug up on July 14 was 70-cent.”Kushwaha had engaged eight other people to help him dig the mine. He said that he will distribute the money from the auction of the diamond equally among everyone.“Though the (lease of the) mine was awarded to me, I will distribute the amount fetched from auction of the diamond equally among all nine of us as it was our collective efforts in the past six months that we could get such a precious stone. I will spend the money on the education of my son and daughter and other requirements of the family. But one thing is certain that I will continue to apply for lease of mines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/labourer-digs-out-10-69-carat-diamond-worth-rs-50-lakh-from-shallow-mine-in-mp-s-panna/story-yaUjr3wGrOMQ5Xi53ssGGI.html

The team is also searching for one more MLA whose name does not figure in the FIR but he is a suspect,” said an SOG official requesting anonymity.Earlier, Rajasthan’s director general of police (DGP) Bhupendra Singh wrote to his counterparts in Haryana and Delhi seeking cooperation in the probe in two SOG cases related to audiotapes in which some people, including the MLA, are purportedly making deals to destabilise the Gehlot government.On Friday, an SOG team was not allowed to enter the ITC Grand Bharat hotel in Gurugram where several rebel MLAs were believed to have gathered as part of a rebellion of former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.The five-member special police team from Jaipur was surrounded by dozens of Haryana police personnel outside the luxury resort.On Sunday night also, another SOG team failed to question the rebel Congress legislator in Haryana’s Manesar. The SOG has registered three cases related to alleged horse trading attempts and arrested three people, all suspected middlemen – Ashok Singh, Bharat Malani and Sanjay Jain.Jain was arrested on Friday night on charges of offering money to Congress and independent MLAs with an aim to dislodge the government in Rajasthan. He has been in the SOG’s custody since Friday.HT had earlier reported that Jain was given a budget of Rs 100 crore from an unidentified mastermind to lure three lawmakers.In another development, a local court in Jaipur rejected the bail application of Bharat Malani, who was arrested on July 11 .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cops-stay-put-in-manesar-delhi-to-quiz-elusive-rebel-mla/story-8ZAOdi6Q5QqJ4xCzYIHphN.html
21-07-2020||India||Three students who wrote Kerala engineering entrance exam test positive||Three students who wrote the Kerala Engineering Architecture and Medical (KEAM) entrance examination have tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday even as the opposition slammed chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for ignoring their warning and conducting the examination.Two of the infected students are from Thiruvananthapuram and the third is from Kozhikode in north Kerala. A parent also tested positive in the state capital. But the CM downplayed it saying desperate opposition was trumping up issues to put the state’s Coved-19 record in a bad light. He said there was no need to worry in this regard.At least 88,000 students had appeared for the KEAM examination on July16 in the midst of lockdown in many areas. Many opposition leaders including Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor had requested the government to postpone it in view of the pandemic situation but the CM rejected them citing the earlier instances of holding SSLC and higher secondary examinations. Also Read: UAE consulate’s charity handout puts Kerala minister under scanner in gold smuggling caseAfter the examination, photos and videos of large crowds of students and parents had appeared on social media and many took a dig at the government for conducting such an examination where social distancing could not be observed despite the state capital being under lockdown.“The CM takes everything personally and is adamant on his stand. We all pleaded considering the impending danger but he ignored our pleas. We wish he could have heard our pleas,” said Congress leader P C Vishnunath. Meanwhile, the state has reported 720 new cases of coronavirus, taking the total to 13,994. Out of these, 8,056 are active cases and 5,892 have recovered. With one more death, total casualties went up to 45. Among the 720 new cases, 528 are locally- transmitted ones, including 17 among the health workers and six among the paramilitary personnel, said the CM, adding there was a concerted bid to portray the state’s good work in a bad light.“Our main concern is to limit the damage and save as many lives as possible in trying times. But some people are out to sabotage it. They are quite intolerant towards the recognition the state is earning,” he said.He asked the opposition to spell out its contribution in six-month’s fight against the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-students-who-wrote-kerala-engineering-entrance-exam-test-positive/story-GOplZv3XFTpXcNUMpp3hOO.html

Except, the package is not an ordinary one. The box has seven small containers inside, each carrying the precious breast milk of Wangdus’ wife for their newborn, who underwent a complex life-saving surgery recently at a private hospital here. The boy was born through a C-section on June 16 at Sonam Nurboo Memorial Hospital in Leh and 30-year-old Dorjey Palmo found out that her baby was unable to suckle when she tried to feed him. “I was in Mysore when my family in Leh contacted me and my Guruji’s family members, who are doctors, suggested sending the baby immediately to Delhi or Chandigarh at a bigger hospital. So, my wife’s brother, Jigmat Gyalpo, took a flight from Leh and brought my child to Delhi on June 18 morning,” Wangdus said. Wangdus, who works as a manager in an educational institution in Mysore, took a flight too and reached early morning on the same day. Leh and Delhi are 1000-km apart by road and a direct flight takes one hour and 15 minutes. “I only once took my child in my hands when he was two days old. I didn’t touch him much because I had travelled from Karnataka and there was so much Covid scare. My brother-in-law carried him,” he told PTI. Upon landing at the Delhi airport, the baby was rushed by his father and uncle to the Max hospital, Shalimar Bagh in an ambulance and was admitted to its NICU (neonatal intensive care unit), hospital authorities said. At Max hospital, Dr Harshwardhan, Principal Consultant, Paediatric Department, diagnosed the baby with tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, which he said, is not very uncommon, but affects about “three in every thousand children”. Basically, in this condition, the child’s food pipe and trachea were connected, and it was unable to feed. When the child was brought to our nursery, the baby also had a respiratory infection “so we had to stabilise him first,” he said. “We conducted the surgery, lasting about three hours, the next day and it was a complex surgery, considering the baby was just four-days-old. But, the surgery was successful,” he said. The doctor said the baby was kept in NICU for three days and fed through nose via a tube, when he suggested the father about the need of mother’s milk. Wangdus said his friends at Leh airport, a very generous private airline which ferried the box free of cost every day, and “good-hearted passengers” helped the family in getting a daily supply of the mother’s milk from Leh to Delhi to fortify the baby who was recovering from the surgery. “My wife was unable to travel to Delhi due to the coronavirus scare and therefore we had to manage in this manner,” he said. “From end of June, this has been our routine, and on alternate days, I and my brother-in-law, go to Delhi’s T3 terminal and wait eagerly for the box, which have our contact numbers on it,” he said. “Today, my brother-in-law collected it, and my wife will keep sending the milk till our last day in Delhi,” the father said. Each box has seven containers, of 60 ml capacity each, and every day the boxes are also returned to Leh for refill the next day, Wangdus added. An emotionally overwhelmed father, said, his gurus in Bangalore were sending blessings every day for his well-being and “so many good souls have helped us through this journey in this difficult time. “Two days ago, my Guruji named my child Rigzin Wangchuk. Our flight tickets are booked for Friday, and we all will be going home finally,” he said. Wangdus said the baby’s mother, who works in the Revenue Department in Leh, is on maternity leave and eagerly waiting to hold her child back in her arms. “Every day, she was sending not just her milk for the newborn, which is needed for his healthy growth, but also her love for her child, from 1000 km away. I am happy, my baby is alright now,” he said. Max hospital, Shalimar Bagh is a dedicated Covid-19 facility and Dr Harshvardhan said, the baby was brought to the nursery section of the hospital which has no coronavirus cases. “Post-surgery, we also ran a COVID test on the baby just to be sure, and it came negative. We are very happy that the healthy baby will now be reunited with her mother on Friday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/journey-of-1000-km-mother-s-milk-sent-daily-from-leh-for-newborn-in-delhi-hospital/story-Qdce59iV8qCnSXoCUBsB6H.html

21-07-2020||India||Commerce minister Piyush Goyal proposes ‘preferential trade agreement’ with the US||Commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday proposed a “preferential trade agreement” with the US covering a limited number of goods and services as the next step after the signing of a “quick” trade deal that was just a few phone “calls” away and before the conclusion of a more ambitious Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that could take years.India and the United States have been working on a limited trade deal to expressly address the more urgent issues of concern to both sides and have said they planned to start negotiations on a broader Free Trade Agreement (FTA) later in the year, either before or after US elections in November.“Another couple of calls and we should be able to sort that out,” the minister said of the deal currently under negotiations. He was participating virtually an annual summit of the US-India Business Council (USIBC, a trade body), which was to take place in New Delhi but was being held virtually in view of the Covid-19 epidemic.But as the two countries worked towards a “much more sustainable, much more robust and much more enduring” partnership in the form of an FTA, which may take years to conclude, the two sides “should also look at early harvest in the form of a preferential trade agreement”, Goyal said.It could include “may be 50, may be 100 products and services” where the two sides could engage with “mutual trust and open spirit” to “kickstart” the trade partnership, the minister added.No other details were available of this interim trade pact. But people familiar with trade talks between the two sides, which have been on a long time but with renewed urgency for the last one year, said the idea is to keep the “ball moving” by continuing to address trade issues in small and manageable and not wait for the FTA, which will be a long and tedious process.The “quick” deal, as the minister described it, has been ready and waiting to be signed, but is being held over a “frustrating” desire from the US side to “squeeze” out as much as it can.According to the same people familiar with the talks, the United States has pushed for greater market access in agriculture, dairy and medical devices sectors in the limited trade agreement being finalised. India has sought restoration of preferential trade benefits under the US Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which were terminated by the Trump administration in summer of 2019 to force India’s hand.President Donald Trump’s insistence on trade deficit reduction and reciprocity precipitated a trade crisis between the countries, bringing long simmering issues to a head. He first slapped higher tariff on steel and aluminium imports from India and then evicted India from the GSP programme, which accounted for $6.3 billion worth of Indian exports to the United States in 2018, roughly 12% of total Indian goods exports to the United States.The two sides had tried to stitch together a Phase 1 of the deal in time for announcement during Trump’s February visit to India, but failed; Indians had complained about the constant sifting of the goalpost. The two sides announcement then a plan to wrap a limited deal shortly and a larger deal later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/commerce-minister-piyush-goyal-proposes-preferential-trade-agreement-with-the-us/story-kD2wZ8rXF1ldArRKjxM9LJ.html

All the 50 wards under Tirupati municipal corporation had been affected with some wards reporting more than 40 positive cases for Covid-19,” he said.Except those catering to essential services like medical shops and milk vendors, all the other business establishments, including wine shops and banks, would remain closed. The grocery shops and vegetable markets would be allowed only from 6 to 11 am.No private vehicles, autorickshaws and public transport would be available in the town, except for those who have medical emergencies and go to the hospitals, the collector said.“We shall review the situation on July 31 and take a call as to whether to continue the lockdown or end it on August 5,” Gupta said and reminded that the recent 45-day lockdown in Srikalahasti, another pilgrim centre about 35 kilometres from Tirupati, had yielded excellent results.Strangely, the TTD authorities are yet to take a decision on the closure of the Lord Venkateshwara temple atop the Tirumala hills for darshan of the pilgrims, who cannot reach the pilgrim centre without entering Tirupati town.Tirupati municipal commissioner PS Girisha clarified that the Road Transport Corporation had arranged buses from the RTC bus stand directly to Tirumala for the sake of pilgrims, who should not move anywhere in the town. No restaurants or shops would be available for them in Tirupati.“Those coming by their own vehicles or hired vehicles should go to the hills via Tirumala bypass road and should not enter the town. They could buy food parcels in the restaurants located on the bypass road,” he said.Meanwhile, the TTD announced curtailment of darshans for pilgrims in the wake of restrictions imposed by the district authorities. Starting Tuesday, the TTD stopped offline sale of 3,000 darshan tickets which was offered to pilgrims at Bhudevi Complex located at Alipiri.“Since the entire area has now come under lockdown, the facility for direct purchase of darshan tickets has been closed till further notice,” a TTD official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirupati-a-containment-zone-shut-for-14-days-tirumala-temple-stays-open/story-czECvZ5Sr4ampmWDpifQkI.html

The private taxi, bearing a Delhi registration number plate, was returning to the national capital carrying two passengers after dropping two others at Dugadda near Kotdwar, the police said.“The incident occurred at around 2 pm, when the private taxi was heading towards Kotdwar town from Dugadda after dropping two passengers there. The vehicle’s driver is identified as Bhupender Singh, a resident of Uttarakhand’s Champawat district, but lived with his family in south Delhi’s Munirka area. He used to drive a private taxi in Delhi. On his way back, Singh picked up two passengers for Kotdwar,” said Manoj Raturi, station house officer (SHO), Kotdwar police station. “The car got swept away on the way, as the mud came down flowing at a high speed from uphill into a monsoon-fed rivulet alongside the road. Though Singh was thrown out of the car, he was rescued. Unfortunately, he succumbed to his injuries later. While the other two passengers in the car got swept away,” the SHO added.A search operation has been launched by the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) authorities along with local police personnel to trace the two missing persons, Raturi said.“The missing persons are suspected to have been swept far away from the spot, as the water current is strong. Their footwears were found at least 500 metres away from where they went missing. Perhaps, their bodies will be found after the water level goes down,” he added.In Udham Singh Nagar district, two minor boys drowned in a pond, whose water level has increased due to rainfall, on Monday while taking a bath.Kuldeep Singh Adhikari, in-charge of the ITI police station at Kashipur, said, “Two boys drowned in a pond at Paiga village in Kashipur on Monday. They have been identified as Asif Ali (13) and Robin (9).”Dr. Rajiv Chauhan of LD Bhatt Government Hospital said the minor boys were brought dead on arrival.Intermittent rains continued across the Himalayan state on Tuesday and waterlogging incidents were reported from many parts.In Haridwar district, waterlogging affected traffic movement at several places, including Chandracharya Chowk, Bhagat Singh Chowk, Sandesh Nagar Colony, Vivek Vihar, Awas Vikas, Kankhal, Jwalapur, Moti Bazaar, and parts of Ranipur.In Chamoli district, NK Joshi, district disaster management officer, said the road leading to Badrinath shrine is still blocked near Pipalkoti, a landslide-prone zone, due to falling of debris from the mountain.“Though the blockade, which was on since Monday, was partially lifted on Tuesday afternoon, the falling debris from the mountain has disrupted traffic flow again,” Joshi added.On Tuesday afternoon, India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert --- the public is urged to steer clear of potentially dangerous areas --- for the next 24-hours in five districts, including Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, and Chamoli.The IMD authorities have advised the district administrations to be on their guard and maintain a strict vigil at settlements such as people living nears banks of rivulets, streams, and landslide-prone areas.On Wednesday, heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to occur at isolated places in Uttarakhand’s Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Dehradun, Haridwar, Tehri, Pauri, and Nainital districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-dead-2-missing-as-incessant-rains-lash-uttarakhand/story-iWQCLadPHRwvnLlPezfh6H.html
21-07-2020||India||Bihar cracks whip on pvt hospitals to treat Covid-19 cases||The Bihar government Tuesday roped in private hospitals in an effort to boost the number of beds available to Covid-19 patients following a nudge by the Centre.“The government has authorised district magistrates to identify private health facilities in Covid management,” Anupam Kumar, secretary, Information and Public Relations Department, Bihar told reporters.On Monday, Patna civil surgeon Dr Raj Kishore Chaudhary had issued an order notifying 290 beds for Covid-19 patients across 18 private health facilities in the state capital.He said the government had to force the private facilities into treating Covid-19 patients as they were reluctant to do so.“The private facilities will have to treat Covid-19 patients in times of pandemic. If they do not, we will lodge FIRs against them. The government can even take over their hospitals, along with their staff and doctors and force them to treat Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Chaudhary.Hitech Emergency, GS Neuroscience (10 beds each), Arvind Hospital (13), Medical Magadh Hospital, Dr Bimal Hospital & Research Center (25 beds each), Heart Hospital (14), Murlidhar Memorial Hospital (10), Anup Institute of Orthopaedic, AS Nursing Home (4), Paras HMRI Hospital (30), Curris Hospital (18), Mahavir Vatsalya Hospital (14), Palm View Hospital, Midversal Hospital (12 each), Ruban Memorial Hospital, Patliputra Colony (40), Tara Hospital, near Gandhi Maidan (9), Buddha Cancer Centre (7) and Nestva Hospital (12) were among the 18 private centres the Patna district administration had asked to keep isolation beds for Covid-19 patients.These hospitals have 1,254 beds, with 343 ICU beds of which 72 had ventilator facilities in them, according to the order issued by the Patna civil surgeon.“As of now, we have asked private hospitals to allot 25% of their total beds for management of Covid patients. Going ahead, if need arises, we will ask them to convert the entire hospital into dedicated Covid facilities,” said Dr Chaudhary.Also read: Bodies lie in Covid-19 ward in Patna’s NMCH, a hospital without mortuaryDespite the Patna district administration having issued the order on Monday, with explicit instructions to the management of private hospitals to begin Covid-19 isolation facility with immediate effect, most of these facilities were yet to begin admitting such cases on Tuesday.In addition to better management of its healthcare facilities, a central team, which was here on Sunday and Monday, had asked the state government to increase the number of beds in view of the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases.On Tuesday, Bihar’s Covid-19 tally stood at 28,564 with a doubling rate of 12 days. If infections were to grow at this rate, Bihar would cross 1 lakh cases in less than a month, for which the state had to be prepared, the Central team had pointed out during its discussion with senior state functionaries.The Central team was also critical of the unfettered movement in Rajeev Nagar locality, which was a buffer zone, as the entire stretch between road numbers 1 and 22 had been marked as a containment zone. The team, which found lack of police personnel, and unhindered movement of vegetable vendors in the area, called for better access control in containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-cracks-whip-on-pvt-hospitals-to-treat-covid-19-cases/story-SM4s7AnaCWcCXgoKg7Y3HJ.html
21-07-2020||India||Amarnath Yatra cancelled due to Covid-19, aarti to be broadcast live||The annual Amarnath Yatra has been cancelled due to the continuous rise in Covid 19 cases across Jammu and Kashmir. Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board on Tuesday said the virtual darshan of one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimages devoted to lord Shiva will continue to be telecast live during the morning and evening prayers, which will continue at the shrine, located at a height of 13,000 feet from the sea level.“Based upon the prevailing circumstances, the Board decided with heavy heart that it is not advisable to hold and conduct this year’s Shri Amarnathji Yatra and expressed its regret to announce the cancellation of Yatra 2020,” an official spokesman of the board said.The spokesperson said that the traditional rituals shall be carried out at the shrine without any interruption“The Board is aware of and respects the sentiments of millions of devotees and to keep the religious sentiments alive, the Board shall continue the live telecast/ virtual darshan of the morning and evening Aarti,” the spokesman added.The decision was taken at the 39th board meeting of SASB, attended by the lieutenant governor Girish Chandra Murmu as its chairman and other board members.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe board discussed the Supreme Court order dated 13.07.2020, which left the decision to conduct the Yatra to the administration after assessing the ground realities prevailing in Jammu & Kashmir.The Board was informed that the arrangements were on track since February 2020, but due to the nationwide lockdown, the state executive committee of Jammu and Kashmir had decided to keep religious places closed for the public. These prohibitions continue till 31st July.The Board further discussed that the pandemic has put the health administration system to its limit as a sharp spike in new Covid cases in July has put strain on the system. Health workers and security forces are also getting infected and the focus of the entire medical, civil and police administration was on containing the pandemic.Also Read: CM lauds Uttarakhand HC’s ruling on Charm Dham BoardTheir discussions underlined that diversion of resources for the Yatra will put immense strain on administration and will unnecessarily put the yatris at risk of catching Covid-19.The board also took the views of the government into consideration. The government had reasoned against holding the Yatra this year in larger public interest.The cancellation comes despite the administration making necessary arrangements for conducting a curtailed pilgrimage through a shorter Baltal track in Ganderbal district.Various government departments and security agencies had also made all preparations to welcome the pilgrims.Last year, the Amarnath Yatra was curtailed following intelligence inputs of terror threats and violence ahead of BJP led central government’s move of abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and in 2018, the pilgrimage was held for 60 days.The Amarnath cave is considered to be one of the holiest shrines in Hinduism and hundreds of thousands of devotees undertake the arduous annual pilgrimage in south Kashmir Himalayas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarnnath-yatra-cancelled-due-to-covid-19-aarti-to-be-broadcast-live/story-OAMfJ2HODtcjCMTtni0SZM.html

21-07-2020||India||Rajasthan police recovers Rs 1.25 crore in MLA horse trading probe, suspects being questioned||Rajasthan police’s special operations group (SOG) which is probing the alleged horse-trading attempts to bring down Ashok Gehlot government has claimed to have recovered Rs 1.25 crore from the possession of three people, who are being questioned, reported officials quoted by a news agency.“In an operation by the special operations group (SOG) in Udaipur, Rs 1.25 crore was recovered from the possession of three people in two cars. They are being questioned regarding the money,” ANI posted a statement attributing it to the SOG and the ATS (anti terror squad) of Rajasthan police, both involved in investigating the cases surrounding the alleged plot to overthrow the state government primarily using lure of money.The SOG had earlier last week arrested three persons including one Sanjay Jain, who it alleged, has been enticing Congress MLAs and independent legislators by offering them money to ditch the Congress-ruled government in the statement. The unit claims that the other two arrested in the case -- Ashok Singh and Bharat Malani – are all suspected middlemen.Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot tells Cong MLAs backing him to ‘stand firm like a rockOn Sunday, officials in the SOG had claimed that Sanjay Jain was given a budget of Rs 100 crore to buy out three MLAs including Rs 25 crore for an Independent MLA.The developments follow allegations by Congress leadership that Congress rebel and former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot and his 18 loyal MLAs from the Congress party were directly involved in the plot to overthrow the government in cahoots with the BJP, the principal opposition party in the state. Pilot and the BJP have denied the allegations and accused Rajasthan chief minister of using horse-trading allegations as a ruse to sideline Sachin Pilot, a contender for chief minister’s position in the state.The SOG, however, claims that the investigations point to a deeper political controversy. It alleged Jain was a “small link” to a “long chain” trying to topple the government. “Both Jain and Singh have strong financial background and political links,” one of the police officers had said on Sunday without naming the backers.SOG’s efforts to question one of the rebel MLAs—Bhanwar Lal Sharma—have not been successful so far, since he remains ensconced in a Haryana hotel with other rebels close to Sachin Pilot.Also Read: CBI questions CM Gehlot’s aide, MLA over cop suicide amid Rajasthan crisisRajasthan police’s director general Bhupendra Yadav has written to his counterparts in Haryana and Delhi and sought their cooperation in conducting the probe. Rajasthan police claims Bhanwarlal Sharma’s voice was one the three audio clips that refer to the plot to bring down Gehlot government. The SOG was held up by Haryana police when they late last week tried to raid the hotel where rebels including Sharma are said to be staying. The BJP has accused the Gehlot government of unauthorised phone tapping of politicians and demanded a CBI probe into the matter. However, the state government withdrew the general consent accorded to the central agency to probe cases in the state, making permission from the state a prerequisite for any CBI probe in its jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-police-recovers-rs-1-25-crore-in-mla-horse-trading-probe-suspects-being-questioned/story-AHzFKjFenZAlIaPccgRt0O.html
21-07-2020||India||Lucknow police recover 112 stolen cars worth Rs 11 cr in month-long ops||The Lucknow police said they have seized 62 cars including luxury four-wheelers from a gang of car thieves on Tuesday, a month after they seized 50 cars from the same gang.Police said the 112 cars are worth Rs 11 crore.Twelve people, including the owners of a second-hand car sales market, motor spare parts’ traders, mechanics as well as insurance agents were arrested. The gang had been operational for at least 20 years, police said.Police officials said these stolen vehicles were sold to politicians, businessmen and other white-collar people after preparing forged papers and changing their chassis numbers and registration plates. The cars included Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Honda City, Innova, Safari and Swift Dzire.Lucknow’s Commissioner of Police (CP) Sujeet Pandey said the team led by Vibhuti Khand assistant commissioner of police Swatantra Kumar Singh recovered 62 luxury four wheelers from different places after the arrest of seven people on Tuesday.He said that earlier, five people were arrested and 50 luxury four wheelers were recovered on June 21. Interrogation of those arrested and a subsequent investigation led to Tuesday’s developments.ACP Swatantra Kumar Singh said the recovery of 112 luxury four wheelers from a vehicle lifters’ gang is the biggest catch ever in terms of number of vehicles. He said 104 four-wheelers had been recovered from a single gang by the Maharashtra police a few years ago.“The entire operation to identify and trace gang members lasted for over a month, during which electronic surveillance as well as traditional ways of ground intelligence helped unearth the entire nexus,” said the ACP.He said the gang may have sold over 2,000 stolen vehicles to different people in the past 10 years. The stolen vehicles were sold in different parts of the country and even in Nepal, the police officer said.Singh said those arrested on Tuesday included the key accused Satpal Singh, who deals in sale of stolen four-wheelers through different mediums, including second hand car sales market as well as online platforms.Among the other six were four spare parts’ traders Manoj Kumar alias Bauwa, Enamule Haq, Vikas Jasiwal alias Vicky and Zia-ul-Haq, and two persons Israr and Vinod Sharma, who work in car repairing and denting workshops.“Before selling these at throwaway prices, they changed the chassis and engine numbers of these vehicles,” the ACP explained. “The vehicle’s details were verified from the forensic lab, which confirmed that it was stolen and its engine and chassis numbers were changed,” he said.MODUS OPERANDIThe gang members first bought cars which were totally damaged in accidents and also acquired the papers of these vehicles from owners. They would then steal a car of the same make and replace its engine and chassis numbers with that of the damaged car. They also changed the identification chip of the vehicle. After making these changes, they used to sell the car to a gullible customer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lucknow-police-recover-112-stolen-cars-worth-rs-11-cr-in-month-long-ops/story-qoYW8zAm1dKAf2u2QCdumK.html
21-07-2020||India||Assam flood situation continues to remain grim, over 24 lakh people still affected||Assam’s flood situation continues to remain grim on Tuesday, as over 24 lakh people are still hit hard across the north-eastern state, which keeps a date with monsoon fury every year.Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) authorities said of the 33 districts in the state, 24 are still reeling under floods.Goalpara in lower Assam is the worst-affected, as 4.58 lakh population is estimated to have been ravaged by floods.Barpeta and Morigaon districts are the other worst-hit districts, where 3.52 lakh and 3.15 lakh population, respectively, are braving the monsoon menace.Around 44,500 people have been displaced by floodwaters and have taken shelter at 397 relief camps, where local administrations are pulling out all stops to ensure maintaining social distancing norms and other precautionary measures amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.On Tuesday, two more deaths, due to drowning, were reported from Nagaon and Morigaon districts, as the toll climbed to 85, which is significantly higher than Covid-19-related fatalities at 58 to date.Another 26 lives in the state have been lost due to landslides caused by heavy rains since May.Rescue personnel evacuated 869 stranded people by boats in nine of the flood-hit districts on Tuesday and shifted them to safer locations on higher grounds. Floodwaters have inundated cropland, measuring up to 1.10 lakh hectares (ha) across the state.ASDMA’s latest bulletin said 66 roads in six flood-affected districts are either submerged or damaged.At least six bridges have been damaged, including five and one in Darrang and Barpeta districts, respectively.Darrang is located on the north bank of the mighty Brahmaputra river, which is flowing above the danger mark, along with Dhansiri, Jia Bharali, Kopili, Beki, Gaurang, Kushiyara and Sankosh rivers, at several places, Central Water Commission (CWC) authorities said.While 90% of 430 square-kilometre Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNTPR) -- the largest habitat of one-horned rhinos in the world. – is submerged, the authorities said.So far, 116 wild animals, including nine rhinos, have drowned to death in and around the park this monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-flood-situation-continues-to-remain-grim-over-24-lakh-people-still-affected/story-OoSoWjFXbZLQMc3MtjEG5K.html
21-07-2020||India||Indian Navy to move MiG-29K fighter jets to north amid border row with China||The Indian Navy is deploying its MiG-29K fighter jets to key air force bases in the northern part of the country amid border tensions with China in the sensitive Ladakh sector, people familiar with developments said on Tuesday.The navy has a fleet of more than 40 MiG-29K fighters, of which 18 are deployed on the country’s sole aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya, and the rest are based in Goa.Some of the Russian-origin jets are being moved from Goa to Indian Air Force (IAF) bases in the north, keeping in mind the security scenario, an official said. The IAF has moved several fighters from airbases in north India to Ladakh sector as part of a plan to strengthen the military posture there, said a second official.It couldn’t immediately be ascertained what role the naval fighters would be used for.“If assets and operational pilots are available, why not utilise them,” said naval affairs expert Captain (retired) DK Sharma.The Indian Navy has been part of the military’s ongoing efforts in Ladakh sector, which has been the focus of the standoff since 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash on June 15. The navy’s P-8I maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft have been used for surveillance of Ladakh sector, while their primary role encompasses carrying out anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and surveillance and reconnaissance of the oceans. The P-8Is, imported from the US, carried out similar surveillance missions during the 2017 Doklam standoff with China.The navy has also been active in the Indian Ocean, where it is keeping a close watch on possible Chinese naval activities. On Monday, a US Navy carrier strike group, led by USS Nimitz, conducted maritime drills with Indian warships in the Indian Ocean. The passage exercise involved a total of eight Indian and US warships.The drills came at a time when tensions have mounted over China’s activities in South China Sea, where the US Navy has conducted a major exercise involving two carrier strike groups.The navy has been on operational alert in the Indian Ocean, where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. It has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communication and choke points under its mission-based deployment model, and the vessels can be diverted for any mission.Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait, and from northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-to-move-mig-29k-fighters-to-north-amid-border-row/story-yU5X9WP1VxjVHvqOuLNoYO.html
21-07-2020||India||Relationship with India important, monitoring LAC very closely: US defense secretary||At a time when China is engaging in “systematic rule-breaking” and coercion, the US sees its growing security cooperation with India as “one of the all important defence relationships of the 21st century”, US defence secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday.The exercise in the Indian Ocean between Indian Navy warships and a US Navy carrier strike group led by the USS Nimitz reflects the shared commitment of the two countries to boost naval cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific, he said.Delivering a speech on the US strategy and vision for security in the Indo-Pacific during a virtual event organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Esper didn’t directly refer to the India-China border standoff but made numerous references to what he described as rule-breaking and coercive behaviour by Beijing, especially in South China Sea and against members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean).Also read: Indian Navy to move MiG-29K fighter jets to north amid border row with ChinaHe made a special mention of burgeoning India-US security ties, which in recent years have expanded to the 2+2 dialogue between the foreign and defence ministers and big ticket deals for defence hardware, including aircraft and missile systems.“I want to highlight our increased defence cooperation with India, one of the all important defence relationships of the 21st century,” he said. Also read: US agrees to discuss social security tax burden of Indians working in America“We conducted the first ever joint military exercise last November and as we speak today, the USS Nimitz is conducting combined exercises with the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean, demonstrating our shared commitment to stronger naval cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific.”Esper added: “We also continue to grow our defence sales and look forward to a robust 2+2 ministerial dialogue later this year to build on this progress.”On the other hand, China has continued to engage in “systematic rule-breaking, coercion and other malign activities” amid the Covid-19 crisis, while the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has engaged in “aggressive behaviour” in the East and South China Seas, including sinking a Vietnamese fishing boat, harassing Malaysian oil and gas development, and escorting Chinese fishing vessels into Malaysia’s exclusive economic zone, he said.Asked about the India-China standoff during the question-and-answer session after his speech, Esper said the US is “monitoring it very closely and what’s happening along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)”. He said the US was “very pleased to see that both sides are trying to de-escalate the situation”.In response to a separate question, Esper said the exercise between the Indian Navy and the carrier strike group led by USS Nimitz “shows the growing cooperation between our countries and our ability to project power into the region and to sustain it with our allies and partners”.The US, he noted, is encouraging Indo-Pacific nations to expand intra-regional security relationships and networks of like-minded partners. In this regard, he pointed to the logistical support agreement finalised by India and Australia in June.Esper also referred to what he said was China’s “catalogue of bad behaviour” that accompanies a pattern of disregard for international commitments, failure to uphold commitments under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and disregard for the rights of other countries under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).China, he added, had bullied Asean nations out of an estimated $2.6 trillion in potential offshore oil and gas revenues and cut off access to important fishing grounds even as it made incursions into waters around Japan’s Senkaku Islands and looked the other way as North Korea violated UN Security Council resolutions related to its nuclear programme.“We call on China’s leaders to abide by the international laws and norms that China and the Chinese people have benefited greatly from over the years. While we hope the [China] will change its ways, we must be prepared for the alternative,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relationship-with-india-important-monitoring-lac-very-closely-us-defense-secretary/story-M1DDjM4umFt6BrgfXJoIiL.html
21-07-2020||India||India begins discussion on distribution of coronavirus vaccine, Indigenous candidates also in race||Indian government has said that it has already started to discuss the criteria and method for mass distribution of the coronavirus vaccine following reporting of encouraging results from human trials of international and indigenous vaccine candidates.Even as several leading vaccine candidates across the world are in a race to produce the first reliable medical intervention to block the spread of coronavirus, Indian government has indicated that the country was in an advantageous position for two reasons—firstly because one of country’s leading vaccine maker has been enlisted for manufacturing Oxford University’s vaccine candidate that has shown encouraging results in stage two of human trials as was reported yesterday and secondly because two indigenous vaccines were also not far behind in the race to produce a credible product.“We seem to be reaching a good stage in vaccine development. It gives us hope. We also feel proud when we see our country among leading nations on this front. We also see promise, not just for our country but for the entire humanity,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog.Also Read: Covid-19 pandemic: Wave of promising study results raises hopes for coronavirus vaccineOxford University’s Covid vaccine candidate called AZD1222 has started phase III of human trials and results so far have indicated that it has elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses without any serious side effects. The strongest response was seen in people who received two doses. The vaccine candidate’s co-producer AstraZeneca has also entered a deal with Pune-based Serum Institute of India to supply one billion doses for low-and-middle-Income countries, with first 400 million before the end of 2020.Apart from this, India was also hopeful about the two indigenous vaccine candidates among the leaders around the world.“India’s two Coved 19 vaccines are in phase 1 and 2 of trials. They are also progressing in this journey. Discussions have already begun how the vaccines will be made available to all those who need it. We will not leave any stone unturned,” Dr VK Paul added.He added that this was not just good news for Indians but for the entire humanity as attempts are being made that the world has access to an Indian vaccine as early as possible.“Every possible facilitation will be ensured making sure trials are conducted scientifically and ethically and that we arrive at an affordable option,” Dr VK Paul was quoted as saying by a news agency.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesDr Paul was referring to Covaxin jointly developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and ZyCoV-D, a candidate from Zydus Cadila, that have entered the human trials stage and shown promising results so far.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, has begun recruitment of subjects for the continuous phase 1 and 2 trials for Covaxin. It is one of the 12 centres that will test the safety and immunogenicity-- the ability of a substance to provoke an immune response in the body-- of the vaccine candidate.In the phase 1 trial, the vaccine will be given to a small number of people to see whether it is safe. In phase 2, the immune response it produces will be checked.The other leading Indian company Zydus Cadila has said that it is looking to complete clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate ZyCoV-D in seven months. The company had last week started clinical trials with the first human dosing.AIMMS director Guleria said that several phases of vaccine development were being carried out simultaneously considering the abnormal situation.“Normally, a vaccine takes about 10 years to develop. That is because the different phases of the trial are conducted one after the other after evaluation of the results. Even as the effectiveness of the vaccine is being studied, manufacturing capacity is also being built,” said Dr Guleria.India is the third worst-affected country, with its Covid-19 tally reaching 11,55,191. India is among the biggest manufacturers of generic medicines and vaccines. Many Indian companies are engaged in making vaccines for various diseases like polio, meningitis, rotavirus, measles etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-begins-discussion-on-distribution-of-coronavirus-vaccine-indigenous-candidates-also-in-race/story-8jm3AOqf49uNBPr7ckxYaI.html

The district administration has sealed the village and ordered an inquiry into the issue.Similarly, a coronavirus positive man from a different district was shown a resident of Narayanpur district triggering panic within the administration.“A patient, who was kept in the quarantine centre of Negangar and came from some other state on April 2, was found positive. Later, the administration staff who were deployed at the quarantine centre were also kept in isolation for 14 days. On July 17, one of our staff was sent home after he was found negative but on July 18, the hospital told us that he was positive. Subsequently, we have taken all precautionary measures and sealed the village,” said Praveen Verma, deputy collector of Jagdalpur. He further said that collector Jagdalpur has sought a report from the Dean of the Medical College.On July 19, deputy director of Baliram Kashyap Memorial Government Medical College, Jagdalpur wrote a letter to the College and expressed his displeasure over the issue. He said that these ‘mistakes’ are unfortunate.“I have got information from the district officials because of a mistake in the detection of Covid-patient done by your department, a patient has been discharged from the quarantine centre, which can lead to spread of the disease. Second, the entry of Covid-19 patient of Bastar was shown in records of different districts... These mistakes are unfortunate,” the letter stated.The deputy director further said that an internal inquiry will be launched so that departmental action can be taken against those responsible.“We have ordered an inquiry over the matter. As soon as we came to know about this mistake we have sealed the village and made it a containment zone,” Rajat Bansal, Collector Jagdalpur, told Hindustan Times.On Monday, Chhattisgarh reported a total of 173 new Covid-19 cases and the total count increased to 5,598.Eleven Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), nine Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel and one Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF) jawan were among the new cases.Of the fresh cases, 66 were reported from Raipur district, 27 from Dantewada, 22 from Janjgir-Champa, 13 from Rajnandgaon, nine from Bilaspur, eight from Durg, seven each from Bijapur and Jashpur, four from Surguja, three from Mahasamund, two each from Raigarh and Sukma districts.Meanwhile, in Chhattisgarh, a seven-day fresh lockdown restriction will be imposed in nine urban areas of Chhattisgarh’s five districts following a spike in coronavirus cases for the past month.In Raipur, Surguja, and Baloda Bazar districts, the lockdown will be imposed from Wednesday for the next seven days following the orders of the respective collectors.While in the urban areas of Durg, Korba, and Bilaspur districts, the restrictions will come into effect from Thursday, state officials said.All government, semi-government and private offices will remain closed during the re-imposition of lockdown restrictions.

21-07-2020||India||UAE consulate’s charity handout puts Kerala minister under scanner in gold smuggling case||Kerala Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel is likely to be questioned in the gold smuggling case, said a senior officer familiar with the probe into the racket.Last week, Jaleel had said that he had accepted a sponsorship for food worth Rs five lakh from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate to distribute as ‘zakat’ (alms, one of the five pillars of Islam).The minister’s phone number had figured in the list of phone calls of one of the prime accused Swapna Suresh. According to the list that was leaked, Jaleel had made nine calls to Suresh in June with the calls ranging from 64 seconds to over three minutes. The accused had also called the minister’s office staff several times.Hours after the list surfaced on July 14, the minister had called a press conference and said he had called Suresh who was formerly employed in the consulate in connection with Ramzan kits being offered by the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. But this clarification only invited more trouble. The minister is not supposed to accept any fund or freebies without the consent of the Ministry of External Affairs, experts said. “All such contributions will have to come through the MEA only. A state minister cannot directly interact with the representative of a foreign country and it is against diplomatic protocol and norms,” said former diplomat T P Sreenivasan.The Opposition Congress has shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking action against Jaleel while the BJP sought his immediate resignation. “The conduct of the minister is punishable under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. We have requested the PM to include this also in the ongoing probe into smuggling,” said Congress MP the UDF convener Benny Behnan who wrote to the PM two days ago.But the minister said it was part of a witch-hunt and he is ready for any probe. “I did not accept direct money or fund. I accepted ‘zakat’ to distribute it to poor people in my constituency. I did it through a government agency. It is sad such a humanitarian move is mired in a controversy,” Jaleel said.He also said that during Diwali and Christmas many foreign missions carry out such humanitarian campaigns. But the BJP said the minister was trying to communalise the whole issue. “Cornered, now he is playing his favourite communal card,” said BJP state president K Surendran.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had sent a letter to the PM earlier this month requesting him to include the terror angle also in the gold smuggling probe. But many in the CPI (M) fear that the BJP may use it to embarrass the government when assembly elections are nine months away. “We hope the probe will not take a political colour,” said senior CPI (M) leader K N Balagopal.The Customs had seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. On July 9, the Union home ministry asked the National Investigation Agency to probe the racket. Several other central agencies are also involved in the investigation. The NIA has arrested four persons and Customs 13 in connection with the case so far. Two senior officials, the CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar and IT fellow Arun Balachandran, were removed after their name cropped up and many others are under the scanner now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-consulate-s-charity-handout-puts-kerala-minister-under-scanner-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-QHqSPJhcJQ48bNYZneS6SK.html

For this requirement, the DRDO has provided the Bharat drones to it,” defence sources told ANI here.The Bharat drones have been developed by a Chandigarh-based laboratory of the Defence Research and Development Organisation.The Bharat series of the drones can be listed among “World’s most agile and lightest Surveillance drone. Indigenously developed by the DRDO.”DRDO sources said the “small yet powerful drone works autonomously at any location with great accuracy. The unibody biomimetic design with advance release technology is a lethal combination for surveillance missions”. The drone is equipped with artificial intelligence to detect friends and foes and can take action accordingly.The drone has been made capable of survival in extreme cold weather temperatures and is being developed further for harsher weather.The drone provides real-time video transmission during the complete missions and with very advanced night vision capabilities, it can detect humans hidden in deep forests.It is gaining a lot of popularity because it can operate in swarm operations, sources said.The drone has been built in a way that makes it impossible to be detected by Radar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-s-bharat-drones-for-indian-army-for-accurate-surveillance-along-china-border/story-qeGW9rDFjIpNy7a8ov2eSI.html

He warned of strict action against those who do not wear masks in public  He also sought the opposition’s cooperation in combating the pandemic and insisted that there has been no corruption in the drive against Covid-19.“All purchases are transparent and the is no corruption We will provide any details and documents sought by opposition within 24 hours. Not one rupee has been misused,” he said.Earlier this month, senior Congress leader and former chief minister and leader of opposition in the Karnataka assembly Siddaramaiah had alleged that there was a Rs 2,200 crore scam in the purchase of Covid-19 related equipment.Meanwhile,Medical Education minister Dr K Sudhakar after a meeting of the Covid taskforce on Tuesday said that the rates for testing for has been fixed at Rs 2,000per person if they come through government referral and Rs 3,000 per person ifthey directly approach a private lab.In another development, KPCC President D KShivakumar said that if the government failed to meet the demands of ASHAworkers in the state who are protesting for the last 12 days demanding enhancedpay and insurance cover, the Congress party would join hands with them toensure justice to Covid warriors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bs-yediyurappa-dumps-lockdown-says-karnataka-to-return-to-normal-economic-activity/story-YhVogwN7rpmQatZ8Q4LorI.html

She was grilled by the same team on Monday as well for about three hours.Vishnudutt Vishnoi, who was SHO at Rajgarh police station in Churu, was found dead at his official residence in Churu in May following which BJP and BSP leaders in the state alleged that he was under pressure.Two suicide notes were recovered from Vishnoi-- one addressed to his parents and the other to the Superintendent of Police of the district.In the suicide note to the SP, Vishnoi had said he was not able to bear the pressure put on him. In his suicide note, he had also said that he tried to give his best to the Rajasthan Police.A screenshot of a purported WhatsApp chat that Vishnoi had with one of his activist friends, in which the police officer talked about being trapped in dirty politics, had also gone viral.The leaders of the BJP and the BSP have alleged that the officer, who was known for his honesty and hardwork, was being pushed by Congress MLA Poonia, a charge that she has denied.CBI officials said that the questioning is being done to clarify certain things and it doesn’t mean that Poonia or Saini are suspects in the case.The officials also pointed out that Rajasthan government’s decision to block CBI probe in the state won’t affect this case as this case was sent by state government before the notification issued on July 19, which itself says that cases which have been already sent will remain valid.The CBI interrogation comes at a time when the Rajasthan government is facing political turmoil post Sachin Pilot’s rebellion. Deva Ram Saini said, “I am extending full cooperation and providing all required information.”Congress MLA Poonia also said she would cooperate with the investigating agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-questions-cm-gehlot-s-aide-mla-over-cop-suicide-amid-rajasthan-crisis/story-MFNYv5yT0gUPGxKREDw1UK.html

21-07-2020||India||YES Bank co-founder’s bail plea rejected by special PMLA court||A special Prevention of Money Laundering (PMLA) court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea filed by Rana Kapoor, YES Bank’s co-founder, former managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO), who has been booked for alleged money laundering by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Kapoor was arrested by ED on March 8 and produced before the special PMLA court.Initially, he was remanded to ED custody till March 11 and later sent to judicial custody.Earlier in March, CBI had registered two cases against Kapoor.One first information report (FIR) had alleged that the bankrupt YES Bank had invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) between April and June 2018. In lieu, Kapoor was allegedly paid “kickbacks” to the tune of Rs 600 crore by DHFL promoter, Kapil Wadhawan.DHFL had sanctioned a loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises in which Kapoor’s wife Bindu is a director and 100% shareholder, the CBI had stated in its FIR.Kapoor’s three daughters -- Rakhee Kapoor Tandon, Roshni Kapoor, and Radha Kapoor -- are also 100% shareholders in DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd.It is on the basis of the CBI case that ED began its probe into allegations of money laundering by Kapoor and subsequently arrested him on March 8.In the second case, CBI alleged that Kapoor and his wife bought a bungalow from Avantha Group promoter Gautam Thapar at a much lower price than it’s market valuation.In the past, Thapar had mortgaged the bungalow for a corporate loan of Rs 600 crore, but he sold it for Rs 380 crore to Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd, when Kapoor’s wife was a director of the company.ED filed a charge sheet against Kapoor, his wife, and three daughters for money laundering on the basis of its investigation. Kapoor’s lawyers moved bail plea after the charge sheet was filed, pleading that the case was based on documentary evidence that has already been collected by the agency and he is eligible to be released on a personal surety bond, which can be determined by the special PMLA court.ED, however, argued that the probe is yet to be concluded and that Kapoor could tamper with the evidence and also influence witnesses. The special PMLA court saw merit in ED’s argument and rejected his bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yes-bank-co-founder-s-bail-plea-rejected-by-special-pmla-court/story-62OOlZJIWbEUNWYnUu6YPL.html
21-07-2020||India||11 cops convicted for killing Rajasthan ex-royal in fake encounter 35 yrs ago||A special CBI court in Mathura pronounced 11 policemen, including a former deputy Superintendent of Police (SP), guilty on Tuesday in the murder of former royal Raja Man Singh.The CBI had presented the charge sheet against 18 police personnel; four of them died during trial and three others were acquitted. The convicted police officials included Kan Singh Bhati who was the deputy SP of Deeg in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur.The CBI verdict came 35 years after Singh was killed in police firing.Raja Man Singh was the younger brother of last ruler of Bharatpur, Maharaja Sawai Vrijendra Singh, and son of Maharaja Kishan Singh who was born on December 5, 1921. He studied engineering in England and was seven-time Independent MLA from Deeg from 1952 to 1984.Raja Man Singh’s daughter Krishnendra Kaur Deepa was the tourism minister in the last BJP government in Rajasthan.The CBI court hearing was shifted to Mathura from Rajasthan on a plea by Krishnendra Kaur Deepa.Man Singh was shot dead along with his two supporters in police firing in February 1985 after an incident of violence in which chief minister Shiv Charan Mathur’s helicopter was damaged.The CM had come to campaign for Congress candidate from Deeg, retired IAS officer Vijendra Singh, who was contesting against Man Singh.The chief minister was scheduled to address an election meeting in support of Singh. Ahead of the meeting, Congress workers removed flags and banners of Raja Man Singh. An enraged Singh reached the meeting venue with his supporters in his Jonga Jeep.He created a ruckus and even damaged the chief minister’s helicopter by his Jeep. Mathur was rescued by the security personnel.On February 21, 1985, curfew was imposed and police forces deployed in Deeg. Singh’s daughter Krishnendra Kaur Deepa alleged that after police registered complaint against her father, he was going to surrender himself before police but deputy SP Kan Singh Bhati with heavy police forces stopped his jeep in Anaj Mandi in Deeg and opened fire.Singh and his supporters Thakur Sumer Singh and Thakur Hari Singh were killed in the police firing.As the court pronounced its judgement, heavy police force was deployed outside to maintain law and order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-court-convicts-11-cops-including-deputy-sp-for-ex-royal-s-murder-in-rajasthan/story-M54w3o75NfoSpVSzfXnjlK.html
21-07-2020||India||‘Reign of fear across the country’: Mamata Banerjee attacks BJP, Centre||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the government it leads at the Centre, claiming there is reign of fear across the country.“People are unable to speak due to reign of fear across the country,” Banerjee said while addressing a virtual rally of the Trinamool Congress (TMC).Calling the BJP a party of “outsiders”, Banerjee said they will never get a chance to run West Bengal. “The central government has neglected us. People of West Bengal will give them a befitting reply. Outsiders will not run the state. There are some people who don’t have any political experience. They speak of killing people and setting things ablaze,” said the chief minister.Sharpening her attack further, Banerje said that the Centre is conspiring against “Bengal by saying every day there is violence”.“What about UP where ‘jungle raj’ prevails? What is happening in Uttar Pradesh? People in that state are afraid of lodging complaints with the police. Several policemen were killed in a single incident,” she said.“Centre has deprived West Bengal of resources, people will give a befitting reply for injustice,” Banerjee added.The chief minister also accused the BJP of using the state agencies to try and topple the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal and attacked the saffron party of “destabilising governments in Madhya Pradesh, Bengal and Rajasthan”.Banerjee said that the Trinamool Congress will win the assembly elections this time too. “Trinamool Congress will form the government again. The next elections will show a new direction to the state as well as to the country,” the TMC chief said.Assembly elections are due in West Bengal next year and the BJP has vowed to dethrone Banerjee. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats, marking the party’s highest ever growth in Bengal.The party has attacked Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress for violence in West Bengal. On June 9, Union home minister Amit Shah sharpened his attack on the chief minister, saying that while democracy has strengthened its roots in the entire country West Bengal remains the only state where political violence is propagated.Banerjee had stormed to power in 2011 by overthrowing the 34-year-old Left government. Before coming to power, Banerjee had promised to end political violence but killings and turf wars continued.The 2018 panchayat polls saw a spate in violence. While only 10 people died on the day of polling, against an all-time high of 76 in 2003 and 39 in 2013, the elections stood out because of rigging, booth capturing and burning of ballot papers in front of the media and policemen. More people were killed after the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reign-of-fear-across-the-country-mamata-banerjee-attacks-bjp-centre/story-mYBuYFuwVFz4sMBywBVq9L.html

Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha said no one was near the spot at the time of the incident.Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad and Ganga Sabha have demanded an inquiry into this incident at this ancient religious place in the context of the structural strength of the wall housing a pilgrimage thronged by millions every day.Watch: Landslide in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli following heavy rain“Akhada Parishad demands an inquiry into this incident as Har-Ki-Pauri is a place where thousands of people arrive on a daily basis. Mahakumbh is just five months away so construction of a stronger outer wall and related infrastructure works should be carried out in such a manner that safety of pilgrims and Har-Ki-Pauri personnel is ensured, “said Mahant Narendra Giri, president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad.Har-Ki-Pauri police station in-charge Amarjeet Singh said that the police personnel have cordoned off the whole area as the remaining portion of the wall, too, seemed vulnerable.Also Read: Uttarakhand HC upholds constitutional validity of Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management ActFormer municipal chairperson Satpal Brahamchari alleged that the wall caved in due to pressure from rain water which had accumulated due to uncovered digging work currently being undertaken for the underground laying of power cables and piped natural gas lines. A section of local traders seemed to agree with Brahamchari.Mayor Anita Sharma, too, weighed in and blamed the haphazard laying of underground power, piped natural gas lines and sewer lines for water logging and the subsequent caving in of the wall.District authorities said an expert opinion was needed to confirm if the collapse was indeed a result of lightning strike. District disaster management officer Haridwar Meera Kainthura said the reason will be known after submission of a report by disaster management experts and geologists.Local priests have interpreted the collapse as “a bad omen” and an expression of “wrath” by Ganga Maa, upset at the move to not to allow devotees to take a holy dip and offer Ganga Jal at Shivalingams on the pious festive occasion of Shravan Shivratri and Somwati Amavasya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-era-wall-at-haridwar-s-har-ki-pauri-collapses-in-lightening-strike/story-m0rg6NwXThNWeUeV6w3xyN.html

Vaiphei, chairperson, AHRC, and other members of the commission, Naba Kamal Bora and Deba Kumar Saikia, have issued the notice. Saikia had complained to AHRC about negligence in providing proper healthcare facilities and diet to inmates of the Central Jail in Guwahati and other prisons and correctional homes across the state and also cited the non-compliance of the Covid-19 protocol by the jail authorities.Earlier on July 9, Saikia had written to Kumar Sanjay Krishna and Dasharath Das, state chief secretary and inspector-general (I-G) (prisons), Assam, respectively, seeking an inquiry into the matter and also sought the release of undertrial prisoners, while citing the Supreme Court’s March 23 order that had directed state governments to free prisoners on bail or parole in a bid to decongest jails and correctional homes across the country because of the viral outbreak.Saikia urged the commission to direct the state government to constitute a committee to ascertain Covid-19-related facilities provided in the major hospitals of Assam since the viral disease was first reported over four months ago.He also wanted directions on whether the Covid-19 protocol was followed at Guwahati’s Central Jail and whether proper medical care was provided to the inmates.“Issue notice to the chief secretary and I-G (prisons) to submit a report to this commission on or before August 5 as to what actions have been taken by them in connection with the complaint,” the commission said in its order.Assam has recorded 25,092 Covid-19 positive cases till Monday, including 17,095 patients have recovered from their viral infection and 58 deaths.According to officials, 435 inmates of Guwahati’s Central jail, which has around 1,000 inmates, have tested Covid-19 positive to date.Peasant leader Akhil Gogoi is among the prominent inmates of the jail, who has contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Guwahati. Most of the inmates of the jail have recovered and 154 is yet to recover from their viral infection.On Monday, five people in Kokrajhar Jail in lower Assam, including four police personnel and an inmate, tested Covid-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-human-rights-commission-issues-notice-to-govt-on-covid-19-scenario-in-jails/story-AREZ4JnQ2v4xapPZrqSEvO.html
21-07-2020||India||Order on Sachin Pilot, rebels’ plea on July 24, Rajasthan speaker asked to wait||The Rajasthan high court said on Tuesday that it will pronounce its verdict on the writ petition filed by Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident Congress MLAs, challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by the state assembly speaker, on Friday. The speaker has been asked to take no action against the MLAs till then.The MLAs were served the disqualification notice after the Congress party complained to speaker CP Joshi that the lawmakers had defied a whip to attend two Congress legislature party (CLP) meetings last week on Monday and Tuesday.In its complaint to the speaker, the Congress had sought action against Pilot and the MLAs supporting him under the 10th Schedule of the constitution. The Pilot camp, however, has argued that a party whip applies only when the Assembly is in session.Sachin Pilot, who has maintained he is not joining the BJP, was sacked as deputy chief minister of the state last month and also as head of Rajasthan Congress unit. Govind Singh Dotasra has been appointed as the new head of the state unit. Even as the court hearing was on, the Congress held another legislature party meeting at the luxury resort where all its MLAs have been sequestered since the beginning of the crisis. Once again, team Pilot was missing.“Neither Congress nor BJP want Assembly to be dissolved and election to take place...Entire country is watching the way you’re fighting. Your respect has increased manifold. It’s not something ordinary. All of you have phones, there’s no pressure on anyone,” said chief minister Gehlot at the CLP meet. CM Gehlot, who admitted in a TV interview that he has not been on talking terms with his former Number 2 for the last 18 months, has been trenchant in his criticism of Sachin Pilot. In rather unpleasant remarks yesterday, the CM called Pilot “nikamma (worthless) and nakaara (good for nothing)”. Repeating his earlier charge, he said Pilot has been trying to dislodge his government. Gehlot also claimed that some MLAs of the Pilot camp, whose phone were snatched away, have been held captive. The CM added the dissident lawmakers have been “calling us and crying over phone while explaining their ordeal”. Sachin Pilot, when the drama began, claimed the support of 30 MLAs, however that number now stands at 18. On the other hand, Gehlot claims the support of over 100 MLAs. In the 200-member assembly, 101 is the majority mark. With 72 MLAs, the BJP has been watching the developments from the sidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/order-on-sachin-pilot-rebels-plea-on-july-24-rajasthan-speaker-asked-to-wait/story-6QBDJsVjrE8ws0OfbiLobP.html
21-07-2020||India||Kin of girl whose unnatural death sparked clashes in north Bengal arrested||Police in Bengal’s North Dinajpur district have arrested the father and two brothers of the 16-year-old girl whose unnatural death on Sunday triggered clashes between police and local people in the Chopra area.The Bharatiya Janata Party had alleged that she was raped and killed by Trinamool Congress workers as her family supported the saffron party.The arrests were made a day after the local youth, who was named as the suspect in the police complaint lodged by the girl’s father, was found dead in a ditch on Monday morning. The youth’s family said in a police complaint that he was murdered by the girl’s family.Tension is still palpable in the area since the girl and the youth belonged to different religious communities.The youth lived in the same village and police are investigating if the two had an affair and whether their parents were opposed to it.Sachin Makkar, superintendent of police, Islampur police district, said “We have arrested the father and two brothers of the girl based on the complaint of the youth’s father.”The autopsy report of the youth will be available to the police on Tuesday afternoon. The post mortem report of the girl did not indicate rape and pointed at poisoning, the state police earlier said.Police have also arrested 22 people in connection with Sunday’s arson and clashes in which police vans and government buses were also set on fire. Surajit Sen, vice president of the BJP North Dinajpur district unit, said, “The government and police have cooked up a story about an affair between the youth and the girl.”The police stopped a team of senior BJP leaders from visiting the village on Monday but Bengal’s tourism minister Gautam Deb met the girl’s family.The girl recently passed the class 10 state board exams.The youth’s uncle alleged that his nephew was murdered by the girl’s family on Sunday night. He alleged that both the youth and the girls had been killed.The youth’s mother said, “Someone called my son over the phone at 11 pm on Sunday and he left home. He later called and said he was with three people and would return soon. We never heard from him again.” “Police are investigating both the cases and looking into all possible aspects of the incident including social ostracism, parental pressure and the role played by some persons in hiding, misleading and diverting the attention from the actual incident,” the West Bengal Police said on Twitter on Monday.The girl’s father had alleged that his daughter was regularly harassed by the youth and he raped and murdered her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/father-brothers-of-girl-whose-unnatural-death-sparked-clashes-in-north-bengal-arrested/story-SAxo7eEINnKJvBTnzXCTIJ.html

Here’s why||The Union health ministry has warned all states against use of N95 masks with valved respirator, saying these can be detrimental as the valves do not prevent the virus from escaping out of the mask.The ministry has prescribed the use of home-made protective cover described on the website of the ministry.Prof (Dr) Rajiv Garg, director general of health services, issued the directive in a letter to the health secretaries of all states on Monday.“It has been observed that there is an inappropriate use of the N95 mask (particularly with valved respirator) by the public other than designated health workers. In this regard, I would like to draw your attention to the advisory on the use of home-made protective cover for face and mouth available on the website of the MoHFW,” the letter says.“It is to bring to your knowledge that the use of valved respirator N95 masks is detrimental to the measures adopted for preventing the spread of the coronavirus as it does not prevent the virus from escaping out of the mask,” the letter says. The advisory has asked the states to prevent inappropriate use of N95 masks.The government had in April issued an advisory on the use of home-made protective cover for face and mouth, asking people to wear it, particularly when they step out of their residences.The advisory stressed such face covers must be washed and cleaned each day, as instructed, and stated that any used cotton cloth can be used to make this face cover.It also listed the procedures of making such home-made masks, asking to ensure it fits the face well and there are no gaps on the sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-govt-wants-you-to-stop-wearing-valved-n95-masks-here-s-why/story-wnKap7lZQg1IZOAEm0gHHO.html

He also urged the legislators supporting him to “stand firm like a rock” and assured them that the mandate is with the Congress party as the turf war with Pilot whittled down to the numbers.“We will have more than 115 MLAs, including some from among the absentees. And nobody wants elections to happen be it Congress or the BJP,” he said during the meeting, according to people aware of the developments.He also had some words of praise for the MLAs.“The entire country is watching the way you’re fighting. Your respect has increased manifold. It’s not something ordinary,” he said, according to news agency ANI.“All of you have phones. There’s no pressure on anyone,” he said.Senior party leader Ajay Maken and state unit president Govind Singh Dotasra were among others present at the CLP meeting.The Rajasthan chief minister has also called a meeting of his cabinet later in the day, leading to another buzz about a floor test.Meanwhile, the Rajasthan High Court said it will pronounce its order on Friday on the petition by Sachin Pilot and 18 other rebel Congress MLAs challenging the disqualification notices served to them by the speaker of the state assembly, CP Joshi, last week for “anti-party activities”.The court also requested the speaker to defer any action against Pilot and legislators in his camp till then.If the high court decides to disqualify Pilot and members of his camp, it will have a direct bearing on the numbers in the Rajasthan assembly.Their disqualification will bring down the majority mark in the assembly—101 in the 200-member house making it easier for chief minister Gehlot to win a floor test. Gehlot has claimed he has the support of more than 100 members of legislative assembly (MLAs) and Pilot is being backed by 18 legislators.The disqualification notices to Pilot and the MLAs were served after the Congress party complained to Rajasthan assembly speaker Joshi that they defied a whip to attend two CLP meetings on July 13 and July 14.After he gave the meetings a slip, Pilot was sacked as the Rajasthan deputy chief minister and the president of the state Congress unit as he rebelled against Gehlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-tells-congress-mlas-backing-him-to-stand-firm-like-a-rock/story-MV9Cm9dXNCeZC3suLj1JaO.html
21-07-2020||India||Assam BJP MLA tests positive for Covid-19, fifth from state BJP to report||The raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in Assam’s tally is on an upswing, as politicians, cutting across party lines, are contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and adding to the north-east’s most populous state’s viral load.On Monday, Atul Bora, the BJP member of the Assam legislative assembly (MLA), who represents the Dispur constituency, tested Covid-19 positive in Guwahati and is undergoing treatment at a local hospital.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBora (69) got infected a day after the BJP lawmaker from Sonari, Nabanita Handique, too, tested Covid-19 positive.So far, five lawmakers – all from the ruling BJP – have tested Covid-19. Barring BJP MLAs Bora and Handique, their colleagues Krishnendu Paul of Patharkandi constituency, Narayan Deka (Barkhetry), and Bolin Chetia (Sadiya) were found to be infected.Paul and Deka have recovered, while Chetia, Handique, and Bora are still undergoing treatment.Opposition Congress has criticised the state government for playing petty politics over the pandemic.“The state government is trying to extract political mileage from the Cobid-19 situation. Opposition leaders are being prevented from reaching out to the public on the pretext of the pandemic. However, similar restrictions don’t hold good for the BJP leaders, who are mingling with the public while throwing social distancing norms to the wind,” alleged Debabrata Saikia, a Congress MLA and the leader of opposition in the state assembly.“Numerous people in certain areas have either been infected by the viral disease or have had to undergo quarantine after coming into contact with BJP MLAs and other leaders,” he further alleged.Earlier in July, Sushmita Dev, former Congress Member of Parliament (MP) from Silchar in Assam and the president All India Mahila Congress, had also tested Covid-19 positive. She underwent treatment at Silchar Medical College Hospital between July 8 and 19, when she was discharged after recovering from her viral infection.“Covid-19 positive cases have been spiralling in most parts of the state, as around 1,000 fresh cases are being reported daily. Frontline workers, who are battling the pandemic, including doctors, paramedical staff, police, and bureaucrats, are getting infected. In that light, it’s nothing unusual for public representatives such as lawmakers, too, who are adding to Assam’s Covid-19 positive tally,” said a state BJP leader, requesting anonymity.Assam has recorded 25,092 Covid-19 positive cases until Monday, including 17,095 recoveries and 58 deaths.Around 1, 000 police personnel, including senior officers; dozens of healthcare workers, including doctors; bureaucrats, hundreds of inmates in jails and correctional homes and over 70 people posted at Raj Bhawan are among the state’s Covid-19 patients, many of whom have since recovered from their viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-bjp-mla-tests-positive-for-covid-19-fifth-from-state-bjp-to-report/story-CYH7bK2zkANLphCa5XTVaJ.html
21-07-2020||India||Nearly 1 in 4 Delhiites exposed to Covid-19: Sero-survey data||A serological survey of Delhi’s population shows that 23.48% people may have been exposed to the pathogen that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Union health ministry said on Tuesday, releasing results of the exercise that covered over 20,000 people across the Capital’s 11 districts between June 27 and July 10. If extrapolated across the population, this would come to nearly one in four people, or 4.7 million of Delhi’s residents.“The results of the sero-prevalence study show that on an average, across Delhi, the prevalence of IgG [Immunoglobulin G] antibodies is 23.48 % [22.86%, when adjusted for sensitivity and specificity of the tests]. The study also indicates that a large number of infected persons remain asymptomatic,” the health ministry said in a statement.The ministry had commissioned a sero-surveillance study in Delhi, which has a population of about 20 million, and it was jointly conducted by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Delhi government. It was done following a rigorous multi-stage sampling study design between June 27 and July 10.Also read: Oxford Covid-19 vaccine’s first human trial shows promise, more phases underwayExperts in community medicine say that since the samples were collected in end-June and the beginning of July, there is a possibility more people may have developed antibodies against the virus by now.“This is suggestive of infection during mid-June, and since then, we have seen a decent increase in the number of cases. That means more people are exposed to the virus, and the disease prevalence could be higher,” said Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicine department of Safdarjung Hospital.“Also, it wasn’t a door-to-door sample collection, that also means about 5% to 10% of the population probably was missed. If you factor in all these variables then the prevalence should easily be around 40%, which is good.”He added, “It also means the susceptible population is going down, which suggests that the epidemic is moving downwards towards its end.”Survey teams were formed for all the 11 districts of Delhi, and blood samples were collected from 21,387 individuals. The samples were tested in labs for Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.IgG is the most common antibody in blood and other body fluids that the immune systems produces to protect against bacterial and viral infections and allergens. IgG can take time to form after an infection, and is useful in detecting a past infection, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Also read: Maharashtra facing surge in cases even outside red zonesEpidemiologists say merely knowing the presence of antibodies is not enough, as one needs to know the quality of antibodies to make some meaningful difference.Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division of ICMR, said: “We need more information to make sense of the survey, such as whether these antibodies are neutralising antibodies that can kill the virus, or for how long do these antibodies stay in a person’s system. Is it a long-term immunity or short-term? More relevant information needs to be put out.”The antibody test is not a diagnostic test but provides information about past infection due to SARSCoV-2 in individuals who test positive. Antibody testing repeatedly done over time, in the form of sero-surveillance, generates important evidence for assessing the spread of the pandemic from time to time, the health ministry’s statement said.“This implies the following: nearly six months into the epidemic, only 23.48% of the people are affected in Delhi, which has several pockets of dense population. This can be attributed to the proactive efforts taken by the government to prevent the spread of infection, including prompt lockdown, effective containment and surveillance measures, including contact tracing and tracking, as well as citizen’s compliance to COVID Appropriate Behaviours,” it said.“However, a significant proportion of the population is still vulnerable. Therefore, the containment measures need to continue with the same rigour. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing, use of face mask or cover, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoidance of crowded places etc, must be followed strictly,” it added.This was one of the largest sero-prevalence studies conducted in India using ELISA testing. ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV) at Pune developed and validated the indigenous blood-based IgG ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) test “Covid Kavach Elisa” for antibody detection for Covid-19, which was used for the sero-prevalence survey in Delhi. While real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test is the frontline test for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, robust antibody tests are critical for surveillance to understand the proportion of population exposed to infection. It takes about 2.5 hours to get results and can be deployed even in districts, says the research body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-1-in-4-delhiites-exposed-to-covid-19-sero-survey-data/story-YhKD2eZdGlYEWiAIaXLxEL.html

Airlines have limited options to turn to for funding except their promoters, given that 3rd party investors will be reluctant to provide capital right now, and the government is unwilling to do so.”On July 20, IndiGo, India’s largest airline by market share, announced the lay-offs due to the pandemic. CAPA said, “The decision by IndiGo to lay off 10% of its staff is the beginning of a painful process for Indian aviation as things start to unravel from the impact of Covid-19 in India. It will be impossible to survive this crisis without a strong balance sheet.”Airlines have been struggling since the Covid-19 lockdown was announced in late March. Even after domestic operations partially resumed from May 25, most aircraft are on the ground as airlines have been operating in a limited manner with only 60% of their capacity due to poor load factor.“Even while the state government has allowed 50 take-offs and 50 arrivals from Mumbai, not all are operating their planned flights, as demand has been low,” said a senior airline official who declined to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indigo-s-decision-to-lay-off-staff-is-the-beginning-of-a-painful-process-for-indian-aviation-capa/story-Yj9oY62JoKwkiyj0ZqOrUI.html
21-07-2020||India||Bi-weekly lockdown in West Bengal may help ease pressure on health sector: Doctors||Senior doctors in West Bengal have blamed people’s casual approach to lockdown guidelines and quarantine norms for high Covid-19 caseload in the state, and welcomed the TMC government’s decision to impose bi-weekly shutdown to stem the spread of the disease.Admitting that community transmission of Covid-19 has been detected in a few pockets of Bengal, surgical oncologist Dr Diptendra Sarkar said the “two-day total lockdown across the state will help the administration tackle the situation to a considerable extent”.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“In several areas, where contact tracing is not possible, community transmission has been detected. But that does not mean that community transmission has happened in the entire state,” he said.Talking about the new shutdown strategy, Dr Sarkar said, “We have to contain the rate of transmission. We have to flatten the curve which has moved upward over a period of time... The lockdown is being imposed in a very calculative manner.”“If it is in force on Thursday and Saturday, people wouldn’t get much to do on Friday. And Sunday is usually not a busy day. So the shutdown covers more than just two days. If we can continue this in the coming weeks, we might be able to ease the pressure on the health sector.” Another senior physician, Dr Syamasis Bandyopadhyay, said many people have flouted quarantine guidelines over the past few months, leading to the rapid spread of the disease.“There are family members of Covid-19 patients who have not submitted their samples for examination. Some have also violated quarantine norms. These are major reasons for community transmission,” he said.The physician was also sceptical that people might continue to disregard safety norms during this fresh spell of bi-weekly lockdown.“I think many still do not realise the need to be on self quarantine. I doubt how much this complete lockdown will help, under such circumstances.” The Bengal government on Monday announced a complete lockdown in the state twice a week in its bid to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission. The announcement came as Bengal recorded the highest one-day spike of 2,282 infections, which pushed the caseload to 44,769.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bi-weekly-lockdown-in-west-bengal-may-help-ease-pressure-on-health-sector-doctors/story-emQlUIfhgPJFRKcHlmDHML.html
21-07-2020||India||After claiming Jats have less intellect, Tripura CM apologises and praises the community||Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb on Tuesday regretted his earlier comment that had snowballed into a raging controversy of comparing his own Bengali stock to be intellectually superior to Jats and Punjabis and made a U-turn in his apologetic remark that he’s proud of both these north Indian communities. “I had expressed thoughts about my Punjabi and Jat brothers at an event in Agartala Press Club recently. I didn’t intend to hurt any community. I am proud of both Punjabi and Jat communities. I myself have spent a lot of time with them,” Deb tweeted as a mark of apology.“Many of my close friends are from these communities. If my statement has hurt anyone’s sentiments, I personally seek apology for that,” he further tweeted as a sign of atonement.In another tweet, he said that he was aware of these communities’ immense contributions to the country’s freedom struggle and would never doubt their role behind India’s growth story.Earlier, CM Deb had landed in a soup after Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala circulated a video on social media that quickly went viral.The video showed Deb making a pronouncement with a great degree of certitude that Jats are blessed with less intellect, but are healthy, while Bengalis, a community to which he belongs, are known for their intellectual prowess.Surjewala himself is a Jat.“In Haryana, there are Jats. Let me tell you about them. Jats are less intelligent, but are physically healthy. While for Bengalis, it is said that they should not be challenged regarding their intelligence. They are known for their intelligence across the country,” Deb had said at a programme in Agartala Press Club recently. Bijan Dhar, a local veteran Communist Party of India (CPI) (Marxist), a party that had ruled Tripura for two decades on the trot until 2018 and was a formidable political force until recently, termed CM Deb’s statement as “objectionable” and smacked of “racism”. “This kind of statement is objectionable. It’s a racial slur to divide the people of this country. It poses a threat to the union and the integrity of our nation. However, if this news is, indeed, fake, then he must counter it publicly,” Dhar said.Opposition Congress, a dwindling political force in the state, also jumped on the bandwagon.“The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands for divisive politics. This is not the first time that the CM has made such off-the-cuff remarks and later ended up eating the humble pie,” said Tapas Dey, state vice-president, Congress.The ruling BJP, however, sprang to CM Deb’s defence.“The CM didn’t intend to degrade any particular community’s intelligence quotient. His speech was misconstrued. He wanted to delineate the characteristics of various communities across the country. His comments were misinterpreted and spun out of content to give a political twist to it and create unnecessary controversy,” said Subrata Chakraborty, BJP’s state spokesperson.However, CM Deb, a gymnasium instructor-turned-politician, is no stranger to putting his foot in his mouth.Earlier, he had claimed that the internet existed even during the mythological Mahabharat era. He had also drawn flak for his uncharitable remark that Diana Hayden didn’t deserve to win an international beauty pageant contest.His unscientific temper had also made him a butt of ridicule, when he had said that ducks release oxygen to the atmosphere during swimming in the water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-claiming-jats-have-less-intellect-tripura-cm-apologises-and-praises-the-community/story-OGvVxjdeY7JIqz836sa8tJ.html

Gandhi, on a daily basis, has been challenging the Centre’s narrative on various issues and raising questions. Asking the Congress MP to take note, the information minister, answering in identical fashion as Gandhi’s tweet, listed out six “achievements” of the 50-year-old leader. The list went like this: Feb: Shaheen Bagh & riots March: Losing [Jyotiraditya] Scindia and MP governmentApril: Instigating labourers May: 6th anniversary of historic poll defeat [Congress]June: Advocating for China July: Party [Congress] destroyed in Rajasthan Going further, the BJP leader then asked the Congress leader to also note the country’s achievements in “war against coronavirus”.“India has the least average cases, active cases and death rate than the US, Europe and Brazil. By making fun of candle lights, RahulGandhi ji you have insulted the people of India and brave Corona warriors,” said the minister. The torrents of criticism followed Rahul Gandhi’s satirical dig to highlight priorities of the central government amid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic raging in the country. It also included a reference to Rajasthan Congress crisis.“Achievements of the government in the Covid-era: February -- Namaste Trump, March-- toppling the government in Madhya Pradesh, April -- making people light candles, May -- government’s sixth anniversary, June -- Bihar virtual rally, July -- Attempt to topple the government in Rajasthan,” Gandhi said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-note-your-achievements-union-minister-s-biting-comeback/story-8Nwx713nkIuF4gUPyzmzCI.html

The summit is being hosted by US-India Business Council.This year marks the 45th anniversary of the formation of the council.“US-India economic partnership has been one that has been growing in importance for both countries. We have seen that the pandemic has created enormous disruption on global supply chains including in the pharmaceutical sector and the US-India partnership is one of the trusted partners,” USIBC president Nisha Biswal had said last week, ahead of the two-day summit.Biswal said India stands to benefit as the companies look to diversify their global supply chains.The participants in the summit will discuss wide range of topics including the impact of coronavirus on global supply chain and healthcare collaboration between the US and India.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, External Affairs S Jaishankar, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal, Deputy Secretary of US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Eric Hargan, Senator Mark Warner, Representative (California) Ami Bera, India ambassador to the US Taranjit Sandhu, US ambassador to India Kenneth Juster and many more diplomats as well as dignitaries are expected to participate in the summit.The summit will also feature senior executives from top US and Indian companies, like Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet and Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran.“This year’s focus is on ‘Building a Better Future’. As Prime Minister Modi navigates the twin challenges of managing the health impact of Covid-19 and the associated global economic disruption, he has articulated the importance of the US-India Partnership in ushering an era of economic renewal and inclusive opportunity,” said Vijay Advani, USIBC global board chair.Speaking on the H-1B visa issue, Biswal said it is USIBC’s strongly held view that both the US and India benefit when workers, ideas, or innovations are allowed to move more freely across both borders.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-address-high-profile-us-india-summit-on-economic-revival-after-covid-19/story-Wm1Zmlfam8roIzDR3mAogL.html

21-07-2020||India||With Xi Jinping Centre On Diplomatic Thought, Chinese President is the new Mao||Chinese Communist Party General secretary and PLA commander-in-chief Xi Jinping became paramount leader of the Middle Kingdom in 2012. That President Xi thought himself second to none in the Chinese communist pantheon that includes founding father Mao Zedong and economic revivalist Deng Xiaoping became evident on Monday when the Xi Jinping Research Center for Diplomatic Thought was inaugurated within China’s foreign ministry.Foreign minister Wang Yi, who inaugurated the center in Beijing, said Xi’s diplomatic doctrine embodies 21st century Marxism and transcends traditional theories regarding international relations, Wang said, describing Xi’s doctrine as the ultimate guiding principle for Chinese diplomacy.According to China watchers, the new institute of research into Xi Jinping’s thought virtually places him on par with founding father Mao Zedong who led the cultural revolution in the Middle Kingdom that snuffed out millions of lives. Mao’s thought was incorporated into the Communist Party of China’s charter in 1945.Also read: From Ladakh to Japan’s Senkaku Islands, ‘bully’ China is in an overdriveIn October 2017, Xi Jinping was the first Chinese leader since Mao to have had an eponymous ideology included in the charter while in office. Deng’s name was added to the charter after his death in 1997.Deng Xiaoping, the man who led the rise of China as an economic power, stands below the pedestal with his doctrine that put economic development at the centre of party work and provided the ideological roadmap for the modernization of the Chinese economy. While the world sees Xi Jinping’s aggression in Ladakh and South China Sea as divergence from struggles within the party, this move clearly cements his position as the first and most powerful Chinese emperor.In the Indian context, it may be recalled that Mao Zedong mounted the aggression on India in 1962 after the failure of Great Leap Forward agriculture revolution in which millions died of hunger and famine, the PLA’s aggression on the India-China border under the garb of peace and tranquility has come after millions have been infected due to the coronavirus that originated in central China’s Wuhan.At Monday’s event, President Xi who aims to turn China into an eminent global power, upending Deng Xiaoping’s approach to adopt a low profile to expand Beijing’s trade was described as a great strategist with vision. Deng’s doctrine advocated that China should “keep a low profile and bide your time” to stay focused on economic revival.Xi, however, wants that China should take an active role as a contributor to development of global governance and what he had described as “a protector of international order”.Also read: In renewed attack on border row, Rahul Gandhi connects PM’s image and China’s plan“The theory of international relations has achieved a historic leap in the field of diplomacy in the localization of Marxism,” said foreign minister Wang at Monday’s event on XI’s approach.This wasn’t the only aspect of Deng Xiaoping’s efforts to reform China that President Xi has reversed. Two years ago, President Xi had removed the constitutional bar introduced by Deng in 1982 on the China’s president serving more than two terms. This will allow him to continue as China’s president for lifetime, quite like Mao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-xi-jinping-centre-on-diplomatic-thought-chinese-president-is-the-new-mao/story-2KnFtJVLyarsXxPXq2tdUO.html
21-07-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh: Lokayukta initiates inquiry into IPS officer video||Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh (MP) Lokayukta Justice NK Gupta took suo motu (on its own motion) cognisance of media reports and on Monday ordered a preliminary inquiry against an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, who is seen accepting envelopes from five police personnel in a video that has gone viral on social media.The video clip is believed to be three years’ old but still found traction on social media, as the 1991-batch IPS officer, V Madhu Kumar Babu, who was posted as the inspector-general (IG) of police, Ujjain zone, is seen receiving the envelopes from the five police personnel at the government-run guest house in Agar-Malwa, which was under his jurisdiction, when the incident allegedly occurred.A Lokayukta official release stated that special police establishment (SPE), Lokayukta, would probe the matter.Babu, however, skirted the allegations after the probe was ordered. “I’d like to speak about this later,” he said.But the viral video had an immediate fallout on Babu’s career prospects. The state home department relieved him on Saturday evening from the post of transport commissioner to police headquarters (PHQ) to an additional director-general (ADG) without any department under him.Babu told media persons after he was shunted out of his post that “a conspiracy has been hatched to malign my image. A high-level inquiry should be conducted in the matter to get to the bottom of it.”However, he has refused to comment on his purported action of accepting the envelopes, as the viral clip illustrated. The state Congress has demanded a high-level probe in connection with the alleged corruption case.PC Sharma, former Congress lawmaker, and an ex-public relations minister, alleged, “The state government should have immediately ordered an investigation after the video went viral on social media. But, no inquiry has been ordered yet. This shows that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government is not serious about curbing corruption in MP.”State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal, however, refuted Congress’s allegations.“The BJP government’s swift action in transferring the IPS officer is proof of transparent and good governance. We can’t make any comment on the officer’s conduct until the probe is over is and a report is made available. The government is serious about graft and its intent is clear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-lokayukta-initiates-inquiry-into-ips-officer-video/story-MLGDTPYlIlodLBbLQMwsKN.html
21-07-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi lists govt’s achievement, crisis in Rajasthan is one of them||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday added a reference to the political crisis in Rajasthan to question the priorities of the central government amid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic raging in the country.Gandhi in a tweet in Hindi listed the “achievements of the government” from February till July as he blamed the Centre for trying to destabilise the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan.The former Congress president also mentioned Madhya Pradesh, where the 15-month-old Congress government led by Kamal Nath fell in March after a rebellion by 22 party legislators.“Achievements of the government during the Corona period: ● February - Hello Trump ● March - Toppled government in MP ● April - Lighting candles ● May - 6th anniversary of the government ● June - Virtual rally in Bihar ● July - Attempt to topple the government in Rajasthan,” Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.This is the first time Rahul Gandhi has spoken publicly about the crisis in Rajasthan triggered by Sachin Pilot and other MLAs of the party revolted on July 10.He also added an “atmanirbhar” jibe to continue his attack on the government.“That is why the country is 'self-sufficient' in the battle of corona,” the lawmaker from Kerala’s Wayanad added.Before this, Gandhi had Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his direct line of attack as he released a video on Monday to throw a jab at the Centre on the ongoing border row with China.He had said the Chinese are attacking PM Modi’s image as “they understand that for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’ (56-inch)”.The video was the second of his series to share his thoughts on national issues.The Congress has targeted the Prime Minister since the June 15 clash in the eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Vallery in which 20 Indian Army soldiers were killed, accusing him of giving away Indian territory to China.The attack has mostly been led by Rahul Gandhi and the verbal duel has been on since then. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on its part, has accused the Congress of lowering the morale of the Indian Army and politicising a critical national security issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-lists-govt-s-achievement-crisis-in-rajasthan-is-one-of-them/story-OCEOqHWXJVi3TMdOjj3DgK.html

21-07-2020||India||Central team flags poor infection control in Patna Covid-19 hospitals, says it will create super spreaders||A Central team’s visit to Bihar’s first dedicated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) facility, Nalanda Medical College & Hospital (NMCH), in Patna, on Sunday was relegated to the back-burner and exposed the sorry state of pandemic management in the state.TV news channels on Monday telecast the horrific footage in a loop of the body of a Covid-19 victim lying in the middle of a ward while the delegates were making rounds of the hospital to assess the ground reality about the contagion management in the state. A Central team member was aghast to see an unrestricted movement of attendants and sundry other people in Covid-19 wards. “Such reckless acts are like superspreaders. The hospital needs to guard against the spread of infection. Else, it will be difficult to break the transmission pattern,” the member was quoted as saying during his interaction with a healthcare professional from Patna.Later, the delegates underscored that it is imperative to strengthen the hospital’s infection control policy; and instill confidence among frontline healthcare workers, who are battling the pandemic, during a meeting with Bihar government officials.Dr. Neeraj Nischal of New Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said a strict hospital infection control policy is the top priority and doctors and paramedical staff need to undergo exhaustive training to implement it.“The policy implementation will ensure that doctors and healthcare workers will work without any fear and hesitation amid the spread of the viral outbreak. All healthcare personnel will perform better, if they are made to feel safe,” said Dr. Nischal.The delegates have taken strong exception to the unfettered movement of attendants in the Covid-19 facility. “The wards are prohibited areas. The attendants’ unrestricted movement makes them potential superspreaders,” Dr. Nischal said during the meeting, while efforts are on to boost the morale of the hospital’s healthcare staff.Dr. Nischal is believed to have advocated for a mechanism to train doctors and healthcare workers in infection control in Bihar’s medical colleges that can function as nodal centres.The Central team members reinforced the concept of aggressive daily testing while citing that Bihar has been lagging behind in optimal utilisation of its test potential. “Bihar needs to conduct around 18,000 daily tests, which must be further increased. Test-contain-treat should the simple three-step formula to treat Covid-19 patients. An uptick in aggressive daily testing count is the need of the hour, as the state had to cope with a massive influx of migrant population amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions,” said Dr. Nischal, who also interacted with civil surgeons and others involved with the bid to contain the contagion, in the presence of Manoj Kumar, executive director, Bihar State Health Society (BSHS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patna-central-team-flags-poor-infection-control-in-hospitals-says-it-will-create-super-spreaders/story-22Vlp0oMEa129tSdawfqwJ.html

The team inspected some containment zones and dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in Patna and Gaya. It asked the state’s health department to focus on “contact-tracing and testing” to combat the deadly virus more effectively. Based on its survey, the team warned that Bihar could see a further rise in coronavirus cases, and recommended ramping up of the state’s medicare facilities. As on Tuesday, the state has recorded 27,646 cses of Covid-19 and 217 related deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-state-tally-delhi-records-less-than-1-000-cases-for-first-time-in-7-weeks-bihar-a-concern/story-AjZFWELb5292xbi6gOmm2O.html

It did not prompt any serious side effects and elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses, according to trial results published in The Lancet medical journal.A coronavirus vaccine under development by CanSinoBiologics Inc and China’s military research unit also showed that it appears to be safe and induced an immune response in most of the 508 healthy volunteers who got one dose of the vaccine.Germany’s BioNTech and US drugmaker Pfizer Inc also released details from a small study in Germany of a different type of vaccine that uses ribonucleic acid (RNA).In the not-yet peer-reviewed study of 60 healthy adults, the vaccine-induced virus-neutralising antibodies in those given two doses, a result in-line with a previous early-stage US trial. Closer home, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, began recruiting healthy participants for the continuous phase 1 and 2 trial of Covaxin, jointly developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech.In the phase 1 trial, the vaccine will be given to a small number of people to see whether it is safe. In phase 2, scientists will check the immune response it produces.The participants will also be followed up for 28 days and a longer period to check for any adverse effects, apart from the immediate reactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-37-148-new-covid-19-cases-in-24-hours-india-s-infection-tally-over-11-55-lakh/story-Ev6NPwubSlVsohPgIurgeM.html

India has the option of buying another six from Boeing to be negotiated later in 2021, people familiar with the developments in New Delhi and Seattle said.The Indian Navy variant of the P-8A Poseidon - P-8I where I stands for India - is essentially designed for maritime patrol. Integrated with the Harpoon Block II air launched missiles and lightweight torpedoes, the reconnaissance craft - it can carry 129 sonobuoys to locate subs - turns into a deadly submarine killer that can also launch anti-ship missiles.The proposed acquisitions come against the backdrop of China’s efforts to militarise the South China Sea and expand its sea footprint.Beijing had already acquired a string of ports in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran and east Africa to not only contain the Indian Navy but also challenge the presence of US Central Command forces as well as French and British Navy.Beijing has 70 percent stake in Kyaukpyu port in Myanmar, which sits in the Bay of Bengal, Hambantota port in South Sri Lanka dominates the Indian Ocean, Gwadar port in Pakistan sits on the mouth of Gulf of Oman and the port of Jask in Iran is located on the edge of Persian Gulf.National security planners believed that the possibility of China attempting to replicate its aggressive posture along the Line of Actual Control at a time of its choosing in the Indian Ocean Region was very real, a government official said.India also inched closer to formalising the anti-China QUAD - Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - strategic grouping. The United States, Japan and Australia are the other members.In some measure, the QUAD is already a reality on the high seas due to India signing the Communications, Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) agreement in September 2019. The P-8I helped.The pact provided the legal framework for exchange of encrypted communication. P-8I makes this possible with ease, particularly since the aircrafts are interoperable, can communicate securely and is designed for .“This is a de-facto QUAD because these have interoperability with the P-8A Poseidon delivered to other countries,” said the official.The secure communications enables one aircraft to share real-time operational intelligence, including a Common Tactical Picture with other P-8 aircraft.The P-8I aircraft is designed for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It operates with joint and combined But it can be used elsewhere too. The military had relied on the reconnaissance aircraft for surveillance during the ongoing Ladakh standoff with China as well as the 2017 Doklam standoff.It has a range of about 2,200 km and flies at a maximum speed of 490 knots, or 789 km per hour.The negotiations for the purchase of six more P-8I aircraft are yet to begin, a government official in New Delhi said. The purchase of six P-8I was cleared by the Defence Acquisition Council in November 2019, long before the stand-off with an aggressive China along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-sub-killer-p-8i-crafts-coming-to-india-next-year-then-talks-for-six-more/story-Y7jNhu6lZHU4dF2SXraU8M.html
21-07-2020||India||Delhiwale: And then there was music...||They have left. His partner has gone back to her family in Jaipur, and he has returned to his parents’ apartment in Gurugram’s Sector 30. “Everything has changed... it’s like our whole world has crashed down,” he says, talking on WhatsApp video.Indeed, musician Sidharth Gupta, 26, could no longer afford the rent of the second-floor barsati they had been calling home for almost a year, in Malviya Nagar in south Delhi. His resources quickly dried out as live performances, occasional assignments for music production and guitar tuitions had to stop when the coronavirus pandemic hit the country. As soon as the long lockdown was lifted and the Delhi-Haryana interstate border was unsealed, he gave up the place. Now, at his parents’ home in Gurugram, where he was living until one year ago, the music man is trying to pick up the pieces of his pre-corona life.In hindsight, those Malviya Nagar days in the BC (Before Corona) era seem like a dream, a kind of life belonging to artistes devoted to their passions. Sidharth would wake up around 9am. Mornings would always pass in a flurry of household chores that he would divide with his partner—jharoo pocha (sweeping) and cooking. Their terrace residence had two rooms, one of which he used as his “home studio”, and had filled with guitars, synthesizers, keyboards, speakers, and processing equipments.Lunch hour would come and go and as soon as the clock would strike two, his bandmate Utkarsh Varma would arrive by Uber, from his home in Greater Kailash II. Sidharth and Utkarsh have been friends since their school days in Delhi’s DPS RK Puram, and both specialise in electronica and hiphop. They co-founded a band—Shoals—two years ago, and they also produce music for clients. Together in the barsati, they would spend hours creating music scores while Sidharth’s partner, who works in the academia, was usually busy with her own work in the other room. If the daylight outside was changing with the passing of hours, the two musicians wouldn’t know — the home studio had heavy thick curtains drawn across the windows, and the light within was always the same. They would call it off by 8pm, and Utkarsh would leave, except on evenings when they had planned a get-together with common friends. Then, they would all sit in the barsati terrace outside, their bare arms smeared with Odomos cream to keep off the mosquitoes. Those were pleasant nights of chitchats, beer and impromptu music.That used to be the life back then.In the ongoing pandemic-ridden days, Sidharth keeps working with Utkarsh, of course, but they interact over the internet, working separately from their respective houses and exchanging recordings from computer to computer as they move on. He also continues to teach a few students individually through video calls, and takes on projects that can be carried on remotely, such as mixing or production jobs. “But the thing with music,” he says, “is that it is very important to feel the energy of your bandmate right around you.... and yet we have to adapt and change the way we work.”In the new normal, Sidharth says, “my routine involves a lot more practice on the guitar, as I had slowly lost my connection with the instrument when life was busy with lots of projects and jobs.” After practising for a few hours, he eventually shifts his focus to the various commissioned projects. Later, in his room, Sidharth poses for a photo shoot through the phone screen that connects him to this reporter. He sits on the edge of his bed littered with his laptop, synthesizer and all sorts of other instruments, and starts playing the guitar. Rest is music.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-and-then-there-was-music/story-eOlgdxnu2uSf4pbwAuLc2O.html
21-07-2020||India||Workers must be paid for extra hours, says Centre||The union labour ministry informed a Parliamentary panel that it will insist on appropriate compensation for workers in states which diluted factory laws to allow longer shifts.As the demand for workers in factories jumped after production lines restarted in May, many states relaxed labour laws to extend daily shifts from 8 hours to 12 hours to help industries cope up with the shortage of staff.Deposing before the parliament’s standing committee on labour, Hiralal Samariya, labour secretary, said that if an industry makes workers slog for extra hours, then it has to pay 200% of daily basic pay—as stipulated in the law—for each extra hour. Samariya also added that if the worker is on duty in a holiday, then he has to be paid 300% of his basic. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal have relaxed labour laws.Panel chairman, BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab, questioned the authenticity of the ministry’s headcount for migrant workers. When the officials said that they have calculated number of passengers in shramik special trains to conclude that 1.09 crore migrant workers have returned home, Mahtab argued that shramik special trains also carried stranded students and tourists.Also read: Rajasthan creates most jobs for migrants under govt planThe panel also insisted that the ministry must come up with special social security card for all migrant workers—those coming through agencies, self-employed or joining factories directly—that will help them getting social security coverage. The panel said that as migrant workers have started returning to cities, the receiving states must make the social security cards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/workers-must-be-paid-for-extra-hours-says-centre/story-URRWomgs8FlYX7FWK2SfTJ.html

21-07-2020||India||Vikas Dubey encounter: Madhya Pradesh forms panel to decide ₹5 lakh reward||Madhya Pradesh police have formed a three-member panel to determine who deserves the ~5 lakh reward, their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh offered for the capture of gangster Vikas Dubey, who was killed in an encounter with the latter on July 10, a day after his arrest from the Mahakal temple premises in Ujjain. The panel was formed after some initial claimants to the reward said they played no role in the arrest of Dubey, the prime accused in the killing of eight policemen in Kanpur’s Bikru village on July 3. The committee comprises superintendent of police (SP), Ujjain City, Rupesh Dwivedi; SP, Ujjain rural, Amrendra Singh; and an additional SP rank officer.The top contender for the reward is Suresh Mali, who sells puja material and flowers at the Mahakal temple, according to people familiar with the matter , who requested anonymity. Mali recognised the gangster entering the temple and alerted the temple’s security staff, they said.Security guard Rahul Sharma is also in the reckoning for the reward, they added. Mali spoke to him about Dubey being present on the temple premises and he, in turn, informed the police. Initially, there were several claimants to the reward. But may changed their statements and admitted that they played no role in the capture of the gangster. Temple security guard Lakhan Yadav and priest Gopal Singh, for instance, initially spoke about the key role they played in the arrest, but could not corroborate their stories.Inspector general of police, Ujjain range, Rakesh Gupta, said the three-member committee was determining the role that various people played in the arrest of Dubey. The committee’s report would be submitted soon, following which Ujjain police would share it with UP police, he said.“There will be at least one civilian, a guard and our jawans who made the arrest. The committee has started working on this,” he said.Suresh Kahar (Mali), the flower seller in Ujjain who first spotted Dubey at the Mahakal temple and informed a guard, said, “I have heard through media that the security guard’s and my name have been selected for the reward. It’s all Mahakal’s blessings.”After Dubey’s arrest, Uttar Pradesh director general of police HC Awasthy said the reward money would be sent to the Madhya Pradesh state police chief to be awarded to those who merited it. MP officials said Kanpur police wrote a letter to Ujjain police, asking for the names of people who deserved the reward.Ujjain’s superintendent of police Manoj Singh was not available for comment on the issue. Inspector general of police, Kanpur range, Mohit Agarwal said he was not aware of any letter going out to the MP police from his office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vikas-dubey-encounter-madhya-pradesh-forms-panel-to-decide-5-lakh-reward/story-Qh8hZYaL48HADvPbyF9j1N.html

Hindustan Times is in possession of the postmortem report prepared by a panel of three doctors in Kanpur. Two bullets pierced through the left side of the chest and the other went through the right side of Dubey’s shoulder.Other injuries were presumably caused in the process he was trying to flee and might have fallen, said the report.The report doesn’t mention the distance the shots were fired from. The entry points of all the bullets were on the front side.Dubey was killed in an encounter near Sachendi here when he was being brought back from Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, where he was arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gangster-vikas-dubey-died-of-blood-loss-says-autopsy-report/story-qKCV3XOj1Cj8Hck55sT7xH.html
21-07-2020||India||Dubey encounter: Supreme Court asks UP to keep ex-judge, DGP in panel||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Uttar Pradesh government to consider appointing a retired Supreme Court judge and a former Director General of Police in a panel enquiring the July 10 encounter killing of dreaded gangster Vikas Dubey, even as the top court observed that it was the “failure of the institution” that a criminal who should have been in jail was out on bail instead.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP government, agreed to bring a draft notification by Wednesday that will have the names of the retired Supreme Court judge and a former DGP selected by the state government. Once it is approved by the apex court, the same shall be notified.The state appointed retired Allahabad high court judge Shashi Kant Agarwal on July 12 to investigate the death of the gangster, who faced over 60 criminal cases, in an alleged encounter. “We are appalled at the fact that such a person was released on bail despite having so many cases. As an institution we have failed to keep a person behind bars,” a bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said, hearing a batch of pleas against the killing of Dubey and his associates by the police.The three-judge bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, told the Uttar Pradesh government that it was the state’s duty to uphold the rule of law.Dubey, who faced over 60 criminal cases, was shot dead on July 10 after he tried to escape from police custody while being transported to Kanpur, officials said. He was arrested from Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain the previous day.Dubey and his associates killed eight policemen, including a deputy superintendent of police, in a 15-minute ambush in Bikru village near Kanpur city on July 3 after the police team reached there to carry out a raid and arrest the gangster. Dubey and his aides escaped after the attack.Before Dubey was shot dead — police said he snatched a pistol from an official, fired at the team bringing him back to Kanpur and tried to escape after the vehicle carrying him overturned — five of his alleged accomplices too were killed in separate encounters.The court had indicated last week that it was keen to set up a judicial committee to probe the Dubey killing incident similar to the one it had set up in December 2019 when four rape-murder accused were shot dead in an encounter with Telangana police. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who represented UP DGP told the Court that a judicial enquiry in this case will demoralize the police force. He said the policemen’s rights when faced with a dreaded criminal who slaughtered policemen, must be upheld as well. The bench said, “If rule of law is to be strengthened, it will not demoralize forces…. You (police) must also understand that you are responsible for maintaining rule of law. It requires arrest, trial and sentence, if guilty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dubey-encounter-supreme-court-asks-up-to-keep-ex-judge-dgp-in-panel/story-w5iuBj1lTMcNO12kAsnmUP.html
21-07-2020||India||2014 Supreme Court order stopped Choksi from running a coal mine: Enforcement Directorate||If the Supreme Court hadn’t scrapped the allocation of 214 coal blocks en masse in September 2014 on the ground of “illegality”, fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi may well have been running a coal mine. According to the latest charge sheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), a joint venture between Choksi’s Gitanjali Group of Companies and Kolkata based EMTA Coal Ltd , named as M/s GEMTA Coalmines Ltd, managed to get a contract for “development and operation” of Urma Paharitola coal block in Dumka, Jharkhand. The agency has relied on the statement of Upender Kumar, a director in GEMTA, for this information.The coal mine was originally allotted by the UPA government in 2010-11 to two state run companies , M/s Bihar State Mineral Development Corporation and M/s Jharkhand State Electricity Board from Bihar and Jharkhand respectively. The two state-run companies formed a joint venture, M/s JHARBIHAR Colliery Ltd for the development and operation of the block but then they issued a tender in March 2012 seeking bids from experienced mining organizations including consortia for the same, the ED charge sheet, which has been reviewed by HT, states.Also read: ED files new charge sheet to aid Mehul Choksi’s extraditionThe charge sheet adds that the same year (2012), three companies belonging to Mehul Choksi’s Gitanjali Group (M/s Gitanjali Gems Ltd, Mozart Trading Pvt Ltd and Partha Gems LLP) formed a consortium with EMTA Coal Ltd and submitted their bid along with a bank guarantee of ~ 2 crore against the tender. The bid was successful, and a letter of intent (LoI) was issued to them in March 2014. GEMTA, Upender Kumar has revealed, was formed with an authorized capital investment of ~5 crore, and its registered office was in Kolkata.Choksi’s Gitanjali Group held a majority stake of 51% shares in the company , while EMTA held 49%. “It was basically a third party contract to GEMTA and not direct allocation of a block to Choksi’s company,” said an ED official. “After the decision of SC [in 2014], formation of joint venture– GEMTA Coalmines became ‘infructuous’, and bank guarantee of ~12 crore, which was submitted to JHARBIHAR expired on October 31, 2014,” the ED charge sheet says. The SC had termed the allocation arbitrary; the allocation was estimated to have cost the state ~1.86 lakh crore. It was one of the scandals responsible for the loss of the United Progressive Alliance government in 2014.When contacted, Mehul Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said : “ED’s whole case is based on statements recorded under Section 50 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Admissibility of the same is under consideration by larger bench in Supreme Court as referred in Tofan Singh‘s case. So ultimately their cases are bound to fall flat. All this is a cock and bull story.” Aggarwal was referring to the Tofan Singh Vs State of Tamil Nadu case, in which SC, while dealing with the issue of evidentiary value of confessions, referred the matter to a larger bench. HT could not trace representatives of EMTA Coal Ltd .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2014-supreme-court-order-stopped-choksi-from-running-a-coal-mine-enforcement-directorate/story-Yxk8qSQHDC4qRJ0WicFnVO.html
21-07-2020||India||Rural unemployment inches up, urban figure dips slightly||India’s rural unemployment rate has started moving upward, with the summer crop sowing season drawing to an end.The rural unemployment rate climbed to 7.1% in the week ended July 19 from 6.34% recorded in the previous week, according to fresh data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). This is still below the figure for the week before India went into a lockdown on March 25, but economists feel it will see a gradual climb in the coming weeks, and July may not see job creation picking up much.Overall national unemployment also inched up to 7.94% in the week ended July 19 from 7.44% the previous week. However, urban unemployment remains the bigger concern, as it continues to stay high and its decline has been slower.Also read: Rajasthan creates most jobs for migrants under govt planThe urban joblessness rate came down marginally to 9.78% from 9.92% during the same time period, according to CMIE, reflecting the stubborn formal sector jobs space that is directly influenced by the existing business environment, which is improving very slowly.Economists and experts said the labour market will see a tougher challenge over the next couple of months both in the rural areas and in urban pockets. In rural India, the sowing season is nearing an end. Monsoon is expected to pick up in parts of India, bringing along with it natural calamities such as floods, which will restrict activities in the agriculture sector and partially limit low-end self-employment avenues.In urban areas witnessing sporadic lockdowns, the slow reopening of businesses will limit the faster recovery that the country saw in June.“The sowing season is nearing completion and the strain in the rural labour market will be visible in the coming weeks. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is helpful but may not be able to take pressure off and absorb all the people during the rainy season, who were earlier largely deployed in agricultural activities,” said Arup Mitra, a professor of economics at the Institute of Economic Growth in New Delhi.Also read: Sectors not hit by coronavirus may see spike in hiringCMIE data shows that rural employment scenario is much better in recent weeks, but “we must take note that a higher labour force participation rate in agriculture means only a marginal growth in productivity of labour. Immediate income growth is not there,” Mitra said.The Centre and the states must devise a strategy for the growth of non-farm sector in rural India which can help absorb people in decent jobs, he said. The slow recovery of businesses and the urge to cut cost by employers for survival has a direct impact on employment, Mitra contended.GN Jha, a farmer from Purnia in Bihar, agreed. “Farmers with a good land holding are doing fine, but people who don’t have enough land or working as daily wagers are in real trouble. The lack of cash in hand is a problem, and this will prompt people to go back to urban areas again despite the bad living conditions there. This is where non-farm activities and white-collar jobs in regional level will be of help,” Jha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rural-unemployment-inches-up-urban-figure-dips-slightly/story-cb4SJ2138xqSLR8HlZrs7N.html
21-07-2020||India||Two petitions on artefacts draw the ire of apex court||Petitions filed before the Supreme Court seeking preservation of artifacts recovered from the Ram Mandir site at Ayodhya in Faizabad district, drew the ire of the top court, which, on Monday, termed the plea as an attempt scuttle the November 2019 judgment of the top court awarding the site to the child deity, Ram Lalla Virajman for construction of Ram temple.A bench headed by justice Arun Mishra imposed costs of ₹1 lakh on each of the petitioners, stating that the petitions were frivolous and displayed scant respect for the top court’s verdict.“You are just trying to stop the verdict of this court. Is there no respect for this court’s judgment. We will order CBI investigation into all people involved in this petition”, justice Mishra remarked.Two separate petitions were filed before the top court in June pointing out the news reports about the discovery of ancient artifacts and remains of monuments at the temple site in May. One petition was filed by four persons from Maharashtra associated with cultural organization, Samyak Vishwa Sangh. The other petition was filed by DrAmbedkar Bodhikunja Foundation, a Bihar based NGO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-petitions-on-artefacts-draw-the-ire-of-apex-court/story-Ix4EExpDlBUv7xsBcoC7FK.html
21-07-2020||India||Rajasthan creates most jobs for migrants under govt plan||Rajasthan, whose chief minister Ashok Gehlot is now embroiled in a political battle with his ousted deputy Sachin Pilot, generated the highest employment in the first month of the Centre’s flagship job scheme for migrant workers who have returned home in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Rs 50,000-crore Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyaan, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 20, is spread across 116 districts from six states: Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha. Bihar, the launchpad of the programme, has emerged as the top spender under it.Bihar is home to the second highest number of migrant workers, next only to Uttar Pradesh, who returned home after the government enforced the lockdown for the pandemic starting on March 25. It has spent ~2,558 crore under the programme, and Rajasthan has generated 41.1 million persondays of employment, according to government data accessed by HT.Also read: House schedule may change next sessionThe job scheme was announced after at least 10 million daily wage workers returned home amid the lockdown that sparked fears of loss of livelihood. Policymakers clubbed together 25 schemes to generate jobs through the programme, primarily construction work that uses skilled migrant labourers. Only districts with at least 25,000 returnee migrant workers were eligible for the scheme. The scheme generated 110.2 million days of employment in the first month in all six states, underlining the demand for skilled jobs. The Centre’s other flagship programme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), saw a surge in unskilled employment in the hinterland of India.The six states have collectively spent ~ 9,699.62 crore so far on the scheme that will run for at least 125 days. Rajasthan, geographically India’s largest state, started the MGNREGS season on a tepid note because of the lockdown, but it generated 41.1 million days of work at a cost of ~2,502.67 crore. It has completed 24,000 projects of rural housing and 13,000 pieces of work for laying of optical fiber cables.Bihar, now home to at least three million migrant returnees, has given 18.7 million days of employment. It, too, saw heavy participation in building rural houses for the poor (53,741 projects), followed by laying of fiber optic cable (16,856 projects). Bihar generated fewer than half the days of work that Rajasthan did despite spending more. Jharkhand, is yet to pick up pace. It created just 1.83 million days of employment and spent ~247.92 crore—the lowest among the six states. Experts said the spending patterns and extent of job creation can vary because of different factors. “You need to see which projects are being taken up in higher quantity. Constructing national highways is less labour-intensive...construction of a rural house needs 2-3 workers whereas a cattle shed requires just one man,” said former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra. India’s most populous state, UP, received over 3.5 million migrants in the last three months. Under the scheme, it has generated 27.2 million days of employment and spent ~ 2,142.29 crore. Madhya Pradesh created 18.8 million days of employment, spending ~1,903 crore; Odisha generated 2.44 million days of employment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-creates-most-jobs-for-migrants-under-govt-plan/story-UzInXiEwoYp9aYN89di4TI.html
21-07-2020||India||House schedule may change next session||Indian Parliament’s monsoon session might see a different daily schedule for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to facilitate the participation of the largest number of lawmakers possible from each House while adhering to social distancing norms necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. A senior official familiar with the matter said that while one House could start in the morning at the scheduled time of 11 am, the other House could start its proceedings in the afternoon, to ensure minimum interaction between MPs of the two Houses and adequate space for lawmakers of both. The Lok Sabha’s current strength is 542 and that of the Rajya Sabha is 242. If this happens, it won’t be the first time parliament’s schedule has changed. During the 1962 and 1971 wars and the Emergency, the House proceedings were delayed. “This is also an emergency situation,” argued a second official familiar with the matter. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.

21-07-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine: Health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan says too soon for procurement in India||A deal for a vaccine with the developers of any of the candidates is too premature for India at this point, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday, even as news poured in of successes by at least three teams of researchers, some of whom have already entered into deals with other countries. Early-stage trial results published in the journal Lancet showed the vaccine candidate developed at the University of Oxford is safe and effective. The news was separately followed by successes reported by a Chinese as well as a German vaccine. “I do not know about the details of this particular vaccine candidate but there are more than 200 trials happening around the world currently for developing a vaccine against Covid-19, and all are currently far from the stage of manufacturing. None of these are a ready vaccine, rather, these are merely vaccine candidates,” said minister Harsh Vardhan, while also seeking to assure that India will not lag behind in providing vaccines to its people.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know today“Even though we are closely following every single related development, it will still be too premature to put out the vaccine procurement and roll-out plan of the government in public domain just as yet,” he said.“Having said that, I want to tell people that India government is in touch with all concerned involved in anti-Covid vaccine development, both nationally and internationally. I want to assure our citizens that the government is working to ensure whenever a vaccine is ready, wherever it is ready, it will be made available to our people also. We are also in touch with the World Health Organisation in this regard. We won’t lag behind in any way. We have plans in place and at the right time, we will make the information public,” he added.The minister also said that for the past few months, India is fully focused on managing Covid-19 pandemic in the country, with great success, including expediting drugs and vaccine development initiatives.“We have been expediting all permissions, be it related to investigational therapies such as Remdesivir or granting approvals to our indigenous vaccine candidates. There has been no delay and we have made some of the life-saving drugs available to our people in record time without compromising on regulatory requirements. The government is making concerted efforts, and will take up anything that is seen moving in a positive direction, and is good for its people. We are closely following the whole process,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-health-minister-dr-harsh-vardhan-says-too-soon-for-procurement-in-india/story-QjXAywMZ1ubdpPfcJshtxL.html
21-07-2020||India||AIIMS starts recruiting volunteers for Covaxin trial||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, began recruiting on Monday healthy participants for the continuous phase 1 and 2 trial of Covaxin, jointly developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. It is one of the 12 centres that will test the safety and immunogenicity, the ability of a substance to provoke an immune response in the body, of the vaccine candidate. “In the phase 1 trial, the vaccine will be given to a small number of people to see whether it is safe. In phase 2, we will check the immune response it produces. For that, we will have to check the antibody level of the participants as Covid-19 can be asymptomatic in many. We have a target of 100 patients. The trial vaccine will be given in an area close to the hospital emergency in case someone goes into anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction that can close the airway of a person),” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS Delhi.Apart from the immediate reactions, the participants will also be followed up for 28 days and a longer period to check for any adverse effects.Also read: Vaccine results shot in the arm for Covid fightThe participants will receive three combinations with different adjuvants – an agent that improves the immune response -- of the vaccine in either 3 microgram or 6 microgram doses. Apart from figuring out the correct dose, the investigators will also look at whether the immune response is long-lasting.“We need a vaccine that is first and foremost safe, the triggers and immune response, and that immunity lasts for at least a year or two. If it just lasts for six weeks, then it is of no use. Fortunately, from what we have learnt so far, the mutations in the virus have not been very significant or the antigenic drift is not as fast as the flu for which vaccine has to be taken every year. The mutations reported so far have not been in the spike protein that is the target of vaccines,” said Dr Guleria.In just 24 hours after seeking applications from people, the hospital received 1,000 applications against its requirement of 100 volunteers. Dr Guleria said the centre may be able to finish the trial in two to three months if the screening goes well. “Normally, a vaccine takes about 10 years to develop. That is because the different phases of the trial are conducted one after the other after evaluation of the results. It is a financial risk if everything is done simultaneously as all vaccine candidates do not work and scientists might have to go back to the drawing board. But, in this case, everything is happening simultaneously. Even as the effectiveness of the vaccine is being studied, manufacturing capacity is also being built,” said Dr Guleria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-starts-recruiting-volunteers-for-covaxin-trial/story-yGOb69cBQiZHmgUpu4bWWO.html
21-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India crossed the 40,000 cases-in-a-day mark for the first time on Sunday. Should one be worried?In the month between June 20 and July 19, the country added 705,097 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to the HT dashboard. That translates to 63.14% of the 1,116,597 cases it saw (cumulatively) till July 19.In the same period, it saw 14,209 deaths, 51.6% of the 27,487 cumulative deaths till July 19.But there is good news as well. The period saw 472,179, or 67.42% of the 700,324 recoveries from Covid-19 till July 19. On June 20, India’s recovery rate was 55.44%. On July 19, it was 62.71%. On June 20, India’s death rate (measured by the case fatality rate) was 3.22%. On July 19, it was 2.46%.Even when measured as a proportion of closed cases (deaths plus recoveries), the death rate has seen an improvement between June 20 and July 19 — from 5.5% to 3.77%.India had 170,077 active cases on June 20; and 388,786 on July 19.Also read: Delhi records lowest Covid-19 cases reported since June 1Irrespective of whatever else the numbers prove (or don’t), they clearly establish that: one, we seem to be getting better at saving lives (which, a previous instalment of this column wrote, was in evidence even globally) and two, the number of daily cases has been increasing.The first is important because it establishes that the increase in daily deaths (now consistently close to 700 as compared to consistently around 400 a month ago) ,while worrying, is offset by the fact that the proportion of those recovering is rising. The second is important because, when disaggregated across states, cities, and districts, it tells administrations where hospital beds and health care intervention are most needed.The increase in the number of daily cases has also come against the backdrop of increased testing. India was conducting an average of 177,439 tests on June 20. That increased to an average of 327,048 tests a week on July 20 (all averages are five-day ones). I’ve previously written about the relationship between cases and tests: as testing increases, the number of cases as a proportion of the tests (a.k.a. the positivity rate) increases to a point, then plateaus, and finally starts declining. Delhi, for instance, is clearly seeing a decline — as is Mumbai (although the Maharashtra numbers are now being driven to new highs by cases from the larger Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, and other parts of the state). Tamil Nadu is continuing to identify more new cases as it tests more (the state has carried out the most tests in India in absolute terms, around 2 million), but its positivity rate has come down from its peaks and continues to remain in the 10-12% range. On Sunday, for instance, the state saw 4,979 new cases, but carried out 52,993 tests, translating to a positivity rate of 9.39% (a number that is also within the range acknowledged by experts around the world that signifies adequate testing).Also read | India’s fatality rate lower than global average: GovtOther states, too, are seeing an increase in cases as they test more. Many of them — and this has been my refrain for weeks now — are still not testing enough, though, which is reflected in their positivity rates (either too low, without showing the waxing and the waning that comes with aggressive and adequate testing, as in Uttar Pradesh; or too high, as in West Bengal). Interestingly, in both states, the positivity rate has been increasing. The average daily positivity rate for the past week for Uttar Pradesh was 4.3%, and West Bengal, 14.4%, which is higher than the cumulative positivity rates in the two states — 3.3% for Uttar Pradesh, and 6% for West Bengal.Bihar is no different — its cumulative positivity rate is 6.96% and its average for the past week, 14.2%. Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal are three of India’s four most populous states (at first, third and fourth positions respectively; Maharashtra is in second).Which means the number of daily cases in India can be expected to increase even more over the next month, maybe even longer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-SWYE8nwWT76TD1yGMxCVVP.html

India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted thunderstorm with moderate to heavy intensity rain and gusty wind with a speed of 40-70km per hour over the national capital till 2 am, news agency ANI reported. The national capital is likely to witness heavy rains at isolated places over the next two days, the India Meteorological Department had said earlier in the day.Widespread moderate rains are predicted for the rest of Delhi and neighbouring areas, it said.“Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy showers very likely over Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh during the next two days,” it said in a weather forecast.“The rainfall intensity and distribution are very likely to decrease significantly thereafter,” the IMD said.The convergence of moist easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal and southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea is likely to continue over northwest India for another two-three days, weather experts said.The monsoon though is also running through the region. These two factors together can lead to moderate to heavy rains in Delhi-NCR in the next 24 hours, they said.The IMD’s regional forecasting centre predicted moderate rains along with winds gusting up to 40 kilometers per hour towards Monday night.During the day, sporadic light rains and cloudy weather kept the mercury in check in the national capital.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides official figures for the city, recorded a maximum of 32.6 degrees Celsius, two notches below the normal.The mercury oscillated between 30 degrees Celsius and 33 degrees Celsius in most parts of the city.On Sunday, the first heavy monsoon rainfall in Delhi claimed four lives, including that of a mini-truck driver who got trapped in a waterlogged underpass.According to the IMD, the Safdarjung Observatory had recorded 74.8 mm rainfall on Sunday.The Ridge and Lodhi Road weather station recorded 86 mm and 81.2 mm rainfall, respectively.Rainfall recorded below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate, and above 64.5mm is heavy, according to the IMD.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thunderstorm-rain-in-parts-of-delhi-heavy-downpour-likely-over-next-two-days/story-oB3FZgVioNLaoCVbbLsJhM.html

The patient who was believed to have been ailing with liver and heart issues became the state’s 23rd Covid-19 victim. Goa has recorded 3,853 cases till date and while the state was recording daily cases in double digits through the month of June, they have since moved to triple digits since the start of July giving a renewed headache to the state that was once credited with keeping the figures low. Health authorities have expressed concern that manufacturing units located in Goa’s industrial estates have become super spreaders of the disease with a single pharma company contributing 136 positive cases and prompting reprimand from the health secretary. Covid-19 cases from industrial units also spark fears of the disease spreading in the localities they hail from. On a positive note, two people above the age of 90 have recovered from the virus and have since been discharged after being in the hospital for 23 days. “A 90-year old woman who was admitted in a critical condition and, suffering from dementia and malnutrition steadily improved under the able treatment and care of the COVID Hospital doctors and staff,” the state government said in a statement. She was the second 90-year old to survive after a 91-year-old was cured and discharged a couple of weeks back. The Mormugao taluka of Goa has been placed under a week-long lockdown even as the rest of the state emerged from a weekend lockdown. Mormugao is the worst affected taluka in the state and accounts for more than one-third of the state’s Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-year-old-man-is-goa-s-youngest-covid-19-victim/story-ioCmabAaLeKC1mVKJP6tOM.html

I have moved CAT [the Central Administrative Tribunal] and am awaiting justice,” she said.A second official, who also works in the CAG’s office, said, “She was dismissed from service immediately after the finance ministry gave its approval in May this year.” Email queries sent to CAG and the ministry of finance did not elicit any response.According to a PTI report published in HT on September 6, 2017, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) booked the principal director for allegedly diverting funds of the Coffee Board during her posting there.It said, quoting the first information report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation, that Subramaniam was charged with allegedly diverting Rs 16.2 crore of the Coffee Board funds into mutual funds, causing a loss of Rs 53.3 lakh to the organisation and corresponding gain to herself during her posting as its director, finance. The case pertained to the period between 1998 and 2003.Subramaniam on Monday said, “No single officer could take such a financial decision alone. All decisions pertaining to financial matters were taken collectively and with complete knowledge of my superiors. No money is traced to any personal or individual account. Entire money remains with the government. I have been framed for some notional loss...Truth will come out if relevant documents are produced.” A third official, working at the finance ministry, said, “The action has been taken after a thorough investigation on this matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cag-dismisses-principal-director/story-I7ZMGh9UnWDYeAhMOS0AEL.html

Apart from essential services, all other activities will be prohibited. Lockdown will be imposed on Sunday and the day either preceding or following Sunday i.e. Saturday or Monday which will be decided by the district crisis management group in such districts. The night curfew will be imposed in all the districts from 8 pm to 5 am,” said an official communiqué quoting the CM.However, there was no official information about the districts with high infection. A complete lockdown has been observed on Sundays across the state since July 8.The announcement came on a day when the state reported 710 new Covid-19 cases, taking the count to 23,310 including 6,888 active cases. With 17 more fatalities recorded during the day, the death toll rose to 738, according to the state health department bulletin released late on Monday evening.Indore district reported the maximum number of cases (6,115), followed by Bhopal (4,363 cases), Gwalior (1,706) and Morena (1,332). There are least six other districts which have more than 500 Covid cases each.Of the738 deaths, 295 have been recorded in Indore district, 138 in Bhopal and 71 in Ujjain.As per the communique released by the CM’s office, “all offices of the state and Union government will function with 30 to 50 % capacity except for the infection-free districts where offices will function to their full strength.Private offices and commercial establishments will also function with 30% to 50% capacity. In case of any corona patient is found at private offices and commercial establishments, they will be closed for 7 days.”The CM said action would be taken against any government officer and employee who didn’t wear masks, didn’t follow physical distancing or violated the Corona guidelines in any way.A review of rising corona infections in the state revealed that one of the main reasons for the spread of infection was the gathering of people.The CM made an appeal to people to celebrate all upcoming festivals including Raksha Bandhan and Eid at home. “No permission will be granted for celebration of festivals in public”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-to-impose-2-day-lockdown-every-week-in-districts-with-high-covid-19-incidence/story-yigJ9J07069C9DTXmOICsL.html

It said the Nimitz carrier strike group’s operations were designed to provide security throughout the region while building partnerships with friends and allies.The 7th Fleet is the largest of the US Navy’s forward deployed fleets.“Naval engagements such as these exercises improve the cooperation of US and Indian maritime forces and contribute to both sides’ ability to counter threats at sea, from piracy to violent extremism. These engagements also present opportunities to build upon the pre-existing strong relationship between the US and India and allow both countries to learn from each other,” it added.The Nimitz carrier strike group, consisting of flagship USS Nimitz, Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Princeton and Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Sterett and USS Ralph Johnson took part in the drills. India was represented by INS Rana, INS Sahyadri, INS Shivalik and INS Kamorta.“It was a privilege to operate with the Indian Navy,” said Rear Admiral Jim Kirk, commander of the Nimitz carrier strike group.Also read: US rejects Chinese claims in South China Sea in new escalationThe Indian Air Force has deployed half a squadron (eight to 10) of its Jaguar fighters at the Car Nicobar air base, in a show of strength amidst the tense confrontation between Indian and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, said a third official.The IAF has raised its guard along the northern border to deal with any military provocation by the Chinese forces and forward bases have been ordered to be on their highest state of alert.The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are more than 1,200 km from mainland India. A significant volume of China’s oil imports passes through the Malacca Strait, which is south-east of these islands.The Nimitz carrier strike group entered the Indian Ocean from the Malacca Strait and is on its way to the Persian Gulf.“A passage exercise is normally undertaken whenever an opportunity arises, in contrast to pre-planned maritime drills. While the Malabar exercise with the US will be conducted later this year, it is always good to exercise with like-minded navies and exchange best practices whenever there is a chance,” said naval affairs expert Captain DK Sharma (retd).The navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. It has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points under its mission-based deployment and the vessels could be diverted for any mission.Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.The nuclear-powered USS Nimitz, one of the largest warships on the planet, is returning from an operational deployment in South China Sea. A carrier strike group led by USS Ronald Reagan was part of the US drills in South China Sea.The US deployment to South China Sea came after China’s People’s Liberation Army-Navy conducted drills in the contested waters, provoking a sharp reaction from neighbouring countries and Washington. The US Navy has said its operations in South China Sea are designed to support a “free and open” Indo-Pacific.The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 17. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year.The formal invitation to Australia is expected to be extended after some time in view of delicate negotiations between India and China on disengagement and de-escalation to end their standoff along the LAC.China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-indian-us-warships-conduct-maritime-drills-in-indian-ocean/story-WwAcbU0FyKbrwcJLr05aGP.html
21-07-2020||India||LAC stand-off :Rahul attacks PM, BJP hits back||New Delhi: Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Monday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the border standoff in eastern Ladakh, saying that the Chinese were targeting the PM’s image as a strong leader, and that he feared that Modi was succumbing to it.“They (Chinese) understand that in order for Narendra Modi to be an effective politician, in order for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhappan (56) inch’, and this is the real idea the Chinese are attacking,” Gandhi said in the second part of a series of short videos on the India-China border face-off he released on Monday. His reference is to a comment made by Modi in the run up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where he referred to his 56-inch chest -- to reiterate his strongman image. That “strongman image” is Inia’s “biggest weakness” now, Gandhi tweeted in a message accompanying the video. His comments drew a swift riposte from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda, who said that the Congress leader preferred to believe the Chinese army over India’s own government, and described him as “weak on facts and strong on mud-slinging”.In his first video released on Friday, Gandhi claimed that a “troubled economy, foreign policy and neighbourhood” had prompted China to adopt an aggressive posture against India.Titled China’s Strategic Game Plan, the second video, which is two-and-a-half minutes long, is Gandhi’s take on how the Chinese have triggered the border issue to put pressure on Prime Minister Modi.“It is simply not a border issue. The worry I have is that Chinese are sitting in our territory today. Chinese don’t do anything without thinking about it strategically. In their mind they have mapped out the world and they are trying to shape the world. That’s the scale of what they are doing,” he said.“And they (Chinese) are thinking of putting pressure in a very particular way. And what they are doing is that they are attacking his (Modi’s) image... They are basically telling Mr Narendra Modi that if you do not do what we say, we will destroy the idea of Mr Narendra Modi as a strong leader,” Gandhi claimed.He then went on to ask how Modi will react to the situation.“Will he take them on? Will he take on the challenge and say absolutely not, I’m the Prime Minister of India. I do not care about my image, I’m going to take you on. Or will he succumb to them?” asked the former Congress chief. “The worry I have so far is that the Prime Minister has succumbed.”The BJP’s Nadda, in a series of tweets, said the video showed Gandhi wanted a weak India and a strong China.“We saw yet another (failed) edition of ‘Project RG Relaunch’ today. @RahulGandhi Ji was, as usual, weak on facts and strong on mud-slinging,” Nadda tweeted.“Why does one dynasty want a weak India and a strong China? Many leaders in Congress also disapprove of one dynasty’s shenanigans!” he added, in a reference to the Nehru-Gandhi family.“For years, one dynasty has been trying to destroy PM @narendramodi. Sadly for them, PM Modi’s connect with 130 crore Indians is deep-rooted. He lives and works for them,” Nadda wrote. “Those who want to destroy him will end up only further destroying their own party,” he said in a fourth tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-stand-off-rahul-attacks-pm-bjp-hits-back/story-QHRCQjtgNjZkZjdZ1WtrNK.html
21-07-2020||India||Priest at Tirumala temple dies of Covid||Calls for a temporary closure of the Venkateshwara temple in Tirumala intensified following the death of a former chief priest due to Covid-19 on Monday.Srinivasa Murthy Deekshitulu (75), one of the 18 priests of the Tirumala temple who had tested positive for Covid-19 last week, succumbed to the infection at Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS). B Vengamma, SVIMS director, said Deekshitulu, who was admitted to the hospital on Saturday, had comorbid conditions of diabetes and kidney-related ailments.Priests and employees of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) have called for a temporary closure of the temple to the public to check the spread of the virus.Deekshitulu, who belonged to Archakam Peddinti family, one of the four families of hereditary priests associated with the Tirumala temple for centuries, had served as the chief priest for over two decades. He, along with three other priests, was forced to retire in 2018 during the Telugu Desam Party government. After the YSR Congress government came to power, he had been participating in the temple rituals although he was not restored to the office.The TTD decided against following the specific procedure for last rites of hereditary priests due to the ongoing pandemic.The TTD Staff and Workers United Front, affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, submitted a representation to TTD executive officer Anil Kumar Singhal requesting that visits to the temple be temporarily suspended in the wake of a growing number of positive cases on the Tirumala hills.The TTD staff pointed out that more than 1,000 positive cases of Covid-19 were reported in Tirupati town and around 100 employees of the TTD have tested positive. “These employees can end up infecting devotees when they go up the hill to Tirumala to perform duties. In this context, employees are all very worried,” the representation stated.Soon after the death of Deekshitulu, TTD trust board chairman YV Subba Reddy flew to Vijayawada to hold a meeting with chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to discuss the demand from various sections of the TTD for the closure of the temple.Subba Reddy had told the reporters last week that 15 of 50 priests at the Tirumala temple have tested positive, besides 140 other TTD employees, since the temple was re-opened on June 8.Honorary head priest of the temple AV Ramana Deekshitulu found fault with the TTD authorities for continuing to allow pilgrims despite a surge in Covid-19 cases in Tirumala.He alleged that the TTD officials were obediently following anti-hereditary archaka (priest) and anti-Brahmin policy of the TDP. “Disaster if this continues. Please take action,” he appealed to chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priest-at-tirumala-temple-dies-of-covid/story-U3mTLeisS0xRjkQ14brkWJ.html

21-07-2020||India||Ram temple trust’s invite to PM Modi sparks political row||The timing of the start of construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya — the country is in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic — and an invitation extended to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend it by the trust mandated to oversee the construction have sparked a political debate.A day after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar criticised the timing of the bhoomi pujan, set for August 5, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh questioned the invitation extended to Modi to the ceremony by the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, which was formed last year to construct the temple.Singh said the Centre had appointed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders as members of the trust while overlooking religious figures such as the Shankaracharyas.If the Prime Minister lays the foundation stone of the temple on August 5, all Shankaracharyas and Swami Ramnareshacharya ji of the Ramanandi sect should be invited to the function and made members of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said.He supported Pawar, who has criticised the timing of the function. “You are right, Pawar saheb. Wish Modi-Shah had paid heed to what you said, then the situation of the country would have been different,” he tweeted in Hindi, referring to the Prime Minister and home minister Amit Shah.Also read | Row over invitation to PM Modi for Ram Temple bhoomi pujan unwarranted: VHPPawar, whose party is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi ruling coalition in Maharashtra, together with the Shiv Sena and Congress, said on Sunday that some people think building a temple in Ayodhya will help eradicate the Covid-19 pandemic.“We are all thinking of how to fight the battle against Covid-19 but some people think that pandemic will be mitigated by building a temple. Our priority is to see how to improve the economy which has been affected due to lockdown,” he told a press conference in Mumbai.His remarks exposed fissures within the Maha Vikas Aghadi. On Monday, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut claimed his party had “laid the road” to the Ram temple and removed the main roadblocks in its construction “not for politics but out of faith and for the cause of Hindutva”.Raut said Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray always visits Ayodhya. “Uddhav Thackeray always goes to Ayodhya. He went when he was not chief minister and he went there after becoming chief minister too,” Raut said when asked whether the chief minister will visit Ayodhya on August 5 when Modi is likely to attend the bhoomi pujan.“The ties of the Shiv Sena and Ayodhya are intact. It is not a political relationship. We do not go to Ayodhya for politics and did not go there for politics in the past too. Rather, it is the Shiv Sena which laid the road to the Ram temple,” he said.Asked about Pawar’s remark, Raut said, “The fight against coronavirus is being fought by our doctors in white attire, whom we call devdoot (messenger of God) is only what I can say.”The VHP, which has been at the forefront of the campaign to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya on a site Hindu groups believe marks the birthplace of the warrior-god, defended the invitation to Modi. It said the ceremony will be performed in line with all laid-down protocols that need to be followed to avoid transmission of the coronavirus.Alok Kumar, the international working president of the VHP, said the controversy over the invitation to the PM, who is yet to confirm his presence, was unwarranted.“There is no confirmation on who all will be present for the ceremony. The invitations have been sent out by the trust after deciding the names unanimously,” he said. GRAND PLANSAfter some changes are made to the existing model, the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya would become the third largest Hindu temple in the world, said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, designated successor of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust. Architects Nikhil Sompura and Ashish Sompura, the sons of the project’s chief architect Chandrakant Sompura, will prepare the new design.“The architects have presented a rough sketch of the new layout before Mahant Nritya Gopal Das,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das. “The temple’s height is likely to be 161 feet, width between 270 and 280 feet and length anything between 268 and 300 feet,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-trust-s-invite-to-pm-sparks-political-row/story-G0uYdLGGPjQQwsz0JUOwwL.html
21-07-2020||India||‘Development matrix’ may define share given to states||The 15th Finance Commission is in the process of devising a “development matrix” of states based on their social indicators, especially in health and education, which will likely serve as a new parameter to decide the transfer of financial resources, such as taxes and grants, to them. Finance commissions rely on a host of yardsticks in deciding a state’s share in the nation’s financial resources, such as taxes. Predominantly, income criteria, such as per capita incomes and growth, determine who gets what. Poorer and disadvantaged states get a bigger chunk of the resource pie. “But per capita incomes are not good enough a basis compared to a holistic development index, not that the two of them are coterminous. So, we felt that a development matrix will be a better guide,” chairman of the 15th Finance Commission, NK Singh, told HT. A “development matrix”, as is being considered, will for the first time bring the levels of social development, especially access to health-care and schooling, of states into the framework of how resources are distributed. Analysts say this could address deficits in crucial areas, such as health-care, provided states spend the additional resources for the purpose they are given. Also read | Boost to rural economy: Record sowing points to good harvestThe Constitution, through Article 280 to 281, provides for finance commissions as a mechanism for division of taxes and revenues vertically i.e. between the Centre and states, and horizontally, i.e. among all states, based on levels of development, prosperity and regional needs. To decide on a state’s share of resources, finance commissions usually rely on parameters such as income distance, population size, geographical location and forest cover, etc, which are then assigned weightages. Income distance is the difference between average per capita incomes and the per capita income of an individual state in question. It gives the most direct measure of how rich or poor a state is. Forest cover is included as a parameter because it is assumed that heavily forested states will have less land to devote to factories, hurting growth. Such states qualify for additional resources.“If the development matrix is put in place, states with poor health and education facilities will qualify for additional resources. That’s the implication and it is a welcome move,” said NR Bhanumurthy, the vice-chancellor of Bengaluru Dr BR Ambedkar School of Economics. Economists widely hold that, over time, poorer states should come up to the level of richer states, as richer states hit their growth limits. They call this “income convergence”.Singh said the dilemma was that in India, poorer states weren’t catching up with richer states. “We need to know what is behind this,” he said, referring to poor investment in social infrastructure.Also read: Centre’s rural spending doubles amid Covid-19 pandemicSingh said the 15th Finance Commission was therefore weighing the idea of including sectoral initiatives, such as health and education, in the development matrix. “Would sectoral initiatives be helpful? And this is the idea the Finance Commission is toying with and exploring...if this could be one way of overcoming the past legacy while trying to aim for a greater convergence by not just relying on income distance but on some other parameters,” Singh said. The Singh-led 15th Finance Commission has already submitted its first report to the government for the 2020-21 period. It then received an extension till October 30 to submit its final report covering financial years 2021-22 to 2025-26 (April-March).Some southern states, including Andhra Pradesh, have been unhappy with the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission — the body is mandated to take into account the 2011 census instead of the 1971 census. This, some southern states feel, will result in penalising them for keeping population growth stable, while rewarding the northern states. In 2018, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu said states like his would be “penalised”, and the new development matrix could lead to similar concerns from states that have done better on social indicators.“The commission will uphold the principles of efficiency as well as equity,” Singh said, when asked whether the new system would address these concerns.Indian states broadly fall into high, middle and low-income categories and unlike China, poorer states have showed no signs of moving up the income ladder towards a national income convergence. “One of the reasons is, we invest so little on health and education. These areas have an intrinsic value of their own, but also help economic growth. Including non-income parameters by the finance commission will be a significant shift,” said S Mahendra Dev, director of the Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research.India’s overall health spending has consistently lagged global averages, leading to poor health outcomes. The total expenditure on health by the Centre and states for 2019-20 was Rs 2.6 lakh crore, or just 1.29% of GDP, according to official data. This includes salaries, gross budgetary support and transfers to states under programmes such as the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. Of the total expenditure, the Centre’s share is 25%.By comparison, the UK spent 9.6% of its GDP on health in 2019-20, according to the OECD.Bhanumurthy said one problem is that if states with poor health and education infrastructure were to be given additional money to develop these facilities, there is still no mechanism to ensure that states use them specifically for these purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/development-matrix-may-define-share-given-to-states/story-qSOrqmjpymTuLpIRO4zQKO.html
21-07-2020||India||Rajasthan revokes general consent for CBI to probe cases in state||The Congress government in Rajasthan has withdrawn the general consent accorded to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases in the state, making it mandatory for the central agency to seek the state government’s express permission before investigating cases within its borders.The Rajasthan home department issued the orders on July 19, a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanded a CBI probe into the allegations by the Congress in Rajasthan that leaked audio tapes on social media proved the BJP was in collusion with rebel Congress leaders in an attempt to bring down the Ashok Gehlot government.“The government revokes all previous general consents issued by the state government under section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946,” the notification issued by the home department said.“In view of revocation of all previous general consents issues earlier vide notifications, prior consent of government of Rajasthan shall be required to be taken on case to case basis for investigation of any offence or class of offence under section 3 of the DSPE Act, 1946 by the DSPE,” it added.Rohit Kumar Singh, Rajasthan’s additional chief secretary, home, said: “Its administrative provisions were already there, it was notified yesterday [Sunday].”In 2018, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh — all states ruled by non-BJP parties — withdrew the general consent to CBI, alleging that the Centre was misusing the agency to harass opponents. The government of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, which came into power in Andhra 2019, decided to reverse the decision.CBI comes under the DSPE Act and it requires states to give the agency a general consent to act against central government employees within a state as public order and police are under the purview of state governments, which routinely renew the permission.Officials said in June 1990, too, the then Rajasthan government refused to give such ‘’ general consent’’ to the Centre, according to news agency PTI.The BJP questioned the Rajasthan government’s move, saying there was an “indirect emergency” in the state. “The way the state government misused the SOG and the ACB and it was afraid of CBI action... There is something fishy,” BJP state president Satish Poonia told reporters.There was no immediate response from the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-revokes-general-consent-for-cbi/story-UfxWQ2Wno0S51nCT8TbDsJ.html
21-07-2020||India||SC notice to Akshardham Temple Trust on petition by green activist||The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Akshardham Temple Trust, admitting an appeal by environmental activist Manoj Mishra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, an organisation founded to revive and protect the river and its floodplains, challenging a National Green Tribunal order of 2019. The notice was issued on July 13.Mishra, in an appeal to the Supreme Court, pointed out that the NGT had in effect overturned its own decision directing payment of compensation of 5% of project cost by the temple trust for seeking post-facto environmental clearance for expansion of its complex on the floodplains following a letter by the temple authorities in 2019.In 2013, Mishra moved NGT against the expansion of a cultural complex on Akshardham premises without prior environmental clearance, which is mandatory under the law.The temple trust, known as the Bochasanvasi Sri Akshar Purshottam Sanstha, applied for an environmental clearance after beginning construction on what is categorised as a flood zone recognized by NGT’s own principal committee as an area likely to be submerged during a one in 25-year flood in the absence of an embankment.NGT, after hearing the matter, directed in 2015 that the Akshardham Temple Trust pay an environmental compensation of 5% of project cost for violating the environment clearance norms.It had also directed a principal committee constituted by NGT with river and water experts from Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi; Delhi University; Jawaharlal Nehru University and others to ascertain whether the construction was indeed on the Yamuna floodplains.The Akshardham Temple Trust sent a letter on November 1, 2019 wherein it claimed that NGT’s 2015 order doesn’t stand. “It is humbly submitted that the above case has now become infructuous as no view has been expressed by the principal committee and the undersigned is suffering for no reason whatsoever. That the regular statutory renewals are being hampered due to pendency of this case and both the SC decision as well as the other earlier Manoj Mishra case on Yamuna categorically held that the Akshardham temple is a sanctioned structure…”According to Mishra’s appeal in SC, based on Akshardham Temple Trust’s letter, NGT had reopened the case and without hearing any objections by the appellant, directed that no payment was required to be made by the trust in the “absence of any violation.”“During the hearing, SC asked how can the Tribunal pass such an order based on a letter? Where does the Tribunal get the power to overturn a decision based on a letter?” said Mishra.“The expansion was not on the flood plains. It was in ‘O’zone (river zone). The expansion was on already sanctioned space. The judges in SC did say that a letter cannot be the basis for an order but we will soon submit a detailed response to all the contentions,” said Sanjay Upadhyay, advocate representing the Akshardham Temple Trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-akshardham-temple-trust-on-petition-by-green-activist/story-451m2RwUh9bLfChhJa8a4K.html
21-07-2020||India||Delhi flooding: Govt fixes responsibility, blame game on||The Public Works Department (PWD), municipal corporations and the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) have been asked to identify new waterlogging-prone areas, especially those in proximity to a construction site, the Delhi government said on Monday. A group of chief engineers has also been constituted for the purpose, it said.The direction came a day after Delhi saw one of its worst rain crisis with several areas being inundated and two people drowning on waterlogged stretches. Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev held an emergency meeting on Monday on the city’s monsoon preparedness plan. The chief secretary said that the head of the departments (HoDs) of the agencies responsible for tackling monsoon related problems will be held responsible for any lapses, officers who attended the meeting said. The Public Works Department, the MCDs, New Delhi municipal council (NDMC), Delhi Jal Board, and the revenue and flood and irrigation departments are responsible for cleaning and maintaining roads and drains in the city.Also read: Why does Delhi flood every Monsoon?“All agency heads of MCDs, NDMC, DJB, PWD and the divisional commissioner have been directed to work in unison. A group of chief engineers of these agencies has been formed to jointly inspect all vulnerable points and take coordinated action,” Dev said.The chief secretary said all the stipulations of the ‘Flood Control Order, 2020’ released on June 26 should be followed without any negligence or compromise. “Directions were also issued that the 24x7 control room must be kept operational at all times without fail. Besides, relief for any loss of life or property must be expeditiously extended, preferably same day,” Dev said.A senior official who attended the meeting said the incident in which a person drowned in the submerged road under the Minto Bridge on Sunday was also discussed in the meeting. “At Minto Bridge, the problem arose because of an embankment resulting from some construction activity. Apart from engineering solutions, at least four temporary pumps have also been set up there to drain out water,” the official said.In an interview to HT, Delhi’s PWD minister Satyendar Jain blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the Minto Bridge mess. “I think the waterlogging at Minto Bridge was because the BJP people deliberately closed the drain in front of the BJP headquarters. They had done it last year as well and we had to get it opened up. Why else would the water not drain out despite having four pumps working there?” he said.RP Singh, national general secretary BJP, refuted Jain’s claim. “These are baseless allegations. The BJP headquarter was constructed only three years ago but waterlogging problem near Minto Road has persisted for long. The truth is that out of five pumps there, only one was functioning. The AAP is in the power in Delhi for the last six years and yet there are 159 places in the city which get inundated every monsoon. They should make water harvesting pits at Minto Road to control flooding. They don’t do their work but blame others for problems.”The minister said nearly 1,500 pumps – including mobile pumps – have been deployed across the city to prevent waterlogging. The political blame game which followed the Sunday’s incidents continued on Monday with Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta holding the Delhi government’s PWD and DJB responsible for waterlogging in the city. “If the Delhi government had taken its responsibilities seriously in time, then preparations for the monsoon would have been done and no person would have died today nor would the roof have been snatched from anyone’s head. The chief minister is asking to not indulge in blame game, on the other hand his own MLAs are making baseless statements,” Gupta said. Raghav Chadha, DJB’s vice-chairperson and Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Rajendra Nagar, said that the MCDs are yet to complete desilting of all stormwater drains in the city.“The Delhi government is doing the desilting works of the drains and now the MCDs should also finish their work. At Anna Nagar, the houses that were washed away in Sunday’s downpour were built on the BJP-ruled South MCD’s drain number 12. Even the Minto Bridge stormwater drain is under the MCD,” Chadha said in a press conference.Mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) Anamika Mithilesh said initially all the staff was engaged in coronavirus related duties but still the corporation floated tenders for desilting process to start the work.“Entire process was delayed as labourers were not available in the city and our departmental staff such as sanitation workers, DBC workers were busy in sanitisation exercises; collection and transportation of garbage from containment areas. Even the machines such as jetting machine, lifters, tippers were engaged in coronavirus related works. All our drains are clean now and the allegations made by the AAP leader are baseless,” she said. Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that he conducted an inspection of all the areas on Monday where waterlogging happened and found that ghat drains were not cleaned by the PWD there.“The PWD did not complete desilting of drains. Most of these are bigger drains and smaller drains of civic bodies discharge water in them. Since these drains are not desilted, the water flows back in MCD drains and inundated the area. Instead of blaming MCDs, the government should do its work properly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-flooding-govt-fixes-responsibility-blame-game-on/story-EL70xdgzocoywBnDus31XP.html
21-07-2020||India||Odisha Human Rights body asks vigilance cop to pay Rs 5 lakh for framing official in graft case||Holding a former deputy SP of the state vigilance department guilty of framing a junior engineer in a fake bribery case, the Odisha Human Rights Commission has asked the state government to recover Rs 5 lakh from the retired vigilance officer and pay it to the engineer.In his order, OHRC chairperson justice BP Das recommended that Himansu Sekhar Mishra, the former deputy SP of the vigilance department in Dhenkanal district pay Rs 5 lakh to former junior engineer of Kamakhyanagar Notified Area Council Rajendra Prasad Mishra for framing the latter in a false vigilance case.On March 24, 2017, Rajendra Mishra was arrested by the vigilance over allegations of demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 25,000 from a contractor to facilitate an official work. He was then suspended from service.The junior engineer then moved the Odisha Human Rights Commission alleging he was framed in a false case by Himanshu Mishra, the former DSP of vigilance. He alleged that he was framed as he did not allow the contractor to execute some work in a sub-standard manner under his supervision. He alleged that the contractor conspired with the vigilance staff including the deputy SP and laid a trap.The former junior engineer submitted the CCTV footage of his office room in which a vigilance constable was seen keeping a bundle of Rs 25,000 in his left side drawer at around 6.00 pm. When the engineer raised allegations of being framed, a DIG of vigilance conducted an inquiry and recommended departmental action against the DSP and others involved in the case.The OHRC chairperson said that after going through the report submitted by the DIG of Vigilance, recording statements of all the accused in the case and watching the CCTV footage, it was clear that the case against the junior engineer was a fake one.As the illegal and stage managed trap has tarred the junior engineer’s dignity and reputation, the commission said the victim is entitled to get compensation. The human rights panel also recommended that the contractor be black-listed and marked ineligible from getting any government contract in future.The commission, however, said the junior engineer can donate the compensation amount to the District Red Cross Fund of Dhenkanal if he wishes.Though Odisha claims to be turning aggressive against corrupt officials, its record in conviction is such cases is quite poor. In 2018, the department could get conviction in about 51 per cent of vigilance cases while in 2017 it was 47 per cent. The department is yet to release its conviction rate in 2019. It had also a high pendency at the investigation stage. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in its report for 2017 said that over 92 per cent of vigilance cases were pending for investigation in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-human-rights-body-asks-vigilance-cop-to-pay-rs-5-lakh-for-framing-official-in-graft-case/story-sVNid387EGiDH7sMLp3jlO.html

Jain was hospitalised with fever on June 15 and diagnosed with Covid-19 on June 17. On oxygen support until last Thursday, Jain credited his recovery to plasma therapy and pranayam, a breathing exercise in yoga. Edited excerpts:How was your experience with the coronavirus disease?Whenever doctors asked me how I was feeling, I said I was absolutely fine. The doctors used to laugh that I never said I wasn’t fine. Two days after I was moved out of the ICU (intensive care unit), I came home. The doctors had said that I should stay at the hospital, but I said when I am not in the ICU, staying in the hospital or at home was the same. Even after coming back home, I needed oxygen daily. It has just been three days since I haven’t needed it.Oxygen is very important when it comes to this disease. And, I think pranayam helps. My oxygen saturation was dipping even after I came home; when I spoke to the doctors they asked me to try pranayam. I started doing it around 12 days back and there has been an impact. So, all the people – those who have the infection and even those who don’t – should do pranayam.Also read: Daily new Covid-19 cases drop in Delhi, CM Kejriwal says ‘don’t be complacent’What helped you get through it?First of all, people should not be scared, they should be strong mentally. When I got the infection, everyone in my family other than me was worried. I was never scared. People are not scared of the disease, they are scared of dying. I never even thought that there was a possibility that I could die. That might be the reason I recovered from the disease easily. The biggest immunity buster or booster is the mindset of the person.The cases are going down now. Is it time for de-escalating Covid-19 preparedness?We cannot decide what to do based on a seven or 10 days’ trend. Today, we are getting just over a 1,000 cases a day, but we do not know whether the numbers would remain there. We are comfortable at the moment; if we scale down and then the cases start rising again, what will we do? Scaling back up is easier said than done. So, we need to wait and watch.We are reviewing the situation daily. There was a time when some hospitals were at 100% occupancy; now it is just 50%. Beds are available at every big hospital in the city. This is a comfortable situation.Getting the 16,000 beds was not an easy task and we had planned ahead. Had there been a need for 80,000 beds, we would have arranged that too. The CM (Arvind Kejriwal) had said, keep three times as many beds ready as the number of cases in the city – for 1,000 patients in the hospitals we wanted 3,000 beds ready and for 5,000 patients 15,000.At present, our occupancy is less than a third of the hospital beds available, so we do not need to scale up the beds further. We will maintain this for some time.Also read | In its fight against coronavirus, Capital has turned a corner: CM KejriwalHas Delhi crossed its Covid-19 peak?The numbers are definitely going down, but I think it is too early to say whether the cases have peaked. Even if you see the trends in the US, a month ago it had started declining but now look at the situation there – the highest number of cases are being reported from there. It is very difficult to predict anything about this virus. If today, I say that it’s over, the cases might start going up from tomorrow. And, when we had predicted a sharp increase, it went down.So, we need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.There are two plasma banks in Delhi government hospitals and preparations to set up a third one have begun. Are enough people donating plasma?We have received some donations, but I would like to appeal to all those who have recovered from the infection to come forward and donate plasma. They can save someone’s life. I will donate my plasma once I get the doctors’ nod.A sero-surveillance study had been conducted in Delhi to gauge the population-level presence of Covid-19 antibodies. What have we learnt from the study?The sero-surveillance tells us how many people in the population have already had the infection. What we have learnt is a huge number of people have had it. But the results of the survey will be declared by the central government’s NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control).How will this help us in planning ahead?First, let us find out the number. Then, we will see what to do. However, I think treatment is the most important. At this time, we should leave the other things and focus on treating Covid-19 just like any other ailment.In your capacity as the public works department (PWD) minister, could you tell us what went wrong with monsoon preparedness that led to water-logging at Minto Bridge after the first heavy shower of the monsoon season?I think the water-logging at Minto Bridge was because the BJP {Bharatiya Janata Party} people deliberately closed the drain in front of the BJP headquarters. They had done it last year as well and we had to get it opened up. Why else would the water not drain out despite having four pumps working there?Apart from that, about 1,500 pumps – including mobile pumps – have been deployed across the city.Yesterday, Delhi received about 80-90mm rainfall within two hours – that is about 15% of the total annual rainfall of the city. This means Delhi got two months’ worth of rain in two hours. This is the reason there was water-logging in some places. But all the water across Delhi was drained out – even from Minto Bridge – within two hours. Five years ago, this would have taken two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-wait-and-watch-no-let-up-in-preparedness-against-covid-satyendar-jain/story-MLNQY2bEIg0BebetqZkuhJ.html
21-07-2020||India||Delhi records lowest Covid-19 cases reported since June 1, case fatality rate at 2.96 per cent||Delhi reported 954 cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday, with number of fresh cases dipping below the 1,000-mark for the first time since June 1 when 990 cases had been recorded. However, the number pertains to the weekend when fewer tests had been conducted – only 11,470 as opposed to an average of almost 20,000 over the last three weeks.The city also reported 35 more deaths due to the infection, taking the total toll so far to 3,663. Delhi’s case fatality rate now stands at 2.96%.With fewer tests, the positivity rate – the percentage of people who test positive among those tested – also increased to 8.32. In comparison, the average positivity rate recorded over the last week was 7.61.Also read | In its fight against coronavirus, Capital has turned a corner: CM KejriwalThe number of tests had shot up in Delhi since the third week of June when the rapid antigen tests, which give results within 15 minutes outside of laboratories, had been introduced. The positivity rate had almost touched 37% in the second week of June when very few symptomatic people were being tested.The number of active cases or those living with the infection at any given time has also reduced to just about 15,000. The highest number of active cases reported in the city was just over 28,000 reported in June-end. Along with the number of active cases, the number of hospitalisations have also reduced, with just 3,517 people admitted to hospitals as on Monday, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government.Delhi had massively scaled up Covid-19 infrastructure when the cases were shooting up in June. Currently, there are 15,462 hospital beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at AIIMS, said: “There is a downward trend, but not everyone in Delhi has had the infection. For now, what has helped Delhi is the high testing rate, which in turn means that more cases must have been detected and isolated preventing further spread. It is not the time to slow down. The high testing rate must be maintained. The number of beds that have been earmarked so far should also remain because once we de-escalate getting the numbers back might be a challenge. The government should wait at least a month to decide if we can lower our guard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-reports-954-cases-lowest-since-june-1/story-c7D98b2zUuRo4SX7Z6FmdM.html
21-07-2020||Editorials||The power gap with China | HT Editorial||In a conversation on Monday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar laid out the big picture about how the world has changed and how India sees the world, four decades after he first entered South Block as a junior diplomat. He made a series of significant points. The old bipolar politics of the Cold War between the United States (US) and Soviet Union, with elements of a multipolar system, has given way to a multipolar system with elements of bipolarity between the US and China. The world is more globalised, but it is also, now, witnessing an era of protectionism. Non-alignment was a strategy adopted at a particular time, and while India would not be a part of any alliance system, it could not stay out on critical global issues and once it was in the game, it had to play the game. These interventions give a glimpse into the Indian worldview. But Mr Jaishankar’s most important point was about the power differential between India and China. He suggested that while the two countries had similar economic trajectories and growth rates in 1988, when Rajiv Gandhi made his historic visit to Beijing, China has leapfrogged since then — by focusing on economic growth and embracing the world and opportunities therein. India, by contrast, grew too, but as Mr Jaishankar acknowledged, it wasn’t able to industrialise to the extent it should have; manufacturing remained a weak spot; embrace of the world was somewhat limited; and free trade agreements did not yield the dividends India had hoped for. This power differential — and India’s recognition of the power differential — is significant. It shows a realistic appraisal of the challenge at hand, and underlines what India has to do to compete more effectively. For India, the best foreign policy is a high growth rate. Unless India is able to get its economy right — and what is visible is a slump — its global ambitions will never be met. It will continue to pale in front of China. It will find managing the neighbourhood more difficult. It will become less attractive to its western partners and global businesses. It will not be able to modernise its military. It will not be able to provide global common goods which earns both soft and hard power. And it will be a story of opportunities lost. The minister’s assessment is a plea to get the economic story right, for foreign policy to be effective in a new world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-power-gap-with-china/story-qi7T116s732mrf71SOeLuJ.html
