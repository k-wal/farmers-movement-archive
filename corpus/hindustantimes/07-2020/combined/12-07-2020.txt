12-07-2020||News||The Chinese trishul in South Asia | Opinion||For a country with 14 neighbours, China remained a regional power without a regional policy for a long time. But a new China has, in recent years, adopted a sophisticated trishul (trident) approach at the local, national and regional level, especially in South Asia.At the local level, the Khunjerab Pass on the Karakoram highway in Pakistan; Tatopani and Kerung-Rasuwagadhi in Nepal; the Wakhan Corridor in northeast of Afghanistan; and Nathu la, Shipki la and Lipulekh in India are signs of integration, aimed at the borderland geography and communities. These instruments are likely to be mainstreamed and transformed into national and cross-regional grids. For instance, the Khunjerab Pass recorded a trade volume of nearly one billion dollars in 2019, and is already connected with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) through the Karakoram highway. The Shigatse-Lhasa-Shanghai railway line is proposed to be extended to Nathu la in Sikkim and Kerung-Rasuwagadhi in Nepal. Besides the use of the Chinese renminbi (RMB) in trade — such as the $6 billion border trade between Muse (Myanmar) and Ruili (Kunming-China) — foreign exchange reserves in RMB are being promoted.At the national level, China has already grabbed a significant portion of South Asia’s trade volume. China-South Asia trade recorded an over five-fold jump from a mere $1.18 billion in 1990 to $5.57 billion in 2000, and another 23-fold jump to $127.36 billion in 2018. Over 23% of the total global imports of Bangladesh, 15% of India, 24% of Pakistan and 19% of Sri Lanka are from China. All South Asian countries now have a significant trade deficit with China. Bhutan is the only country which has steadfastly remained outside the trishul framework, despite the Doklam intrusion and other fresh claims by China. From Hambantota and Colombo Port City in Sri Lanka to investing $3 billion each in the Payra Power project and the Dhaka-Chittagong railway in Bangladesh, from putting in $8.62 billion to complete eight energy projects under the CPEC in Pakistan to planning railway lines to Indian and the Nepalese highland borderlands, China has upset India’s predominant position both as a traditionally core neigbouring country and influential economic-democratic-military power. At the regional level, China has adopted four methods. First, it has entered the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) process, and promoted the Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM) cooperation initiative. Second, it exploits forums it leads, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (Brics) initiative, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Boao Forum, to attract South Asian countries into its fold. Third, it has effectively started using newly-created development funding agencies such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Silk Road Fund to finance projects in South Asia. Fourth, the gradual unfolding of region-wide projects such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and its alignment with regional and sub-regional groupings in South Asia in the next few years will further extend its reach.India has reacted to China’s trishul strategy in four ways. It announced a “neighbourhood-first” policy, and re-engaged neighbours with a more liberal attitude. It initiated interventions such as waterways, railways and a gas pipeline in Nepal, and established electricity grid connections with Bangladesh. It blocked Saarc, and reinvigorated counter-balancing regional institutions such as the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) initiative and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec). But India has not come up with a comprehensive counter-trishul approach yet.India’s neighbourhood is now entangled in an unparalleledbalancing dilemma. These countries are striving diplomatically to convey an impression of non-alignment. Aware that the cost of alignment, even at the perception level, could generate suspicion, they consciously appease India on its core concerns such as terrorism. But India is adept at immediately sensing significant deviations in their foreign policy. Nepal’s tilt towards China, even without major formal agreements and projects, was obvious. Later, when Nepal signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) related to access to ports, partnership in BRI initiatives, and other trade and investment ventures with China. India unsuccessfully tried to use the proverbial stick but had to quickly fall back on the theme of historic and cultural ties. These nations fear that the competitive and conflictual existence of two giant neighbours, however beneficial, can result in micro-management in their domestic affairs. This could even jeopardise their sovereignty.When Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa visited India to allay apprehensions about his earlier “aligned posture”, and when the Maldives President Ibrahim Solih reassured India of its traditional hold in the island, they were, in fact, trying to evolve a new balancing technique. In Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, overwhelmed by President Xi Jinping’s liberal investment announcement in 2016, said that Bangladesh would maintain “good relations with everyone. The purchasing power of our people will increase, and who will be the bigger beneficiary of that in our region? India. India is best poised to benefit from the Bangladeshi market”. China’s trishul approach, India’s attempts to counter it, and the new balancing code being adopted by smaller neighbours, is transforming South Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-chinese-trishul-in-south-asia/story-qUKiiJBi66Dx6QtD6aQtTJ.html
12-07-2020||News||India needs to rethink housing for the poor | Opinion||Last week, the Union Cabinet approved the Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) scheme, which aims to provide reasonably priced rental accommodation for migrant labourers. The Rs 600 crore-programme has a two-pronged roll-out plan: First, existing vacant government-funded housing complexes will be converted into ARHCs through concessional agreements for 25 years; and second, incentives will be offered to private and public entities to develop ARHCs on their vacant land for 25 years.The trigger for the scheme, which is a part of the Centre’s larger affordable housing programme for the urban poor, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana — Urban (PMAY-U), is Covid-19. The pandemic not only triggered an unprecedented exodus of migrant workers from their host states to home states, but also exposed an ugly reality: Migrant labourers — ironically, the bulk of them work in the construction sector — live in slums and informal/unauthorised colonies that are congested, lack basic sanitation and water services, ventilation and green spaces.This is due to the informal nature of their employment; inability to access legally-mandated minimum wages, welfare benefits, employer-provided facilities or services, or afford formal rental accommodation, which in any case is in short supply.  The government estimates that there are 26-37 million families in urban India that live in informal housing, and they largely belong to the poorer sections. Under PMAY-U, India aims to build 20 million housing units for the poor by 2022.The pandemic has highlighted the high social and economic costs of this gap in the safety net. People living in poor-quality, overcrowded, or unstable housing cannot follow directives on safe shelters or maintain social distancing. As a result, they are at a far greater risk of contracting the virus, along with other illnesses. There is also mounting evidence that Covid-19 could be airborne, and the lack of adequate ventilation increases the risk of transmission.The pandemic has also shown that homes are not just living spaces, but also productive spaces. So it becomes imperative that once construction activities restart, the sector must respond to the new realities and the demands of the Covid-19-hit world. This means that homes have to be thermally comfortable (at the lowest-income level, many cannot afford air-conditioning); have natural daylight; and proper ventilation. Architects say that three principles need to be followed: Ensure window shading and ventilation; insulate the walls and roofs; and share walls between two houses. The focus on natural thermal comfort will deter buying/minimise the use of ACs, which are energy guzzlers and use high global warming potential refrigerants; and using less/reusing building material will mean less use of natural resources. Plus, cooler and comfortable homes increase productivity.The good news is that India has a code — Eco-Niwas Samhita Part I — for residential buildings. The code, which was launched by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency in 2018, sets standards to limit heat gains (for cooling-dominated climates), limit heat loss (for heating-dominated climates), and ensure natural ventilation and daylight potential. Unfortunately, the codes are voluntary, and many states have not dovetailed them into their by-laws.States must implement these codes in letter and spirit. It is also critical that some changes — roof insulation, improved shading — are done in the existing buildings. At a holistic level, states must invest in rainwater harvesting, solar power, decentralised waste management, and provision for multi-functional spaces in ARHCs, and opt for green rating the buildings. While costs may increase, in the long-run, these steps will not only have a positive impact on the physical and mental health of residents, and attract migrant labour, but also ensure that these structures don’t contribute further to the already raging climate and environmental crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-needs-to-rethink-housing-for-the-poor/story-mQBSGgAbpxy1pHdkZUu1PN.html
12-07-2020||City||SGPC urges Takht to get missing saroops case probed by ex-judge||Under fire for the 267 missing ‘saroops’ (copies) of Guru Granth Sahib from its record, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Sunday urged the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs, to get the matter probed by a retired judge or any prominent Sikh personality.A fire incident took place in the SGPC publishing house at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib on May 19, 2016, in which 14 ‘saroops’ of Guru Granth Sahib were damaged, as per the gurdwara body claim. After five years of the incident, the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO) said that the damage was done on mass level and this fact was hid to save the then SAD-BJP government from public wrath when the issue of Bargari sacrilege was already burning and next assembly polls were close. On the basis of the statement of a retired employee of the SGPC, the PHRO maintained that 267 ‘saroops’ went missing after this incident as per the record and a probe must be conducted to ascertain their whereabouts. It is being dubbed another big sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib in the Sikh segments. At an emergency meeting held at Sri Guru Ramdas Medical College in Amritsar, an SGPC executive panel passed a resolution to discontinue the probe being conducted by a sub-committee constituted by it, as other Sikh bodies doubted the fairness of such a committee. The Takht has received several letters in this regard from various Sikh bodies, which cite that the probe should not be given to the SGPC as its functionaries, whose role is under the scanner in this case, are influential in the body.This will be the first time in recent history that the investigation of an SGPC matter will be handed over to independent persons.Divulging the proceedings of the meeting, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said, “An appeal has been made to Akal Takht Sahib so that the reality of the matter is brought in public domain. We want the probe to be conducted under the supervision of Akal Takht Sahib so that all kinds of doubts are removed.”“Keeping in view of seriousness of the matter, its probe must be conducted in impartial and credible manner. So, the executive committee has urged Akal Takht. Besides, the decision has been taken to transfer the officials concerned and employees of SGPC publication and binding department with immediate effect so that the probe is not influenced in any way,” he said.However, he did not disclose the initial findings of the SGPC sub-committee, which was constituted on June 30 on the directions of Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh after the Punjab Human Rights Commission (PHRO) exposed the entire matter.Notably, on the basis of its investigation and statements of retired SGPC employee Kanwaljit Singh, who was deputed in the publication department where the holy saroops went missing, the PHRO had also alleged that the SGPC deliberately hid the 2016 fire incident that massively damaged the saroops and stated that this event was linked with the lost saroops. However, the SGPC refuted these charges.ATTACH CASE WITH 2015 SACRILEGE PROBE: AUJLAAmritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla, however, has written to the Akal Takht jathedar urging him to ask the Punjab government to attach the missing saroops case with the ongoing probe into 2015 sacrilege incidents, or initiate a time-bound judicial investigation under the supervision of a sitting judge of Punjab and Haryana high court instead of a retired judge or some eminent personality.“Judicial probe or probe by SIT will have better chances of standing in court than probe by an in-house team; and this is evident from the probe in the matter of sacrilege incidents in Faridkot district. It would have been better if the SGPC president became a party in the 267 missing saroops case and wrote to the police for FIR registration,” his letter reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sgpc-urges-takht-to-get-missing-saroops-case-probed-by-ex-judge/story-jKsYckXRopuZo3hfWpdn2M.html
12-07-2020||Chandigarh||OBJECTIONABLE VIDEO: Punjab cops chase Shiv Sena leader down in Indore||Punjab Police on Sunday arrested self-proclaimed chief of Shiv Sena (Taksali) Sudhir Suri over an objectionable video clip allegedly denigrating women and inciting enmity between different groups, after a nearly 1,300km chase that ended in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.Suri managed to flee Amritsar despite heavy police security. A police official said Suri left Amritsar in the wee hours of Friday, two days after a case under non-bailable sections of inciting enmity was registered against him at the Jandiala police station of the Amritsar rural district.The state government had deployed 15 cops, eight gunmen and a police pilot Gypsy in Suri’s security. “Before fleeing, Suri had asked his security personnel to leave him as he was scheduled to go out of the state,” said a police official, who is the part of two teams that arrested him from Indore.On July 8, after the first video went viral and was heavily criticised both in India and abroad, Suri was booked under Sections 153-a, 354A and 509 of the IPC and 67 IT Act.Senior superintendent of police (SSP-rural) Vikram Jeet Duggal said: “Suri might have dodged his security men before escaping. However, it is a part of the investigation. We will also question his security personnel.”Meanwhile, director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said two Punjab Police teams, comprising 11 personnel of Amritsar (Rural) district, nabbed Suri on Sunday morning. He added that a manhunt had been launched for him after the release of a video with alleged derogatory remarks against women, followed by a Facebook video in which he had subsequently claimed that the objectionable video clip was a voiceover by some other person using his name.Despite Suri’s denial of any involvement in the said objectionable video clip that had appeared in the social media, the DGP said he had ordered a massive manhunt against the suspect through Amritsar (Rural) Police.Gupta said he had also directed the Punjab Bureau of Investigation to get the clip examined though the Forensic Science Laboratory at the earliest. Subsequent investigations revealed that fearing arrest, Suri could have fled to Indore, said the DGP, disclosing that the operation was successfully conducted in coordination with the Madhya Pradesh Police.The DGP said he personally spoke to Vivek Johri, his counterpart in Madhya Pradesh, at the time of the dispatch of the two police teams to Indore.Punjab Police is now moving for bail cancellation requests before the judicial courts concerned in cases where Suri has already been granted bail earlier. Suri has been booked in five cases of hate speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/objectionable-video-punjab-cops-chase-shiv-sena-leader-down-in-indore/story-Qq7KpAsVgLRQSTyK4TakHI.html
12-07-2020||Chandigarh||Alumnus Swraj Paul donates $5 million to MIT, says studying there ‘changed his life’||Jalandhar-born industrialist Swraj Paul has donated $5 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a private research university in Cambridge, where he studied mechanical engineering and later went on to found the Caparo Group that straddles various sectors, including value-added steel products.MIT’s Kresge Auditorium is to be named after the 89-year-old Paul, whose two sons, Akash and Angad, also went to the MIT. The donation has been made through the Paul family’s charitable trust, the Ambika Paul Foundation, a statement from Paul’s office said on Sunday.Designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, the Kresge Auditorium is architecturally significant as a leading example of a minimalist thin-shell concrete structure. Located in the central area of the MIT campus, Kresge opened its doors in 1955 and has played an important role in the life of the MIT community. It was renovated in 2016.In recognition of the gift, the large hall in the Kresge Auditorium will be named as the Lord Swraj Paul PC ’52 and Angad Paul ’92 Theatre; more generally known as the Swraj Paul Theatre at Kresge Auditorium.Paul, a member of the House of Lords, said, “I first came to MIT from India in 1949 at a time when there were very few Indian students in the United States, and the experience changed my life”.“Because of my time at MIT, I decided to expand my Caparo companies into the US, and for more than 30 years, we have made significant investments across the country in our Bull Moose Tube and XL Trailers businesses”.“I have always had a great respect for MIT as a world centre of technical excellence, and was delighted when my sons followed me there in the 1970s and 80s. MIT means a lot to our family, and I am honoured that we are able to support the continuation of its values and way of life through this iconic building.”The Kresge auditorium also serves as a venue for a variety of community activities including MIT events and symposiums and student performances, and Cambridge Symphony Orchestra and New England Philharmonic performances.The Ambika Paul Foundation was established in 1978 in memory of Paul’s daughter, Ambika, who died of leukaemia in 1968 aged 4. It was for her medical treatment that Paul first came to Britain in 1966, where he remained and went on to create Caparo, a diversified global association of businesses with interests predominantly in the design, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of value-added steel and niche engineering products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/alumnus-swraj-paul-donates-5-million-to-mit-says-studying-there-changed-his-life/story-8OMB0hMaBtxnWrgcSmD2eN.html

The sound dealers and disk jockeys (DJs) in Yamunanagar are no exception.With no grand weddings taking place this year, the DJ industry had pinned its hopes for revival during Kanwar Yatra that too was called off, like most other events.With lakhs of devotees, who would otherwise have been preparing to walk barefoot from Yamunanagar towards Haridwar, what will also take a hit is the local DJ business.Rajan Sahni, 52, has been in sound and DJ business from the last three decades who operates from his office-cum-godown near Bhuria Gate police post in Jagadhari, said, “With wedding bookings down to zero from 200 (per year), we hoped for some business from the annual Kanwar Yatra, which has been called off. The administration has also banned selling or renting of items associated with the yatra.”He said he has been paying the salary of his employees from his savings and hopes to get some orders for the Navratri festival in October.There are nearly 300 sound dealers in Jagadhari town and almost the same in Yamunanagar spread till the camp area on Radaur road. Another businessman in the town, Manga Nagpal has too faced the brunt of lockdown and like Sahni, he was also unable to pay salary to his employees and hence was forced to close his shop temporarily. “I’ve not opened my shop for weeks to at least save my electricity expenses. Like most of my fellows in the business, I too hoped for some revenue from Kanwar Yatra but now that too has been called off,” said Nagpal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-losses-djs-sound-dealers-in-yamunanagar-pin-hopes-on-navratri-festival-for-revival/story-B5IC2MjlbydkGolv4QoeTL.html

12-07-2020||Chandigarh||Locusts devour crops in six Haryana districts||Farmers in Haryana’s Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Sirsa, Mahendergarh, Jhajjar and Rewari districts reported extensive damage as their crops came under locust attacks on Saturday night. Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal quickly visited Bithan village of Bhiwani’s Loharu and directed officials to carry out an overnight anti-locust drive. He went on to visit the affected areas in Charkhi Dadri on Sunday and appealed to the farmers to avoid panicking. “These insects will continue to attack the crops throughout the year, but we are ready to tackle the menace. We managed to kill over 50% of locusts in an overnight drive. All deputy commissioners have been directed to inspect the affected areas and take necessary steps. The locust swarms had entered Rajasthan via Pakistan and later reached our state. We have sufficient stock of chemicals and spraying machines to deal with the situation,” the minister said. He told the farmers to inspect their fields and immediately report any sighting of locusts to the local agriculture development officer.“We have also advised people to make loud noises by beating drums and thalis to drive away the locusts. Patwaris and village secretaries have been directed to spread information about the locust attack,” he added.Action against companies for adulterating chemicalsDalal said he has ordered the registration of FIR against four companies for mixing water in chemicals used to kill locusts. These companies will be blacklisted, he added. Naveen Kumar, a resident of Bithan village, said despite making loud noises to drive away the locusts, their cotton, guar and bajra crops were damaged. “Agriculture officials had called fire tenders to kill the locusts, but they managed to kill only limited insects and two more swarms arrived in the morning,” he added. Yogesh Kumar, head of entomology department at Hisar’s Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, said the swarms were coming in big numbers because of their large-scale breeding in Africa last year. “Vast swarms of locusts swept through Haryana districts due to the wind’s direction. These insects are entering India from Pakistan through Rajasthan and Gujarat because the atmosphere in these two states is suitable for them,” he added.Girdawari ordered Agriculture and farmers’ welfare minister JP Dalal said as per the directions of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, reports of losses caused by the locust swarms have been sought and a special girdawari will be conducted wherever the damage is more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/locusts-devour-crops-in-six-haryana-districts/story-5BEtoTj2PcPCL6RDtVAzCM.html
12-07-2020||Gurugram||Two men arrested for illegal home delivery of liquor; mastermind identified||The police on Friday arrested two men for delivering liquor on the behalf of a person who was allegedly selling liquor online and promoting his business on various social media platforms, said the police on Sunday. The alleged mastermind behind this liquor delivery racket is yet to be arrested. The police said the mastermind behind this business of home delivery of liquor had placed advertisements on various social media platforms and was accepting online payments from customers at a higher price to deliver liquor at their doorstep. He had employed the two suspects to deliver liquor at the doorstep of his clients. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that buyers would contact him on the number mentioned on the social media site. He would buy liquor from wholesale godowns and deliver it directly to homes of the buyers in exchange for delivery charges. “We are suspecting that even during lockdown, the owner of the business has supplied liquor to more than 100 people across the city. This is against the existing excise policy,” he said.As per the excise policy, there is no provision to sell liquor online. Even placing advertisements on social media platforms is illegal, said the police.Sangwan said they received a tip-off that the two delivery boys will deliver liquor to a customer in the Sector 51 area. Following this, they formed a team of four members from the crime investigation agency(CIA) of Sector 17. The team reached the spot and nabbed the suspects. “The owner of the business used to send liquor to his clients through his delivery boys. On Friday, he bought liquor from Malibu Towne and sent the delivery to Mayfield Gardens, from where the two suspects were arrested,” said Sangwan.The suspects were identified as Bhanu Singh, a resident of Nathupur, and Mahinder Singh, a resident of Mangolpuri in Delhi. The police also recovered a scooter and two cases, containing 24 bottles of liquor, from their possession.During questioning, the suspects revealed that they were involved in the doorstep delivery of liquor for the last three months and were paid a salary by the owner of the business.The police said they have identified the mastermind but he has not yet been arrested. The suspects were produced before the court and were granted bail.A case under the Excise Act was registered at the Sadar police station against all the three suspects, said the police.The police also said they have begun a crackdown against the illegal sale of liquor across the city and strict action will be taken against those found to be violating the rules and regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-men-arrested-for-illegal-home-delivery-of-liquor-mastermind-identified/story-m2SfF6ne51lOGVZaDCindM.html
12-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram police trace 1,538 missing Covid-19 patients||The city police have traced more than 1,538 people who had gone missing after testing positive for Covid since March this year, when the lockdown started. Most of the missing patients had shared incorrect phone numbers and addresses, making it difficult for authorities to trace them.Tracking patients and their close contacts is critical in curbing the spread of Covid-19, police said.Police said most of these patients were either found not living at the addresses provided by them or had mentioned wrong addresses in the form that they had filled at the private labs or at Civil hospital. Apart from the cyber cell of the police, the crime branch has also been reaching out to trace Covid-19 patients and their contacts. Out of the 1,538 people tracked down by Gurugram police, the credentials of at least 1,144 have been verified. Six teams, of seven members each, have been formed in the district to trace patients who had gone missing. The teams comprise officials from the police force along with those drawn from the health and district administration departments.Police commissioner KK Rao said that all efforts are being made to ensure that every single patient who had gone “missing” is traced within the next two to three days. “Four out of every 100 positive case in the district was reported as untraceable, causing a threat to the society as they might be infecting more people. Such patients, fearing stigma, provide wrong credentials and switch off their mobile phones thinking that they cannot be traced by the authorities. It is extremely challenging to trace people who have mentioned wrong addresses as the exercise involves a team of police officials, including officers drawn from the cyber crime unit,” he said.As soon as details of untraceable patients is sent to the police, they start checking the addresses of the patient and a team is sent to the area to verify the name mentioned in the form. Simultaneously, the mobile number is given to the cyber crime team who get out the call detail records (CDR) of the patients and get the correct address of the patients through their friends and relatives.Once traced, according to SOPs in place, the patient is retested for Covid and then put in an isolation centre.“The only threat is that people who test positive roam around freely and infect others, leading to an increase in number of cases and fatalities due to Covid-19. We have registered cases against such people and have warned them of strict action. But still people are not sensitive towards the issue and are risking their lives as well as that of others,” said Rao.Earlier, private and government labs only took samples of patients and maintained data without verifying their mobile numbers and credentials. People took advantage of this fact and started mentioning wrong detail, which led to a high number of untraceable cases, police said.“To control the situation, the district officials starting generating OTPs on registered mobile numbers before sample collection,” said Rao, adding that strict instructions have been given to all the private labs and hospitals to ensure no test is conducted if people have not given their address correctly. “This will ensure the data stored is correct and no fake or wrong information creeps in,” he said.Rao said on Friday itself, the joint teams at least put 61 patients under isolation at different facilities and their contract tracing was being conducted by the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-trace-1-538-missing-covid-19-patients/story-wrYAagt9DFKSd2kBXaCM7O.html
12-07-2020||Gurugram||City sees 112 new cases, total tally inches towards 7,000||Gurugram reported at least 112 new cases on Sunday, bringing the district’s total tally of reported Covid-19 cases to 6,860. The district has so far reported 105 deaths (indicating a case fatality rate of 1.5 percent), with one new death being reported on Sunday.Of the deaths recorded, 68 patients had pre-existing co-morbid conditions.The number of active cases in the district now stands at 1,027, down from Saturday’s tally of 1,036. With 120 new recoveries on Saturday, the district’s recovery rate stands at just above 83 percent, up from 77 percent exactly a week ago. Of the current active cases, 870 are currently in home isolation, 21 are hospitalised, and 136 are under observation at Covid-19 care centres across the district.“So far a total of 5,728 patients have been discharged from hospitals, home isolation and Covid-19 care centres after testing negative. We are still getting between 100 to 150 new positive cases a day, but we are not worried as we have a high recovery rate and also a low test-positivity rate (at around 11 percent),” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.On Sunday, the district collected 2,026 samples (through antigen tests, RT PCR tests, and RT PCR tests in private labs). This marks the seventh consecutive day on which the number of samples collected for testing have exceeded the 2,000 mark. “Our aim is to maintain a steady testing rate of 2,000 tests per day, bulk of them being antigen. A second RT PCR machine is now operational in the city, and we will be able to add about 200 more RT PCR samples to this testing pool each day,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer, Gurugram.Meanwhile, Haryana reported 658 cases on Sunday, taking the total tally to 21,240 cases. Of these 15,983 patients have recovered and 4956 patients are still under treatment. On Sunday, the state also reported four new deaths, taking Haryana’s total mortality to 301.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-sees-112-new-cases-total-tally-inches-towards-7-000/story-c1UDriTqeOvKpCxZ7VJcVK.html
12-07-2020||City||Environmental compensation: Recovery from polluting units remains a challenge for Haryana pollution control board||Despite National Green Tribunal’s (NGT’s) clear guidelines, polluting units in Haryana aren’t complying with the environmental standards and making recovery of compensation an uphill task for the state pollution control board. A consolidated report of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) submitted to the NGT mentions the non-compliance of erring units. In its November 2019 orders, the NGT had made it clear that meaningful action has to be taken by the state pollution control boards against the polluting units and the environmental compensation should be recovered as the cost of restoration of the damage to the environment, otherwise there will be no meaningful environmental governance. As per a report of Haryana pollution control board, there are 129 industries in three clusters — 72 in Faridabad, 30 in Gurugram and 27 in Panipat — which have not been complying with the environmental standards for the last five years. The board claimed that 76 units, including 45 in Faridabad, 21 in Gurugram and 10 in Panipat, were facing closure over their non-compliance. As per the report, of Rs 1.53 crore imposed on the erring units in Faridabad, the state pollution control board could recover only Rs 19.53 lakh. In Panipat, Rs 70-lakh fine has been slapped on eight polluting units, of which only Rs 25.47 lakh could be recovered from three units. However, the environmental compensation to be paid by the polluting units in Gurugram was not mentioned in the report.S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said, “The recovery of environmental compensation must be in process and I will get it examined again.”“But the erring units will not be allowed to reopen until they clear the dues. A committee in the state headquarters will probe every case individually and impose the penalty as per the CPCB guidelines,” he added.On why the environmental compensation imposed on the erring units in Gurugram was not mentioned, Narayanan said, “It may not be immediately issued, but is usually done in all cases without any exception.”It is pertinent to mention here that in the reports of polluted industrial areas or clusters monitored in 2018 by the CPCB, Gurugram was at the ninth spot, Panipat at 11th and Faridabad at 63rd. As per the scores, Gurugram and Panipat are in the category of critically polluted areas, whereas Faridabad is a severely polluted area.In the November 2019 orders regarding the status of compliance of orders and recovery of environment compensation from the polluting units in red and orange zones, the NGT had sought the consolidated status report from the pollution control board of the state. As per the information, the NGT is likely to hear the matter next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/environmental-compensation-recovery-from-polluting-units-remains-a-challenge-for-haryana-pollution-control-board/story-LGqBgpSfWQ8PvuXF4QiwQK.html

At this place, better management of waste will be done through modern machinery and special care will be taken for cleanliness. Citizens in Nuh will not have to face any kind of trouble. Garbage will be dumped at Nuh only for some time, and as soon as the legacy waste at Bandhwadi is cleared and the waste disposal plant is operational, MCG will return to dumping Gurugram’s waste at Bandhwari,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, in the civic body’s release.The civic agency has finalised a 10 acre piece of land falling under Korali and Mahwan villages, respectively, in Nuh district, located around 40 kilometres from the city, for dumping the waste.Last week, MCG had scrapped its plan for dumping and processing Gurugram’s waste at a 25-acre plot at Chand Nagar Ki Dhani Road in Farrukhnagar following a nearly month-long protest by various villages and political leaders.Subsequently, the MCG had decided to shift the processing and dumping at Nuh, which is also encountering resistance by locals.On Thursday, a maha panchayat of over 20 villages was held at Karoli village where a decision was taken by villagers that Gurugram’s waste will not be dumped in the two villages and further they formed an eleven-member committee that will be dealing with the local administration regarding the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-mcg-says-will-be-dumping-waste-at-nuh-temporarily/story-oHqH9sjWD9Ry9PfnNvisBN.html

So, he carries an extra spray of temefos, and either sprays medicine upon spotting any still water or larvae breeding or upon receiving the complaint,” she added.The malaria mosquito Anopheles breeds from July through October, and the one that causes dengue comes after August. According to the officials, Gautam Budh Nagar saw over 400 cases of malaria in 2019.“There were around 400 cases of malaria in the district last year and a year before that, but thankfully, there were no deaths due to the disease,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. He points out that since the malaria mosquito breeds in still water, they also keep a check on the water stored in parks for animals or birds.“It is easier to control the larvae, but difficult to control the adult mosquitoes. So we try to cover as much area as possible with help of other departments as well,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-anti-larvae-drive-intensifies-to-prevent-malaria-during-monsoon/story-qEwvBF0Pi1c5Av2qjPQyKK.html

The new area will be used to house aircraft maintenance facilities and other manufacturing units as the demand for land for these businesses will increase once the proposed international airport at Jewar along the expressway becomes operational by 2022-23, said officials.The Uttar Pradesh government on April 24, 2001, had established Yeida to set up industries to generate employment and develop urban areas along the expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra. Around 200,000 hectares from 1,187 villages of six districts -- Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura and Agra -- were notified under Yeida. So far, it has acquired around 16,000 hectares of land for its various schemes. “We are conducting a survey to identify how much land we should acquire from Bulandshahr district in order to meet the increased demand due to airport connectivity in this region. We may identify the required area of land in one or two months and then acquisition will be started,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida. Singh is also the CEO of Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), a nodal agency for the development of Jewar airport project.According to the officials, Yeida has decided to acquire agricultural land in Chola area, which is part of Bulandshahr district and located only 12 kilometers from the city.“We need land for manufacturing units in Bulandshahr’s Chola, where railway connectivity already exists. Many manufacturing units, including companies involved in producing electronics items, want to buy land from us and start business. They want to buy land in this region because it is going to have smooth air connectivity in a couple of years,” said Singh.Once the land area is identified, Yeida will start formalities required to procure it. “We may directly buy the required land from willing farmers. And once the land is procured, we will start developing drains, roads, parks and other services before allotting the same to interested investors,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yeida-plans-to-extend-industrial-area-along-yamuna-e-way-till-bulandshahr/story-wnUtj3gfLC9epKFJSHshrI.html

12-07-2020||Chandigarh||Beggars living on roadside potential Covid risk for all of Chandigarh||With loss of livelihoods and no money to pay rents, seasonal labourers are now turning to begging and living on the roads. And without any money to buy masks or sanitizer, their lives and those of the people they beg from are at risk as Covid cases rise in the city.Near sectors 33 and 34, around 10-15 beggars have been living on the road, using one of the road signs here to hang their laundry. One of them, Prahlad, says he used to work as a labourer before the lockdown, and had no other option but to sit there and beg. “People don’t give us much money these days, but we have no option but to beg. We go to the Sector 20 gurdwara for food and sleep here,” he said.One of the beggars who refused to tell her name said she was from Uttar Pradesh and had nowhere else to go. “We are always on the lookout for policemen. A couple of days back they took away our rations. Even today, they were asking us to vacate. We move when they ask us to, but come back after some time,” she said.Local area councillor Ravinder Kaur Gujral said, “Beggars usually settle here every year. A week back I had asked the police to remove them. I will look into the matter again.”Meanwhile police officials of the Sector 34 police station said they had driven the beggars away earlier, but they will check the spot again to ensure they don’t sit there while breaking the social distancing rules.Similarly, on the Sector 41/42 dividing road, beggars have even put up tents and continue to live here without wearing masks or maintaining hygiene. Speaking about this, local area councillor Hardeep Singh Buterla said, “This is an ongoing problem, and government departments including the police, the UT forest department and the MC are passing the buck. Besides begging, residents of Sector 41C are worried about open defecation that can lead to spread of diseases as well.” Police officials here added that they had asked the people living in tents not to come out begging and to stay within their tents till the pandemic passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/beggars-living-on-roadside-potential-covid-risk-for-all-of-chandigarh/story-cxAyX0kSfAzEtGazjnzthO.html

The principals have been given a proforma and they need to give an undertaking that they will not demand more resources if they want to run these courses for the next academic session. Out of around 450 sanctioned teaching posts, around 100 are vacant at government colleges in Chandigarh.

Trucks were plying from Market Yard signal up to the start of Swargate flyover from morning 6 am. Last night too, a person supplying animal fodder to me, hinted that he was not sure of stock from Tuesday onwards. I was charged high for vegetables which were affordable till yesterday,” he saidSanjay Telang, a fabricator, from Hadapsar, said, “ The vendors were charging double the price for fruits and vegetables. Some action should be taken against them.”Popatlal Osawal from Pune Merchants Chamber, said, “There are enough stocks. The market was open today (on Sunday) and will function tomorrow as well.

A letter in this regard was issued by the school education secretary, Krishan Kumar, to the districts and funds were transferred to districts, which will be e-transferred to the schools to purchase the machines. There are 342 government senior and high schools in the district out of which 100 senior secondary schools of Ludhiana already have the incinerator machines, either donated by NGOs or businessmen in the last two years.SCHOOLS WITH MOST GIRL POPULATION SELECTEDAccording to the DGSE office, the authorities selected those schools which are either girl’s schools or the ones who have more strength of girl students. The school principals have been instructed to spend the funds by maintaining a record and take two years annual maintenance contract to get the machines serviced.The incinerator burns sanitary napkins into ashes and this way basic sanitation facilities can be provided to female students. Manju Bhardwaj, a smart school coordinator, said, “I will send the names of schools without incinerators to the head office for approval. The funds will be sent to these schools once we receive consent from the higher authorities.” The school principals have stated that this way the toilets can be kept clean because sanitary napkins are normally thrown in washrooms by students which is unhygienic. Female teachers and girls will be trained to use the machine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/140-govt-schools-in-punjab-to-get-funds-to-install-incinerators-to-dispose-sanitary-napkins/story-SPdebmr8fheZsOMTO26BLP.html

12-07-2020||Chandigarh||3-member SIT to probe alleged Covid-19 testing scam by private lab: Capt||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday announced a three-member special investigation team (SIT) to probe the alleged Covid-19 testing scam by Tuli Diagnostic Centre, a private lab in Amritsar, while warning that his government would not allow private hospitals or laboratories to earn profit from this unprecedented crisis.The vigilance bureau had on June 24 booked five doctors, including those from the private lab, and owner of a private hospital on the charges of murder bid, criminal conspiracy and corruption for giving fabricated and false Covid-19 test reports allegedly to fleece suspected patients.During his #AskCaptain Facebook Live session, the CM said he had received a complaint against the said private lab and had asked the vigilance bureau to look into the matter, but when initial investigation showed that there was no involvement of any state government department or officer, the case was transferred to the Punjab Police.The SIT tasked with the probe is headed by Amritsar police commissioner, himself a doctor, with civil surgeon as a member, said the CM, adding that he has ordered the SIT to conduct a thorough investigation and submit its findings soon, so that suitable action can be taken.A spokesperson of the CMO later said Amarinder had taken strong exception to SAD leader Bikram Majithia’s attempts to politicise the “simple jurisdictional decision” of transferring the probe to the district police. Apart from the fact that the vigilance bureau had, prima facie, not found any complicity of government department/official in the case, Tuli lab had moved the court challenging the bureau’s jurisdiction, he said.“Rather than raising such nonsensical issues and weakening the morale of the Punjab Police, Majitha should invest his time and energy in pressurising the Akalis’ political masters in Delhi to put a stop on CBI interference in the Punjab Police investigation in the Bargari and other sacrilege cases, and the subsequent policing firing incidents,” said Amarinder.When asked during the FB Live if the recent appointment of Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa as party president by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) rebels was a Congress gameplan, the CM said that what happens in the Akali party “is not our job.”“They keep fighting…history shows that they keep getting divided. There is nothing new in it. At one point of time there were seven Akali Dals. The Akali party is like a rubber band, it keeps expanding and co-added,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/3-member-sit-to-probe-alleged-covid-19-testing-scam-capt/story-jEBkoqDUeT8AgcKzkYbEoO.html
12-07-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Heads of MSME bodies write to Modi, Gadkari for aid||A day after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das termed the Covid-19 pandemic the worst health and economic crisis in the last 100 years during peacetime with unprecedented negative consequences for output and jobs, heads of various industry associations in Ludhiana on Saturday demanded government support to tide over the current economic crises.Upkar Singh Ahuja, president, Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) and Ajit Lakra, head of textile division, FICO, sent open letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister of micro, small and medium enterprises, Nitin Gadkari, stating that making India ‘atma nirbhar’ is not possible unless the government supports MSMEs and manufacturing sector.“The electricity rate of industrial units should be reduced by Rs 3per kw and liquidity should be available easily for MSMEs at low interest rate. Improvement of transport infrastructure is imperative and GST should be slashed. Besides this, export incentive like no income tax on export should be offered to encourage industrial growth,” Ahuja said.He said the country’s MSME base is the largest in the world after China and if the government abolishes anti-dumping duties for raw material such as steel and plastic, the Indian MSME industry has the potential to touch 200% growth in three years.“The anti- dumping duties makes raw material expensive. This in turn makes finished products costlier, which is why Chinese products are preferred over ours,” he added.Lakra said that amid growing anti-China sentiments, India has a lucrative opportunity to become one of the most industrialised countries of the world.“It is most important to immediately ban import of unnecessary commodities from China or any other country to promote our own industry and create more employment,” he added.He said labour, land acquisition and tax laws must be suitably amended to make them satisfactory for foreign investors to establish their business ventures in India with ease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-heads-of-msme-bodies-write-to-modi-gadkari-for-aid/story-DCU8f3GBIORQcfRNc3peNO.html

Seven more deaths reported Sunday from different hospitals, meanwhile, took the Covid-19 toll in the state to 144, although the official figure, as mentioned in the bulletin released by the state health department on its Twitter handle on Sunday, stood at 125.The discrepancy flows from the time lag between the health department’s bulletin and daily figures released by hospitals, which come hours later.State’s health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh, however, underlined the brighter side, of the rise in the recovery rate. “In the last 24 hours, 962 patients have recovered, pushing the recovery rate to 72.31%,” he said, adding that 11,953 patients had recovered so far.As per the health department, two deaths were reported from Darbhanga, one each from Begusarai, Muzaffarpur, Nalanda, Patna and Siwan. Three of these deaths were reported from Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) in Patna. “Two patients from Patna, with comorbidity of heart disease, diabetes and hypertension respectively, died on Sunday, while the other of Bhabua having asthma passed away at the hospital today,” said Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the hospital.The health secretary, meanwhile, said Patna has so far reported 1,868 cases, the highest in Bihar, followed by 996 in Bhagalpur and 734 in Begusarai.Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi said the state capital had 90 containment zones, which included 20 in Patna City, 34 in Patna Sadar, 21 in Danapur, eight in Paliganj 8 and 7 in Masaurhi.Meanwhile, a top functionary of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), who tested positive, was admitted to the intensive care unit at the AIIMS-Patna, after being referred there on Saturday evening. Unlike AIIMS and the NMCH, the IGIMS is not a dedicated Covid hospital.The senior faculty member had come in contact with his driver who was found to be positive early this month.One of the IGIMS superintendents, who was in home quarantine, has tested negative the second time.The reports of 17 nurses, who had come in contact with an infected patient at Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC), were still awaited. “We were expecting reports on Sunday, but the virology lab of PMCH has not delivered them,” said OP Sah, joint director-cum-nodal officer, Covid-19, IGIC.Hot spotsPatna: 1,868 casesBhagalpur: 996 casesBegusarai: 734 casesCases break-upThe twitter handle of health department while giving of break-up of 1,266 cases said besides 177 patients reported in Patna, Siwan had 98 cases, Bhagalpur 81, Nalanda 78, 76 each in Begusarai and Nawada, Muzaffarpur 72, Munger 61, West Champaran 54, Saran 47, Katihar 46, Bhojpur 40, Vaishali 36, Gaya 34, 29 each in Lakhisarai and Rohtas, Buxar 27, Samastipur 24, Gopalganj 22, Aurangabad 21, 14 each in Araria and Jehanabad, 13 each in East Champaran and Sitamarhi, 11 each in Arwal, Khagaria and Sheikhpura, Supaul 10, Jamui 9, Purnia 7, 6 each in Madhepura and Madhubani, Sahara 5, Banka 4, Sheohar 3 and Dhanbad 1 (sample collected at Gaya).The highest case of 749 last time was detected on July 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-curve-careens-in-bihar-highest-spike-in-a-day-caps-the-week/story-mWYKDrEYpLLYr0abWK9V7I.html

Health officials from the Civil Hospital at Dera Bassi, Mohali, allegedly mistook the woman, Kamalpreet Kaur, for another patient with a similar name from her village who had tested positive, and mixed up their reports.A resident of Ballomajra village in Dera Bassi, Kaur said she had been told she was Covid-19 positive after she delivered the baby at the Civil Hospital and home quarantined. She was not allowed to feed or see the infant during this period, she complained.Four days later, health officials told her that she had been declared positive by mistake, their reasoning being that another woman with a similar name had been infected, leading to the confusion.Dr Sangeeta Jain, senior medical officer (SMO) of the Civil Hospital, said, “We had received information from the health department directing us to isolate the Covid-19 positive patient after which according to the guidelines we isolated her at home. Later we learnt that the woman is actually negative as the reports were mistakenly exchanged with that of a woman with a similar name who had given birth on the same day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/newborn-baby-separated-from-mother-identified-covid-19-positive-by-mistake/story-NrC8MvMxzCvhhLMTo8jpfJ.html

Before the lockdown, the airport saw nearly 12,000 passengers, both at arrivals and departures. The number has since come down to 1,000 a day.This is mostly because — of the 44 domestic and two international flights (Sharjah and Dubai) arriving and departing from the airport before March 23, now there are only six to eight a day.“The airport authorities have not taken any decision on rent waiver. Most brands have ceased their operations due to losses. Though they are not pushing us to pay, we request them to take a decision on the waiver soon,” said the owner of one of the stores, wishing not to be named.Airport’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ajay Bhardwaj said including losses in terms of rent from shops, they were overall losing around Rs 9 crore per month. “It will take some months for the airport to tide over this crisis. Authorities concerned will take a decision on rent waiver soon,” he added. The airport’s main source of revenue is from the aeronautical category, whereby the airport charges Rs 800 per passenger from airlines. For instance, an airline flying to Delhi with 80% occupancy pays around Rs 65,000 to the airport per flight. Besides, the airport charges rent from retail shops, office spaces, vehicle parking and advertisements. Total revenue under both categories comes to around Rs 30 lakh per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-shadow-60-high-end-brands-cease-operations-at-chandigarh-airport/story-vK1Qlg3sBxB844NpOrkdSL.html

On Saturday night, he claimed he killed Shamsher as he was involved in illegal activities, but could not provide details about this. Then he claimed his boss ill-treated him by hurling abuses,” said assistant commissioner of police (ACP, Civil Lines) Jatinder Chopra.Eventually, the accused revealed that his father, who is an electrician in Sunet village, owed money lenders Rs 1 lakh. He had asked Shamsher to loan him Rs 1 lakh, which he assured to return in a year. But, Shamsher turned him down.Recently, he found out that Shamsher would receive Rs 1.25 lakh from his client on Saturday. So, he planned to murder his employer to grab the money.The ACP said on Saturday evening, even before the client brought the money, Manish stabbed Shamsher with a knife at their office. Shamsher put up a fight, causing injuries on Manish’s hand.“But, Manish managed to overpower Shamsher and stabbed him multiple times. After confirming he had died, the accused locked the office, took his boss’ car and got admitted to a hospital,” the police official added.Shamsher’s body was discovered by his wife, Pupinderjit Kaur, who, along with her family members, had reached the office on Saturday night after her husband did not respond to her phone calls. On reaching there, they were shocked to see Shamsher lying dead in a pool of blood, and informed the police.The ACP said Manish had been booked under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. They were questioning him to find out if he had any accomplices.The deceased leaves behind his wife, a son and a daughter, who are settled in Canada||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/office-boy-held-for-murdering-60-year-old-ludhiana-realtor/story-rMLarNSQeLMbHwPSlEp4FM.html

12-07-2020||City||Climate change: Snow cover declines in major river basins of Himachal Pradesh||Rapidly changing climate is degrading the snow cover of Himalayan rivers originating in Himachal Pradesh, according to a recent study by the State Centre on Climate Change under the aegis of the Himachal Council for Science Technology and Environment (HIMCOSTE).The state witnessed a marginal decrease of about 0.72% in its snow cover from October 2019 to May this year in comparison to 2018-19 i.e total average area under snow has reduced from 20210.23Km2 to 20064.00Km2. Further, during peak winter months, the snow cover area has reduced gradually from February onwards which may affect the runoff patterns during the summer months. Based on the data analysed, more snow cover has been observed in the Satluj basin during winter months (November to January) than the Beas and Ravi basins, whereas the Chenab basin has not shown much change in the area under snow during this period. Based on summer month analysis, in Chenab basin (65% of the total basin area) and Satluj basin (50% of the total basin area) will contribute as snowmelt in the river system after May onwards in comparison to Beas basin (45%) and the Ravi basin (26%) of the total basin area this year.State Centre on Climate Change has successfully utilised the applications of space technology in carrying out studies related to Cyrosphere comprising the snow and glaciers in Himachal in collaboration with Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad. The Cryospheric studies are important as the one-third part of the state is characterised by this great Himlayan reserve and the studies of which using any other conventional method is not possible due to the inaccessibility of this area.Himachal Pradesh receives winter precipitation in the form of snow at the higher altitudes. About one-third of the total geographical area of the state remains under thick snow cover during the winter season. Most of the major rivers like Chenab, Beas, Parvati, Baspa, Spiti, Ravi, Satluj, and its perennial tributaries originating from the Himalayas depend upon the seasonal snow cover for their discharge dependability. Besides this, the snow cover also helps in controlling the accumulation and ablation patterns of the glaciated regions in the state.Considering the importance of seasonal snow cover as a major input in controlling the hydrology of the river basins, director (environment science and technology)-cum-member secretary (HIMCOSTE) DC Rana said that although we have the information about the total snowfall that takes place during the winter season from the various observatories operating throughout the state as point information and therefore its spatial extent cannot be ascertained. Thus by using satellite data of different resolutions, it has now become possible to map the geographical extent of the area covered under snow during the winter season. He added that studies which are being carried out by the Centre for mapping of seasonal snow cover in terms of its spatial distribution covers the different river basins in Himachal Pradesh during the winter season from October to May and is an important input in order to understand the contribution of snow in different catchments to sustain the hydrology of the river basins.Considering the present trend of winter snowfall in Himachal Pradesh, the winter precipitation was mapped in all the basins viz Chandra, Bhaga, Miyar, Beas, Parvati, Jiwa, Pin, Spiti and Baspa using AWIFS satellite data having a spatial resolution of 56 mts from October to May. During 2019-20 snowfall was estimated and analysed with reference to the average value of the total area under snow in each month from October to May in 2018-19, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/climate-change-snow-cover-declines-in-major-river-basins-of-himachal-pradesh/story-Yy1ah7mt6ZY11ugUfGq4hI.html

Keeping in mind the usual business, I had purchased about 150 litres of drought beer and 150 cases of bottled beer. Now, my entire stock has expired and I have no support from any quarter to compensate for the loss,” he said.Satish Arora, the state president of Punjab Hotel, Restaurant and Resorts Association, says there are 1,500 bars and over 500 pubs in various districts.“Unlike liquor, beer comes has a best before date. Since the lockdown, the hospitality sector is on the verge of collapse as bars have not been permitted to open and there are no customers in restaurants. The state government should announce a relief package to the industry that contributes to about Rs 160 crore per month to the state’s tax kitty,” he said. Gurdeep Singh Walia from Patiala said since the beer season begins from March onwards and bar owners ensure sufficient stock to cater to their customers. “Bar owners pay a hefty fee for annual licence renewal and duty on beer sourced from identified dealers. As there is no business now, excise licence fee should be deferred for at least six months and the validity of the bar licence period should also be extended,” he said.Rakesh Kaul, a leading hotelier in Pathankot, said lowering of electricity tariff from the existing about Rs 12 per unit would be a major relief.“I had a considerable stock of drought beer for the wedding and tourist season starting March onwards and investment in it is uncertain. The entire stock is not worth consuming now. We do not demand complete waiver on taxes but the sector should be compensated,” added Kaul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/owners-counting-losses-as-50-cr-beer-stock-expires-in-punjab-s-closed-bars/story-mhbVyFiwSjAPUfKlnD2JuN.html

He said they want an amendment in the five-day advance hotel booking condition for tourists. “Tourists are not willing to visit the state due to the irrational condition,” Bamba said, adding that the government should reduce the limit to two-days.He said even during the peak season, the average stay of a guest in tourist destination is not more than two days. “The association has got feedback from travel agents who say that the tourists are reluctant to come due to the conditions,” he added.He said when the government has made a Covid-19 negative certificate mandatory for tourists, the condition of five-day booking is utterly unreasonable.Similarly, the condition related to vehicle sanitisation is also impractical given the fact that the government has not mentioned about which agencies will issue the certificate.Bamba said the SOPs also require hotel owners to allow entry of tourists even if they are having Covid-19 like symptoms. “This will cause unnecessary trouble for hotel owners and if a tourist tests positive for the virus, the premises will be sealed and staff quarantined.He, however, said the hotels which are ready to comply with the current SOPs are free to operate. Tourism activities in Himachal are closed since March due to Covid-19 outbreak. Under the guidelines for Unlock Phase-II, the government has allowed tourism activities to resume with certain restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dharamshala-hoteliers-demand-change-in-sops-to-keep-hotels-shut-till-july-30/story-BXHSUZruJ45NYernCR4plL.html

If some students are unable to do so due to some genuine reason, they will be allowed submit the forms in August. “Schools principals have been directed to inform the parents about admission process on phone,” said Sharma.He said the state government will also prepare a school and district-level education programme which will be submitted to the Union human resource development ministry. Under this programme, the education department will collect data of students studying through various means.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/online-classes-in-himachal-schools-to-resume-today/story-hnh5XEpDH0nQ90T7OlAtrK.html

12-07-2020||City||Delhi govt cancel exams at all state universities||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Saturday cancelled all end-semester examinations in eight state universities across the capital in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, a move that will impact more than 130,000 students. This came on a day when Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to intervene and scrap exams for students from central universities. In Delhi’s state universities, students across all years will now be evaluated on the basis of internal assessments and previous examinations. Deputy chief minister and Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia at a digital press conference said it would be unfair to hold exams for students as the pandemic had disrupted all teaching-learning activities since March. Sisodia added that the Delhi government’s decision did not extend to Delhi University (DU), Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and other central universities in the national capital.While DU has postponed its first-ever online open book exams to August amid student outrage, JNU had asked its schools and centres to opt for online and offline modes of exam following consultation with students and teachers.The Delhi government runs eight state universities — Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIPU), Delhi Technological University (DTU), Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University (DPSRU), Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW), Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT-D), Ambedkar University (AUD), Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (NSIT), and National Law University Delhi (NLU).“Though online classes are being conducted, the absence of in-person lessons, including lab classes, practicals, and field research has hampered the students’ learning. It will be unfair and difficult to hold examinations for the semester for which teaching-learning was hampered,” Sisodia said on Saturday.These universities have been directed to evaluate students on the basis of exams already conducted in previous semesters, internal assessments, or other progressive ways, Sisodia said.“The ones who were to appear for semester examinations should be promoted to the next semester on the basis of internal assessment and their performance in the mid-term exams. The final semester/year students should also be evaluated on the previous semesters, performance in internal assessments. Awarding degrees to students is very important because they have studied for three or four years and now want to start working and support their families as well as the economy,” he said.The decision comes after the University Grants Commission (UGC) on Monday asked all universities to conduct end-semester examinations for final-year students by September whether through offline or online modes, or a blend of both. After Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha, and Maharashtra, Delhi becomes the fifth state to say it won’t be able to adopt UGC guidelines.However, UGC secretary Rajnish Jain on Saturday told HT said that UGC guidelines are to be adopted by all states for universities and colleges across the nation.In his letter to the Prime Minister, Kejriwal said the UGC’s order had caused anger among students, teachers, and parents. “When renowned institutes like IIT and NLU have awarded degrees on the basis of internal assessments, why can’t other universities do the same,” he asked. The chief minister said that while all state university exams had been cancelled in Delhi, decision for central universities like DU, can only be taken by the Centre.”HT reached out to several senior officials in the Prime Minister’s Office for comment on Saturday, but did not receive a response. However, some students said the Delhi government’s decision holds little significance for students from institutes like Ambedkar University (AUD), where the focus is on continuous assessments through the entire semester instead of weightage on end-semester examinations.Shubhojeet Dey, a member of AUD students’ council, said the university had in April announced that the semesterwould continue online. “Generally, professors have flexibility over end-semester examinations at our university. For instance, there can be two assignments throughout the semester with a combined weightage of 60% and the rest would be for end-semester exams. Faculty members of various courses can make this decision over how much weightage can be given to final exams and assessments each throughout the year. For many subjects, no single end-semester examinations are conducted and evaluation is entirely based on the assessments,” he said.Dey, a postgraduate student who said he already received his grades, said the varsity came out with a flexible assessment process in April by allowing an option to students who couldn’t appear for online assessments.“Students who couldn’t submit presentations were asked to submit 1,000-word essays instead. Those who couldn’t submit any online assessments were offered an option to appear for exams whenever the situation was conducive,” he said.For final-year students of Delhi Technological University, who had previously written emails to government and university officials asking for cancellation of online exams, the decision doesn’t help a lot since their exams were conducted last month.“There is considerable disappointment among students. The decision should have come before because we had appeared for the papers in June itself. Now it is too late for us and even our grades suffered. Our juniors might benefit from this,” said Rizwan Saifi, who graduated from DTU this year.However, students from other universities welcomed the move. “Our end-semester exams were scheduled to take place on July 14. Following deputy CM’s announcement, we are waiting for the university to clarify the method on the basis of which we are promoted,” said Ankita Gaur, a student at DPSRU.Expressing disappointment over the delay, Rajesh Jha, DU executive council member, said, “DTU had already conducted its online exam despite the opposition from students. Now, Delhi government has cancelled all the exams, whereas the MHRD-UGC has made all the exams including final-year exams, compulsory. In this whole process, students suffer the most.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-cancel-exams-at-all-state-universities/story-UgLbs02ixKbD6QKnWfiRCK.html
12-07-2020||Delhi||Five new courses in Ambedkar University from this academic session||Ambedkar University of Delhi on Saturday announced five new programmes for the 2020-21 academic session in addition to its existing 37 undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) programmes, the varsity said while releasing its admission brochure on Saturday. The new UG programmes are Bachelor of Vocation (Accounting and Finance Programme) and BBA, offering 35 seats each. The PG programmes are MBA in Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Venture Development (IEVD) and MA (Hindi), offering 35 and 42 seats, respectively. AUD is also launching an MPhil course in Disability Studies with eight seats this academic session onwards. Around 1,800 seats will be available in the upcoming academic session for admission to UG/PG courses.Vice-chancellor Anu Singh Lather announced that the admission process will be carried out completely online in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Earlier, students used to come to the campus to get their documents verified and pay their fee. That process will be carried out online to ensure students don’t have to come to campus,” she said.Students can upload their self-attested documents online, which would be checked by university officials. While there are no measures to check for fraudulency, the university said the documents will be verified whenever students return to campus.While the state university said it would release the admission schedule next week after consulting state authorities, it expects to begin classes for its existing students by August. “While the final call will be taken based on the prevailing situation then and government directives, we are hoping to start classes in August through a blended learning model (both online and offline classes),” Lather said.For admission to its various UG, PG, Mphil, and PhD programmes, the university will give admission based on merit. While undergraduate admissions have always taken place based on Class 12 results, the university would conduct interviews and tests for PG/MPhil/PhD courses. In the wake of the pandemic, the university is not sure what alternate plans will be made in this regard.Established in 2008, the state university reserves 85% seats for students from the National Capital Region and has separate cut-offs for them. Apart from NCR applicants, the university also has a quota for co-curricular activities and the single girl child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/five-new-courses-in-ambedkar-university-from-this-academic-session/story-KxUGY9efdJjYhucdg8iqnK.html

12-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Perfectly alright’: Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari says after reports of self-isolation||Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari said on Sunday some of the news reports regarding his health are “baseless” and that he is not in self-isolation after more than a dozen members of his staff tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had said earlier that Bhagat Singh Koshyari has isolated himself after 16 members of the Raj Bhavan staff tested positive for Covid-19. Koshyari will undergo the test for Covid-19, if required, in the coming days, they had said.“I am perfectly alright and not in self-isolation. I underwent relevant tests, the result of which came in the negative. There are no symptoms of Covid-19 either,” he said in a statement.“However, considering the Covid-19 situation elsewhere, I am discharging all my official duties strictly adhering to protocols like social distancing, sanitizing, wearing of masks, etc,” he added.BMC officials had said out of the 16 staff members of Raj Bhavan, two had tested positive more than a week ago. Around 100 members were then tested for the viral disease by the governor’s office on Saturday at state-run JJ Hospital. BMC officials said around 14 staff members have tested positive for Covid-19.Maharashtra, India’s worst-hit state, on Saturday reported 8,139 new cases of Covid-19—the first time when the state crossed the 8,000-mark in a day—taking its tally to 146,600.The death toll of the state also breached 10,000-mark after 223 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. The toll stands at 10,116, according to data released by the health department. Mumbai reported 1,284 new coronavirus disease cases, which have taken the city’s tally to 91,745.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/perfectly-alright-maharashtra-governor-bhagat-singh-koshyari-says-after-reports-of-self-isolation/story-urSnYSqL2sw2shz2eGhasN.html
12-07-2020||Pune||Covid impact: Restaurateur, auto driver turn vegetable vendors||The Covid-19 pandemic is not only impacting people’s health but also forcing them to change professions.Akshay Khatmode, the owner of North and South Station snack centre, Baner has converted his restaurant into a vegetable shop while Dadarao Rasal—an auto driver has turned his autorickshaw into a vegetable cart in Aundh gaon.For both of them, the pandemic put a brake on their businesses and with no source of money generated in the last two months, the duo decided to change their profession and begin selling vegetables.“After sitting at home for two months, I was completely frustrated and the government was extending lockdown every 15 days, so I decided to change my field and started selling vegetables,” said Khatmode who runs a vegetable shop at Pancard club road, Baner.Following Khatmode, a couple of his restaurant owner friends switched their profession too.“There was no way out to earn money. The government has now given orders to open a hotel but our head cook has gone back to Bihar and out of a staff of nine, I am the only one left. How I will run a restaurant?” added Khatmode who inaugurated his snack centre 14 months ago.Khatmode’s tea had a loyal customer base on Pancard Club road and most of the IT companies used to order from him, but now since the IT companies are working with 33 per cent workforce Khatmode has no plans of selling tea again.“Starting the snack centre again looks very difficult. How people will respond to dine in after it is allowed is a question mark, so I will continue selling vegetables for now. No plans of restarting the restaurant again” added Khatmode.Survival is toughThe thought of paying school fees for his children and earning bread butter inspired auto driver Rasal to start selling vegetables and make a living. A resident of Aundh gaon, Rasal now wakes up at 5 in the morning daily for his new business.“Life is different now, go to the vegetable market, bring vegetables, clean it and sell it. This is my new business and I am proud of it as I am able to earn money again,” said Rasal who is a father of two daughters.In the pre-Covid era, driving an autorickshaw gave Rasal a good amount of money but now people’s perspective has changed.“People are not feeling 100 per cent at comfort while asking for an auto. There is fear in their mind of catching the virus,” said Rasal who is against the 10-day lockdown.“The state government should have taken some time in unlocking the state, now people have started their businesses and they have planned lockdown again. It will impact everyone financially and the government should think about it,” added Rasal.Box:Auto driver turns cloth-seller Dilip Gujar who runs an auto on Sinhagad road is facing a financial crunch as people are not keen on taking an auto-rickshaw.“I was left with no option, so I decided to start selling clothes to earn money. All auto drivers are suffering badly and I request the state government to help us,” added Gujar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-impact-restaurateur-auto-driver-turn-vegetable-vendors/story-55mOxkvzahDsAzshxKsncL.html
12-07-2020||Pune||Did resistance to lockdown being pushed by other IAS officials and politicians cost Gaikwad his job as civic chief?||Shekhar Gaikwad, a 2003 batch IAS officer, had a short yet most eventful stint as Pune municipal commissioner chief. The order about Gaikwad’s sudden transfer on Saturday raised many eyebrows as it came just at a crucial juncture when Pune will be undergoing a ten-day stricter lockdown, starting Tuesday, after a spike in Covid-19 cases.During the meeting called by Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister and guardian minister, in the city, on Friday, Gaikwad was among the very few officials who resisted the lockdown. This, according to sources close to him, was an immediate trigger used by other IAS officials for pushing the case of his transfer.“I have just got to know about the news. Even I am trying to figure out about the transfer. As a civic chief, I tried to give my best despite limited days,” said Gaikwad, immediately after the order was issued by the state government.“Decision to transfer Gaikwad is wrong. He has been made scapegoat. I feel the transfer was for political reasons,” said Pune MP Girish Bapat. Gaikwad, who shared proximity to Pawar was brought as civic chief from sugar commissioner in January this year had barely any breathing space to get a grip on civic issues as Covid pandemic changed the focus of PMC after the first week of May. Before taking charge as the sugar commissioner, Gaikwad had served as commissioner of the groundwater survey and development authority, district collector of Sangli and chief executive officer of Thane zilla parishad.During the last leg of lockdown in May, Gaikwad had taken a consistent stand about opening up while offering more relaxations in Pune as compared to other cities. However, as the city’s Covid tally began witnessing spike, his stand over more relaxations came under scrutiny especially when the government has brought ten IAS officials to coordinate with him while dealing with the crisis. Some of the officials who are more experienced were working under Gaikwad. Interestingly, Gaikwad had shifted in the official Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) bungalow just a week ago. However, within seven days, he will have to vacate it after transfer orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/did-resistance-to-lockdown-being-pushed-by-other-ias-officials-and-politicians-cost-gaikwad-his-job-as-civic-chief/story-AgWsDQqFCLmwgUj9MgFMvK.html

12-07-2020||Pune||BJP steps up attack on government over Lockdown 3.0 in Pune||If residents were angry due to sudden announcement of lockdown in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was also quick in its response.Several BJP leaders, including party national vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, city MP Girish Bapat and Shivajinagar legislator Siddharth Shirole said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has no concrete plans to deal with the crisis.Besides Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, other cities to go or already under lockdown are Thane, Aurangabad, Nanded, Solapur and Amravati.Calling the lockdown as an ad hoc approach and confusion between opening up and restrictions, Sahasrabuddhe in his letter to the chief minister said the government is taking decisions arbitrarily with “safe-play”.“Many believe that this re-lockdown in just few days after declaration of ‘Mission Begin Again’ smacks of utter confusion at various levels of administration. It is believed that these decisions are taken arbitrarily as they can be described as case of convenient safe-play,” said Sahasrabuddhe.Shirole said the city has reported maximum Covid-19 positive cases after Mumbai and Thane, but the CM is yet to visit the city or have not acknowledged the situation here. Leadership that is paramount in times of such crisis is missing.“Let alone a visit to #Pune, Hon CM @OfficeofUT ji has not had a single update or review call / video conference with elected representatives of the City who are working on the ground during this unprecedented Pandemic. Even emails from me are yet to receive a reply. Why is the leader of our state Hon. CM @OfficeofUT ji ignoring #Pune, a city closest to his home, and has one of the highest mortality & infection growth rates in India ? Why has the CM not visited #Pune or held a conference call with local representatives in past 100 days?,” said Shirole in series of tweets.The announcement of lockdown made in Pune by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar came just days after NCP chief Sharad Pawar advocated resumption of activity in the state. While taking the decision, Ajit did not consult any public representatives in Pune, angering many in the BJP.“Ajit Pawar’s decision is unilateral and makes no sense. He should have at least discussed the issue with MLAs and MP before going ahead with lockdown measure. People are already frustrated because of poor economic activity,” said city MP Girish Bapat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bjp-steps-up-attack-on-government-over-lockdown-3-0-in-pune/story-Q6dlY4etkWnv7nOcY1TMZP.html

According to Superintendent of Police Indrajeet Mahatha, a group of armed Maoists had barged into the buildings in Berkela forest area of the district on Saturday night and asked all staffers to vacate the premises.Several employees were also beaten up by the miscreants, and warned of consequences if they informed the police, he told PTI. The naxalites then blew up the buildings, located one after another in the forested area, with Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Mahatha said. “Preliminary investigation showed that the Maoists had also felled trees in the forest to prepare a route, which they would have possibly used to attack the security forces,” the SP said. A massive search operation is under way in the forest, and more details will be available after further investigation, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/maoists-blow-up-12-buildings-of-jharkhand-forest-department-in-west-singhbhum-district/story-gVpeXUMjccPUjZZmavs9pJ.html
12-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi man gets challan for speeding, over 20 days after car was stolen||A resident of the national capital has received a traffic challan for speeding more than 20 days after his car was stolen from near Vivek Vihar Police Station in east Delhi. A resident of Hari Nagar in West Delhi, Yogesh Poddar’s vehicle was stolen on June 6 and remains untraceable, police said. However, on June 28, he received a challan for speeding near Millennium Depot. According to Poddar, he parked his car near Vivek Vihar Police Station on June 5 at around 8 pm. “I visited my in-laws in E-block, Jhilmil Colony, behind Vivek Vihar Police Station on June 5. Since the streets there were congested, I parked my vehicle on the main road near the police station. However, the next day, my car was not there,” Poddar, who deals in packaging of pharmaceutical materials, said, adding that he filed an FIR online.Police claimed that there were no CCTV cameras near the spot where Poddar parked his car and despite analysing the footage from nearby areas, they could not spot his car. “The area where his car was parked did not have a CCTV camera installed but we scanned footage from multiple CCTV cameras installed in the adjoining areas to identify the culprits who fled with the vehicle but we could not find anything,’’ an officer privy to the investigation said. “Despite our best efforts, we could not trace the car and after a few days, following due procedure, we filed an ‘untraceable report’ in the court,” the officer said. However, barely a week later on June 30, the complainant received the challan along with a photo of his stolen vehicle. Poddar immediately informed the investigating officer as he was hopeful that police will now be able to trace the stolen vehicle. “Until I received the challan on June 30, I thought the culprits must have either dismantled the car or sold it to someone outside Delhi,” Poddar said. “But after I received the challan with the photo, I was surprised to see that neither the colour of my car nor its registration number had been changed, only a few stickers and an idol on the dashboard were missing. Despite this, police have failed to trace my vehicle,” claimed Poddar. Although, the untraceable report was filed before the car was challaned, it is still pending with the court and efforts are being taken to trace the stolen vehicle, senior police officer said. Earlier this month, the husband of a Delhi court judge received a traffic challan for speeding two months after their car was stolen from their west Delhi residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-man-gets-challan-for-speeding-over-20-days-after-car-was-stolen/story-z8rBi4a0CN2C18jpnNglsN.html
12-07-2020||Delhi||Restaurants open but grapple with decreased sales, few dine-in customers||Restaurants across Delhi may have reopened their doors a month ago after being allowed to resume their business post the Covid-19 lockdown, but are still grappling with decreased sales, staff shortages and few dine-in customers. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions, many restaurants have not commenced dine-in facilities and are relying on takeaways to drive their business.According to Rohit Aggarwal, director, Lite Bite Foods, post ‘Unlock’, the situation has not been “very motivating, walk-in numbers are extremely low and the operational cost is soaring”.“The highest number of dine-in guests we have served on a single day after opening following the Covid-19 lockdown is just 15 at Punjab Grill’s Saket outlet. We are hoping to serve the same number of guests we had before very soon and are positive that this number will go up eventually. “We are making just 20 per cent sales of what we used to do. Dine-in sales account for just 25 per cent of the existing 20 per cent sales and rest all are delivery and takeaway orders,” he said.Aggarwal said people are still apprehensive of stepping out and going to confined public places such as malls and restaurants. Currently, only two restaurants under the Lite Bite Foods portfolio are open for dine-in -- YouMee (GK2 Delhi and Bangalore outlets) and Punjab Grill (four outlets across Delhi-NCR ) -- but both are experiencing extremely low footfall, Aggarwal said.With movie halls shut and restrictions on liquor service, customers have no motivation to go out and eat. Even the restaurants in mall are finding it difficult to attract dine-in guests, he added.The shortage of staffers, many of whom had gone back to their hometowns, are also the reason behind many restaurants opting to open takeaways.“Our workforce is the biggest concern as most of the people are from different cities and we need time to call them back. Our prime concern is and will always be the safety of our staff. “With most of the state borders still closed, we don’t want to take any risk. The other pain points are not being able to serve liquor and to operate with less than 60 per cent seating capacity to maintain social distancing,” said Joy Singh, co-partner, Raasta and Yeti restaurants.As late hours make up the lion’s share of our revenues, the 10 PM deadline will further hurt business, Singh said, adding that with the given restrictions, they are still contemplating whether it’s worth opening up at the moment.“Currently, we are focusing on home deliveries with our brand Yeti,” he added.Karan Tanna, founder Ghost Kitchens and co-founder BroEat, also echoed similar reactions and said expenses have begun but business is down by 70-75 per cent.However, he said the silver lining is all this is that there is a week on week increase in footfall and due to precautions taken by restaurants, customers are slowly feeling confident to eat out.Ashwin Jain, co-founder, Instapizza, said they have seen a reasonable recovery in sales in the last four to six weeks, and consumers have looked to their favourite and most trusted brands in-home delivery to find a little bit of respite from the ongoing challenges of the crisis.So the question arises -- when do restaurants think of resuming dine-in facilities, asked Chef Irfan Pabaney, country head, SodaBottleOpenerWala and added that the restaurants might resume dine-in facilities within a month or two. He said restaurants are relying on takeaways currently but they hope that the situation will normalise in some time.Pabaney said the major challenge for their workforce is maintaining social distance given that they have to interact with each other during the preparation of dishes. They maintain social distancing and regularly wash hands, he said.Aggarwal also says the coronavirus pandemic has changed consumer behaviour forever.“‘Contact-less dining’ seems to be the buzz of the future with customers’ hesitation for sociable activities and they being more cautious about their health. At Lite Bite Foods, we have revamped our menus thoroughly in the lockdown period.“Although, all the high sellers and most of our specialities have been retained, the overall menu size has been decreased. This is to ensure that our chefs also maintain proper distancing at the workplace,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/restaurants-open-but-grapple-with-decreased-sales-few-dine-in-customers/story-s4xviE7FgQwQNAyAB71faO.html

Back then, nearly 40,000-45,000 vehicles were registered in Delhi every month, the officials said.J S Nayol, president of the All India Car Dealers Association, said the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the business and the situation will take time to return to normal.“People are facing financial hardships, so they are going for used cars instead of new ones. We have demanded the government to give relief from GST so that sale of new cars also picks up,” he said.Most of the vehicles being bought by the people are in the range of Rs one lakh to Rs eight lakh. There is not much demand in high-end cars upwards of Rs 10 lakh. The highest demand is in the small car segment, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-sees-over-23-000-vehicle-registrations-in-june/story-8JaHG3t4YWIEL6xrQBrDHJ.html
12-07-2020||Kolkata||Covid-19, Amphan help RSS to spread wings in rural West Bengal||In the last three months the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) intensified its activities to provide food and medical help to migrant workers during the coronavirus pandemic and relief to those affected by Cyclone Amphan as it made a political point that the ruling Trinamool Congress failed to manage the two simultaneous disasters.RSS, the ideological parent of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has around 1,800 sakhas (branches) in West Bengal. It could not hold daily assemblies because of nationwide lockdown that started in March but its members have tried to help people during the crisis.“The Covid-19 pandemic is the worst thing that has happened in India. Helping people should be our sole objective,” Jishnu Basu, general secretary of the RSS state unit, said while speaking to HT. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the RSS’ trade union arm, in a bid to provide work to migrant workers has set up help desks to provide employment opportunities in the eastern state as well as in others like Kerala, Maharashtra and Gujarat. The BMS claims it is contacting local employers as well.“We are operating 38 help desks across Bengal. According to our estimate, 80% migrants will leave the state again. We are preparing records of these people and helping them to get work,” said Ravi Singh, the BMS’ state working president. “Our 121 active unions in Bengal have distributed food and sanitisers among 1.62 lakh families at 665 locations in 23 districts. Tarpaulins, food and relief materials were distributed in Amphan-hit areas as well,” Singh added. The National Medicos Organisation (NMO), an organisation of doctors and volunteers of the RSS, along with two other outfits, have so far held 80 medical camps in East Midnapore and the South and North 24 Parganas, the Amphan impacted districts.“We have treated about 25,000 people so far, thanks to 80 doctors, 250 volunteers and help from the BJP medical cell. Masks and medicines have been distributed. We are preparing a list of people who need surgery,” said Dr Prabhat Singh, state president of NMO.Sahakar Bharati, a nationwide cooperative movement backed by RSS, has in recent years set up multipurpose, agricultural and fisheries cooperatives depending on location and requirement, said Vivekananda Patra, its organising secretary in West Bengal, Sikkim, Odisha and the Andamans.These cooperatives are now helping people affected by lockdown.Basudeb Sarkar, who is associated with Sahakar Bharati, said he has been able to help the families of many of his neighbours who went to other states for work and faced crisis during the lockdown.Sarkar is a resident of Nandangram village of North Dinajpur district in north Bengal.“Around 2.24 lakh people from North Dinajpur were stuck in other states. We helped some of them through the Sahakar Bharati network in those states. Now our main objective is to help women whose husbands have not returned. We are inducting them in cooperative societies for packaging and marketing organic farm products,” said Sarkar.Political fallout:Political observers say that with RSS cadre working on the field helps the BJP for the crucial 2021 assembly polls. The humanitarian work, they say, gives the BJP the same strong platform that the RSS ensured for the party in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Assam and other states. The BJP bagged 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, unsettling the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the districts. The party’s leaders are now publicly saying that they will win 200 of the 294 assembly seats in 2021 assembly polls.Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, former principal of Presidency College, said the RSS was doing a great job for people affected by the lockdown and Cyclone Amphan.“I don’t support the RSS ideology but TMC activists are not doing anything of this kind. They are more interested in robbing the money that has come from the government as a grant,” said Mukhopadhyay.“Because of these welfare activities the BJP is trying to have its strongholds, particularly in the rural areas that represent the majority of the voters. If RSS continues this work it will surely help the BJP do much better in the coming election,” he added.The outreach of the RSS could hurt the TMC, a senior minister, who did not wish to be named, admitted. “In 2011, we could overthrow the Communist Party of India (Marxist) despite its phenomenal cadre-based organisation because voters turned against the Left. In the coming war, our main weapon against the BJP is the TMC government’s performance,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/covid-19-amphan-help-rss-to-spread-wings-in-rural-west-bengal/story-OL4wNeVTGZYitkCmHlZefJ.html

We don’t think holding offline tests is possible during such a pandemic. And online tests will also be discriminatory for a large section of students. There should be other ways of evaluation,” an SFI leader said.The demonstrators also demanded that no tuition fee be taken from students of educational institutions during the lockdown period.The body of vice-chancellors of state-run universities of West Bengal has already aired their opposition to the advisory of the MHRD which said final-year examinations in universities will have to be conducted by September-end, deferring the schedule from July in view of a spike in Covid- 19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/sfi-holds-protest-rallies-against-mhrd-advisory-on-university-exams/story-UqaY8APRq3h6znJHkYH6cL.html

But at the same time, recovery rate is almost 83%. The city’s current positivity rate is 11%. Ideally, it should be around 5% as per the World Health Organization ( WHO), but through our interventions in large outbreak areas and containment zones, we are trying for 8% to 10%.”Experts who have been monitoring Gurugram and state Covid-19 data said that the spike is due to unchecked transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 infection.“In the last 10 days, Gurugram saw 18.4% rise in the coronavirus cases detected in the city, when compared to the data of the previous 10 days from June 21 to 30. More testing leads to higher detection of so far undetected infection in the community. But at the same time it also points at the unchecked transmission of the coronavirus among susceptible hosts. Tests are detecting only a portion of such infected lot,” said Dheeraj Singh, data scientist who has been monitoring district’s Covid-19 data.The total count of the coronavirus cases has crossed the mark of 20,000 in the state to record 20,582 with 648 new cases. Out of these, 4891 are active cases, while 15,394 have been discharged, according to the state bulletin.

12-07-2020||Lucknow||Vikas Dubey was ready for ‘big action’ day before ambush||Gangster Vikas Dubey had set a plan in motion for what he called ‘big action’ on July 2, a day before he and his men killed eight policemen, injured seven others and looted five police weapons, police officials said on the basis of questioning of Dubey in Ujjain after his arrest on July 9. Dubey was subsequently killed in an encounter as he tried to escape when he was being brought to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh early on July 10, according to the police. The gangster spoke about what happened before the July 3 ambush during his day-long questioning at Narwar police station in Ujjain rural and then at the police training school (PTS) in Ujjain, police officials said.“He was calm and relaxed during the questioning. He said he was getting regular inputs from the police about the developments. He knew the raid was imminent and he prepared accordingly a day before,” said an official who spoke to his Madhya Pradesh police counterpart. On July 2 and July 3, he had food prepared for 30 people living in his house, Dubey told the police, the officials added.After he was certain that an attempt to murder case was going to be lodged against him following a complaint by villager Rahul Tiwari, he asked his supporters to prepare for a hard battle, the officials said.

12-07-2020||Delhi||2/3rds of Covid beds in Delhi hospitals vacant||The number of people in the city hospitalised with Covid-19 has been declining consistently over the past week, with the number of beds occupied dipping below the 5,000-mark on four consecutive days. This means over two-thirds of beds in Delhi designated for the treatment of Covid-19 patients remain vacant, as on Saturday.Currently, there are 15,244 Covid-19 beds across government and private hospitals, of which 4,502 were occupied as on Saturday evening. An additional 1,000 beds are available at the field hospital in Dhaula Kuan built by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The last time the number of people in the hospitals was as low was on June 10, when Delhi had been recording between 1,000 and 1,500 new cases a day. The daily new case count shot up to 3,947 on June 23, but has significantly lowered, especially over the past week.The government, however, has no plans to de-escalate the preparations made for Covid-19 treatment. “We cannot start de-escalating preparations made for Covid-19 right now even though the number of howspitalisations has gone down. In many places across the world — even in Mumbai — the number of cases has gone up after showing a decline. We have to stay alert,” said a Delhi government spokesperson.However, hospitals have put any further expansions on hold. “Only about a third of the beds in the AIIMS Trauma Centre and Jhajjar campus are currently occupied, and there is no need for more. The burns centre will not be converted to a Covid-19 hospital for the time being,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The hospital has 1,250 beds in its cancer centre at Jhajjar and 260 beds in the trauma centre on ring road earmarked for Covid-19 patients. Currently, just over 400 patients are admitted to both, Dr Sharma said.The number of admissions started going down at the hospital 10 days ago. The highest number of active cases that the hospital had was just over 600 mid-June.At the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, Delhi’s biggest Covid-19 facility, the number of admissions have gone down from about a 100 a day 10 days ago to about 50 to 60 in the last 10 days. “The number of cases has certainly gone down, but the cases we are getting are more serious ones, where the patient is semi-conscious or is already on life-support. This means more and more people are staying in home isolation rather than coming to hospitals. However, whether or not to start other services is a decision that has to be taken by the government,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital.Experts also agreed that it would be premature to scale down the number of Covid beds. “I visited two private hospitals in the city as a part of the committee observing Covid-19 patient care and found that 50% of the beds were empty. It is encouraging to see that the number of new cases and hospitalisations are going down, but it is too early to shut down these facilities. The government should review the situation again in a few weeks to examine the trend,” said Dr Mahesh Verma, vice-chancellor of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. He chaired a committee set up by the Delhi government in June that estimated infrastructure needs to treat Covid patients.The committee had said there would be 100,000 cases by June-end, which would consequently necessitate at least 15,000 beds.Another member of the committee Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council, said, “The number of people hospitalised in the city is consistently going down by 200 to 300 every day. This is very encouraging, but the government cannot lower their guard yet. In countries like China, Spain and US the number of cases has risen after a decline.”Assuming the initial trends of the sero-surveillance data to be true, he said, Delhi is a long way away from herd immunity.“There were reports that there is a 15% prevalence of the antibodies against Covid-19 in Delhi. This is not enough for herd immunity, which can protect those who are uninfected. Besides, we don’t even know whether the antibodies are enough to prevent a second infection — studies have shown that antibody levels are lower in asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms. Plus, we also don’t know how long the antibodies last in a person. The infection is spreading in the other parts of the country and there is a possibility of resurgence in Delhi,” said Dr Gupta||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/2-3rds-of-covid-beds-in-delhi-hospitals-vacant/story-WzQ7HNdeWrEzyaM12xZriI.html
12-07-2020||Delhi||Pre-wedding shoots, parties likely to be allowed at Waste to Wonder park||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has decided to allow paid pre-wedding shoots, birthday parties and brand promotions at the popular Waste to Wonder park, which has replicas of the Seven Wonders of the world, officials associated with the matter said. Spread across seven acres and located at Rajiv Gandhi Smriti Van near Sarai Kale Khan ISBT, the park has replicas of Leaning Tower of Pisa, Eiffel Tower, Pyramids of Giza, Taj Mahal, Statue of Liberty, Colosseum and Christ the Redeemer -- all made out of waste. Opened in February 2019, the park has become a popular tourist spot. Till February this year, nearly 1.55 million people visited the park, earning the municipal corporation Rs 8 crore in ticket revenues. The entry fee to the park is 50 on normal days and Rs 100 on Sunday.  The standing committee, the highest decision making body of the SDMC, cleared a proposal on Friday which seeks to allow pre-wedding shoots, social gatherings such as birthday parties, corporate parties or promotion of a product or brand at the Waste to Wonder park. According to officials, the municipal body had been getting requests from people who wanted to hold events at the popular park. They said they have prepared a rate list for different kinds of events. The proposal will now be taken up for discussion at the SDMC House later this month for a final approval. A senior SDMC official said that until the lockdown, they were getting 10-15 requests daily for pre-wedding shoots and birthday celebrations. “We were getting many requests until the lockdown. A proposal made by the horticulture department was tabled in the standing committee meeting yesterday (Friday), which we have passed. It will now go to the House for approval,” Rajdutt Gehlot, chairman SDMC standing committee, said.A senior SDMC official said that bookings for pre-wedding shoots and other social events will bring in more revenue for the corporation once the park opens. He said the civic body was yet to decide the mode of booking, online or offline. “We are working out modalities,” he said. The official said that rates have been fixed for different events (See box for rates).For pre-wedding shoot, Rs 26,000 have to paid out of which Rs 10,000 will be the refundable security amount and Rs 15,000 will be the booking charges. Rs 1,000 will be charged for sanitation purposes.For birthday party celebrations, one will have to pay Rs 16,000, which will include Rs 10,000 booking charges, refundable security deposit of Rs 5000 and Rs 1,000 for sanitation of the park after the party. “The permission will be granted by the horticulture department of the SDMC. This move will generate revenue for cash-strapped civic body. We are also planning to allow film shooting there,” a senior SDMC official said.The park has been built by the SDMC as part of its initiative to process waste, under meaningful projects and add aesthetic value to the city. Nearly 150 tons of scrape and waste material were used to create replicas of wonders of the world. The park showcases grand replicas of the Taj Mahal (20ft), Eiffel Tower (60ft), Statue of Liberty (30ft), Great Pyramid of Giza (18ft), Leaning Tower of Pisa (25ft), Christ the Redeemer (25ft), and Rome’s Colosseum (15ft) – all made of scrap material.The theme park is currently closed due to coronavirus pandemic. The authorities are likely to open this park by the next weekend. Some monuments such as Qutub Minar, Red Fort were opened for tourists last week. The civic body’s officers are preparing a standard operating procedures (SOP) for the purpose which recommends reducing the timing of visitors to stay in the park to one-and-a-half hours from existing four hours. As per the new guidelines, the new timing of the closure of the Park is likely to be at 7pm instead of 11pm. “There will be no entry without masks and thermal screening of visitors will be conducted. Visitors will be sent in batches. To ensure social distancing we will allow visitors to stay only for one-and-a-half hour instead of four hours. Guidelines are still under discussion and we will finalise these in a few days,” the official said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pre-wedding-shoots-parties-likely-to-be-allowed-at-waste-to-wonder-park/story-IGb8M5Xfa6t4RNTBEElhtI.html
12-07-2020||Delhi||New traffic advisory for Ashram Chowk||Delhi Traffic Police on Saturday issued an elaborate traffic management plan for Ashram Chowk, one of the busiest intersections in the capital, with the work on an underpass that will connect the Nizamuddin railway overbridge and Mathura Road resuming after a prolonged lull first in the wake of Shaheen Bagh protest and then the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. The 750-metre underpass which was conceived in December 2015 aims to provide a signal-free ride from Nizamuddin to New Friends Colony on Mathura Road. According to the traffic police advisory, the construction work would affect commuters between East Delhi, South Delhi, Faridabad and Noida for at least a year. The diversions will be implemented from Saturday between 7am and 10pm. The Ashram chowk is an important link between central and south Delhi with the satellite towns of Noida and Faridabad. The intersection connects Mathura Road, National Highway-2 and the Ring Road (linking Lajpat Nagar-Sarai Kale Khan and DND flyover).While releasing the traffic diversion plan for the Ashram intersection, traffic police advised commuters to avoid the intersection because of the ongoing construction work. “The construction work is expected to last until next year, so traffic management will be a problem here. There are hardly two lanes available for the movement of vehicles now,” said a senior traffic police official, explaining the situation on the stretch. According to the traffic plan, private vehicles coming from Sarai Kale Khan and Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) Flyway going towards Badarpur or Faridabad, will now be directed towards CV Raman Marg before Ashram Flyover. From there they can take the Mata Mandir Marg, MA Jauhar Marg or Modi Mill flyover loop to reach Mathura Road.Similarly, commuters coming from Dhaula Kuan side will be diverted towards Captain Gaur Marg under Lajpat Nagar flyover, from where they can take the Modi Mill Flyover via the Outer Ring Road and reach Mathura Road.Goods vehicles destined towards Badarpur or Tughlakabad, from Sarai Kale Khan, will now have to take the Ashram flyover and make a left turn on Captain Gaur Marg from the Lajpat Nagar flyover crossing. Those coming from the other side (from Dhaula Kuan) will also have to use Captain Gaur Marg.Traffic cops said that the Ashram crossing gets a daily load of nearly 4 lakh-4.5 lakh vehicles. In fact, from December last year, when the traffic movement towards Kalindi Kunj was blocked because of a sit-in protest at Shaheen Bagh, this number to 6 lakh vehicles every day, according to a traffic police estimates.“Ashram has remained a traffic management nightmare for us. From 2015 to the end of 2018, the stretch was dug up for Delhi Metro work and then when that opened and traffic jams were finally easing, the PWD has taken over,” another senior official of the local traffic circle said.The underpass was to be completed by March 2018, but the expenditure finance committee of the Delhi government approval it in November 2018. After 2018, the project faced delays because of the delayed permissions, protests at Shaheen Bagh and then the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown. “The work resumed by May end and we will require a year to complete the work,” the PWD confirmed.Dr S Velmurugan, senior principal scientist at CRRI said the underpass will ease the perennial snarls on the Ashram intersection. “The construction period will be a problem, but that can be dealt with,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/new-traffic-advisory-for-ashram-chowk/story-wgkvGCBBJ7dBDfsBHpiNlI.html
12-07-2020||Mumbai||Maha Covid toll crosses 10K; cases up by 8,139||Maharashtra’s death toll due to Covid-19 on Saturday breached the 10,000 mark with 223 deaths reported in the past 24 hours, as the state’s case tally also registered its highest single-day spike of 8,139 infections — first in excess of 8,000.The toll stands at 10,116 and the tally at 246,600, according to data released by state health department, which also stated that active cases rose close to 1 lakh at 99,202. The state reported its first Covid-19 death on March 17, which means it took 117 days to cross the grim 10,000 markSaturday was also the second consecutive day the state reported its sharpest single-day spike after it recorded 7,862 cases on Friday. Meanwhile, Mumbai maintained a sort of stability in the number of fresh cases. On Saturday, it reported 1,284 new cases, taking the tally to 91,745. Of them, active cases are 22,782. Mumbai’s toll stands at 5,244 after 39 more deaths were reported.The number of recovered patients in the state also increased to 1,36,985 after 4,360 patients had recovered in the past 24 hours. The recovery rate has improved to 55.55%.Maharashtra is looking at a surge as the tally of new cases has crossed the 8,000-mark. The cases are going up across the state, whereas the situation in Mumbai appears to be slightly under control when compared to last month. Mumbai’s contribution to total cases has reduced to 37.20% (with 91,745 cases) from 58.09% (with 43,492 cases) on June 3.“Everybody is agreeing that Mumbai is seeing a plateau, in the sense that cases are not coming down, but they are not rising either. Most people are predicting that it will stay so for a while. We are keeping our fingers crossed,” said a senior BMC official.In contrast, the number of daily cases in other eight cities of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) looks like spreading at a rapid speed. Their contribution in total cases has been increased to 25.56% (63,039 cases) from 15.49% on June 3 (11,594 cases).The cities are Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Mira-Bhayander, Ulhasnagar, Panvel, Vasai-Virar and Bhiwandi-Nizampur.On Saturday, Kalyan-Dombivli recorded 640 fresh infections, Thane 455, Navi Mumbai 256, Ulhasnagar 304, Mira-Bhayander 260, Vasai-Virar 305, Panvel 169 and Bhiwandi-Nizampur recorded 63.Amid the rise in number of cases in MMR, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with commissioners of civic bodies in the region on July 9 and termed the situation a “concern”. This was Thackeray’s second interaction with the civic chiefs in under two weeks.Expressing dissatisfaction over the health infrastructure in many cities in MMR, Thackeray has directed them to follow the example of Mumbai and ramp up health facilities for Covid-19 cases. The CM, during a video conference, also asked to set up field hospitals to treat patients. The areas that are not in red zone (apart from 19 cities) are also experiencing a surge in cases. Their contribution in total cases rose to almost double in more than a month. It has now gone up to 17.56% from 9.32% on June 3. This indicates a rise even in rural areas of the state.Dr Archana Patil, director, Directorate of Health Services, said they are working only on enhancing healthcare facilities and cannot say that the peak has started. “Currently, we are monitoring the growth rate of fresh infections and based on that, making projections for the coming weeks. I cannot say that the peak has started. Our priority is to augment healthcare facilities because more cases need more medical facilities. We will have to match the health infrastructure with the rise in fresh cases in each and every district of the state,” Dr Patil said.As number of Covid cases is rising, stricter lockdown restrictions have been imposed in several cities and districts by the local administration. On Saturday, Solapur municipal corporation also declared that lockdown will be imposed between July 16 and 26 to break the chain. Solapur municipal commissioner Milind Shambharkar made the announcement after 77 fresh cases were reported in the city. The case count went up to 3,085.On Friday, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies had decided to impose a 10-day lockdown from July 13, while Mumbai’s neighbouring Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli civic bodies, too, have extended their ongoing lockdown for seven more days till July 19.Along with spike in cases, the state is also facing large number of deaths on daily basis. In the past 11 days (since July 1), it has recorded 2,110 Covid-19 casualties.With 9,893 deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded 4.15% on Friday. It is second highest in the country after Gujarat, where the CFR is 5.05% with 2,022 deaths (40,069 cases) till Friday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Maharashtra still has highest number of deaths across states in the country.After forming a task-force of expert doctors in all districts and the state has now decided optimum use of the testing infrastructure and also start rapid testing to bring down CFR.In a letter from the health department earlier this week, all district collectors and municipal commissioners have been directed to bring down the positivity rate to less than 10% and reduce CFR to less than 1%.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that they are focussing on reducing CFR and for this they have decided to increase daily number of testing in the state. “We have decided to conduct more testing so that more people can be traced and CFR as well as positive rate against total testing can be reduced and be brought under 10%,” Tope said.Currently, the positivity rate against total tests is 19.17% as 246,600 tests were found positive, out of the total 1,285,991 samples tested so far.Currently, 47,376 people have been kept in institutional quarantine and 6,80,017 people have been put under home quarantine across the state. The health minister said the existing institutional quarantine facilities in metro cities need to be augmented, considering aggressive tracing in slum areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-toll-crosses-10k-cases-up-by-8-139/story-pTDIVtBt2P7E4vkmhiqUUO.html
12-07-2020||Mumbai||CM made a cautious decision to ease lockdown: Pawar in Saamana interview||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday commended Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray for deciding to ease the curbs during the Covid-19 lockdown at the right time in his “cautious” style of functioning. Pawar, in an interview with the Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana, insisted there was no difference of opinion between him and Thackeray over the way the government brought in the relaxations during the lockdown. This is the first time Saamana has published a three-part interview of a politician who is not Sena’s top leader. The newspaper had previously only carried such interviews of late party founder Bal Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray.In the interview with Saamana’s executive editor and Sena MP Sanjay Raut, Pawar said he came to the conclusion that curbs should be gradually lifted to revive the economy, after discussions with several people, and then brought it to the notice of the CM. “During this entire situation, I have been in touch with the chief minister, and am even today... During this time, I had discussions with labour bodies, business-owners, etc. I formed an opinion based on that and brought it to the notice of the CM,” Pawar said. The Maharashtra government under Mission Begin Again started relaxing lockdown norms from June. There were speculations that Thackeray was earlier unwilling to open up the state, but Pawar intervened to get the curbs eased.Pawar refuted reports of differences between him and Thackeray on lifting the lockdown. He also categorically denied that there were any differences between Sena and its ruling partners, the NCP and Congress. “This is not called a difference of opinion. Delhi and Karnataka allowed relaxations, and there were consequences, but economic activities started again. Such steps have to be taken. If the entire state and the country’s economy are disrupted, then the ill-effects will be far greater than coronavirus,” he said.“The decision that came was true to the nature of the chief minister. Meaning, a decision should be taken but with caution – to take a step by seeing all sides, so that there is no need to go back on it,” Pawar added.He pointed out that three parties with different ideologies have managed to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak in the state. The Maratha strongman denied that he is either the “remote control” or the “headmaster” of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, amid a buzz that Pawar has been directing Thackeray from behind the curtains, and running the government.“I am neither. If headmaster, he would have been part of a school. In a democracy, governments or administration do not function with remote control,” he said, giving an example of the political scenario in Russia.The veteran leader denied that the alliance between the member parties of the MVA —the Sena, NCP, and Congress— was an “accident”. Pawar pointed out that in the Lok Sabha elections last year, there was no change of government, but before the state assembly polls, the people had decided to bring about a change.He said Sena’s voters and supporters were uneasy during the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Sena government between 2014 and 2019, and the party paid a heavy price for its association.“The BJP continuously took a stand to sideline Sena and, keep it quiet. They functioned as if it was only a BJP government. Earlier too, there was a Sena-BJP government under Manohar Joshi, but the atmosphere was not like this then. The BJP sidelined the Sena; this did not go down well with the people of Maharashtra,” Pawar said.Without naming former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Pawar said, “No political leader should take the people for granted saying ‘I will come back again’.” He said that voters do not tolerate it if they are taken for granted. “Powerful leaders with a mass base like Indira Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee had been defeated. It means that in terms of democratic rights, the common man is wiser than the politicians. If we politicians cross the line, he teaches us a lesson.” Pawar added the Sena made a major contribution to the BJP’s assembly tally of 105 seats in 2019. “Had it not been for the Shiv Sena, that number would have been around 40-50.”Pressing on about the incompatibility of the BJP and Sena, Pawar claimed that Bal Thackeray’s functioning style and ideology were not similar to that of the BJP. “He respected leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani, and Pramod Mahajan,” he said. “The Sena had struggles with the Congress, but it was never permanent, I think. Shiv Sena was never at loggerheads with the Congress,” Pawar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-made-a-cautious-decision-to-ease-lockdown-pawar-in-saamana-interview/story-T8xitlwNc4C3pGLvocsWuK.html
12-07-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects bail plea of woman who didn’t act against husband for raping their 2 daughters||The Bombay high court (HC) last week rejected the bail plea of a woman accused of passively supporting her husband who raped two of their daughters and tried to sexually assault the third.The woman’s bail application was based on claims that the accusations against her were false. However, a single bench of justice Vibha Kankanwadi took note that the entire story narrated by the daughters in the first information report (FIR) was “consistent” and “shocking”, and rejected the woman’s plea.On April 2, the three sisters, who were badly beaten and locked in a room by their parents, were rescued by Kaij police in Beed district. The husband, a school headmaster, and his wife were arrested after the eldest daughter filed a complaint with the police.According to her complaint, on March 31, the man tried to molest his 20-year-old eldest daughter, but she and her two sisters caused a commotion. The parents then beat them up and locked them inside a room in the house. The sisters, however, managed to communicate their condition to a friend who then informed the police.The eldest daughter narrated her ordeal to the police, and in her complaint stated that she was raped by her father in 2012. She told the police that she was beaten by her father after she informed her mother about the incident.The complainant further alleged that while her father kept molesting her intermittently, he also sexually assaulted her younger sister, who is now 18-years-old, since the time she was studying in Class 5. The three sisters were beaten after the matter was reported to their mother, and they were warned not to disclose the acts to anyone.The 20-year-old further alleged that in 2018, her father tried to rape their youngest sister, who is now 15-year-old. In this instance too, their mother remained silent even after the incident was brought to her notice.Acting on the complaint, police arrested the headmaster for rape, and his wife for abetment, for passively supporting her husband.The woman had moved the high court seeking bail, claiming the complaint was false and that her 20-year-old daughter had made wild allegations because she was reprimanded for moving around in bad company. “It is highly impossible that the mother would keep quiet when her husband was molesting her daughter and would allow such activity to be continued for years together,” her lawyer had argued.The judge rejected the woman’s bail plea, primarily noting that the entire story that had been narrated in the FIR appeared to be consistent with the statements of the sisters.Justice Kankanwadi said the entire story was shocking, and the defense put forth by the applicant mother appeared baseless. The judge felt that no daughter would go to the extent of making such serious allegations against her parents simply because they were opposed to her relationship with a particular boy having bad antecedents. The judge said that even if the complainant went to that extent, the other two sisters would not have supported her against their parents if the allegations were false.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-woman-who-didn-t-act-against-husband-for-raping-their-2-daughters/story-9BtwBOOBhJPaOdz6VdwKfI.html

12-07-2020||Mumbai||BMC assistant commissioner dies of Covid-19||In yet another tragic incident, assistant municipal commissioner Ashok Khairnar died due to the Covid-19 on Saturday. He is the second senior civic official to succumb to Covid-19 after deputy municipal commissioner Shirish Dixit had died in June.The 57-year-old, was in charge of H-East ward (Bandra, Santacruz), which includes chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s private residence, Matoshree. Khairnar started feeling unwell and tested positive for Covid-19 in the first week of July. He was initially admitted to Gurunanak Hospital in Bandra but was later shifted to SevenHills Hospital in Andheri. After several treatment measures were ineffective, he was moved to Fortis Hospital, Mulund, where he died on Saturday while undergoing treatment. Civic officials suspect that he may have gotten infected while in the field.Khairnar was at the forefront of implementing several containment measures to contain the spread of the Sars Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, in Bandra. In a press statement, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) praised the official for using effective containment strategies, testing and isolation which helped H-East ward to increase its doubling rate of cases to 134 days – the highest among the 24 wards, and for bringing down the growth rate in the ward to 0.5%.Khairnar was in the service of the BMC from February 1988. Before becoming an assistant municipal commissioner, he was posted with the solid waste management (SWM) department as an executive engineer. He had taken on the post of assistant commissioner in January 2018. “Today we lost @mybmcWardHE AC Ashok Khairnar ji to covid. As I offer my heartfelt condolences to his family, I might as well add that we have lost a covid hero today. He managed his ward with brilliance, the doubling day rate being at 134 and infection rate being lowest at 0.5%,” state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-assistant-commissioner-dies-of-covid-19/story-tFXuB78ggmnuyy8TjT1kyK.html
12-07-2020||City||Kalyan hospital fined ₹5K for dumping biomedical waste in residential area||The waste management department of Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) imposed a fine of ₹5,000 on a Covid-19 hospital at Kalyan’s Tilak Chowk on Saturday, after a video, showing hospital staffers dumping medical waste on road was shot by locals and sent to the civic body.“Locals complained about the waste being dumped outside the Covid-19 hospital, following which our team reached the spot and found used plates and hand gloves from a bin nearby. We have fined the hospital ₹5,000 for it. Covid-19 hospitals are allowed to dump any waste from the facility at public places,” said Ramdar Kokare, deputy commissioner, KDMC.On Wednesday, residents living around the hospital had opposed the civic body’s decision to take over the hospital for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“This is why we opposed the decision to use the hospital as a Covid-19 facility. If medical waste is dumped openly, it may lead to spread of infection,” a resident of the area, who did not wish to be named, said.In a similar incident, locals from Dombivli MIDC Phase-2 complained that red-coloured bags containing bio-medical waste was dumped on the service road of Durvakur Hall. According to Kokare, biomedical waste is dumped in red bags.Social activist Mangesh Koyande,38, took pictures of the bags after learning about the incident and complained about it to the civic body.“I have noticed that from the past six days, that sacks containing PPE [personal protective equipment] kits and other biomedical waste were being dumped in the area. I have asked the civic body to take strict action against those responsible,” said Koyande.“As soon as we received the complaint, my team visited the spot and cleared the bags. We are also trying to find out who is dumping the waste at open spaces and will take a strict action against those responsible,” said Kokare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-hospital-fined-5k-for-dumping-biomedical-waste-in-residential-area/story-VZ1lDY6pQoki3RLc7pBopL.html
12-07-2020||Mumbai||City’s Covid toll jumps to 5,244 with 751 past deaths added in June, July||The city has added 751 deaths from Covid-19 to its death toll from June 19 till date as part of an exercise to reconcile pending death figures. These deaths occurred earlier and were reported late to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Mumbai recorded 1,284 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, raising the total number of cases in the city to 91,745. Of these 24.8%, or 22,782, are active. So far, 63,431 patients have recovered. The death toll from Covid-19 is 5,244 and the mortality rate is 5.7% in the city. On Saturday, 39 deaths were recorded in Mumbai.Previously, BMC had issued two warnings (on June 18 and June 26) to public and private hospitals to report pending figures for Covid-19 deaths, and thereafter report all Covid-19 deaths within 48 hours. After the first warning, reconciled figures of Covid-19 deaths between June 19 and June 26 totalled 353. After the second warning, 398 deaths from Covid-19 from June 26 till date were added to the toll. The delay in reporting deaths has been attributed to hospital staff being overworked and limited means of communication during lockdown.Municipal Commissioner IS Chahal said, “This is a continuous, ongoing process of reconciliation of hundreds of hospitals in Mumbai, [being done] in a very transparent manner by unearthing past deaths of March to June.”An officer from BMC’s health department said, “It is not only late reportage from hospitals. There are a lot of factors. Some deaths that occurred in Mumbai are of persons residing outside of Mumbai in the jurisdiction of nearby municipal corporations,” said an officer from BMC’s health department.According to BMC’s daily press release, 69 deaths were added on July 1, over and above that day’s death toll. Similarly, 57 additional deaths were recorded on June 30; 71 on June 27; 64 on June 28; 64 on June 27; 73 on June 26; 40 on June 25; 82 on June 24; 65 on June 23; 46 on June 22; 61 on June 20; and 59 on June 19. These figures were reported apart from the daily figure of deaths that occurred in the previous 48 hours.On June 16, the state had added 862 deaths to Mumbai’s Covid-19 death toll (1,328 reconciled Covid-19 deaths were added to the state’s death toll). Following criticism for this reconciled figure, BMC had clarified on June 6 that the municipal commissioner had carried out a thorough investigation after a private hospital reported 17 deaths to BMC on a single day even though 16 of these were from earlier dates. Subsequently, on June 8, all private and public hospitals were instructed to reconcile the numbers of the dead and submit these within 48 hours.A senior civic officer said, “After hospitals reported pending deaths, the death audit committee examined them and took a final call on whether they are deaths due to Covid-19. As and when the audit committee confirmed the figures, they were added to BMC’s daily press release.”Dharavi has become an international role model: CM A day after the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised efforts taken to tackle the spread of Covid-19 in Dharavi along with other areas, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the Dharavi slums have emerged as a “global role model” for containing the spread of the virus“Dharavi is an inspiration for the world on how to curb the spread of a pandemic,” he said in a statementThe CM also praised the integrated efforts taken by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, NGOs and Dharavi locals, and congratulated them, calling it a success of their efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-s-covid-toll-jumps-to-5-244-with-751-past-deaths-added-in-june-july/story-TMhUITW5MlDwc7Vz53pCFK.html

The turtles have been taken to the turtle rescue centre in Dahanu.Rahul Marathe, assistant conservator of forest (ACF), Dahanu, said, “We were informed by the fishermen that they rescued the turtles at Chikale village in Dahanu. All the turtles were injured. We reached the spot and took them to our centre where they are being treated. So far, we have rescued 41 injured turtles in June and July, and all of them are at our centre.” He added that a huge number of injured turtles wash ashore due to the moderate and heavy rainfall. He said the turtles get injured while combatting high waves.Marathe said Olive Ridley turtles, which are found along the coasts of Kelwe, Mahim, Tembhi, Shirgaon in Palghar, and Rajodi, Vasai to Zai in Dahanu, either get injured by trawlers or get entangled in fishing nets. The injured turtles will be released in the sea after treatment, when the conditions improve in August-September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dahanu-fishermen-rescue-10-injured-turtles-moved-to-forest-dept-centre-for-treatment/story-6qTDWrZ1KUM3lhqrIVmcdO.html
12-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab: 50-beded hospitals owned by docs out of Clinical Establishments Act||After uproar by private hospitals over the Clinical Establishment Act, implemented from July 1, to regulate the functioning of more than 50-beded private hospitals, the government has decided to keep the health facilities owned individually by doctors out of the purview of the Act.“The government has decided to keep hospitals having more than 50 beds owned by doctors out of the purview of the Act. A formal amendment in the Act will be done in the next assembly session,” Punjab health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said. The Punjab cabinet had in May notified the Punjab Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Ordinance, 2020, applicable to clinical establishments having more than 50 beds. The ordinance provides registration and regulation of clinical establishments in a professional manner to ensure compliance of clinical standards and protocols and transparency in the functioning of these establishments for fair and proper delivery of health services to the common man.Terming the ordinance “anti-doctor” and “anti-public”, the Punjab chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) held state-wide protests on June 23 and shut hospital OPDs leaving the patients in the lurch. As per provision of the Act, the newly formed Punjab State Council, different from Punjab Medical Council, will regulate the functioning in these hospitals and would formulate rules and regulations, including insuring basic requirements in the hospital as per bed capacity and the professional fee being charged from the patients for a particular ailment.The health minister said the idea behind regulating the fee and infrastructure through the Clinical Establishments Act was aimed at the hospitals against whom the department has received of complaints of overcharging.Initially the government was not ready to soften its stand and all meetings of the IMA representatives with the government failed to reach any consensus. Following this, the IMA had threatened to go on strike amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “We had been busy convincing the government that the hospitals owned by the doctors are not purely into profiteering business and there is a huge difference in the treatment charges in these hospitals as compared to facilities being run by business managements,” said IMA’s Punjab chapter president Dr Navjot Dahiya.The IMA claims that doctors individually are already being governed by the Punjab Medical Council and he or she is liable for penalty and action by the council in case found involved in any unethical practice.“The IMA is of the view that government should regulate functioning of all private hospitals, big or small, being run by non-doctors, but why to create unnecessary inspector raj when we are already being governed by so many laws,” Dahiya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-50-beded-hospitals-owned-by-docs-out-of-clinical-establishments-act/story-rETK0javZ8kFTjFiMZvjvN.html

Thane district collector has also extended lockdown in rural areas and talukas, which do not come under any municipal corporations, till July 19.The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), which had earlier announced a 10-day lockdown from the midnight of July 3 till July 13, has extended it by six days till midnight of July 19. This comes as the city crossed the 9,000-case mark on Saturday. With 253 new cases and eight new deaths, the case count in the city is 9,132 and death toll 292.NMMC commissioner Annsaheb Misal said, “It has become necessary to extend the lockdown to control the spread of the pandemic in the city, and to take requisite action and precautions. Only health and essential services will be permitted. All the rules and regulations will continue as per the present 10-day lockdown order.”NMMC had ordered departmental stores and dental clinics to shut down during the lockdown and had only allowed home delivery for essential goods.Similarly, the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) also extended its lockdown till July 22. UMC commissioner Raja Dayanidhi, in a notification issued on Saturday, said all the restriction imposed during the 10-day lockdown will continue.“The lockdown will be imposed till 5pm, July 22.

Sanjeev Sane, president of the forum, said, “The corporation is not taking the situation seriously. The city has thousands of private practitioners who are sitting at home and can be roped in to resolve the scarcity of doctors.

12-07-2020||Mumbai||10-22% decline in rents for Mumbai’s luxury apartments after lockdown||The Covid-19 outbreak has resulted in decline of rents charged for high-end luxury apartments across the city by around 10-22% from what was being quoted before the Covid-19 outbreak.For instance, the rent for a 5-BHK (bedroom-hall-kitchen) flat at Planet Godrej building in Mahalaxmi has come down to ₹3.60 lakh per month, from ₹4 lakh-₹4.25 lakh charged four months ago. In close proximity is the Raheja Vivarea complex at Mumbai Central, where a 3-BHK flat which used to be available for a monthly rent of ₹3.50 lakh in March is now being offered for ₹3-lakh rent.Another well-known complex, Parel’s Ashok Towers, is also witnessing a decline in its rental prices. Before the lockdown, a 2-BHK flat in the complex would command a rental price of ₹1.25 lakh, but now flats are available for a monthly rent of ₹1 lakh. At Lodha Park, Worli, a 3-BHK house which used to be leased for ₹1.50 lakh four months ago, is now being given for ₹1.25 lakh per month. The rent for a 2-BHK apartment at L&T Realty’s signature project Crescent Bay is now ₹75,000 per month. Four months ago, tenants had to shell out ₹85,000 every month as rent for a flat.The situation is no different in the suburbs either. The monthly rent for a 4-BHK apartment at Oberoi Sky Heights in Andheri is now being quoted at ₹2.75 lakh against the ₹3.50 lakh priced before the Covid-19 outbreak.Owners have attributed the decline in the rates to job losses, salary cuts, and losses in businesses as well as oversupply of rental apartments. For years, these gated communities commanded high rentals owing to the sheer number of amenities and open spaces in their premises. Most of these apartments were rented by high-level executives working with multinational companies as well as by entrepreneurs. However, the Covid-19 outbreak has resulted in loss of incomes and hence many are resorting to renting on lower rentals.Mustafa Chhil, one of the partners in Kamna Estates, which specialises in renting luxury apartments, said owners are being “practical” in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.“Luxury apartment owners have realised that there is no point in waiting for higher rents and are ready to lease out at discounted rates. The high-level executives are now facing salary cuts, resulting in the decrease of their disposable incomes. Also, the insecure job market has made the executives reluctant to take apartments on such higher prices,” said Chhil.Real estate data analytics firm Liases Foras attributes the decline in the rents to the oversupply in the luxury homes market. “After the lockdown, many investors have now put their apartments on rent to generate some income from their properties, as they have realised that they will not be able to sell the flats,” said Pankaj Kapoor, founder and managing director, Liases Foras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/10-22-decline-in-rents-for-mumbai-s-luxury-apartments-after-lockdown/story-FBN1vUnSzjItIyex7rXhOM.html

A medical store inside a reputed hospital in Mumbai is also under the scanner after the two arrested accused — Sonu Darshi, 25, who works in a medical shop in Mira Road, and his aide Rodriques Raul, 31 — alleged they got the drugs from the said hospital to sell in the black market. A social worker from Thane, Dr Binu Verghese, tipped off the police about the duo selling remdesivir for around ₹20,000 for one vial while the retail price is ₹5,400. “Following that tip-off, we sent Verghese as a decoy customer. At first, the accused asked for ₹30,000 per vial, but later settled for ₹20,000. They said the drug was being sold in black market from a medical store of a reputed hospital in Mumbai for ₹21,000 each, but they negotiated it to ₹20,000,” said senior inspector Sandeep Kadam.The police caught them in the act when they were handing over the vials to Verghese. “We arrested the duo under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955; Food Drug Administration Act, 1940; and Drug Price Control Act, 2013. They have been remanded in police custody till July 15 by the Thane court on Saturday. We are probing the accused’s statement that they had procured the medicines from a store inside a Mumbai hospital. The store was closed when we went there,” Kadam said, adding they are investigating the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pharmacist-aide-sell-remdesivir-for-four-times-its-price-held/story-SKZ31dAFKV4xf0qXfdaVaM.html

The court refused the bail even after the minor, the complainant in the case, and her mother sought to withdraw the complaint against the man.According to Antop Hill police who arrested the accused on January 20, the man repeatedly sexually assaulted the minor between 2015 and January 2020 whenever his wife would visit their hometown.The incident came to light after the minor narrated the ordeal to her friend, who then contacted the minor’s mother and told her about it. The minor then filed a complaint with Antop Hill police station.The accused in his bail plea claimed the daughter had filed a false case as he had refused to permit her to go out frequently. But the prosecution objected to the plea claiming that it was not a compoundable offence and rape of a daughter was a heinous offence.The court also considered the medical evidence collected by the police during investigation which supported contentions of rape on the minor. “The medical evidence shows direct involvement of the accused…The submission, that now the mother and the survivor want to withdraw the complaint saying the allegations are not true, is rejected,” the court observed while rejecting bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-accused-of-raping-minor-daughter-denied-bail/story-SuDDvWuRCOF807WczaKMzI.html

12-07-2020||Gurugram||DTCP calls for cancellation of property registries that lack NOCs||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has asked the district administration to cancel the registries of property deeds registered without no-objection certificates (NOC) from the department and initiate action against their holders. In a letter dated July 7, the director of DTCP said that the drive against illegal development was not effective due to the registration of such properties. In his letter, the director, Makrand Pandurang, stated that it was brought to his notice that registrations of sale deeds in the urban area notified under Section 7A of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 were taking place in Gurugram district without NOCs and the details of such registries had been sent to the office of the deputy commissioner, Gurugram. As per the rules, an NOC has to be obtained from the enforcement wing of DTCP to register a plot of land less than two-kanals in size to ensure that the land would not be sub-divided to create smaller plots as part of unauthorised colonies. The letter further said that the registration of such sale deeds without NOCs was resulting in widespread sub-division, leading to the development of unauthorised colonies. “As deputy commissioner-cum-registrar, it is incumbent upon you to ensure that such sale deeds do not get registered without an NOC from concerned DTP. Hence, you are requested to explore all possible legal mechanisms to undo the damage arising out of registration of such sale deeds, which are executed without obtaining NOC, including annulment/cancellation/withdrawal of such registrations or initiating judicial process etc [sic],” read the letter. Basti Ram, the district revenue officer, said that action has already been initiated against officials who have allowed registries in unauthorised areas. “We have also issued directions to all the sub-tehsils that no registry should be carried out without an NOC. We are also coordinating with the town and country planning department and will ensure that no violations take place,” he said, adding that they would take strict action against erring officials. A district administration spokesperson said that they have already designated a team of officials from the department of town and country planning (DTCP) to work in coordination with the revenue department at the tehsil-level to prevent these registries. “Officials of the DTP, enforcement, have been deputed tehsilwise for coordination in tehsils/sub-tehsils daily to ensure that no sale deeds are executed in contravention of rules,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-calls-for-cancellation-of-property-registries-that-lack-nocs/story-Y7yCeFed3DJfHbN9qgtRxJ.html
12-07-2020||Gurugram||MCG sets up thermal cameras at offices||After several of its officials tested positive for coronavirus, the municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has installed thermal cameras, which can detect body temperature, at three of its main offices in sectors 34, 42 and 39. It is also exploring ways to install the same at its Civil Lines office where they are currently facing technical difficulties.At the MCG main office in sector 34, two officials, one each from the audit and IT wing tested positive last month. Last week, three officials in the tax wing of MCG’s zone 3 office in sector 42 tested positive. The three included a zonal taxation officer (ZTO). Sector 39 is where its health department is located and although none have tested positive till now, they are at high risk of contracting the infection.In each case, the officials had attended their duties at these offices a day before the confirmation report.“A large number of MCG officials are deployed on the ground and engaged in various Covid-19 related work. Therefore, the possibility of them contracting the infection always remains high. In addition, a large number of them are also interacting with the public on a daily basis. Hence, to ensure their symptoms are detected at the earliest, thermal cameras have been installed at all important MCG offices,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.MCG officials have been also been deployed to transport patients who died of Covid-19 to the burial or cremation ground for last rites, collect data of those under home isolation, set up rapid antigen testing centres, collect biomedical waste, among others.As per officials privy to the matter, all staff members have been told, unofficially, that they will be permitted entry into MCG offices only after they are screened on the cameras. Earlier, officials were checked for temperature with hand-held infrared thermometers, which they said did not represent the most accurate results, and which also put the person checking it at risk.“The biggest advantage of a thermal imaging camera over a hand-held thermometer is that the former covers a larger surface area. Often, there are 3-4 officials entering the offices at once, and sometimes the person with the hand-held thermometer may miss a person entirely. With the thermal camera, the temperature of more than one person is measured at the same time. It ensures that no one can enter the office without their temperature being checked,” said an official privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-sets-up-thermal-cameras-at-offices/story-quBpNCtfeYGj9fjb2i9dyK.html

An eight-month-old girl, the woman’s child, was found crying in the room where the bodies were discovered, police said, adding that they are yet to ascertain the child’s identity.According to police, they received a call from the couple’s landlord around 11am on Saturday saying that he noticed a foul smell coming from the room that the couple had taken on rent and that he could hear a baby crying.“When we reached the spot, the room was found locked from inside. Upon breaking down the door, the man and woman were found hanging from a ceiling fan while the child was found crying nearby. The NGO managing Childline, a helpline for children, was contacted and the infant was taken to a private hospital for treatment,” said Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, station house officer, Sector 49 police station.Police said the child is critical due to complications from being without food for almost two days. “The doctors said that she is on ventilator support. Once she gets better, the matter will be presented to the Child Welfare Committee,” said Satya Prakash, programme manager, FXB India Suraksha, the NGO that manages Childline.Police said no suicide note was found at the spot. However, during investigation, police got to know that the man had eloped with the woman and her daughter from Bihar on July 4 and had rented the room in Noida on July 7. Bihar Police were already searching for them in connection with an abduction case filed after the child went missing. The matter will be handed over to them after the local probe, Noida police said.“From the condition of the bodies, it seems that the duo had taken their lives a day or two ago. Their bodies have been sent for autopsies and only the report will clarify the cause of death. It seems the child was left hungry since then. There is no evidence of foul play, or injuries on the body.

12-07-2020||Noida||Noida: Residents welcome cap on Covid treatment cost in private hospitals||Residents of Gautam Budh Nagar have welcomed the Uttar Pradesh government’s move to fix a price cap on the Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals. The residents had been requesting for such a move for a while.According to the guidelines, districts in the state have been divided in three categories. With GB Nagar being in category A, NABH accredited hospitals in the district will have to provide an isolation bed for a day at ₹10,000 for moderate sickness, ₹15,000 for ICU and ₹18,000 for ICU with ventilator. The prices include the personal protective equipment (PPE) cost, the order said.Though residents feel that the prices are on the higher side, the capping will be helpful in the coming days.“The residents had been pushing for such an action for a long time. More adjustments are needed, but it is the first step in the right direction. Apart from PPE kits, the government should also clarify whether medicines and other items are included in these prices,” said Amit Gupta, president of apartment owners’ association, Prateek Wisteria Sector 77.The residents feel that the capping will put an end to exorbitant prices being charged by private hospitals.“There have been incidents when patients received extraordinarily high bills for treatment. This is a good move. But sometimes hospitals keep on adding extra charges for tests, medicines, etc, and it should be clarified what the package includes. Also, it is important that these prices are strictly implemented. Otherwise, it won’t be beneficial to the common man at all,” said Col (retd) Shashi Vaid, chairman, Arun Vihar residents’ welfare association.Currently, the district has four private hospitals offering Covid-19 treatment -- Fortis, Kailash, Yatharth and Jaypee.A spokesperson for Yatharth hospital said that the prices fixed by the government include the cost of PPE, basic medicines and basic tests.“The new prices will be implemented. We have a dedicated premises for Covid patients, and will continue providing good health care,” said Dr. Kapil Tyagi, managing director, Yatharth.Jaypee hospital is also working to revise the price structure according to the new guidelines. “We have prepared a new structure and will implement it. We currently have 63 Covid-dedicated beds and will keep a multi-bed structure for now,” said a Jaypee hospital spokesperson.Fortis Hospital refused to comment on the issue, while spokesperson of Kailash Hospital did not respond to calls.Nepal Singh, additional chief medical officer of the district, said, “Action can be taken against those hospitals which don’t follow the set guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-residents-welcome-cap-on-covid-treatment-cost-in-private-hospitals/story-UgViNuXkyXHGR9vOIVTzQP.html
12-07-2020||Pune||After resentment and chaos over lockdown, Pune civic chief’s transfer catches city by surprise||Just when Pune was coming to terms with announcement about 10-day lockdown starting Monday, Maharashtra government on Saturday transferred Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad. Vikram Kumar, who is serving as chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), will be the new civic chief. Gaikwad has been posted again as sugar commissioner, a position he was serving before joining as municipal commissioner in January this year. Kumar, a 2004 batch IAS officer, on the other hand has served in various capacities, including CEO of Maharashtra Maritime Board before taking charge in PMRDA in 2019.The bureaucratic reshuffle in Pune came when Covid-19 cases in city have reached 26,904 as 827 fresh cases were reported on Saturday. The rising cases forced administration to announce lockdown, prompting sharp reactions from business community and political circles as many were looking to make up losses in business.The announcement about lockdown, which according to officials, will be far more stricter, hasn’t gone down well among residents too as they rued the “flip-flop” approach as it came just days after chief minister announced “mission begin again”.Puneites on Saturday stepped out in large numbers to stock grocery and vegetable after the lockdown announcement was made. As a result, prices of essential commodity like vegetables went up.As the administration declared that grocery shops and vegetables sale will be shut during the first phase, fear of shortage gripped many parts with citizens coming out for panic shopping. “I stepped out at 7 am first to fill up petrol in my car and then headed to D-Mart for grocery. However, I found that people had already gathered since early morning,” said Rahul Chavan, a banker residing on Pune-Satara road.Places like D-Mart and Grahak Peth, a cooperative departmental store, saw huge crowd, reminiscent of scenes during March and April when the Centre and state had announced lockdown.Several BJP leaders, including party national vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, city MP Girish Bapat and Shivajinagar legislator Siddharth Shirole said MVA government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has no concrete plan to deal with the coronavirus crisis.Industry bodies and associations in Pune and Pimpri–Chinchwad also opposed the state government’s decision to impose lockdown once again fearing that post restrictions since March will disrupt the industry and increase further losses for the companies and business establishments. PCMC MLA Mahesh Landge too has petitioned the state government seeking no lockdown for PCMC industries while Federation of Traders Association of Pune has stated the lockdown will result in huge losses causing tremendous financial and physical suffering to the business owners and their employees. The PCMC administration has already declared ten day lockdown in PCMC area as per the directions of the state government.Besides’ Gaikwad’s transfer, state government has also posted Saurabh Rao as officer on special duty at Pune divisional commissioner office while agriculture commissioner Suhas Diwase will be new chief executive officer at PMRDA. Rao was working as sugar commissioner in Pune. Another bureaucrat Jitendra Dudi serving as project officer, Integrated Tribal Development Project and assistant collector, Manchar sub division in Pune has been appointed as chief executive officer of Sangli zilla parishad||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-resentment-and-chaos-over-lockdown-pune-civic-chief-s-transfer-catches-city-by-surprise/story-Yb8HgiJiNPuYS95tBfrNUL.html
12-07-2020||Pune||State transfers Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad||In a major reshuffle, the Maharashtra government on Saturday transferred the Pune Municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad as sugar commissioner. Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) metropolitian commissioner Vikram Kumar replaces Gaikwad as the new municipal commissioner.Vikam Kumar said, “Pune municipal commissioner is a challenging post. I will try to take stakeholders into confidence and sort out the issues. My first priority to bring down Covid-19 cases in the city. I will take charge either tomorrow or Monday.”Gaikwad was appointed as municipal commissioner in January 2020 and served for hardly six months. Officials on condition of anonymity claim that the sudden transfer is because of his opposition to lockdown.Before the state and central government’s official announcement, he was in favour of unlocking the city.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in a meeting called on Friday to review the Covid-19 situation in Pune had taken the decision for 10-day lockdown beginning Julu 13. Gaikwad expressed his views about not introducing the lockdown at the meet.After joining as municipal commissioner, Gaikwad took a different stand on Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) terming as not useful and asked for the project’s review.As part of the Covid prevention measure, he acquired many private hospitals and created Covid care centers in the city. He scaled up the bed capacity up to 18,000 in the city during the last three months.Both Kumar and Gaikwad could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Vikram Kumar was appointed as a Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) metropolitan commissioner in March 2019.A 2004 batch IAS officer, Kumar before joining as PMRDA metropolitan commissioner, was chief executive officer of Maharashtra Maritime Board.As per the instructions by Ajit Pawar, almost 12 IAS officers were working under Gaikwad for handling the Covid-19 situation. Many senior IAS officers who earlier served as municipal commissioner were also appointed to help the Gaikwad.Gaikwad shifted to the official PMC bungalow a week before and now again need to vacate it. Gaikwad shifted after the previous municipal commissioner Saurabh Rao vacated the place. Before joining as municipal commissioner, Gaikwad was posted as sugar commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-transfers-pune-municipal-commissioner-shekhar-gaikwad/story-MzV80mmRXHd0HMg22XtnEK.html
12-07-2020||World||UK-China ties freeze with debate over Huawei, Hong Kong||Only five years ago, then-British Prime Minister David Cameron was celebrating a “golden era” in U.K.-China relations, bonding with President Xi Jinping over a pint of beer at the pub and signing off on trade deals worth billions.Those friendly scenes now seem like a distant memory.Hostile rhetoric has ratcheted up in recent days over Beijing’s new national security law for Hong Kong. Britain’s decision to offer refuge to millions in the former colony was met with a stern telling-off by China. And Chinese officials have threatened “consequences” if Britain treats it as a “hostile country” and decides to cut Chinese technology giant Huawei out of its critical telecoms infrastructure amid growing unease over security risks.All that is pointing to a much tougher stance against China, with a growing number in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party taking a long, hard look at Britain’s Chinese ties. Many are saying Britain has been far too complacent and naive in thinking it could reap economic benefits from the relationship without political consequences.“It’s not about wanting to cut ties with China. It’s that China is itself becoming a very unreliable and rather dangerous partner,” said lawmaker and former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. He cited Beijing’s “trashing” of the Sino-British Joint Declaration — the treaty supposed to guarantee Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy when it reverted from British to Chinese rule — and aggressive posturing in the South China Sea as areas of concern.“This is not a country that is in any way managing itself to be a good and decent partner in anything at the moment. That’s why we need to review our relationship with them,” he added. “Those who think this is a case of separating trade from government … you can’t do that, that’s naïve.” Duncan Smith has lobbied other Tory lawmakers to cut Huawei out from Britain’s superfast 5G network. Not only that: He says all existing Huawei technology in the U.K. telecoms infrastructure also needs to be eliminated as soon as possible.The company has been at the center of tensions between China and Britain, as U.K. officials review how the latest U.S. sanctions — imposed over allegations of cyber spying and aimed at cutting off Huawei’s access to advanced microchips made with American technology — will affect British telecom networks.Johnson decided in January that Huawei can be deployed in future 5G networks as long as its share of the market is limited, but officials have since hinted that that decision could be reversed in light of the U.S. sanctions. A new policy is expected within weeks.Huawei says it is merely caught in the middle of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. It has consistently denied allegations it could carry out cyber espionage or electronic sabotage at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party.“We’ve definitely been pushed into the geopolitical competition,” Vice President Victor Zhang said Wednesday. U.S. accusations about security risks are all politically motivated, he said.Nigel Inkster, senior adviser to the International Institute for Strategic Studies and former director of operations and intelligence at Britain’s MI6 intelligence service, said the issue with Huawei was not so much about immediate security threats. Rather, he said, the deeper worry lies in the geopolitical implications of China becoming the world’s dominant player in 5G technology.“It’s less about cyber espionage than generally conceived because, after all, that’s happening in any place,” he said. “This was never something of which the U.K. was lacking awareness.” Still, Inkster said he’s been cautioning for years that Britain needed a more coherent strategy toward China that balances the economic and security factors.“There was a high degree of complacency” back in the 2000s, he said. “There was always less to the ‘golden era’ than met the eye.” Britain rolled out the red carpet for Xi’s state visit in 2015, with golden carriages and a lavish banquet at Buckingham Palace with Queen Elizabeth II. A cyber security cooperation deal was struck, along with billions in trade and investment projects — including Chinese state investment in a British nuclear power station. Cameron spoke about his ambitions for Britain to become China’s “best partner in the West.” Enthusiasm has cooled significantly since. The English city of Sheffield, which was promised a billion-pound deal with a Chinese manufacturing firm in 2016, said the investment never materialized. Critics have called it a vanity project and a “candy floss deal.” Economic and political grumbles about China erupted into sharp rebukes earlier this month when Beijing imposed sweeping new national security laws on Hong Kong. Johnson’s government accused China of a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and announced it would open a special route to citizenship for up to 3 million eligible Hong Kong residents.That amounts to “gross interference,” Chinese Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said. Liu also warned that a decision to get rid of Huawei could drive away other Chinese investment in the U.K., and derided Britain for succumbing to U.S. pressure over the company.Rana Mitter, an Oxford history professor specializing in China, said that the security law — combined with broader resentment about Chinese officials’ handling of information about the coronavirus — helped set the stage for a perfect storm of wariness among Britain’s politicians and the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-china-ties-freeze-with-debate-over-huawei-hong-kong/story-vOFZIdXpq5LODBPS31FQQP.html
12-07-2020||World||Man charged in Florida church arson attack||A man accused of setting a Florida church on fire was being held without bail Sunday on charges that include attempted second-degree murder and arson.The Marion County Sheriff’s Office charged Steven Shields, 23, on Saturday, hours after detectives say he plowed a minivan through the front door of Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Ocala, doused the foyer with gasoline and set it on fire, causing extensive damage.Several people were inside preparing for Mass when the attack occurred early Saturday, but no one was hurt.According to court documents, Shields told detectives he is mentally ill but had stopped taking his medication, the Ocala Star-Banner reported.Shields told detectives what he did was “awesome,” and he smiled and laughed, the affidavit said. He told detectives he was “on a mission,” called himself “king” and that he has problems with the Catholic Church and referenced passages in the Bible’s Book of Revelations.Services were being held Sunday in another part of the church.The Marion County Public Defender’s Office was closed Sunday and not accepting phone messages.Ocala is about 80 miles (about 130 kilometers) north of Orlando.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-charged-in-florida-church-arson-attack/story-97IbjU4dTTTPFpJdHXEBOK.html
12-07-2020||World||Florida reports largest, single-day increase in coronavirus cases||Florida shattered the national record Sunday for the largest single-day increase in positive coronavirus cases in any state since the beginning of the pandemic, adding more than 15,000 cases as its daily average death toll continued to also rise.According to state Department of Health statistics, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases, and 45 deaths were recorded.California had the previous record of daily positive cases — 11,694, set on Wednesday. New York had 11,571 on April 15.The numbers come at the end of a grim, record-breaking week as Florida reported 514 fatalities — an average of 73 per day. Three weeks ago, the state was averaging 30 deaths per day. Since the pandemic began in March, 4,346 people have died in Florida of Covid-19, the state says.Testing has doubled over the last month, going from about 25,000 tests per day to almost 50,000, but the percentage of people testing positive has risen even more dramatically. A month ago, fewer than 5% of tests came up positive on a daily average. Over the past week, the daily average exceeded 19%.About 10.7% of Saturday’s 143,000 tests came up positive. “I still think we need to increase our testing a little bit more,” said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins, adding that the state and local health departments should ramp up their contact tracing.Prins said that she’s still concerned about large crowds, gyms and some restaurants as being places of mass transmission. Reports of illegal clubs and raves in South Florida is also a worry, she said.“I really do think we could control this, and it’s the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we’re in a crisis, and we’re definitely not doing it,” she said. “I know people want to live their lives. There have been a lot of other times, people have made those sacrifices in order to benefit our society. It’s almost like a war effort. That’s what we need right now.”Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that his county’s hospitals will soon reach capacity but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care.“We still have capacity, but it does cause me a lot of concern,” he said.Throughout May and into June, the state reopened much of its economy with some restrictions — and the number of positive cases began rising, but it wasn’t until the last week that the daily death total began rising, too.Because of the increase in cases and the positivity rate, doctors have predicted a rise in deaths, saying the mortality rate usually increases two to four weeks later as some of those infected get sicker and eventually die. Health experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention’s nomination party for President Donald Trump will be held in Jacksonville in August.On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that even with the rising rates, he still wants the schools to reopen as scheduled next month, saying children have not proven to be vectors for the disease in states and countries where campuses are open. He said while each county will have to come up with procedures, depending on their local infection rate, not opening the schools would exacerbate the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students.“We know there are huge, huge costs for not providing the availability of in-person schooling,” he said. “The risk of corona, fortunately, for students is incredibly low.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-reports-largest-single-day-increase-in-coronavirus-cases/story-1ncHclIobvokS76eMa6TVJ.html

12-07-2020||World||Coronavirus spread, not politics should guide schools, doctors say||As the Trump administration pushes full steam ahead to force schools to resume in-person education, public health experts warn that a one-size-fits-all reopening could drive infection and death rates even higher.They’re urging a more cautious approach, which many local governments and school districts are already pursuing.There are too many uncertainties and variables, they say, for back-to-school to be back-to-normal.Where is the virus spreading rapidly? Do students live with aged grandparents? Do teachers have high-risk health conditions that would make online teaching safest? Do infected children easily spread COVID-19 to each other and to adults?Regarding the latter, some evidence suggests they don’t, but a big government study aims to find better proof. Results won’t be available before the fall, and some schools are slated to reopen in just a few weeks.“These are complicated issues. You can’t just charge straight ahead,” Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday during an online briefing.Children infected with coronavirus are more likely than adults to have mild illnesses, but their risk for severe disease and death isn’t zero. While a virus-linked inflammatory condition is uncommon, most children who develop it require intensive care, and a few have died. Doctors don’t know which children are at risk.“The single most important thing we can do to keep our schools safe has nothing to do with what happens in school. It’s how well we control COVID-19 in the community,” Frieden said. “Right now there are places around the country where the virus is spreading explosively and it would be difficult if not impossible to operate schools safely until the virus is under better control.”Zahrah Wattier teaches high school in Galveston, Texas, where cases and deaths have been spiking. Until the state recently said schools must reopen to in-person classes, her district had been weighing options many others are considering, including full-time online teaching or a hybrid mix.Wattier’s school has mostly Hispanic and Black students, many from low-income families; almost 70% qualify for free or reduced-cost lunches and many have parents who work in “essential” jobs that increase potential exposure to the virus. Online education was hard for many with limited internet access, and Wattier knows in-person classes can help even the playing field.But she’s worried.“My school has over 2,000 students. That’s over 2,000 exposures in a day,” she said. “It’s a lot to think about. It’s my job. It’s something I choose to do, it’s something I love. Now it comes at a really high risk.’’She also worries about her 2-year-old twins in day care and a 4-year-old who has asthma and is starting preschool. Her parents live with the family and they’re both high-risk.The American Academy of Pediatrics, whose guidance the Trump administration has cited to support its demands, says the goal is for all students to be physically present in school. But it says school districts need to be flexible, consult with public health authorities and be ready to pivot as virus activity waxes and wanes.“It is not that the American Academy of Pediatrics thinks this is a done deal because we have put out guidance,” said Dr. Nicholas Beers, a member of the academy’s school health council. “But what we do know is that we need to have a more realistic dialogue about the implications of virtual learning on the future of children. We have left whole swaths of society behind, whether it’s because they have limited access to a computer, or broadband internet,” or because of other challenges that online education can’t address.Following academy guidelines would mean big changes for most schools. Mask-wearing would be strongly encouraged for adult staff and students except the youngest. Desks would be distanced at least 3 feet apart; the CDC recommends 6 feet. Both the academy and the CDC suggest limiting adults allowed in schools, including parents, and canceling group activities like choir and assemblies. Staggered arrival and dismissal times, outdoor classes, and keeping kids in the same classroom all day are other options.President Donald Trump has threatened federal funding cuts for districts that don’t fully reopen. While most funding typically comes from state and local sources, experts say schools will need more federal funding, not less, to reopen safely. Masks, extra cleaning supplies or janitors, additional classroom space, mental health support for students and staff traumatized by the pandemic are among potential costs. And with more parents out of work, more children will qualify for federally funded school lunches.Lynn Morales, 49, teaches 8th grade English at a high-poverty public school in Bloomington, Minnesota. Her district is considering several options including in-person classes; a final decision is expected Aug. 1.Some colleagues are considering not returning to the classroom because their children’s day care centers aren’t reopening. Some say they won’t come back until there’s a vaccine.“I am concerned and it’s because of the age group,” Morales said. ‘’Middle school students ... are lovely and I love them, but they touch, they get close, they roughhouse. It is their nature. They’re 13 years old. They are defiant.”“If masks are required and a kid isn’t wearing a mask, is my job description going to be to chase down this kid and insist they wear a mask? And what if they don’t?’’She’s heard outrage from parents angry at the prospect of some schools not reopening or incredulous about sending kids back into classrooms.‘’There is no win-win,’’ she said. ‘’Teachers are used to being scapegoats. This is just a whole new level of anger.’’Dr. Emily Landon, a University of Chicago infectious disease specialist, is helping the university and a campus preK-12 school decide how to reopen safely.“Things are evolving from, ‘We can’t do it unless it’s perfectly safe’ to more of a harm reduction model, with the caveat that you can always step back” if virus activity flares, Landon said.Single-occupancy dorms, outdoor classes, socially distanced classrooms and mask-wearing by students and faculty are on tap for the university. Face coverings will be required at the school too. Policies may change depending on virus activity.She dismisses complaints from some parents who say masks are a loss of personal freedom.“It’s not harmful for your child,” she said. “If you see wearing masks as a loss of personal freedom, then you have to think the same of pants.”Dr. Tina Hartert of Vanderbilt University is leading a National Institutes of Health-funded study aiming to determine what role children play in transmitting COVID-19. Almost 2,000 families are enrolled and self-test every two weeks. The idea is to find infected children without symptoms and see how easily disease spreads within families. Results may come by year’s end.“If we don’t see significant transmission within households, that would be very reassuring,” Hartert said.She noted that in other countries where schools have reopened, evidence suggests no widespread transmission from children.In France, public schools reopened briefly before a summer break, with no sign of widespread virus transmission. Masks were only required for upper grades, but students stayed in the same classroom all day. Frequent hand-washing was mandatory. A better test will be when the new school year starts Sept. 1.In Norway, schools closed in March for several weeks. Nursery schools reopened first, then other grades. Children were put in smaller groups that stay together all day. Masks aren’t required. There have been only a few virus cases, said Dr. Margrethe Greve-Isdahl of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, but she noted virus activity is much lower than in the U.S.Kati Spaniak, a realtor in Northbrook, Illinois, says her five teenage daughters have struggled to cope with pandemic fears, school closures and deficits of online learning. She strongly supports getting kids back in the classroom, and all her girls will return to some form of that in the fall.It’s been hard for her high school senior, Kylie Ciesla. Prom, graduation and other senior rituals were canceled, and there were no good-byes. “Just to get ripped away from everything I’ve worked for 12 years, it’s really hard,” Kylie said.At college, classes will be in person, masks mandated and a COVID-19 test required before she can move into her dorm. Kylie isn’t sure all that is needed.“I hate that this thing has become so political. I just want the science. I want to know what we need to do to fix it,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-spread-not-politics-should-guide-schools-doctors-say/story-hVojoU5kxmoDqUnLpQ1BnM.html
12-07-2020||World||Donald Trump gives in, finally wears mask in public as Covid cases rise globally||President Donald Trump finally wore a mask, in public, during a visit to a military hospital Saturday, falling in line with the recommendations of his public health officials and experts.It was a navy blue mask with the golden presidential seal emblazoned on the left.“I’ve never been against masks, but I do believe they have a time and a place,” Trump told reporters shortly before leaving the White House for the Walter Reed military hospital just outside Washington DC in the adjoining state Maryland.Trump’s grudging capitulation came under mounting pressure from his aides, allies and critics, on a day when the cumulative total of Covid-19 infections in the United States climbed to nearly 3.25 million, with 61,352 new infections, and fatalities went up to 134,817 with with 685 more in the last 24 hours.The American president had refused to wear a mask in public — he did say he wore it once, out of public view though — triggering a political war about facial coverings, with many conservatives around the country following his lead. Many Republican-ruled states had refused to make it mandatory — such as Texas — until recently, when it was hit by a brutal spike.The United States federally introduced the use of masks, or any facial covering, in early April as a recommendation. But as the epidemic took hold of the country, states such as New York, which quickly emerged as the epicenter, made masks mandatory in public places. Other states followed at their own pace.But Trump’s top public health officials such as Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, members of the task force he set up to spearhead his administration’s battle agains virus, began recommending it urgently, along with social distancing measures, as the best bed to slow down the spread.President Trump had refused to wear masks in public interactions at the White House and outside, disregarding these urgent appeals. He and his campaign had even mocked Joe Biden, his presumptive Democratic rival for the White House in November, for wearing one.US states battling with the new surge in infections — deaths have been declining — are embracing masks more urgently than earlier. Texas, a Republican-ruled state, made masks mandatory in the first week of July and Arizona — also Republican-ruled state — has left it to its mayors to decide.Even some Democratic-led states have had their shares of mask problems. Louisiana, made masks mandatory Saturday. “Today, I am announcing a mandatory mask requirement for Louisiana, ordering bars closed to on-premises consumption and limiting indoor social gatherings to 50 total people,” John Bel Edwards. the governor, announced on twitter. The new measures go into effect Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-gives-in-finally-wears-mask-in-public-as-covid-cases-rise-globally/story-fu17we49eAPpvvuIJOhifI.html
12-07-2020||World||As coronavirus rages in US, New York guards against another rise||As coronavirus rages out of control in other parts of the U.S., New York is offering an example after taming the nation’s deadliest outbreak this spring — while also trying to prepare in case another surge comes.New York’s early experience is a ready-made blueprint for states now finding themselves swamped by the disease. It could also come in handy at home, as the region readies for a potential second wave of infection that experts predict will likely come at some point.Gov. Andrew Cuomo has offered advice, ventilators, masks, gowns and medicine to states dealing with spikes in cases and hospitalizations and, in some places, rising deaths. Some health care workers are heading to other states to help fight the virus, reciprocating the influx that gave New York hospitals some much-needed relief just months ago.At the same time, the Democratic governor has ordered travelers from more than a dozen states to quarantine for 14 days, while urging New Yorkers not to let up on wearing masks or social distancing.Yet with the virus tearing through the South and West, Cuomo warned Friday it would eventually rear up again in New York.“We’re doing everything we can,” he told WAMC radio, but “I can feel it coming.”A widely cited University of Washington model doesn’t project spikes — at least through its Nov. 1 time frame — in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, whose Democratic governors have coordinated on traveler quarantines and, earlier, some shutdown policies. But that doesn’t mean the densely populated tri-state area is in the clear.“We expect the virus to return in all of those states,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, head of the university’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “The question is one of timing.”As cases spiked in March and April, New York became the nation’s coronavirus nightmare, with New York City at the crux of it. Statewide, over 18,000 COVID-19 patients were in hospitals at one point in April. Daily deaths peaked at 799 in April, and have totaled over 24,000.Now, as states from Florida to Texas to California see new confirmed cases soar, hospitals fill up and daily death tolls hit new records, numbers have dropped precipitously in the tri-state region. New York reported six new deaths statewide Saturday, when hospitals were caring for a total of about 800 coronavirus patients.While New York has been gradually reopening, it also has been quietly preparing to handle another surge if it comes.After health workers in New York and elsewhere grappled with shortages of masks, gowns and other protective gear this spring, Cuomo said he would order hospitals to have a 90-day supply on hand. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city would build its own reserve of ventilators, protective equipment and coronavirus test kits, identifying local suppliers and manufacturers rather than looking to federal authorities or global markets.“We’ve learned a tough lesson that we have to create, and we have to protect ourselves,” said de Blasio, a Democrat, who also said the city would stockpile as many as 18 million shelf-stable meals.Others are preparing, too.Mount Sinai Hospital expanded from 94 intensive-care beds to 235 and converted an atrium and lobby into wards for less-critical patients at the height of the crisis. Now, it’s developing a coronavirus playbook of sorts, so clinicians will have how-tos immediately at hand, said Dr. Roopa Kohli-Seth, who oversees intensive care.New York’s nursing homes, which lost more than 6,400 residents to the virus, have set up wings to separate infected residents. They’re now required to test staffers weekly and have at least a two-month supply of protective gear. And they are no longer accepting recovering COVID-19 patients from hospitals, as the state initially directed them to do. They admitted over 6,300 patients before Cuomo reversed the policy under pressure May 10.“We know how to fight this virus now. We have the resources,” said Stephen Hanse, who heads an association of New York nursing homes.The health care system overall is better prepared now, said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiology professor.“The difference now is we know the capacity of this virus to rapidly spread to cause disease, its impact on the health care system and our needs in terms of testing, personal protective equipment, ventilators — all the other things we didn’t know six months ago,” said Lipkin, who is working with the city to test hundreds of thousands of people a week.New York has taken reopening relatively slowly — and braked, postponing the resumption of indoor restaurant service in New York City, after cases began surging elsewhere. Thousands of contact tracers have been hired to try to keep the virus in check. And mask-wearing has been widespread in the nation’s biggest city since a city recommendation and subsequent state requirement in April, while some other states have only recently started telling residents to don masks in public.Still, with more New Yorkers getting out and about and riding mass transit, and police taking a hands-off approach to enforcing mask and distancing rules after several violent clashes caught on video, experts worry it’s inevitable case numbers will spike.“I’m not sure how long this progress is going to hold,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the Pandemic Resource and Response Initiative at Columbia University.Rob Griffin, a professor of emergency management at the University of Albany, said the state needs to spell out rules for any future shutdowns, “so you don’t have to make a decision on the fly.”Some experts have said New York didn’t move quickly enough early on. New York City’s massive public school system closed March 16, and a statewide stay-at-home order took effect March 22.If such measures had been implemented by March 8, Columbia University researchers estimate about 17,500 lives could have been saved.To New York City’s elected public advocate, Jumaane Williams, the city and state responses to the crisis were frustratingly blind to foreseeable inequities.The city’s Black and Hispanic residents were hospitalized and died of the virus at more than twice the rates of whites and Asians, and people from very poor neighborhoods at twice the rate of residents of wealthy areas.Williams feels New York’s shutdown was too slow and limited, leaving too many workers — many of them people of color — obliged to commute to jobs that might not have been able to provide protective equipment. That can’t happen again, the Democrat said.“The big thing, for me, is to shut down swiftly, open up slowly and make sure there’s an infrastructure for communities we know are going to be impacted the most,” Williams said. “We learned lessons that we didn’t need to learn, and hopefully other people will, too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-coronavirus-rages-in-us-new-york-guards-against-another-rise/story-Fl56RpyxCyMPMe6zh1q46K.html
12-07-2020||World||After Harvard and MIT, Johns Hopkins sues Trump admin to block rule on foreign students||Johns Hopkins University has joined a growing list of prestigious higher education institutions in the US suing the Trump administration over its “cruel” decision not to allow foreign students to take online-only courses this fall semester.On Monday, the Trump administration announced new rules for international students for the upcoming fall semester (September to December) that requires them to take an in-person class to remain in the country. Many American universities have scaled back or eliminated in-person classes due to the raging Covid-19 pandemic.Johns Hopkins University (JHU) filed a lawsuit in federal court on Friday, pushing back against the Trump administration order that would abruptly rescind accommodations for online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic for the nearly 5,000 international students at the university and thousands more across the country.Johns Hopkins said the policy change sending international students back to their home countries if they don’t enroll in in-person classes, “suddenly and unexpectedly” plunged Johns Hopkins, and virtually all of higher education in the United States, into chaos.Hundreds of thousands of Indian students in the US will be affected by the decision of the Trump administration.According to a recent report of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), there were over 1,94,000 Indian students enrolled in various academic institutions of the US in January this year. The JHU’s complaint, filed in US District Court in Washington, D.C., seeks a temporary restraining order against the proposal by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), stating that it is “arbitrary and capricious,” unlawful, and a reversal of earlier guidance upon which months of careful planning is based.The Baltimore-based private institution joins other well-known schools such as Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of California system in filing litigation to stop the US government from enforcing the new rule.“The administration’s decision is gratuitous, cruel, and inimical to what this country is about,” JHU President Ronald J. Daniels said.“The university was left with no option but to bring an emergency lawsuit in federal court to stop the administration from pushing ahead with an illegal and unconstitutional directive that, if permitted to stand, would fundamentally undermine the educational freedoms and humanitarian values that animate higher education in our country,” he said in a statement.“This unjust and discriminatory attack on international students cuts to the core of our mission of education and research,” JHU Provost Sunil Kumar said.“It cannot be allowed to stand,” Kumar said.The ICE rule applies to holders of two types of visas, including F-1 visas, which allow nonimmigrant students to pursue academic coursework in the US.“The Trump administration’s sudden announcement upends that careful consideration. It accounts neither for the risks associated with switching to an all in-person approach, nor for the possibility that we may have no choice but to revert to all online classes if the pandemic takes a turn for the worse,” the JHU statement said.The Trump administration’s actions may force students to choose between increased exposure to a deadly virus and maintaining their visa status, the statement said, adding that the JHU will determine how it will execute its mission of research and education safely without government intervention.The virus has killed more than 134,000 people in the US and infected over three million others, making it the worst-hit nation.“The order came down without notice -- its cruelty surpassed only by its recklessness. It appears that it was designed purposefully to place pressure on colleges and universities to open their on-campus classrooms for in-person instruction this fall, without regard to concerns for the health and safety of students, instructors, and others,” Harvard University President Larry Bacow said while reacting to the ICE’s directive.The US has the largest international student population in the world, with more than 1 million of the nation’s higher education students, roughly 5.5 per cent of all college students in the US, coming from abroad, according to the nonprofit Institute of International Education.The US State Department said earlier this week that international students are welcome in the country, adding that the policy “provides greater flexibility for nonimmigrant students to continue their education in the United States, while also allowing for proper social distancing on open and operating campuses across America.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-harvard-and-mit-johns-hopkins-sues-trump-admin-to-block-rule-on-foreign-students/story-5JkJXF8huY1lZt6W9zJ49I.html

It corresponds to the safety of those vaccines that are currently on the market,” Lukashev told Sputnik.The further vaccine development plan is already being determined by the developer’s strategy, including the complexity of the epidemiological situation with the virus and the possibility of scaling up production, Lukashev added.“Sechenov University in a pandemic situation acted not only as an educational institution but also as a scientific and technological research center that is able to participate in the creation of such important and complex products as drugs ... We worked with this vaccine, starting with preclinical studies and protocol development, and clinical trials are currently underway,” Tarasov noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-sechenov-university-successfully-completes-trials-of-world-s-1st-covid-19-vaccine/story-Fj8MpR43zusjiYOriJy66L.html
12-07-2020||World||Iran blames bad communication, alignment for jet shootdown||A misaligned missile battery, miscommunication between troops and their commanders and a decision to fire without authorization all led to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard shooting down a Ukrainian jetliner in January, killing all 176 people on board, a new report says.The report released late Saturday by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization comes months after the Jan. 8 crash near Tehran. Authorities had initially denied responsibility, only changing course days later after Western nations presented extensive evidence that Iran had shot down the plane.The report may signal a new phase in the investigation into the crash, as the aircraft’s black box flight recorder is due to be sent to Paris, where international investigators will finally be able to examine it. It also comes as public opinion remains low over Iran’s government as it faces both crushing U.S. sanctions and vast domestic economic problems.The shootdown happened the same night Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting U.S. soldiers in Iraq, its response to the American drone strike that killed Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3.At the time, Iranian troops were bracing for a U.S. counterstrike and appear to have mistaken the plane for a missile. The civil aviation report does not acknowledge that, only saying a change in the “alertness level of Iran’s air defense” allowed previously scheduled air traffic to resume.The report detailed a series of moments where the shootdown of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 could have been avoided.The report said the surface-to-air missile battery that targeted the Boeing 737-800 had been relocated and was not properly reoriented.Those manning the missile battery could not communicate with their command center, they misidentified the civilian flight as a threat and opened fire twice without getting approval from ranking officials, the report said.“If each had not arisen, the aircraft would not have been targeted,” the report said.Western intelligence officials and analysts believe Iran shot down the aircraft with a Russian-made Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. In 2007, Iran took the delivery of 29 Tor M1 units from Russia under a contract worth an estimated $700 million. The system is mounted on a tracked vehicle and carries a radar and a pack of eight missiles.The report did not say why the Guard moved the air defense system, though that area near the airport is believed to be home to both regular military and bases of the paramilitary Guard.The report notes that the Ukrainian flight had done nothing out of the ordinary up until the missile launch, with its transponder and other data being broadcast.“At the time of firing the first missile, the aircraft was flying at a normal altitude and trajectory,” the report said.The plane had just taken off from Imam Khomeini International Airport when the first missile exploded, possibly damaging its radio equipment, the report said. The second missile likely directly struck the aircraft, as videos that night show the plane exploding into a ball of fire before crashing into a playground and farmland on the outskirts of Tehran.The report put the blame entirely on the crew of the missile battery. Already, six people believed to be involved in the incident have been arrested, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili reportedly said in June. He said at the time three had been released on bail while the other three remained held.In recent months, Iran has repeatedly delayed releasing the aircraft’s so-called black box, which includes data and communications from the cockpit leading up to the shootdown. The U.S., under international regulations, has a right to be part of the investigation as the plane involved was a Boeing.Iran is to send the black box to France on July 20, where Ukrainian and French experts are expected to examine it, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency recently reported. Iranian officials did not have the equipment on hand to read data from the box.The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians — including many Iranians with dual citizenship — and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. The route was popular with those traveling onward to Canada.After the assassination of Soleimani in the U.S. drone strike, millions came out for funeral processions in his honor across Iran. However, his burial — which also saw a stampede that killed dozens — came just as the Guard shot down the airliner, igniting public anger against a paramilitary force that answers only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-blames-bad-communication-alignment-for-jet-shootdown/story-ybFHxmUMncBMlUf9RdVxZP.html
12-07-2020||World||UK to spend $890 million on post-Brexit border preparations||With less than six months until the U.K.’s transitional membership of the European Union single market ends, ministers have announced plans to spend 705 million pounds ($890 million) on new border infrastructure.Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, in charge of the U.K.’s Brexit preparations, on Sunday insisted the U.K. would have everything in place for Jan. 1, 2021, when the existing temporary arrangement ends. The U.K. and EU have yet to agree on their future trading relationship.A leaked letter from Trade Secretary Liz Truss last week set out her department’s concerns about the government’s post-Brexit border plans, including an increased risk of smuggling and a possible challenge from the World Trade Organization. Speaking to the BBC, Gove said there was no disagreement in government and it was time to “get cracking on implementation.”Although Gove emphasized the “opportunities” he said would exist for U.K. businesses outside the EU, ministers are now preparing them for increased costs. A new government website offers advice on how to hire a business with a base inside the EU to handle the new customs bureaucracy that will be involved in moving goods across the English Channel.The government’s new border arrangements will focus on smart infrastructure, Gove said, without elaborating further.The government has purchased a 27-acre site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the port of Dover for “holding” delayed goods vehicles, The Guardian reported Friday. “It’s not the intention to create a massive concrete lorry park,” Gove told the BBC.The U.K.’s plans for its border with Ireland will be published later this month, according to Gove. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted there will be no checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, Gove said there would probably be “one or two rather simple processes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-spend-890-million-on-post-brexit-border-preparations/story-MqA2AjlnfuNp3ypWMvFZ7K.html
12-07-2020||World||Lanka polls: Election rallies of president, PM cancelled temporarily after spike in Covid-19 cases||All election rallies of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa have been cancelled temporarily, the SLPP announced on Sunday, following a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.The parliamentary elections in the island nation are scheduled for August 5. The country has so far reported 2,511 Covid-19 cases and 11 deaths. All election rallies of President Gotabaya and Prime Minister Mahinda scheduled for July 12, 13 and 14 have been cancelled, the Sri Lanka People’s Party (SLPP) said in a press release. The announcement came as the country recorded a jump in Covid-19 cases since the middle of this week. Sri Lanka on Friday recorded its highest single-day spike of 300 coronavirus cases in a rehabilitation centre for drug addicts in the north central region. Fifty-seven more cases were reported on Saturday.  Sri Lanka’s top election official had also expressed concern over the delay in enforcing the Covid-19 health guidelines for the August 5 parliamentary elections, warning that candidates and supporters were defying measures to contain the spread of the disease which could endanger public safety.Mahinda Deshapriya, Chairman of the National Election Commission, said the health guidelines for conducting the elections were announced on June 2 but they have not been legalised through a gazette notification.The health guidelines require wearing face masks, frequent hand washing and maintaining one-metre distance. The number of people at poll campaign gatherings has also been reduced to a bare minimum. President Gotabaya on March 2 dissolved the Parliament, six months ahead of schedule, and called for snap polls on April 25. However, the election commission in mid-April postponed the elections by nearly two months to June 20 due to the coronavirus outbreak in the island nation. The commission last month informed the apex court that the polls cannot be held on June 20 because of the coronavirus pandemic and the new date was decided following a unanimous decision reached between the members of the commission.There are over 16 million eligible voters in the country. The August 5 poll will elect a 225-member Parliament for a five-year term.Meanwhile, the ministry of education said schools would be closed again if adequate Covid-19 preventive measures are not taken by the respective school authorities. Schools were reopened last week in the country. The Sri Lanka Medical Association has also expressed concern over the “blatant lack” of measures required to control the spread of the deadly virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lanka-polls-election-rallies-of-president-pm-cancelled-temporarily-after-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-EiWWYUOBTjhS0zis1zEP0L.html
12-07-2020||World||Masks, disinfectant, social distancing: Japan responds to floods amid Covid-19||Boxes of surgical masks, bottles of disinfectant and a sign saying “Please wear a mask” mark the entrance to a public gym in Yatsushiro city, a shelter for residents fleeing devastating floods in southwestern Japan this week.Elsewhere in the gym, cardboard partitions separate the 233 evacuees’ sleeping areas and another sign instructs them to check their temperature each morning, then sterilise the thermometers.The measures show what a thorny issue it is for Japan to deal with natural disasters in the time of coronavirus. Japanese authorities have been warning local officials for months to include coronavirus measures in their disaster preparations. Residents have been urged to seek shelter with friends or relatives if possible to avoid overcrowding evacuation centres.But coronavirus contagion was the last thing on the mind of 78-year-old retiree Aiko Ishimura when neighbours knocked on her door on Monday to tell her about evacuation orders.Ishimura, who lives alone, had planned to shelter at home.“So we just came as we were. We were in such a rush to come here, we didn’t bring anything,” Ishimura, who fled with neighbours, told Reuters. “I wasn’t worried at all about coronavirus, not at all.” “We don’t have many cases here in the first place. We don’t really do the whole mask-wearing thing,” she added, although she said she keeps a mask in her pocket.Kumamoto prefecture, where Yatsushiro is located, has had only 49 of Japan’s more than 20,000 coronavirus cases, according to public broadcaster NHK.That compares with close to 7,000 in Tokyo, where cases are on the rise again among its 14 million residents.Misa Matsuda, a 48-year-old nurse, accustomed to the annual floods in the region, had also intended to remain at home. But she was stunned early Monday when she opened her door and found the river flowing just a few feet from her house.“I thought, there’s no way the water would come up here to our house, where it’s a bit of a hill,” she said. Extreme weather disasters have become increasingly common in Japan recently. Last year, Typhoon Hagibis killed nearly 100 people, a year after more than 200 died in western Japan in the worst flooding in decades.Matsuda said she wasn’t too concerned about coronavirus because basic steps were being taken, but did worry residents would congregate to chat, creating just the sort of crowded conditions authorities say increase infection risk.City official Takanobu Ono said the evacuation centre was limited to 300 people despite a capacity for 500. But he said the priority for evacuees was escaping with their lives.“Some of have just been saved by the skin of their teeth,” he said. “The reality is that coronavirus is less of a concern for them ... So we’re taking the measures we have to, but haven’t been so strict about it.”About 60 people have died or were feared dead from floods and landslides triggered by torrential rains that have pounded the southwestern island of Kyushu, including Kumamoto prefecture, since Saturday. Extreme rain warnings were issued for parts of central Japan on Wednesday. Disaster experts said persuading people to evacuate early and find alternative shelters was vital, but agreed that convincing people to plan ahead was often tough.“We kept saying, ‘Check your hazard map,’“ said Masako Yoneda of the Japan Academic Network for Disaster Reduction, which issued an urgent warning on the topic in May. “But still, there are people who don’t check.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masks-disinfectant-social-distancing-japan-responds-to-disaster-amid-coronavirus/story-gxPiRdfoPcWUhbwwkwnWrK.html
12-07-2020||World||Coronavirus surge in Eastern Europe causes new restrictions||Countries in Eastern Europe are facing rising waves of coronavirus infections, leading to new restrictive measures such as the mandatory use of face masks in Croatia and travel bans or quarantines to be imposed by Hungary.Hungarian authorities said Sunday that they would put countries in three categories — red, yellow and green — based on their rate of new coronavirus infections, and would impose restrictions, including entry bans and mandatory quarantines, depending from which country people were coming from.“We see worrisome signs about an increase in the number of cases in the neighboring countries, Europe and the whole world,” said Gergely Gulyas, Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s chief of staff.Foreigners from countries in the red category — those with a high rate of infections, including Albania, Ukraine, Belarus and practically all of Asia, Africa and South and Central America — are banned from entering, while Hungarian citizens arriving from those locations will have to stay quarantined for two weeks or until they test negative twice, 48 hours apart.Both Hungarians and foreigners arriving from countries in the yellow category — which includes, among others, Bulgaria, Portugal, Romania and Sweden, as well as Britain, Russia, Serbia, Japan, China and the United States — will have to quarantine for two weeks, but will be allowed out if they test negative for the virus: once for Hungarians, or two negative tests 48 hours apart in the case of foreigners.Gulyas said the new rules would take effect Wednesday and would be reviewed at least once a week.Romania announced a new high of infections on Saturday, with 698, while 456 new cases were reported Sunday.Serbia reported 354 new infections on Saturday, although there have been increasing doubts about the accuracy of the figures. Officially, the country has over 18,000 confirmed infections and 382 deaths since March, with health authorities warning that Serbian hospitals are almost full due to the latest surge in cases.Croatia, whose Adriatic Sea coast is a major tourist destination, will make wearing masks mandatory in stores from Monday, while restaurant staff, but not patrons, will also have to wear face coverings.Infections are also on the rise in India, which has the most cases after the United States and Brazil, with a record surge of 28,637 cases reported in the past 24 hours as authorities announced a weeklong lockdown beginning Tuesday in the key southern technology hub of Bangalore, where the offices of top tech companies like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon are located.South Korea has also reported an uptick in infections around Seoul, its capital, and other major cities, with 44 new cases over the past 24 hours.The pandemic is also affecting elections in Europe.In Poland, which is holding a runoff presidential vote Sunday between conservative incumbent Andrzej Duda, and Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal, pro-European Union mayor of Warsaw, voters must wear masks and gloves, maintain social distancing and use hand sanitizer. They even can use their own pens to mark ballots. Ballot boxes are being disinfected regularly and the polling stations are ventilated.Similar safety measures have been put in place for elections in two northern regions in Spain, but authorities in both the Basque Country and Galicia have prohibited over 400 people who have tested positive for the virus from leaving their homes to vote. Spain’s Supreme Court backed the decision in a ruling Friday in response to a complaint by opposition parties in both regions.In the U.S., there has been an upturn in coronavirus deaths, driven by fatalities in states in the South and West, with the seven-day rolling average for daily reported deaths increasing from 578 two weeks ago to 664 on July 10 — still well below the heights hit in April — according to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.A coronavirus death, when it occurs, typically comes several weeks after a person is first infected. And experts predicted states that saw increases in cases and hospitalizations would, at some point, see deaths rise too. Now that’s happening.“It’s consistently picking up. And it’s picking up at the time you’d expect it to,” said William Hanage, a Harvard University infectious diseases researcher.Researchers now expect deaths to rise for at least some weeks, but some think the count probably will not go up as dramatically as it did in the spring.___Associated Press writers around the world contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-surge-in-eastern-europe-causes-new-restrictions/story-WH2R9AQ25D67VVsqDuCABP.html
12-07-2020||World||Over 200,000 vote in Hong Kong pro-democracy primaries||Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents turned up over the weekend to vote in an unofficial two-day primary election held by the city’s pro-democracy camp as it gears up to field candidates for an upcoming legislative poll.The primary was held two weeks after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on the semi-autonomous territory in a move widely seen as chipping away at the “one country, two systems” framework under which Britain handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997. It was passed in response to last year’s massive protests calling for greater democracy and more police accountability.Throngs of people lined up at polling booths in the summer heat to vote despite a warning last week by Hong Kong’s constitutional affairs minister, Eric Tsang, that the primaries could be in breach of the new national security law because it outlaws interference and disruption of duties by the local government.Organizers have dismissed the comments, saying they just want to hold the government accountable by gaining a majority in the legislature.The new law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs. Under the law, police now have sweeping powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and platforms to remove messages deemed to be in violation of the legislation.On Friday, police raided the office of the Public Opinion Research Institute, a co-organizer of the primaries. The computer system was suspected of being hacked, causing a data leak, police said in a statement, and an investigation is ongoing.Hong Kong’s pro-democracy camp, which includes multiple parties, is attempting to join forces and use the primaries as a guide to field the best candidates in the official legislative election in September. Its goal is to win a majority in the legislature, which is typically skewed toward the pro-Beijing camp.To hold the primaries, pro-democracy activists had raised money via crowd funding. They pledged to veto the government’s budget if they clinch a majority in the legislature. Under Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, the city’s leader must resign if an important bill such as the budget is vetoed twice.On Saturday alone, nearly 230,000 people voted at polling booths set up across the city, exceeding organizers’ estimates of a turnout of 170,000 over the entire weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-200-000-vote-in-hong-kong-pro-democracy-primaries/story-AkWfVSBRNQFcxdtvEReXNM.html

About a dozen people, most of them clinic staffers, were arrested and released on bail until trial, he said, in the first official conclusion on the cause of the blast.The clinic blast was one in a string of mysterious explosions, including at a military site near Tehran and a nuclear enrichment facility, to have rocked Iran in recent weeks, giving rise to suspicions of sabotage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tehran-police-say-blast-at-clinic-caused-by-staff-negligence/story-uMlU9mr5lX8UmSFMK7fmaL.html

The agitation had also crippled the landlocked country’s economy as supplies from India were blocked.The new Madhesi party can play a crucial role in Nepal’s political spectrum as pressure is mounting on Oli to quit the post of the prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-political-turmoil-may-get-new-twist-as-madhesi-party-gets-poll-panel-nod/story-MUHrGVA5url1wElZhpDaeP.html

Following favourable results in trials on primates, the next step is to manufacture doses for human trials, said Kiat Ruxrungtham, director of the Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University vaccine development program. “At first we were going to send them in June, but it was not easy to plan everything,” Kiat told a news conference. There are no approved vaccines for the virus that causes Covid-19, but 19 candidates are being trailed in humans globally. China is leading the race, with an experimental vaccine by Sinovac Biotech LtdThailand’s first facility should complete production in October and send the products to a second facility, which should finish by November, he said. Originally the earliest target was September, but Kiat said not enough vaccine can be ready by then.Facilities in San Diego and Vancouver will produce 10,000 doses for the trials for 5,000 people. The first group, aged 18 to 60, will receive different doses of the vaccine, he said.The trials will not accept volunteers “until we receive approval from the Thai Food and Drug Administration and an ethics committee,” Kiat said. Thai company BioNet-Asia is preparing its facilities for large-scale manufacturing if the trials prove successful, he said. “If everything goes according to plan, the vaccine will be ready for Thailand in the third or fourth quarter next year,” Kiat said. Thailand on Sunday had a total of 3,217 confirmed infections, with no local transmissions reported in over a month, and 58 Covid-19 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-plans-november-human-testing-for-potential-coronavirus-vaccine/story-WRlguUzYf00obohIBVGIdO.html
12-07-2020||World||Dalai Lama is welcome to visit Taiwan, says foreign ministry||Taiwan would welcome a visit by exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, its foreign ministry has said, adding that any invitation would be handled under “relevant rules” if a request to visit is received, reported Radio Free Asia, a US-funded international broadcasting corporation.The Dalai Lama is “welcome to come to Taiwan again to propagate the Buddhist teachings,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said on Monday, adding that an application by the Dalai Lama to visit would be handled “in accordance with the principle of mutual respect and at a time of convenience for both sides.”A visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama would be his first since 2009 and would certainly anger Beijing, which claims self-governing Taiwan as a renegade province and regards the Tibetan spiritual leader as a dangerous separatist intent on splitting Tibet from Chinese rule.“As the political scenario changes, it may be that I’ll be able to visit you in Taiwan again soon. I hope so,” the Dalai Lama said in a video message sent to supporters in Taiwan on the occasion of his birthday, July 6, and referring apparently to recent moves by the country’s president Tsai Ing-wen to further distance from China.“Whatever happens, I’ll remain with you in spirit,” the Dalai Lama said.Greetings and well wishes poured in from around the world on Sunday, the Dalai Lama’s 85th birthday, with Tibetans in Tibet defying Chinese prohibitions on celebrations by offering prayers and posting images of the revered spiritual leader online.Western politicians and foreign dignitaries including former US President George Bush, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Nobel laureates, and European politicians meanwhile sent video messages voicing admiration and support.“The esteem in which you are held by the people of the United States is a demonstration of the deep and enduring affinity between Americans and Tibetans,” said US Ambassador to India Kenneth Ian Juster in a statement at celebrations held in Dharamsala, India, by Tibet’s government-in-exile, the Central Tibetan Administration.“I believe the warm feelings between Americans and Tibetans spring in part from the recognition that yours is a just and noble struggle--a struggle to secure for your people the same self-evident and unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that our Founding Fathers enshrined in the Declaration of Independence,” Juster said.The Dalai Lama fled Tibet into exile in India in the midst of a failed 1959 Tibetan national uprising against rule by China, which marched into the formerly independent Himalayan country in 1950. Since then he has been living in Dharamsala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dalai-lama-is-welcome-to-visit-taiwan-says-foreign-ministry/story-kRkJFSN5mOvd9Ego8XdTDK.html
12-07-2020||World||On fifth attempt, UN Security Council renews Syria aid via Turkey||The United Nations Security Council on Saturday approved aid deliveries to Syria through one border crossing from Turkey, a day after its authorization for the six-year-long humanitarian operation ended, leaving millions of Syrian civilians in limbo.The United Nations describes the aid delivered from Turkey as a “lifeline” for Syrians in the country’s northwest. The 15-member council had been deadlocked, with most members pitted against Syrian allies Russia and China, which abstained on Saturday in the council’s fifth vote this week on the issue.Veto-powers Russia and China wanted to halve the approved Turkey border crossings to one, arguing that the northwest of Syria can be reached from within the country. They also wanted to include language that Western diplomats said blamed unilateral sanctions on Syria for the humanitarian crisis.German UN Ambassador Christoph Heusgen told his Chinese and Russian counterparts to report back to their capitals that he had asked: “How those people who gave the instructions to cut off the aid of 500,000 children ... are ready to look into the mirror tomorrow.” Council members had also been split on whether to renew authorization for six months or one year. The short resolution finally adopted on Saturday, which was drafted by Germany and Belgium, simply authorized one crossing for one year.“Russia is consistently in favor of humanitarian deliveries to Syria with full respect of the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and with coordination of its legal government. This issue should not be politicized,” deputy Russian UN envoy Dmitry Polyanskiy said after the vote. Twelve members voted in favor, while the Dominican Republic also abstained. The successful vote came after two failed votes on Russian proposals and two vetoes by Russia and China of resolutions drafted by Germany and Belgium.Acting British UN Ambassador Jonathan Allen said after the vote that the loss of aid access through Bab al-Salaam border crossing would deprive “1.3 million people in northwest Syria of cross-border humanitarian assistance that they rely on.” Germany and Belgium said in a joint statement after the vote: “One border crossing is not enough, but no border crossings would have left the fate of an entire region in question.”When the Security Council first authorized the cross-border aid operation into Syria in 2014 it also included access from Jordan and Iraq. Those crossings were cut in January due to opposition by Russia and China. China’s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said China always had reservations about the delivery of cross-border aid, but given the current situation in Syria it does not object to retaining it “at this stage.” Though he added that “it should adjusted accordingly in light of the developments on the ground.”Russia has vetoed 16 council resolutions related to Syria since Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad cracked down on protesters in 2011, leading to civil war. For many of those votes, Moscow has been backed in the council by China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-fifth-attempt-un-security-council-renews-syria-aid-via-turkey/story-MSex90Fa9c8e3P7jNQiqPJ.html
12-07-2020||World||US scientists may have found path to increase human life||Scientists at a university in United States’ Southern California may have found the beginnings of a path needed to extend the lifespan of human beings.The research by a team from USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, published on July 10 by the Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences, shows the drug mifepristone can extend the lives of two very different species used in laboratory studies.Clinicians use mifepristone, also known as RU-486, to end early pregnancies as well as to treat cancer and Cushing disease.The study, Metabolic Signatures of Life Span Regulated by Mating, Sex Peptide and Mifepristone/RU486 in Female Drosophila, also suggests that the findings may apply to other species, including humans.John Tower, a professor of biological sciences at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and his team found mifepristone extends the lives of the female fruit fly Drosophila that have mated.Female fruit flies receive sex peptide from males during mating and previous research has shown that the molecule causes inflammation and reduces the health and lifespan of female flies.Giving mifepristone to the fruit flies that have mated blocks the effects of sex peptide, reducing inflammation and keeping the female flies healthier, leading to longer lifespans than their counterparts who did not receive the drug, Tower and his team, including Gary Landis, a senior research associate and the lead researcher on the study, found.The drug’s effects in Drosophila appear similar to those seen in women who take it.“In the fly, mifepristone decreases reproduction, alters innate immune response and increases life span,” Tower said. “In the human, we know that mifepristone decreases reproduction and alters innate immune response, so might it also increase life span?” Tower was quoted as saying by News Medical, an open-access medical and life science hub.The team looked at the genes, molecules and metabolic processes that changed when flies were fed the drug to seek a better understanding of how mifepristone works to increase lifespan.They found that a molecule called juvenile hormone, which regulates the development of fruit flies throughout their life, from egg to larvae to adult, plays a central role. Sex peptide appears to escalate the effects of juvenile hormone, shifting the mated flies’ metabolism from healthier processes to metabolic pathways that require more energy. The metabolic shift promotes harmful inflammation and it appears to make the flies more sensitive to toxic molecules produced by bacteria in their microbiome, the study shows.When the mated flies ate the drug, their metabolism stuck with the healthier pathways and they lived longer than their mated sisters who did not get mifepristone. Tower has said that these metabolic pathways are conserved in humans and are associated with health and longevity, according to News Medical.Tower and his collaborators also gave the same drug to C elegans, a small roundworm, and found that mifepristone had the same life-extending effect on the mated worm.He said because Drosophila fruit flies and C elegans worms are relatively distant in terms of evolution, the similar results in such different species suggest other organisms, including humans, might see comparable benefits to lifespan.He said the fact that mifepristone can increase lifespan in both species suggests the mechanism is important to many species.“Our data show that in Drosophila, mifepristone either directly or indirectly counteracts juvenile hormone signalling, but the exact target of mifepristone remains elusive,” Tower said, according to News Medical.A clearer understanding of the intricacies of mifepristone’s actions is needed before drawing any firm conclusions, Tower added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-scientists-may-have-found-path-to-increase-human-life/story-eGmgfCwH7pAYs1lBCbV1AM.html
12-07-2020||World||China signals shrimp virus risk after salmon debacle||China said a handful of packaging samples of imported shrimp tested positive for the coronavirus, raising questions again over whether the pathogen can spread through food or frozen products.The virus tested positive on the outside of about five shrimp packages and the inside of one shipping container, said China’s General Administration of Customs. The samples were from three Ecuadorian plants, and imports from those processors will be halted, it said. A leading Ecuadorian shrimp exporter disputed the findings.“The test result doesn’t mean the virus is contagious, but reflects the loopholes in companies’ food safety regulations,” said Bi Kexin, director of the food import and export safety bureau in the customs department. “Customs will further strengthen control of the origins of imported cold-chain food.”China last month pointed to imported salmon as a possible culprit for Beijing’s fresh Covid-19 outbreak, sparking a boycott of the fish as supermarkets took the produce off their shelves. China also began mass testing of cold food imports at ports, and blocked shipments from meat plants abroad that reported infections among workers.Evidence suggests that it’s extremely unlikely for the virus to be transmitted through food, said Gorjan Nikolik, associate director of seafood at Rabobank.“It’s a typical food scare,” he said. “I expect them to be very short-lived.”The US Food and Drug Administration issued a fresh statement on the matter, saying there’s no evidence that Covid-19 is transmitted through food or food packaging.Ecuadorian shrimp exporter Santa Priscila questioned the findings and lamented the blow to the industry’s reputation, saying Chinese officials had refused to provide information on the testing in recent weeks.“They found one positive non-contagious test ‘inside the wall of the container’ as a result of 227,934 samples taken from the containers, that is 0.0000043%,” Santa Priscila President and founder Santiago Salem said in a statement.Low RiskChinese officials have also agreed with global experts that imported food poses a low risk of transmitting the virus. That’s led to confusion overseas over why China is continuing to test and halt shipments.The tests are “an important measure to prevent the risk of the virus being transmitted from imported cold chain food channels,” Bi said. “This is a necessary measure taken to protect the health of the people and does not interrupt normal international trade.”Employees in some countries are still working even after becoming infected with the virus, raising the risk of food contamination, Bi said. Because there are epidemic clusters at some overseas facilities, China halted meat imports from a total of 23 plants, including Brazil, the UK, the US and Germany, he said.For shrimp, China is a much bigger buyer than it is for salmon, Rabobank’s Nikolik said. Chinese purchases are on the same scale as the US and Europe, and Ecuador is a leading supplier, he said.Last year, Ecuador exported $3.2 billion of shrimp, including about $1.4 billion to China in shipments that take about three weeks to arrive.China’s customs authorities also tested a total of 227,934 samples and the rest of the samples were negative, it said. The samples which tested positive had been delivered to ports in Dalian and Xiamen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-signalling-of-shrimp-covid-19-risk-angers-ecuadorian-suppliers/story-UaOY1CUc1mlO1N8Q6X1NaO.html

12-07-2020||World||Covid-19: Thousands of garment workers lose jobs across Asia||Hundreds of thousands of garment workers in Asia, a vast majority of them being women, were suspended or laid off when the coronavirus pandemic struck as stores closed across North America and Europe.As per WallStreet Journal reports, millions of people belonging from various Asia’s developing countries relied on factories producing T-shirts, trousers for employment. But owing to the pandemic, the western brands canceled orders worth billions of dollars, leaving shipments of sweaters and jeans with no takers. As a result, hundreds of factories closed in waves across Asian industrial belts near Phnom Penh, Dhaka and Yangon.Click here for full Covid-19 updatesIn recent months, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Myanmar are the most affected countries in Asia as many workers have returned to their villages, cut back on food and borrowed money to survive.The Journal cites an example of Zin Mar Oo, 22, who had to lose her job in Myanmar after the South Korean-owned factory where she worked closed down operations in April. The owner has not been there seen since and left no word about the fate of the jobs or the factory, according to Oo, the country’s garment manufacturers body and the local labor-relations official.Oo, who didn’t finish high school, made USD155 a month by working in the garment factory located in the outskirts of Yangon. Her role was to check that clothes being made did not have crooked stitching lines or mismatched thread colours. Her income supported her mother and helped repay the family’s debt.These setbacks could be longer lasting than the disruption to shopping. The global fashion industry, which was already facing headwinds before lockdowns decimated sales, is in deep turmoil and is likely to be reshaped by the pandemic.“I don’t think this is a sector which is going to come back to the same point again,” said Rubana Huq, president of the top industry group for garment manufacturers in Bangladesh, among the world’s largest clothing exporters.Meanwhile, J.C. Penney Co., Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and J.Crew Group Inc. have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent months.Western companies are expected to turn more to “near-shoring”--moving some of their production to Turkey, Eastern Europe and North Africa for European markets, and to Mexico for North American markets, said Achim Berg, senior partner at McKinsey & Co. who advises global fashion and apparel companies.For countries with limited infrastructure and low-skilled workers, garment manufacturing has been a key economic engine. Operating sewing machines does not require much education or training, unlike car or smartphone production, and low wages help meet the West’s demand for inexpensive clothing.Clothes make up nearly 85 per cent of Bangladesh’s export earnings, and the sector employs four million people there. In Cambodia, one in five households has at least one garment worker, and 75 per cent of exports are garments, footwear and travel bags. Vietnam and India are also top exporters, according to estimates by the World Trade Organization.Before they moved to the industrial area on the outskirts of Yangon, Oo’s mother sold vegetables in their village market, earning USD2 a day. That meant that on some days, the family don’t even have enough for a full meal. Oo is now helping a local nonprofit make cloth face masks for a small wage while she hunts for job openings.Myanmar, which suffered years of underdevelopment, appeared on the radars of garment manufacturers around 2013, when the military junta that had been in control for decades was loosening its grip. The US and European Union lifted sanctions that had long deterred investment and granted duty-free access to their markets under a program designed to help the world’s least developed countries.Hundreds of factories owned by firms from China, South Korea and elsewhere set up to make clothes for Western brands, seeking to take advantage of the low wages compared with locations like China and Vietnam. Myanmar became a part of a global production network in which designs are created in one country, the textiles woven in another and clothes sewn in a third place.However, the coronavirus pandemic started disrupting the cross-border supply chain behind the shirts and dresses that fill store racks.Developing Asia will grow by just 0.1 per cent this year--the slowest rate in six decades, the Asian Development Bank estimates.Globally, the pandemic could increase the number of people who are extremely poor--living on less than USD1.90 a day--by 71 million to 100 million, estimates a World Bank study. This would be the first increase since 1998, and almost half of the projected new poor would be in South Asia, the bank said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-thousands-of-garment-workers-lose-jobs-across-asia/story-AIKoj37wwDIDudoEcxviuL.html
12-07-2020||World||Video calls, separate bedrooms: Bolsonaro’s first Covid-19 week||After months in which Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro downplayed COVID-19 by flouting social distancing recommendations and mostly shunning masks, both coronavirus precautions became part of his cloistered life this week at the official residence in capital Brasilia.Bolsonaro, 65, announced on Tuesday that he tested positive for the virus and had experienced fever, aches and malaise. He scrapped a trip he had planned to northeastern Piauí state, and all his meetings for the week were converted to video calls.One was with former congressman Roberto Jefferson, president of the conservative PTB party. Jefferson told The Associated Press that he went to the presidential Planalto Palace and sat in front of a large television where he could see Bolsonaro in a makeshift office at his residence.“I found the president well, flushed, willing. In very good health,” Jefferson said Saturday. “I only saw him cough once, when I made a joke.” Since his diagnosis, Bolsonaro has held virtual meetings almost every day with Jorge Oliveira, secretary-general of government, to sign official documents. According to Oliveira’s office, a protocol was created so work could be carried out digitally.This was also how Bolsonaro interviewed candidates to head the education ministry, he said on Facebook on Thursday. The following day, he named to the post Milton Ribeiro, a former deputy dean of Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo who preaches at a Presbyterian church in Santos, outside the metropolis.Only a few aides who were previously infected by the new coronavirus could get close to Bolsonaro during the week, one of them said on Tuesday. The person declined to be named, citing lack of authorization to speak with journalists. Bolsonaro also spent some time in the afternoons in front of the palace with photojournalists 400 yards away, on the other side of a garden. He had met his supporters by that garden until his diagnosis, but no longer.The new routine marks a stark change for Bolsonaro, who spent months attending rallies with his fans, heading out to bakeries and food trucks to mix and mingle. He sometimes declined to wear a mask. He has scoffed at the restrictions mayors and governors implemented to contain the spread of the virus, arguing their economic impacts would cause more suffering than the virus, which he repeatedly called “a little flu.” Bolsonaro took hydroxychloroquine pills for five days, Monday through Friday, according to a member of the presidential medical team who asked to not be identified, citing patient confidentiality and because the person isn’t authorised to speak publicly. The drug has no proven effect on the treatment of COVID-19 and can cause side effects such as cardiac arrhythmia, according to medical studies. As a result, Bolsonaro was subjected to electrocardiograms and blood tests, the person said.Brazil’s presidential press office said in a statement that the president has experienced no medical problems with his treatment.The aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said Bolsonaro slept in a different bedroom to keep the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, safe. He lives with her, his daughter and step-daughter.On Saturday, the first lady shared a photo of her COVID-19 test results showing she was not infected.“My daughters and I tested negative for COVID-19,” she wrote in the post on her verified Instagram account. “I appreciate the prayers.” On Thursday, Jair Bolsonaro held his weekly live broadcast on Facebook. This time, he was not accompanied by a minister or a sign language interpreter, as usual. Despite saying he felt well, he said he should still be isolated next week, so as to avoid contaminating anyone.“I’m sorry I can’t interact with you here. Not even next week will it be possible, because I think I will not yet be completely free of the virus, so I will not have anyone on my side here,” Bolsonaro said on the broadcast.During the broadcast, he wasn’t wearing a mask. But the aide said Bolsonaro now regularly wears the equipment to protect both his family and the more than 100 employees who work at the residence.

Melbourne, the capital of Australia’s second most-populous state, went under a six-week lockdown on Thursday after a spike in community-transmitted cases.“This is a dangerous time,” Victoria’s Premier Daniel Andrews told a news conference. “I know we are asking a lot of Victorians, but we simply have no choice but to acknowledge the reality that we face and to do what must be done, and that is to follow those rules, to only go out when you need to.” Sunday’s cases, the second highest for Victoria, home to a quarter of Australia’s 25 million people, follow a record 288 infections reported on Friday. The increase partly reflects increased testing, with the state conducting more than 30,000 tests daily. There have been multiple outbreaks of the virus, with cases recorded at some public and private hospitals, aged-care facilities, public housing complexes and supermarkets.A man in his 70s died over the weekend of Covid-19, Andrews said, taking the national toll to 108.Most primary and secondary school students in Melbourne will be learning remotely until at least Aug. 19, with exceptions for students with special needs, among others, the premier said.Australia’s other seven states and territories have banned travellers from Victoria amid concern that community transmission was causing a second wave of the virus.New South Wales, the most-populous state, recorded five new cases on Sunday, as it moved to charge all travellers flying in from overseas A$3,000 ($2,100) for a mandatory two-week quarantine in hotels. The decision to charge travellers, including Australian citizens, came after the federal government on Friday announced caps on the number of people arriving in Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-victoria-state-marks-week-of-triple-digit-coronavirus-cases/story-yjxteEwjvF8JD14omlqRcM.html
12-07-2020||World||UN approves aid to Syria’s rebel area through 1 crossing||Russia scored a victory for its ally Syria on Saturday by forcing the Security Council to limit humanitarian aid deliveries to the country’s mainly rebel-held northwest to just one crossing point from Turkey, a move that Western nations say will cut a lifeline for 1.3 million people.Russia argues that aid should be delivered from within the country across conflict lines, and says only one crossing point is needed.UN officials and humanitarian groups argued unsuccessfully — along with the vast majority of the UN Security Council — that the two crossing points in operation until their mandate expired Friday were essential for getting help to millions of needy people in Syria’s northwest, especially with the first case of COVID-19 recently reported in the region.The Security Council vote approving a single crossing from Turkey was 12-0, with Russia, China and the Dominican Republic abstaining.The vote capped a week of high-stakes rivalry pitting Russia and China against the 13 other council members. An overwhelming majority voted twice to maintain the two crossings from Turkey, but Russia and China vetoed both resolutions — the 15th and 16th veto by Russia of a Syria resolution since the conflict began in 2011 and the ninth and 10th by China.Germany and Belgium, which had sponsored the widely supported resolutions for two crossing points, finally had to back down to the threat of another Russian veto. The resolution they put forward Saturday authorized only a single crossing point from Turkey for a year.In January, Russia also scored a victory for Syria, using its veto threat to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution reducing the number of crossing points for aid deliveries from four to two, from Turkey to the northwest. It also cut in half the yearlong mandate that had been in place since cross-border deliveries began in 2014 to six months.Before adopting the resolution Saturday, the council rejected two amendments proposed by Russia, including one suggesting that US and European Union sanctions on Syria were impeding humanitarian aid. That contention was vehemently rejected by the Trump administration and the EU, which noted their sanctions include exemptions for humanitarian deliveries. It also rejected an amendment from China.Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, said after the vote that from the beginning Moscow had proposed one crossing — from Bab al-Hawa to Idlib — and that Saturday’s resolution could have been adopted weeks ago. He said Russia abstained in the vote because negotiations over the resolution were marred by “clumsiness, disrespect.”Polyansky accused Western nations on the council of “unprecedented heights” of hypocrisy, saying they were ready to jeopardize cross-border aid over the references to unilateral sanctions.He said cross-border aid to Syria’s northwest doesn’t comply with international law because the UN has no presence in the region, which he described as being controlled “by international terrorists and fighters” that make it impossible to control and monitor who gets aid.German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen retorted that while Russia talks about delivery of aid across conflict lines, “in practice it doesn’t” happen.He said his side fought to maintain multiple crossing points for aid, including the Al-Yaroubiya crossing point from Iraq in the northeast that was closed in January, because that is what is needed for efficient delivery of aid to millions in need — and he asked Polyansky “this is clumsy?”“This is what we tried to do over these past weeks, to get the optimum to the population,” Heusgen said.US Ambassador Kelly Craft told the council: “Today’s outcome leaves us sickened and outraged at the loss of the Bab al-Salaam and Al Yarubiyah border crossings.”“Behind those locked gates are millions of women, children, and men who believed that the world had heard their pleas. Their health and welfare are now at great risk,” she said.Still, Craft called the authorization of access through Bab al-Hawa for 12 months “a victory” in light of Russia and China’s “willingness to use their veto to compel a dramatic reduction in humanitarian assistance.”“This solemn victory must not end our struggle to address the mounting human needs in Syria — that fight is far from over,” Craft said.Belgium and Germany said in a joint statement that 1.3 million people, including 800 000 displaced Syrians, live in the Aleppo area, including 500,000 children who received humanitarian aid through the Bab al-Salam crossing — and now have that aid cut off.“Today is yet another sad day.

They looked the same at 3 pm as they did at 3 am,” said Wayne Fournier, mayor of the town of 1,800 people in Washington state, in the northwestern United States.“We were getting a lot of calls from businesses saying they were not sure if they would be able to hang on,” he told AFP.The town’s museum had a printing press, so it was put to use to make $10,000 worth of bills on wooden rectangles, each nominally worth $25. They feature a portrait of President George Washington and bear a Latin inscription that translates as “We’ve got it under control.”The money is being given as a grant to locals who demonstrate they have been economically harmed by the pandemic. Each resident is allowed up to $300 per month.Known as “Tenino dollars,” “Covid dollars” or, sometimes, “Wayne dollars” after the mayor himself, the bills are traded at almost all shops in the town at a fixed rate equivalent to $1.The currency is good only inside the town limits.Desperate timesThe idea is not new: town officials last tried it during an even worse period of economic devastation, the Great Depression in the 1930s.A national scarcity of dollars at the time prompted officials in Tenino to print money on spruce bark.“The concept became 1930s viral,” Fournier said, with other communities, businesses and chambers of commerce eager to emulate the town’s example.Media attention piqued the curiosity of investors, and over the years the wooden currency became a collector’s item sold on eBay and Amazon.The contemporary version of wooden currency, like the previous edition, aims to help the town through an economic crisis that forced businesses to close nationwide.“It’s more of an advertisement for the town itself,” said Chris Hamilton, the manager of the town’s main grocery store. “It brings a lot of people into town that may not even know about Tenino and want to check this place out that makes its own money.“They might stop off here, buy an ice cream or go down the street and buy a hamburger.”Similar complementary currencies exist elsewhere in the US and Europe, aimed not at replacing the national money but supporting the local economy -- a key distinction since American authorities take a dim view of anyone trying to create a bill to compete with the almighty dollar. The US Treasury declined to comment on its position regarding local currencies.Switzerland’s WIR system, created in 1934, is considered the oldest local currency in the world, used by thousands of small businesses every day.Response to globalizationFacing an unemployment rate of 11.1 percent in June -- one of the highest rates since the Great Depression -- American advocates of complementary currencies say now is the time to consider them as a means to help residents.“The crisis in municipal funding is pushing creativity. Administrators are exploring this concept of issuing their own currency instead of bonds to finance their Covid response,” said Susan Witt, director of the Schumacher Center for a New Economics.The research center developed BerkShares, a currency in circulation since 2006 in the Berkshires region of western Massachusetts, which is distributed by local banks. Witt is advising several US municipalities interested in similar initiatives.Advocates of local currencies also see them as a bulwark against unbridled globalization.“People are starting to realize that we went too global, too fast and we lost our local skills,” said Chris Hewitt, founder of Hudson Valley Current, a currency in upstate New York which operates as a mutual credit system.Supporters hope to create a nationwide movement.“If that happens across the country organically, that could be something that helps save us from a serious recession,” Fournier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-town-grows-money-from-trees-during-pandemic-downturn/story-suqcRqYwEqyUcU5e5iTWJL.html
12-07-2020||World||In a first, Donald Trump wears mask in public||US President Donald Trump wore a mask in public during a visit to a military hospital Saturday, falling in line with the recommendations of his public health officials and experts.It was a navy blue mask with the golden presidential seal emblazoned on the left.“I’ve never been against masks, but I do believe they have a time and a place,” Trump told reporters shortly before leaving the White House for the Walter Reed military hospital just outside Washington DC in the adjoining state Maryland.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTrump’s grudging capitulation came under mounting pressure from his aides, allies and critics, on a day when the cumulative total of Covid-19 infections in the United States climbed to 3.24 million, with 66,627 new infections, and fatalities went up to 134,740 with 802 deaths in the last 24 hours.The American president had refused to wear a mask in public — he said he wore it once out of public view — triggering a political war about facial coverings, with many conservatives around the country following his lead. Many Republican-ruled states had refused to make it mandatory — such as Texas — until recently, when it was hit by a brutal spike in Covid-19 cases.The United States federally introduced the use of masks, or any facial covering, in early April as a recommendation. But as the epidemic took hold of the country, states such as New York, which quickly emerged as the epicenter, made masks mandatory in public places. Other states followed at their own pace.But Trump’s top public health officials such as Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, members of the task force he set up to spearhead his administration’s battle against the virus, began recommending it urgently, along with social distancing measures, as the best bed to slow down the spread.President Trump had refused to wear masks in public interactions at the White House and outside, disregarding these urgent appeals. He and his campaign had even mocked Joe Biden, his presumptive Democratic rival for the White House in November, for wearing one.US states battling with the new surge in infections — deaths have been declining — are embracing masks more urgently than earlier. Texas, a Republican-ruled state, made masks mandatory in the first week of July and Arizona — also Republican-ruled state — has left it to its mayors to decide.Louisiana, a Democratic-governed state, also in the grip of the new surge, made masks mandatory Saturday. “Today, I am announcing a mandatory mask requirement for Louisiana, ordering bars closed to on-premises consumption and limiting indoor social gatherings to 50 total people,” John Bel Edwards. the governor, announced on twitter. The new measures go into effect Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-gives-in-uses-a-mask-finally/story-GcPe0AcwDA0p3NbJsnCt0O.html

12-07-2020||World||World leaders join Bosnians to mark 25 years of Srebrenica genocide||Bosnians commemorated on Saturday the massacre of about 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica, marking the 25th anniversary of killings that shocked the world and have stood out as Europe’s only atrocity since World War Two constituting genocide.Nine newly identified victims were buried at a flower-shaped cemetery near the town, where tall white tombstones mark the graves of 6,643 other victims. “After 25 years we succeeded in finding his mortal remains, so they can be laid to their final rest,” said Fikret Pezic, who buried his father Hasan. The remains of some 1,000 victims of the massacre in the eastern town during Bosnia’s 1992-1995 war are still missing. Ifeta Hasanovic decided to bury incomplete remains of her husband, saying: “We were aware they cannot be complete after 25 years, at least there are some, I did not want to make any new delays.” World leaders addressed the ceremony by video link, unable to attend because of coronavirus epidemic. Instead of the tens of thousands visitors who typically attend the commemoration each year, only a few thousand came after organisers banned organised visits.During the Bosnian war, Bosnian Serb forces pushed non-Serbs out of territories they sought for their Serb statelet. Fleeing Muslims took shelter in several eastern towns, including Srebrenica, that were designated as United Nations “safe zones”.On July 11, 1995, the Serb forces commanded by General Ratko Mladic overran Srebrenica, which was protected by lightly armed Dutch peacekeepers. They sent women and children away and captured and executed the men and boys they found. The bodies were dumped into mass graves and later exhumed by U.N. investigators and used as evidence in war crimes trials of Bosnian Serb leaders.“We grieve with the families that tirelessly seek justice for the 8,000 innocent lives lost, all these years later,” said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Washington brokered Bosnia’s peace deal months after the massacre. Most people at the commemoration were Muslim Bosniaks, reflecting conflicting narratives about the bloodshed - which hinders reconciliation nearly 25 years after the end of war in which about 100,000 people were killed. The UN war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia convicted Mladic and his political chief Radovan Karadzic over Srebrenica genocide but they remained heroes for Serbs, many of whom deny that genocide happened.On Saturday, the Serbs in the nearby town of Bratunac organised an event marking July 11 as the “Srebrenica Liberation Day”. Sefik Dzaferovic, the Bosniak chairman of Bosnia’s tripartite presidency, called for legislation that would ban denial of genocide.“There can be no trust as long as we witness attacks on the truth, denial of genocide and glorification and celebration of executors,” Dzaferovic told the commemoration gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-leaders-join-bosnians-to-mark-25-years-of-srebrenica-genocide/story-udFcqz3XJRiFux8WcyXVGL.html

12-07-2020||World||Singapore’s version of a political shock upends the old playbook||Most political parties around the world would be thrilled to win 89% of seats in an election. Not in Singapore.The worst showing for the ruling People’s Action Party, or PAP, since independence in 1965 prompted analysts to declare a “vote for change” that will trigger “soul searching” among the country’s leaders. Supporters for the main opposition Workers’ Party -- which took 10 of 93 seats up for grabs -- waved flags, blew whistles and beat drums like they were about to take office.Much of that reaction reflects just how tightly the PAP has clenched the levers of power over the decades. It’s a very high bar for it to continue winning so many seats in every election even with an electoral system that has built-in advantages for the ruling party, and this vote was held when a global pandemic helped trigger the city-state’s worst-ever economic slump.Potentially more concerning for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, however, was that the result upended the conventional wisdom that traditionally risk-averse Singaporeans would strongly back the PAP in an emergency. That alone could have a big impact on policy, raising questions about how leaders positioned to succeed Lee handled the virus and why more young voters are said to have embraced opposition calls for both a stronger social safety net and a more open democracy.“Look at this population -- the youngsters -- they are prepared to vote against the government in times of a crisis, which is very unprecedented,” said Bilveer Singh, associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s department of political science. “It has never happened.”In the early hours of Saturday, Lee said the PAP had won a “clear mandate” even though its 61.2% share of the popular vote -- slightly more than its all-time low in 2011 -- was less than he had hoped. He vowed to take Singapore “safely through the crisis and beyond” before handing over power to the so-called fourth generation of leaders.“The results show also a clear desire for a diversity of voices in Parliament,” Lee said, while adding that the outcome reflected the “pain and uncertainty” caused by a loss of income, anxiety over jobs and virus-related disruptions.Lee hinted at some changes ahead, saying government policies must reflect the younger generation’s “significantly different life aspirations and priorities” compared with older Singaporeans. Still, he implored the youth to heed lessons “hard won by their parents and grandparents so that they don’t have to learn them all over again and pay a high price.”As one of the most trade-reliant economies in the world, Singapore has taken a severe knock during the pandemic. Officials are predicting that gross domestic product will contract as much as 7% this year. Data on Tuesday will probably show the economy already entered a recession in the second quarter.“There may be a greater need to think out of the box for economic strategies in a post-Covid world,” said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., citing debates over fiscal sustainability and accountability, minimum wages, foreign worker policy and reliance on multinational corporations.​The Workers’ Party had campaigned on a slew of policies aimed at helping lower-income Singaporeans, including unemployment insurance, a minimum wage and incentives to hire locals over foreigners. Party chief Pritam Singh, who will become Singapore’s first official opposition leader, said he was humbled by the gains even though “it’s still not exactly a quantum leap.”“I’m not feeling euphoric at all,” Singh told reporters. “In fact I think there’s a lot of work to do.”The election results will likely spur the government to enact measures to strengthen the social safety net and recalibrate its foreign worker policy even while it stresses to the business community that it’s not turning insular, according to Leonard Lim, Singapore country director for regional consultancy firm Vriens & Partners. The government had already tightened restrictions on foreign labor in industries such as retail while allowing imported talent for higher-skilled roles.“Plenty of opposition candidates have rammed home the point that the PAP’s long-standing openness to foreign labor means less good quality jobs for citizens,” Lim said. “It’s low-hanging fruit and a very strategic tactic, especially when many citizens, especially middle-class white-collar workers, are losing sleep about job issues amid Covid-19.”On the campaign trail, Prime Minister Lee had emphasized the government’s moves to stabilize the economy and limit job losses through massive wage subsidies, pledges to create 100,000 fresh work and training opportunities, and re-skilling workers toward next-generation industries. His government allocated S$93 billion ($67 billion) in special budget support to cushion the economic blow, and dipped into its reserves for only the second time to finance the spending.In addition, the government is investing for research and development in areas such as artificial intelligence and biomedical sciences, supplementing ongoing digitization efforts that include building Singapore into a fintech hub and getting the island’s food stalls and wet markets to adopt e-payments.Still, Lee has repeatedly said Singapore needs to attract investments from multinationals to generate sustainable economic growth over the long haul. He blasted opposition proposals for a minimum wage and universal basic income as “fashionable peacetime slogans, not serious wartime plans.”Singapore in survival mode looks to reinvent itself. AgainFor Lee, who has run Singapore since 2004, the election was personal. He has signaled he intends to step down by the time he turns 70 in 2022, with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat set to take over.Yet the election saw the prime minister being attacked by his own brother, Lee Hsien Yang, who criticized the government’s handling of the pandemic and the capabilities of the next generation of the PAP’s leaders. Singapore has been one of the hardest hit places in Asia, with cases topping 45,000 -- mostly migrant workers residing in dormitories -- even though the fatality rate remains low.Lee Hsien Yang also called for an overhaul of the political system, a view shared by the Workers’ Party. It has sought a range of political reforms, such as abolishing the group-representative constituency system that it says has helped the PAP maintain its lock on Parliament. It advocates single-member constituencies, an independent Elections Department and court reviews of government directives under a so-called fake news law passed last year.The extent to which the PAP will change hinges on internal discussions and some form of leadership transition that will happen before Singaporeans are scheduled to vote again in 2025, according to Bridget Welsh, an honorary research associate at the Asia Research Institute of University of Nottingham Malaysia.“If anything,” she said, “the pandemic has taught Singapore that the PAP needs to listen to alternative voices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-s-version-of-a-political-shock-upends-the-old-playbook/story-GA7lZaxizj3jZueB4Ix4LM.html
12-07-2020||World||Iran says forgetful operator helped trigger Ukraine jet crash||An Iranian air defense unit that “forgot” to adjust its radar system triggered a chain of communication and human errors that led to the deadly downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet in January, according to a report from Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization.Iran said it mistakenly shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 shortly after take-off, killing all 176 aboard. Decoding of the jet’s black boxes is expected to start July 20.The plane was downed by two missiles, fired 30 seconds apart, from an air defense unit that mistook the jet for a cruise missile. An operator had forgotten to re-adjust the north direction on the radar system after moving to a new position, an error that contributed to misreading the radar’s data, according to the report published on CAO’s website on Saturday.“The operator of the air defense system launched a missile at what it had detected as a hostile target without response from the command center,” CAO said in the report, adding that an unnamed person took action independently and without authorization from superiors.The incident took place hours after Iran’s defense systems were put on high alert following the country’s missile attack on a US air base in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian general by the order of President Donald Trump.Six people have been arrested in connection with the incident, authorities said in June without giving details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-forgetful-operator-helped-trigger-ukraine-jet-crash/story-2PgisFor9lcWnB7C8QoZYL.html
12-07-2020||World||IMF urges fiscal caution as global debt surges to record||The International Monetary Fund urged governments to exercise fiscal caution as they borrow more to support economies hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, saying debt levels could soar to a record this year.“The need for continued fiscal support is clear, but this begs the question of how countries can finance it without debt becoming unsustainable,” Fiscal Affairs Department Director Vitor Gaspar and Gita Gopinath, the fund’s chief economist, said in a blog Friday.While governments will benefit from record-low borrowing costs that are set to stay that way “for a long time,” their collective fiscal response of about $11 trillion to increase health capacity, replace lost incomes and stave off large-scale bankruptcies is set to take the world’s public debt to more than 100% of global gross domestic product in 2020, the highest yet, the IMF said.“Our balance of risks points to the fact that premature withdrawal of fiscal support is a more pressing danger than the high levels of debt,” Gaspar said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.The fund in June downgraded its outlook for the coronavirus-ravaged world economy, projecting a significantly deeper recession of 4.9% this year, the biggest slump since the Great Depression. It has provided more than 70 countries with emergency funds, and gave immediate debt-service relief to 29 nations.Public-Health PriorityThe fund warned that borrowing costs can increase rapidly, particularly for emerging economies and frontier markets, as was the case in March. Countries that entered the crisis with already elevated debt and low economic growth will need to find a path back to sustainable fiscal balances, it said.“Governments will need to pursue a credible medium-term fiscal plan that relies on improving revenue mobilization – including through minimizing tax avoidance, greater tax progressivity in some cases, carbon pricing and higher efficiency in spending,” like removing fossil-fuel subsidies, Gaspar and Gopinath said. They added that international institutions must ensure that access to liquidity is not disrupted by self-fulfilling market panics.With the virus causing “radical uncertainty,” the number one priority is public health, Gaspar said.“Only by controlling the epidemic are we going to be able to reduce uncertainty and so create conditions for the economy to pick up in a sustainable way, for investment to pick up, and for the transition to a new model for sustainable and inclusive growth,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-urges-fiscal-caution-as-global-debt-surges-to-record/story-My4qzYsS5x1iUGYmDXdcEN.html
12-07-2020||World||Poles vote in presidential election that could define EU relations||Poles vote on Sunday in a knife-edge presidential election that may shape the country’s future relations with the European Union, which have been frayed by the bloc’s concerns over the rule of law.Incumbent Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling nationalists Law and Justice (PiS), takes on liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski after a campaign that has shown sharply contrasting visions for the future and exposed deep political divisions.Duda’s re-election is crucial if PiS is to deepen judicial reforms that the European Union says increase political control over the courts.The president holds the power of veto and Trzaskowski has said he will block legislation that he believes would undermine democratic norms.Given that Poland’s president holds few executive powers, it is unlikely Trzaskowski could bring about significant change if he won. But with the presidency as well as the upper house of parliament in opposition hands, PiS’s ability to implement its agenda would be hampered.The election is a run-off after a first round on June 28. Polling stations open at 0500 GMT and close at 1900 GMT, at which point the results of an exit poll will be announced.Duda has painted himself as a defender of Poland’s Catholic values and the generous social benefit programmes that have transformed life for many, especially in the poorer rural regions of the country, the EU’s largest post-communist member.“I believe we can build the Poland we dream of, a fair Poland, a rich Poland, a strong Poland... a Poland that can protect the weak and doesn’t have to fear the strong,” Duda told supporters on Friday, asking them to compare their standard of living now with what it was before he took office.However, while Duda vows to stand on the side of the weak, critics say his campaign has also drawn on homophobia and anti-Semitism.He has compared what he calls LGBT “ideology” to Soviet-era communist indoctrination, while state TV, the mouthpiece of the government, has used the sensitive issue of Jewish property restitution to attack Trzaskowski.“There are very energetic attempts, and at the centre of these attempts is Mr Trzaskowski, to see to it that in Poland different kinds of minorities can... terrorise the rest,” said Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of PiS and Poland’s de-facto ruler.Trzaskowski became a target for religious conservatives for promoting gay rights after he took part in pride marches and pledged to introduce sex education classes in Warsaw schools.MORE TOLERANT POLANDTrzaskowski says he seeks a more open, tolerant Poland and has criticised PiS’s rhetoric, while vowing to abolish state news channel TVP Info.“Have you ever heard such homophobia, such anti-Semitism, such attacks on everybody who is brave enough to say ‘we have had enough’,” he asked supporters on Friday, contrasting PiS’s use of language with that of opposition politicians.But while vowing to block PiS’s judicial reforms and condemning attacks on minorities, Trzaskowski has stressed that he would leave PiS’s popular social benefit programmes intact and not seek to raise the retirement age.Trzaskowski has tried to portray himself as someone who can unite a divided nation, but many observers say a period of bitter conflict between the PiS dominated parliament and the presidential palace awaits if he wins.For Adam Schulz, a 36-year-old office worker enjoying an ice-cream in the central Warsaw sunshine, it is this deep division that could drive Sunday’s turnout to record levels.“As the years go by polarisation on the political scene means that more and more people want to express their opinions... that is why I think there is more interest,” he said. “There is no conversation between these sides.” (Reporting by Alan Charlish, Pawel Florkiewicz, Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk and Anna Koper Editing by Frances Kerry)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poles-vote-in-presidential-election-that-could-define-eu-relations/story-sSEwNmtjEZy5REu69uIgSK.html
12-07-2020||World||Robert Mueller defends Russia probe, says Stone remains a felon||Former special counsel Robert Mueller sharply defended his investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, writing in a newspaper opinion piece Saturday that the probe was of “paramount importance” and asserting that a Trump ally, Roger Stone, “remains a convicted felon, and rightly so” despite the president’s decision to commute his prison sentence.The op-ed in The Washington Post marked Mueller’s first public statement on his investigation since his congressional appearance last July. It represented his firmest defense of the two-year probe whose results have come under attack and even been partially undone by the Trump administration, including the president’s extraordinary move Friday evening to grant clemency to Stone just days before he was due to report to prison.Mueller said that though he had intended for his 448-page report on the investigation to speak for itself, he felt compelled to “respond both to broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper, and to specific claims that Roger Stone was a victim of our office.“The Russia investigation was of paramount importance. Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so,” Mueller wrote.Mueller did not specify who was making the claims, but it appeared to be an obvious reference to Trump, who as recently as Saturday derided the investigation as this “whole political witch hunt and the Mueller scam.”The mere publication of the op-ed was striking in itself for a former FBI director who was tight-lipped during the investigation, refusing to respond to attacks by the president or his allies or to even make public appearances explaining or justifying his work. In his first public statement after the conclusion of his investigation, Mueller had said that he had hoped his report would speak for itself. When he later testified to House lawmakers, he was similarly careful not to stray beyond the report’s findings or offer new evidence.But that buttoned-up approach created a void for others, including at the Justice Department, to place their own stamp on his work. Even before the report was released Attorney General William Barr issued a four-page summary document that Mueller privately complained did not adequately capture the gravity of his team’s findings.In the months since, Barr assigned a U.S. attorney to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, and the Justice Department moved to dismiss the criminal case against former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn even though Flynn had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition period.The op-ed traced the basis for the Stone prosecution, with Mueller recounting how Stone had not only tampered with a witness but also lied repeatedly about his efforts to gain inside information about Democratic emails that Russian intelligence operatives stole and provided to WikiLeaks, which published them in the run-up to the election.Those efforts, including his discussions with Trump campaign associates about them, cut to the heart of Mueller’s mandate to determine whether anyone tied to the campaign coordinated with Russia in the hacking or disclosure of the stolen Democratic emails.Stone was particularly critical to the investigation, Mueller writes, because he claimed inside knowledge about WikiLeaks’ release of the stolen emails and because he communicated during the campaign with people known to be Russian intelligence officers. He also communicated with members of the Trump campaign about the timing of the WikiLeaks releases, something that he denied.“We did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its activities,” Mueller wrote. “The investigation did, however, establish that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome. It also established that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”Stone was found guilty last fall of witness tampering, false statements and obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian election interference. He was sentenced in February to 40 months in prison and was due to surrender on Tuesday, until the president commuted his sentence.“Roger Stone was treated horribly. Roger Stone was treated very unfairly,” Trump told reporters on Saturday.He was one of six former Trump associates or advisers to be convicted in the Russia investigation. In total, the investigation produced charges against 34 individuals, including 25 Russians accused either of hacking into Democratic email accounts of engaging in a covert social media campaign to divide American public opinion ahead of the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robert-mueller-defends-russia-probe-says-stone-remains-a-felon/story-OkdixRPfm7HMA57VCZGZPN.html
12-07-2020||World||Trump wears mask in public for first time during pandemic||President Donald Trump wore a mask during a visit to a military hospital on Saturday, the first time the president has been seen in public with the type of facial covering recommended by health officials as a precaution against spreading or becoming infected by the novel coronavirus.Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Washington to meet wounded service members and health care providers caring for Covid-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: “When you’re in a hospital, especially ... I think it’s a great thing to wear a mask.”Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed’s hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the US since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democrat Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Phoenix and South Dakota’s Mount Rushmore.The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.On its website, Walter Reed carries this recommendation: “Whenever you’re out in public, like at your local grocery store or pharmacy, where it’s difficult to maintain 6 feet of social distance, you should wear a cloth face covering.” The facility also notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-wears-mask-in-public-for-first-time-during-pandemic/story-kQp0GCLwOWvGlcRP47aJ5O.html
12-07-2020||World||5 dead in South Africa hostage situation||Five people are dead and more than 40 have been arrested after a hostage situation at a church near Johannesburg, police said on Saturday.Police and military who responded to reports of a shooting at the International Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zuurbekom found four people “shot and burned to death in a car” and a security guard shot in another car. Six others were injured.Police said they rescued men, women and children who had been held hostage and appeared to have been living at the church. The attack by a group of armed people “may have been motivated by a feud” between church members, the police said.Photos tweeted by the police showed more than a dozen men lying on the ground, subdued, along with rifles, pistols, a baseball bat and boxes of ammunition.Among those arrested were members of the police, defence forces and correctional services.The church has been the scene of violence between factions in recent years, with shots fired, rocks thrown and cars smashed. “Trouble has been brewing at the church following the death of its leader‚ Glayton Modise‚ in February 2016,” The Sowetan newspaper reported in 2018||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-dead-in-south-africa-hostage-situation/story-K7Xp2lneUCsLfcSZ8QDkLM.html
12-07-2020||World||Facebook mulls ban on advertisements for US elections||Facebook is planning to impose a ban on political ads on its social network in the days leading up to the US election on November 3, according to people familiar with the company’s plans.The potential ban is still only being discussed and hasn’t yet been finalised, said the people, who asked not to be named talking about internal policies. A halt on ads could defend against misleading election-related content spreading as people prepare to vote. Still, there are concerns that an ad blackout may hurt “get out the vote” campaigns, or limit a candidate’s ability to respond widely to breaking news or new information.This would be a big change for Facebook, which has so far stuck to a policy of not fact-checking ads from politicians or their campaigns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-mulls-ban-on-ads-for-us-polls/story-aPXoNeu5dFLBy8nHIGjMUI.html
12-07-2020||World||Crisis as US Marines in Japan test positive||Dozens of US Marines at two bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa have been infected with the coronavirus in what is feared to be a massive outbreak, Okinawa’s governor said on Saturday, demanding an adequate explanation from the US military.Governor Denny Tamaki said he could say only that a “few dozen” cases had been found recently because the US military asked that the exact figure not be released. The outbreaks occurred at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute, and Camp Hansen, Tamaki said.Local media, citing unnamed sources, said about 60 people had been infected.“Okinawans are shocked by what we were told (by the US military),” Tamaki said. “We now have strong doubts that the US military has taken adequate disease prevention measures.” Tamaki demanded transparency in the latest development and said he planned to request talks between the US military and Okinawan officials. Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact.New cases rose by over 69,000 across the US on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, setting a record for the third consecutive day as Walt Disney Co stuck to its plans to reopen its flagship theme park in hard-hit Florida.A total of nine US states - Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Ohio, Utah and Wisconsin - also reached records for single-day infections.In Texas governor Greg Abbott warned he may have to impose new clampdowns if the state cannot stem its record-setting caseloads. California announced on Friday the state will release up to 8,000 inmates early from prisons to slow the spread of Covid-19 inside the facilities. Australia has granted provisional approval to Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir as the first treatment option for Covid-19 in the country, the national regulatory body said.The approval is for adults and adolescent patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms and have been hospitalised. Remdesivir has become the treatment of choice for many countries against severely ill Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crisis-as-us-marines-in-japan-test-positive/story-GfI8AtfW8XhbGuZzaQZnVK.html
12-07-2020||World||World Council of Churches expresses dismay over Hagia Sophia||The interim secretary general of the World Council of Churches has written to Turkey’s president expressing his “grief and dismay” over Turkey’s decision to change the status of Istanbul’s landmark Hagia Sophia from a museum to a mosque.As a World Heritage museum, “Hagia Sophia has been a place of openness, encounter and inspiration for people from all nations,” Ioan Sauca said in the letter released Saturday by the Geneva-based group.The colossal Hagia Sophia was built 1,500 years ago as an Orthodox Christian cathedral and was converted into a mosque after the Ottomans conquered Constantinople, now Istanbul, in 1453. The secular Turkish government decided in 1934 to make it a museum.Sauca said the museum status had been “a powerful expression” of Turkey’s commitment to inclusion and secularism.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday formally converted the building back into a mosque and declared it open for Muslim worship, hours after a high court annulled the 1934 decision turning it into a museum.Erdogan, a devout Muslim, has frequently used the debate over Hagia Sophia to drum up support for his Islamic-rooted party. The decision has provoked deep dismay among Orthodox Christians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-council-of-churches-expresses-dismay-over-hagia-sophia/story-JdW9e9pK77YssliRwsKwvI.html
12-07-2020||World||Egypt grounds kites for ‘safety’, ‘national security’||Egyptian police have seized kites from people flying them after a ban by a northern governorate for “safety” reasons and a lawmaker’s warning they posed a “national security threat”.Police seized 369 kites in Cairo on Friday, Al-Ahram reported, while Akhbar Al-Youm, another state newspaper, said police confiscated 99 kites and fined five people in the northern region of Alexandria.The ban was brought in “to ensure the safety of citizens after a number of accidents” involving kites, Alexandria’s governorate said this week on its Facebook page.Fines imposed for kite-flying in the Mediterranean city can reach up to 1,000 pounds (about $60).Egypt’s skies have been filled with thousands of colourful paper kites flown by youths from rooftops and on corniches, as the hobby took off during night-time curfews to limit the spread of coronavirus. But they have also raised complaints, including from an MP.Khaled Abu Taleb, a member of parliament’s Defence and National Security Committee, said last month he wanted the prime minister briefed on the dangers of flying kites because they posed “a national security threat”.The kites might be equipped with surveillance cameras, he said.Abu Taleb was roundly ridiculed on social media in Egypt, where operating a drone is only authorised with a special permit.A three-month curfew was lifted in June, even as cases of COVID-19 in Egypt continue to rise, with over 80,000 declared infections and nearly 4,000 deaths to date.ff/lg/hcFACEBOOK||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-grounds-kites-for-safety-national-security/story-x54YCKSpI55YmBNUGv1JqN.html
12-07-2020||World||Iran’s president warns lockdowns could lead to protests||Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said Saturday that lockdowns meant to curb the spread of the pandemic could lead to street protests over economic problems, his website reported.In a regular Cabinet meeting on the coronavirus, Rouhani said the easiest way to fight the virus is to close off all activities. But “then people come and stage protests because of chaos, famine and problems,” he said.Confirmed virus cases and deaths reached a record low in May after mass lockdowns were imposed in Iran. But since then, the numbers have spiked again, with officials saying a combination of improved testing and re-openings has driven the surge.Rouhani urged that ceremonies be held with a limited number of participants. Many experts blame an increase in virus-related deaths over the past week on wedding and funeral ceremonies with large crowds.Ali Reza Zali, the head of Tehran’s virus task force, in a letter to officials banned any conferences, festivals or exhibitions and limited participants in wedding and funeral ceremonies to 10.Earlier this week, Iran reported 221 fatalities in a 24-hour period, the highest single-day death toll.Rouhani’s remarks came as many experts urged a halt to business activities to stop the increase in virus related deaths that have exceeded 12,600 out of 255,117 confirmed cases.Iranian officials have been particularly eager to remove restrictions on its economy, already crippled by sanctions the U.S. imposed after the Trump administration’s 2018 withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement.A sharp rise in subsidized gasoline prices led to four days of unrest in cities and towns across Iran in November, which rights group Amnesty International said led to more than 300 people being killed in clashes with police and security forces.Tehran has yet to release any official statistics about the scale of the unrest, though in June the government acknowledged that the security forces shot and killed protesters and a lawmaker said that 230 people were killed in the anti-government protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-president-warns-lockdowns-could-lead-to-protests/story-xx8kIN147s3ak1AKEWTL6I.html
12-07-2020||World||Iraq’s PM takes step in battle against border corruption||Iraq’s prime minister took a first step Saturday to combat cross-border corruption that has long plagued the country’s frontiers as part of a reform plan to grapple with unprecedented financial shortfalls.Mustafa al-Kadhimi launched a campaign to recover “hundreds of millions” of Iraqi dinars in import tax revenue lost to bribery in the northern province of Diyala. In the first phase, security forces from the Interior Ministry will supervise the work of border guards to ensure proper payment of tariffs at the Mandili border crossing with Iran, he told reporters.“Today, military forces were sent and allowed to shoot anyone who violates customs, in order to protect the people’s money and to search for ‘ghosts’ who blackmail businessmen.” he said.The scheme is expected to be repeated at other border points.Local security and government officials said enforcement brings with it the risk of contending with powerful armed groups.A Mandali border official with the rank of lieutenant colonel said “ghosts” referred to armed factions, some with links to groups within the state’s Popular Mobilization Forces, comprised of an array of militia groups, some with links to Iran. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity fearing retribution.Hours before the prime minister’s arrival at the frontier, Iraqi security forces announced the start of the fourth phase of a military campaign to root out Islamic State group elements from Diyala province, according to a military statement. At least 15 IS hideouts were destroyed since the dawn operation was launched.The launch of the border corruption campaign comes as Iraq’s government struggles to plug a widening budget deficit amid spiraling oil prices that has slashed expected state revenues, leaving the country with little liquidity to pay state salaries and finance a response to the coronavirus.In June, the crude exporting state received $2.68 billion in oil revenues, about half of what a draft 2020 budget projected.Attempts at financial reform have been met with protests and rejection from parliament, which voted down proposals to cut public salaries, which represent a chunk of the government’s monthly expenditure.The government plans to pay full salaries for the months of June and July by borrowing from reserves through state banks, but this is a short-term option, two Iraqi officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.With strong opposition to wage cuts from political blocs in parliament, al-Kadhimi is considering measures that don’t require their approval, according two members of the government Crisis Cell, a high-level committee overseeing top economic issues. These include changing taxation methods and enforcing tariffs at customs. Iraq imports nearly all of its goods from neighboring Iran and Turkey.“We are in crisis mode, we have a 3-trillion (dinar) deficit every month,” said one official. “It’s not sustainable for the future.”Improving customs collections across Iraq’s 21 border crossings had been on the reform agenda of previous Iraqi governments but officials have repeatedly said enforcement was the key obstacle.Mandali crossing, recently re-opened after a virus-related closure, has fallen victim to armed groups in the past, said Omar al-Waeili, director of the border ports. Once they even confiscated prohibited items by force, he said. With stricter policing he expects the crossing to bring in around 250 million dinars per day.The government alleges that corruption arises from certain border officers accepting bribes for charging lower tariffs, while others say they are intimidated by armed gangs with links to militia groups that are dominant in the area.Some local officials say plans to introduce automated security technology at the crossing and clamp down on corrupt officials would introduce fresh obstacles.PMF groups and some Iraqi security forces maintain security in Mandali. Two officials, one lieutenant colonel at the border and another in the government, said armed factions with militia links were involved.“They give you a receipt of just 10 percent of what is paid, the rest will be theirs,” the officer said. He requested anonymity for fear of retribution. “If someone opposes them or wants to implement the law, they threaten them.”Al-Kadhimi visited the headquarters of the PMF during his trip to Diyala.“I ask for time and patience,” he said, in comments to reporters following his meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-s-pm-takes-step-in-battle-against-border-corruption/story-vad4VWbROWECCSdrNhsY9M.html
12-07-2020||World||US warns of ‘arbitrary detention’ risk in China||The United States on Saturday warned citizens of “heightened risk of arbitrary detention” in China as tensions between Beijing and Washington soared over issues including Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. US citizens in China “may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to ‘state security’“, the State Department warned in a security alert.The State Department said Chinese authorities may also impose exit bans as part of “arbitrary enforcement of local laws for purposes other than maintaining law and order”.Beijing and Washington have traded barbs and sanctions on a slew of issues in recent months, including the coronavirus pandemic and Chinese policies in the far west regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, with Chinese authorities threatening retaliation this week for US sanctions on Chinese officials. A controversial security law pushed on Hong Kong by China’s central government in June has also caused international concern over the wording of the legislation, which bans subversive acts and speech against the Chinese government made anywhere in the world.Australia and Canada have also issued travel warnings over fears of arbitrary detention by Beijing.Last year China arrested Australian-Chinese writer Yang Hengjun, who was indicted earlier this year for espionage.China has also arrested two Canadians after Canada detained a high-profile executive of Chinese telecom giant Huawei in late 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-of-arbitrary-detention-risk-in-china/story-xTF29YavFTcTx2N3dvcGiI.html
12-07-2020||World||Trump commutes longtime friend Roger Stone’s prison sentence||President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of his longtime political confidant Roger Stone, intervening in extraordinary fashion in a criminal case that was central to the Russia investigation and that concerned the president’s own conduct.The move came Friday, just days before Stone was to begin serving a 40-month prison sentence for lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing the House investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.The action, which Trump had foreshadowed in recent days, underscores the president’s lingering rage over special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and is part of a continuing effort by the president and his administration to rewrite the narrative of a probe that has shadowed the White House from the outset. Democrats, already alarmed by the Justice Department’s earlier dismissal of the case against Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, denounced the president as further undermining the rule of law.Stone, 67, had been set to report to prison on Tuesday after a federal appeals court rejected his bid to postpone his surrender date. But he told The Associated Press that Trump called him Friday evening to tell him he was off the hook.“The president told me that he had decided, in an act of clemency, to issue a full commutation of my sentence, and he urged me to vigorously pursue my appeal and my vindication,” Stone said by phone from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he was celebrating with friends. He said he had to change rooms because there were “too many people opening bottles of Champagne here.”Although a commutation does not nullify Stone’s felony convictions, it protects him from serving prison time as a result.The move is another extraordinary intervention by Trump in the nation’s justice system and underscores anew his willingness to flout the norms and standards that have governed presidential conduct for decades. As Trump stares down a coronavirus pandemic that has worsened his chances for reelection, he has been more willing than ever to test the limits of his power.Democrats denounced Trump’s action. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday called it “an act of staggering corruption,” saying legislation is needed to prevent a president from pardoning or commuting the sentence of someone who acted to shield that president from prosecution.House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff called it “offensive to the rule of law and principles of justice. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez asked, “Is there any power Trump won’t abuse?”Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, also condemned the move. “Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,” he tweeted Saturday.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, in a statement, called Stone a “victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media,” and declared, “Roger Stone is now a free man!”Stone had been open about his desire for a pardon or commutation, appealing for the president’s help in a monthslong television and social media campaign and seeking to postpone his surrender date by months after getting a brief extension from the judge, in part by citing the coronavirus.Trump, who had made clear in recent days that he was inching closer to acting, had repeatedly publicly inserted himself into Stone’s case, including just before Stone’s sentencing.That earned a public rebuke from his own attorney general, William Barr, who said the president’s comments were “making it impossible” for him to do his job. Barr was so incensed that he told people he was considering resigning over the matter.“With this commutation, Trump makes clear that there are two systems of justice in America: one for his criminal friends, and one for everyone else,” Schiff said. “Donald Trump, Bill Barr, and all those who enable them pose the gravest of threats to the rule of law.”Stone, a larger-than-life political character who embraced his reputation as a dirty trickster, was the sixth Trump aide or adviser to have been convicted of charges brought during Mueller’s investigation.A longtime Trump friend and informal adviser, Stone boasted during the campaign that he was in contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange through a trusted intermediary and hinted at inside knowledge of WikiLeaks’ plans to release more than 19,000 emails hacked from the servers of the Democratic National Committee.But Stone denied any wrongdoing and consistently criticized the case against him as politically motivated. He did not take the stand during his trial, did not speak at his sentencing. His lawyers did not call any witnesses in his defense.Prosecutors had originally recommended Stone serve seven to nine years in prison. But in a highly unusual move, Barr reversed that decision after a Trump tweet and recommended a more lenient punishment, prompting a mini-revolt inside the Justice Department, with the entire prosecution team resigning from the case.Department officials have vehemently denied Barr was responding to Trump’s criticism and have insisted there was no contact with the White House over the decision. Barr has also pointed out that the judge, in imposing a 40-month sentence, had agreed with him that the original sentencing recommendation was excessive.Barr has said the prosecution was justified, and the Justice Department did not support Stone’s more recent effort to put off his surrender date. Though the Justice Department raised concerns about the handling of Flynn’s case, including what it said were irregularities about his FBI interview, prosecutors did not point to any similar issues or problems with the Stone prosecution.Even so, the commutation will almost certainly contribute to a portrait of a president determined to erase the impact of the Russia investigation and to intervene on behalf of allies.The commutation was the latest example of Trump using his unlimited clemency power to pardon powerful men he believes have been mistreated by the justice system.Trump went on a clemency spree in February, commuting the 14-year prison sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat, and pardoning former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik, financier Michael Milken and several others.Trump has also offered clemency to other political allies, including Joe Arpaio, an Arizona sheriff who was awaiting sentencing at the time, conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza, who had been convicted on campaign finance violations, and Conrad Black, a newspaper publisher convicted of fraud who had written a flattering book about the president.Trump, however, has spent much more time trumpeting his decision to commute the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who was serving life in prison for nonviolent drug offenses and who came to Trump’s attention after reality star Kim Kardashian West took up her cause. Her story was featured in a Trump campaign Super Bowl ad.Stone told the AP he expressed his gratitude to Trump in the phone call.“You know, he has a great sense of fairness,” Stone said. “We’ve been friends for many, many years, and he understands that I was targeted strictly for political reasons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-commutes-longtime-friend-roger-stone-s-prison-sentence/story-R9qcA5uebDCOYdF722kqtM.html
12-07-2020||World||UN to vote on reduced extension of cross-border aid to Syria||The UN Security Council is due to vote again Saturday on an extension of cross-border humanitarian aid to Syria after Russia and China vetoed a previous measure to the chagrin of Western member states.Authorization for the transport of aid to war-torn Syria, a system in place since 2014, expired Friday following the two countries’ veto earlier in the day and the subsequent rejection of a counterproposal by Moscow.Saturday’s vote will be on a new draft text submitted overnight by Germany and Belgium, which would provide for a single aid access point into Syria.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called in a tweet Saturday “on all delegations to no longer obstruct a compromise.”European countries and the US had wanted to maintain two crossing points on the Turkish border -- at Bab al-Salam, which leads to the Aleppo region, and Bab al-Hawa, which serves the Idlib region.The latest draft measure calls only for the Bab al-Hawa crossing to be maintained “for a period of twelve months,” according to a text obtained by AFP. The Council would also ask the UN secretary-general for a report “at least every 60 days.”UN authorization allows the international body to distribute aid to displaced Syrians without needing permission from Damascus.But Russia and China argue that the authorization violates Syria’s sovereignty, and that aid can increasingly be channeled through Syrian authorities.Russia, Syria’s closest ally, has for weeks argued that Bab al-Salam should be removed as an access point, particularly as it leads to the Aleppo region.Bab al-Hawa, on the other hand, allows for aid to be funneled to nearly four million people in the insurgent Idlib region, which the Syrian regime does not control.- Multiple vetoes -Western member states reject Russia’s arguments that authorization for cross-border aid violates Syrian sovereignty.Those countries maintain that there is no credible alternative to the cross-border system and argue that Syrian bureaucracy and politics are preventing an effective flow of aid in areas not controlled by the Syrian regime.The US has gone so far as to describe having two entry points as “a red line.”The 15 members of the Security Council have until midday Saturday to submit amendments to the latest text before the vote.Russia has asked for two things -- a mention of the impact of unilateral sanctions on Syria (an implicit jab at the United States and Europe), and a statement acknowledging improvements in aid delivery carried out under the Syrian regime.However, those amendments have little chance of being adopted.China, for its part, has called for an amendment highlighting the work of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, “in particular his appeal for an immediate global ceasefire.”In January, Moscow succeeded in having the crossing points reduced from four to two and in limiting the authorization to six months instead of a year.This week Russia and China exercised their veto rights as permanent members twice -- on Tuesday and Friday -- even as NGOs and Western countries accused them of politicizing a humanitarian issue.To be adopted, Saturday’s draft text must get at least nine of the 15 votes, with none of the five permanent members voting against the measure.Friday’s vetoes by Moscow and Beijing marked the 16th for Russia and 10th for China on texts linked to Syria since the war began in 2011.In a report in June, Guterres called for a one-year extension of the aid to include the two current access points.prh/bfm/bbk||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-to-vote-on-reduced-extension-of-cross-border-aid-to-syria/story-HsuNoG7LWdZ7CooXgfHlgP.html
12-07-2020||World||Coronavirus deaths take a long-expected turn for the worse||A long-expected upturn in U.S. coronavirus deaths has begun, driven by fatalities in states in the South and West, according to data on the pandemic.The number of deaths per day from the virus had been falling for months, and even remained down as states like Florida and Texas saw explosions in cases and hospitalizations — and reported daily U.S. infections broke records several times in recent days.Scientists warned it wouldn’t last. A coronavirus death, when it occurs, typically comes several weeks after a person is first infected. And experts predicted states that saw increases in cases and hospitalizations would, at some point, see deaths rise too. Now that’s happening.“It’s consistently picking up. And it’s picking up at the time you’d expect it to,” said William Hanage, a Harvard University infectious diseases researcher.According to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily reported deaths in the U.S. has increased from 578 two weeks ago to 664 on July 10 — still well below the heights hit in April. Daily reported deaths increased in 27 states over that time period, but the majority of those states are averaging under 15 new deaths per day. A smaller group of states has been driving the nationwide increase in deaths.California is averaging 91 reported deaths per day while Texas is close behind with 66, but Florida, Arizona, Illinois, New Jersey and South Carolina also saw sizable rises. New Jersey’s recent jump is thought to be partially attributable to its less frequent reporting of probable deaths.The impact has already been felt by families who lost kin — and by the health care workers who tried to save them.Rublas Ruiz, a Miami intensive care unit nurse, recently broke down in tears during a birthday dinner with his wife and daughter. He said he was overcome by the number of patients who have died in his care.“I counted like 10 patients in less than four days in our ICU and then I stopped doing that because there were so many,” said the 41-year-old nurse at Kendall Regional Medical Center who lost another patient Monday.The virus has killed more than 130,000 people in the U.S. and more than a half-million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true numbers are believed to be higher.Deaths first began mounting in the U.S. in March. About two dozen deaths were being reported daily in the middle of that month. By late in the month, hundreds were being reported each day, and in April thousands. Most happened in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere in the Northeast.Deaths were so high there because it was a new virus tearing through a densely populated area, and it quickly swept through vulnerable groups of people in nursing homes and other places, said Perry Halkitis, the dean of the Rutgers University School of Public Health in New Jersey.Many of the infections occurred before government officials imposed stay-at-home orders and other social-distancing measures. The daily death toll started falling in mid-April — and continued to fall until about a week ago.Researchers now expect deaths to rise for at least some weeks, but some think the count probably will not go up as dramatically as it did in the spring — for several reasons.First, testing was extremely limited early in the pandemic, and it’s become clear that unrecognized infections were spreading on subways, in nursing homes and in other public places before anyone knew exactly what was going on. Now testing is more widespread, and the magnitude of outbreaks is becoming better understood.Second, many people’s health behaviors have changed, with mask-wearing becoming more common in some places. Although there is no vaccine yet, hospitals are also getting better at treating patients.Another factor, tragically, is that deadly new viruses often tear through vulnerable populations first, such as the elderly and people already weakened by other health conditions. That means that, in the Northeast at least, “many of the vulnerable people have already died,” Halkitis said.Now, the U.S. is likely in for “a much longer, slower burn,” Hanage, the Harvard researcher, said. “We’re not going to see as many deaths (as in the spring). But we’re going to see a total number of deaths, which is going to be large.”In other virus-related developments:— Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are reopening Saturday; Epcot and Disney’s Hollywood Studios will follow four days later. The move comes as there has been a surge in the number of Floridians testing positive for the coronavirus and the state set a record of nearly 500 confirmed deaths in a week.— The number of New Yorkers hospitalized with the coronavirus — 799 — has fallen to the lowest point since March 18. But Gov. Andrew Cuomo fears a resurgence in cases is inevitable amid outbreaks in other states.Kristin Urquiza is worried things may get dramatically worse soon in at least some American cities, like Phoenix, where her 65-year-old father died recently.When the dangers of the virus first became known, Mark Anthony Urquiza, a quality assurance inspector, took precautions such as wearing a face mask and staying home as much as possible, his daughter said.But that changed after Gov. Doug Ducey ended Arizona’s stay-at-home order on May 15, eased restrictions on businesses, and initially blocked local lawmakers from requiring residents to wear masks.By June 11, the elder Urquiza had developed a fever and cough. He was hospitalized and eventually placed on a ventilator. He died June 30.“His life was robbed. I believe that terrible leadership and flawed policies put my father’s life in the balance,” Kristin Urquiza said in an interview with The Associated Press.Ducey, a Republican, has more recently changed direction, closing many businesses and allowing mayors to make mask-wearing mandatory.But Kristin Urquiza is worried. Her father received the care at a time when beds in intensive care units were readily available. Now some Arizona ICUs are becoming swamped.“Other families are not going to be reassured the hospitals will have the capacity to give (coronavirus) victims the dignity and the health care that they deserve. And that breaks my heart,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-deaths-take-a-long-expected-turn-for-the-worse/story-9PgMkgR199FTqF0iCSzY6N.html
12-07-2020||India||Nepal complains to India over reportage||New DelhiNepal has formally complained to the Indian government about coverage of the Chinese envoy’s meetings with senior Nepalese leaders in a section of the Indian media, describing the reports as baseless and part of a smear campaign.The complaint was made through a note verbale or unsigned diplomatic correspondence sent by Nepal’s foreign ministry last week, people familiar with developments said on Sunday.There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to the development.Nepal’s cable TV operators had on July 9 removed all Indian news channels, except Doordarshan News, from their networks over the same issue, and Nepal’s envoy in New Delhi, Nilambar Acharya, had raised the media reports with the external affairs ministry.The complaint from Nepal’s foreign ministry said it had taken seriously the content of reports by some Indian media outlets, which were baseless and abusive towards the country and its leadership, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Such reports went against public decency and were part of a motivated smear campaign that has hurt the feelings of the Nepali people, the complaint said. Relations between the two countries are based on understanding and mutual respect of each other’s interests and concerns, and the media plays a vital role in disseminating the correct information and advancing these ties, it added.Nepal’s cable TV operators had said they were irked by objectionable and derogatory references to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Chinese envoy Hou Yanqi in the media reports. One Indian news channel had suggested the premier could be “honey trapped” by the ambassador.The Chinese envoy in Kathmandu has had a series of meetings with the president and leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, including Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who are seeking the ouster of Oli. The move against Oli has come at a time when his government issued a new map showing the Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal, triggering a border row with India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-complains-to-india-over-reportage/story-CSVljdH17ID1cLqkkOzpdP.html
12-07-2020||India||India, EU to focus on multilateral order with rise of assertive China||New DelhiIndia and the European Union (EU) will focus on strengthening multilateralism during their upcoming summit this week amid uncertainty created by the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of an assertive China, people familiar with developments said on Sunday.The 15th India-EU Summit, which was delayed by the Coronavirus outbreak, will be held via video conference on July 15. The summit will be co-chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both sides felt the need to take the lead in bolstering multilateralism and cooperative international relations against the backdrop of the US ceding its leading role on the world stage.“This has created a vacuum that needs to be plugged, or else an aggressive China will only become more assertive,” one of the people cited above said. “The whole multilateral system is under stress and many experts have expressed doubts about the future of the global system.”In a blog titled “In a world of disorder, Europe needs partners” written on July 10, the EU’s high representative for foreign and security policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, noted that China has become increasingly assertive, while the Covid-19 pandemic was the first major world crisis “where the US is not in the lead” as the US administration has “mostly withdrawn from the global order it has built”.He further wrote of a “real crisis of multilateralism”, with the G7 and G20 being absent and the UN Security Council paralysed. He added: “Europe feels somewhat lonely, trying to hold the multilateral ring. For sure we know that we need partners.”Some preparatory work has already been done in this regard and external affairs minister S Jaishankar joined his European and other counterparts for a virtual meeting of the informal Alliance for Multilateralism on June 26, the people said.This alliance was launched by France and Germany in April 2019 after they felt the need to protect the rules-based multilateral order to ensure international stability and to resolve common challenges through cooperation.The alliance met in February and April before holding a virtual ministerial meeting on June 26. While participating in that meeting, Jaishankar reiterated India’s call for reformed multilateralism along with purposeful reform of existing structures so that they continue to serve the world even more in this complex and uncertain time.Jaishankar also referred to the two-pronged attack of “a viral pandemic and misinformation going viral”, and highlighted the need to strengthen scientific approaches to analyse the causes of the Covid-19 pandemic, assess multilateral health mechanisms, and take concrete steps to counter the “infodemic” in the context of a statement adopted by more than 130 states and observers on Covid-19 at the UN.The EU has already stated that multilateralism, with the UN and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core, is the cornerstone of the grouping’s foreign and security policy. As part of its efforts to strengthen multilateralism, the EU intends to act on three fronts – upholding international norms and agreements, extending multilateralism to new global realities, and reforming multilateral organisations.In a recent letter to the prime minister, European Commission President von der Leyen suggested common engagement of India and the EU for effective multilateralism and a cooperative approach to international ties, based on their shared values of democracy and pluralism.The people said India is hoping the July 15 summit can frame their partnership to preserve multilateralism and promote dialogue and cooperation to address global challenges.The external affairs ministry earlier said the summit will review India-EU cooperation in political and security relations, trade and investment, and economic cooperation. The summit is also expected to discuss developments related to the pandemic. The EU, in a statement, said the summit will be an opportunity to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two sides and to discuss cooperation in climate, environment, digital economy and connectivity.The last India-EU Summit was held in New Delhi in October 2017. The EU is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for trade in goods worth 80 billion euros in 2019 or 11.1% of total Indian trade, on par with the US and ahead of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-to-focus-on-multilateral-order-with-rise-of-assertive-china/story-2yWMVCaNVjjHsYRotmecWK.html

12-07-2020||India||India to levy taxes on measuring tapes amid dumping from China||New Delhi: India has imposed anti-dumping duty on steel and fibre glass measuring tapes and their components originating from China and other countries after finding that the Chinese products were entering India through locations such as Singapore and Cambodia to circumvent Indian laws, government officials said.The finance ministry not only imposed the anti-dumping duty on Chinese measuring tapes on July 8, but also extended it to imports from other sources so that the Chinese products are not re-routed through a third country, the officials said, requesting anonymity.As influx of measuring tapes and their components from China had been hurting the domestic industry, prompting the government to impose anti-dumping duties on them from July 9, 2015. The punitive duties would have expired on July 8.An investigation launched in December last year found that while imports of these items from China had declined after the imposition of the duties, there was a significant jump in their imports from other countries such as Singapore and Cambodia although they do not manufactures these products, the officials cited above said.The finance ministry then imposed anti-dumping duty of $1.83 per kg on steel measuring tapes and their components, and $2.56 per kg on fibre glass tapes and their components originating from China or any other country for five years from July 8, 2020, one of the officials said.The decision was taken after a thorough investigation by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) on this matter, a second official said. DGTR is a single-window agency seeking to provide a level playing field to domestic industry against unfair trade practices of countries like China.Evidence show that there are no producers in Cambodia and Singapore, and Chinese producers are apparently exporting through these countries, the official cited above said, quoting DGTR’s investigation report. HT reviewed a copy of the report.“Examination of the evidence is indicative of the fact that significant imports have been reported from Cambodia and Singapore, which are allegedly Chinese origin products,” the report said. Dumping is an unfair trade practice that entails the export of a product at a price lower than its value and is countered by a punitive duty, which is an acceptable measure under multilateral trade agreements.Mekhla Anand, partner at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas said the numerous such cases were noticed by the government that saw amendment of the Customs Tariff Rules, 1995 last year to widen the scope of anti-circumvention measures. “Anti-dumping duty measures have to be coupled with measures to prevent circumvention of the rules so as to ensure that the domestic industry is not unfairly targeted by non-domestic players,” she said.DK Aggarwal, president of the PHD Chamber of Commerce & Industry, said China had been resorting to unfair trade practices. “As a result, unfair competition from low-cost imported (Chinese) products has impacted the sentiments of domestic manufacturers, resulting in significant effect on production processes and employment creation,” he said.“Anti-dumping duties significantly help in supporting the domestic industry, however, it is not very much helpful in case of China due to its extreme unfair trade practices,” he said, adding that the government should strictly impose quality assurance norms to check import of counterfeit products.HT reported on May 11 that India could extend anti-dumping duties and safeguards on more than two dozen Chinese goods ranging from calculators and USB drives to steel, solar cells and Vitamin E amid concern that a flood of imports would kill domestic manufacturers who will lose duty protection soon against such products. Anti-dumping duties on these products were imposed five years ago and are expiring this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-levy-taxes-on-measuring-tapes-amid-dumping-from-china/story-6UgFfQ4KlgnvSyyHrshSfL.html

The 81-year-old is lodged in the Taloja jail in Mumbai.Rao’s wife, Hemalatha, and daughters, Sahaja, Anala and Pavana, told reporters that they were worried about his health following a phone call with him on Saturday.“He appeared to be in a state of delirium and hallucination, as he was talking about the funeral of his father and mother, the events that happened seven decades and four decades ago respectively. His co-prisoner took the phone from him and informed us that he is not able to walk, go to toilet and brush his teeth on his own. We were also told that he is always hallucinating that we, family members, were waiting at the jail gate to receive him as he was getting released,” Hemalatha said.She added that Rao’s co-prisoner also told the family that he needed immediate medical care. “The confusion, loss of memory and incoherence are the results of electrolyte imbalance and fall of Sodium and Potassium levels leading to brain damage,” Hemalatha said.She said that her husband’s health had been deteriorating ever since he was taken to JJ Hospital in Mumbai in an unconscious state on May 28. “Even as he was discharged from the hospital and sent back to jail three days later, there has been no improvement in his health. The earlier two calls on June 24 and July 2 were also worrying with his weak and muffled voice, incoherent speech and abruptly jumping into Hindi, which was quite worrying,” she said.“His life is the top most concern for us right now. Our present demand is to save his life. We demand the government to shift him to a better hospital or allow us to provide required medical care. We want to remind the government that it has no right to deny the right to life of any person, much less an undertrial prisoner,” the family members said.In April, around 40 prominent writers wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting Rao’s release in the wake of outbreak of Covid-19. Several MPs, cutting across political lines, also wrote to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with a request to provide medical care for Rao and to shift him to a hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varavara-rao-s-health-deteriorating-family/story-YRx2nzEUZnEnVMC1gD4xbO.html

They also burnt down some bikes. They had snatched away the mobile phones and threatened to kill anyone trying to phone or switch on any light. This led to information of the incident reaching the police late this (Sunday) morning,” Mahatha said.The SP added that the CPI (Maoist) extremists were led by Central Committee member (CCM) Misir Besra and assisted by area commander Mocchu. There were some women members in the group who beat up women guard officers, the officer said. “We are talking to senior forest officials to shift the employees and over a dozen families to the Chaibasa Township for their security,” added Mahatha. Police and CRPF have launched intense operations in Sarjamburu-Sangajata forests where another CCM-cum-Politburo member Prashant Bose alias Kshan-da has been camping ever since Maoists shifted their eastern region bureau from Saranda forests to Sarjamburu. “They have also pasted posters denouncing the Forest Right Act and calling upon the innocent tribal villagers to join and intensify the armed struggle to drive away the forest officials to secure their rights on jal, jangal and jameen (water, forest and land). They have been asking the village heads to send youths to join their ranks and kill police and SPOs. This is another ploy to incite villagers against forest officials, another government apparatus. They want to create a free buffer zone bereft of any police and administrative presence to have complete domination over the area and villagers under their reign of terror,” said the SP.Kolhan DIG Rajiv Ranjan said this was old tactics of the Maoists. “Whenever they lose their foothold and become organizationally weak, they blow up schools, panchayat buildings, health centres, forest offices and guest houses to spread panic, protect their levy network. They are asking villagers to send their sons and daughters to join ranks because they have lost many extremists and control over the villagers. I appeal to the people to ponder who actually benefited from these so-called misleading fights for jal, jangal and jameen,” said Ranjan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-blow-up-several-buildings-of-jharkhand-forest-dept-torch-cars-bikes/story-eE7N4QJcn8T2qGjiP7NTJK.html

12-07-2020||India||India-EU Summit to focus on multilateral order in face of increasingly assertive China||India and the European Union (EU) will focus on strengthening multilateralism during their upcoming summit this week amid uncertainty created by the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of an assertive China, people familiar with developments said on Sunday.The 15th India-EU Summit, which was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak, will be held via video conference on July 15. The summit will be co-chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both sides felt the need to take the lead in bolstering multilateralism and cooperative international relations against the backdrop of the US ceding its leading role on the world stage.“This has created a vacuum that needs to be plugged, or else an aggressive China will only become more assertive,” one of the people cited above said. “The whole multilateral system is under stress and many experts have expressed doubts about the future of the global system.”In a blog titled “In a world of disorder, Europe needs partners” written on July 10, the EU’s high representative for foreign and security policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, noted that China has become increasingly assertive, while the Covid-19 pandemic was the first major world crisis “where the US is not in the lead” as the US administration has “mostly withdrawn from the global order it has built”.He further wrote of a “real crisis of multilateralism”, with the G7 and G20 being absent and the UN Security Council paralysed. He added: “Europe feels somewhat lonely, trying to hold the multilateral ring. For sure we know that we need partners.”Some preparatory work has already been done in this regard and external affairs minister S Jaishankar joined his European and other counterparts for a virtual meeting of the informal Alliance for Multilateralism on June 26, the people said.This alliance was launched by France and Germany in April 2019 after they felt the need to protect the rules-based multilateral order to ensure international stability and to resolve common challenges through cooperation.The alliance met in February and April before holding a virtual ministerial meeting on June 26. While participating in that meeting, Jaishankar reiterated India’s call for reformed multilateralism along with purposeful reform of existing structures so that they continue to serve the world even more in this complex and uncertain time.Jaishankar also referred to the two-pronged attack of “a viral pandemic and misinformation going viral”, and highlighted the need to strengthen scientific approaches to analyse the causes of the Covid-19 pandemic, assess multilateral health mechanisms, and take concrete steps to counter the “infodemic” in the context of a statement adopted by more than 130 states and observers on Covid-19 at the UN.The EU has already stated that multilateralism, with the UN and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core, is the cornerstone of the grouping’s foreign and security policy. As part of its efforts to strengthen multilateralism, the EU intends to act on three fronts – upholding international norms and agreements, extending multilateralism to new global realities, and reforming multilateral organisations.In a recent letter to the prime minister, European Commission President von der Leyen suggested common engagement of India and the EU for effective multilateralism and a cooperative approach to international ties, based on their shared values of democracy and pluralism.The people said India is hoping the July 15 summit can frame their partnership to preserve multilateralism and promote dialogue and cooperation to address global challenges.The external affairs ministry earlier said the summit will review India-EU cooperation in political and security relations, trade and investment, and economic cooperation. The summit is also expected to discuss developments related to the pandemic. The EU, in a statement, said the summit will be an opportunity to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two sides and to discuss cooperation in climate, environment, digital economy and connectivity.The last India-EU Summit was held in New Delhi in October 2017. The EU is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for trade in goods worth 80 billion euros in 2019 or 11.1% of total Indian trade, on par with the US and ahead of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-summit-to-focus-on-multilateral-order-in-face-of-increasingly-assertive-china/story-fKtuFbti9en3gXQ47NssaI.html

That order was also made through the fast track procedure (FTP) prescribed in India’s defence procurement rules.ALSO WATCH: Explained | Missiles, fighter jets: How India’s boosting forces amid China rowThe Sig Sauer rifles are being bought to meet the army’s requirement of a total of 8 lakh assault rifles, said a second official. The new assault rifles will gradually replace the flaw-ridden 5.56mm INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) rifles inducted around 22 years ago.The remaining requirements of the army will be met through a Make in India project for the local production of AK-203 assault rifles at Amethi’s Korwa, and this procurement is in its final stage with a committee ironing out pricing issues, said a third person.The FTP can be invoked in cases where “undue/unforeseen delay” in buying weapons is seen to be adversely impacting the military’s capacity and preparedness.According to rules, weapons sought under the FTP should already be in the military’s armoury, have been trial evaluated or be in service in foreign militaries so that the time required for evaluation is minimised.India has also ordered more stocks of Excalibur precision guided munitions from the US for its artillery guns, while Russia assured swifter delivery of weapons and ammunition during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to Moscow last month.Indian, Chinese commanders to meet this weekA fourth meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders is expected to take place along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh this week. Both sides are working on finalising the date, officials said. The military talks between corps commander-ranked officers are expected to focus on the critical Finger Area and the strategic Depsang plains. The next phase of the complex disengagement process is expected to begin after the fourth round of talks, the officials said. Previous military talks on June 30, set the stage for disengagement in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-to-order-72-000-assault-rifles-from-united-states-amid-border-row/story-1VBWcld6EDwOxe279f3n3H.html

12-07-2020||India||I-T dept’s utility helps banks, post offices ascertain TDS rates on cash withdrawals||The Income Tax Department on Sunday notified facilitating a new functionality for banks and post offices to help them ascertain the applicability rates of Tax Deducted on Source (TDS) on cash withdrawal of above Rs 20 lakh in case of a person who hasn’t filed income tax return and that of above Rs 1 crore in case income tax return has been filed.Under this facility, the bank or post office will now only have to enter the PAN of the person who is withdrawing cash for ascertaining the applicable rate of TDS. On entering PAN, a message will be instantly displayed on the departmental utility: “TDS is deductible at the rate of 2% if cash withdrawal exceeds Rs. 1 crore” [if the person withdrawing cash is a filer of the income-tax return] and “TDS is deductible at the rate 2% if cash withdrawal exceeds Rs. 20 lakh and at the rate of 5% if it exceeds Rs. 1 Crore” [if the person withdrawing cash is a non-filer of the income-tax return]”, according to the notification issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).CBDT said that this functionality available as “Verification of applicability u/s 194N” on the income tax department website www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in since 1st July 2020, is also available to the banks through web-services so that the entire process can be automated and be linked to the bank’s internal core banking solution.Data on cash withdrawal has shown that large amounts of cash is being withdrawn by people who have never filed income tax returns. Therefore, to discourage cash transactions, keep track of cash withdrawals by non-filers, increase tax compliance and curb black money, the government changed TDS rules for making cash withdrawals from banks and post offices from this month.As per the amended Income Tax Act, which came into effect from July 1, 2020, the threshold of cash withdrawal has been further lowered to Rs 20 lakh for the applicability of this TDS for the non-filers and also mandated TDS at the higher rate of 5% on cash withdrawal exceeding Rs. 1 crore by the non-filers.The CBDT note said that so far, more than 53,000 verification requests have been executed successfully on the new facility provided to banks and post offices by the income tax department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-t-dept-provides-utility-to-banks-post-offices-to-ascertain-tds-applicability-rates-on-cash-withdrawals/story-GSgxoMYgZqT2DpsHH12bQL.html

It is only after a project becomes successful you get your identity,” says the actor who had been part of hit show such as ‘Mirzapur’ and film such as ‘India’s Most Wanted’. “But my role was not much noticed before Jamtara,” says the actor over phone. Lucknow has played an important role in his journey as he his first major show ‘Mirzapur’ was shot here. “Season two of Mirzapur and my upcoming film ‘Pagglait’, which stars Sanya Malhotra have also been shot in Lucknow,” he says while insisting that he plays bigger and significant roles in both the web series and the film.“This year has been a tough for everyone, including myself, but career-wise it surely has given me a lot. Having said that, I will still say, ‘mera kaam utna important nahi hai jitni logon ki jaan (my work is not more important than lives of people,” says the actor who belongs to Nimbahera in Chittorgarh district. “My brother Imran was topper and me his opposite — to the extent that I failed in Class 3. My first artistic work was participating in school’s musical prayer on annual day where I played Congo. I grabbed a small role in a play, which was rejected my many.”His journey began with comedian Raju Srivastava’s ‘shaadiwallah’ stand-up act in 2003. “I was so impressed with the show that I took part in a stand-up comedy competition where I won the first prize. Winning the prize motivated me and started participating in events,” he says.After his father expired he started doing small jobs. “In 2010, I convinced my mother (Firdaus) and I went to Mumbai to become an actor. To sustain, I started working as waiter at a hotel. After few months, when I was working in the kitchen department, we had a party which was Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor’s reception. First time I saw film stars and Mr (Amitabh) Bachchan. Soon after, I left that job, started working in a mall and giving auditions. I was told to learn acting and do theatre,” he recalls.He went to Jaipur and joined a theatre group. “For 6 years I did theatre which became my passion. For a NSD group I did ‘Midnight Summer Dream’ for which I travelled all over India.” He returned to Mumbai and joined Abhishek Banerjee and Anmol Ahuja’s casting company. “I did casting for a year. Abhishek is my mentor and friend. If I am stuck anywhere, my first phone call is always to him. I did ‘Humorously Yours-2’ and ‘Pataal Lok with him.”Aasif also did cameo in films ‘Toilet Ek Prem Katha’, ‘Pari’ and ‘India’s Most Wanted.’“My life experiences are coming very handy. I have a large ‘emotion bank’ of my struggle period which I try to bring out in my roles.

12-07-2020||India||At loggerheads with Ashok Gehlot, Sachin Pilot is angry. Here’s why||Three days ago, Rajasthan plunged into a political crisis when Special Operations Group (SOG) registered a case of sedition in an alleged attempt to topple the Ashok Gehlot government. The FIR was based on interception of two mobile phones. Two people, whose numbers were intercepted, have been arrested and the SOG has issued notices to Gehlot, deputy chief minister Sachin deputy Pilot, chief whip Mahesh Joshi and some legislators to record their statements in the case.Pilot left for Delhi on Friday and at least seven Congress legislators also reached the capital at different times. All of them are first-time MLAs. The presence of Pilot and Congress MLAs in Delhi fuelled speculations that there was an attempt to topple CM Gehlot but people close to Pilot said the deputy CM went to bargain hard with the party leadership because he felt sidelined in the state government.ALSO WATCH | Rajasthan political thriller: Gehlot-Pilot tussle, SOG probe, resort politicsAlso read: Ashok Gehlot marginalised Pilot, Congress failed to settle issues in RajasthanThe problem with them started after Congress won the December 2018 Assembly elections and instead of Pilot, who had steered the party to victory, Gehlot was named the CM. After that, both of them have targeted each other in a subtle manner, without naming each other.The latest trigger was the issue of the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief. Pilot has been party president in the state for a long time and there’s talk of appointing someone else on the post to follow ‘one person, one post’ rule. People close to Pilot say he wants either his man in the saddle after him or an important portfolio.Before this, during the recent bureaucratic reshuffle of IAS and IPS officers, political commentators said Pilot didn’t get even a single officer of his choice posted. “Forget about IAS and IPS officers, he cannot even get a BDO (Block Development Officer) transferred or posted,” said one of the commentators who didn’t want to be named.Also read: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot to meet party lawmakers tonightThe buzz in the state bureaucratic circles is that Pilot has differences with bureaucrats in his departments, especially in the public works department (PWD). Political appointments are also due in the state and Pilot, obviously, wants some of his people accommodated.But, there has been friction between the two top leaders since the time of the government formation, which had led to a delay in the formation of the state government. The Congress party leaders said that after much persuasion, Pilot was able to get the post of deputy chief minister and some important departments. Pilot also had to bargain a lot to get some ministerial berths for legislators considered close to him.Since the government was formed in 2018, Gehlot and Pilot had been at loggerheads. Both Gehlot and Pilot have passed comments against each other without taking each other’s names on several occasions. Pilot had questioned his own government over the death of 107 children in a government-run hospital in Kota and had also repeatedly raised the issue of no meeting of the coordination committee constituted by Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to iron out differences between him and Gehlot. Political analyst Narayan Bareth said that there is a process in the political system and you have to invest time and hard work to reach a post. “Sachin Pilot is angry because he wants a lot of things in very less time. He is the state party chief, deputy chief minister holding various portfolios. Just like party invested in Ashok Gehlot, the Congress is also investing in Pilot,” Bareth said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-political-tussle-why-is-sachin-pilot-angry/story-6SViC35e5uATeqvCnY1EbJ.html

12-07-2020||India||First time in history, Jammu and Kashmir gives skip to martyrs’ day||For the first time since 1948, there will be no holiday and official functions to commemorate martyrs’ day in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.“In December last year, the list of gazetted holidays had no mention of martyrs’ day on July 13 and December 5, the birth anniversary of former J&K Prime Minister Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah. Therefore, the question doesn’t arise of holding any official function or declaring a holiday on Monday,” said a senior official.Following the revocation of Article 370 on August 5 last year, the government had issued a list of gazette holidays for the newly carved union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. However, July 13 and December 5 were omitted from the list inviting an outcry by the Kashmir centric parties.Also read: Authorities order partial lockdown in parts of Srinagar due to spike in Covid-19 casesThe then prime minister of J&K, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, had declared July 13 as martyrs’ day in memory of those who revolted against the Dogra rule on July 13, 1931. Twenty-two people were killed in the protest against the then Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh.While Kashmir commemorated the day as martyrs’ day and chief minister, ministers and DGPs used to pay tributes at the official programmes across the then state of J&K, in recent years Jammu had started observing it as a ‘black’ day.Pro-Jammu parties used to hold protest rallies wearing black armbands to express their resentment against the decision of successive Kashmir centric governments.The parties also included Kashmiri Pandits, who called July 13, 1931, as the first-ever communal attack on religious minorities in J&K.In the new list of gazette holidays, the government, however, declared October 26 as a gazetted holiday. On this day in 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh had signed the “Instrument of Accession” with the dominion of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-time-in-history-jammu-and-kashmir-gives-skip-to-martyrs-day/story-NtlNiC2NXnUjw50LQys3DK.html
12-07-2020||India||Indian online grocery market can exceed USD 3 bn sales in 2020: Goenka||The Indian online grocery market could exceed sales of USD 3 billion (about Rs 22,500 crore) in 2020, a substantial 76 per cent jump over the previous year, Spencer’s Retail Chairman Sanjiv Goenka said.  The preference for online delivery of products became more visible following the Covid-19 outbreak, he added. Spencer’s Retail, part of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka (RPSG) Group, had acquired online supermarket and grocery store Nature’s Basket in July 2019. Consumers opted to buy essentials and other products from home in a bigger way than they had done in the past, he said. “The result is that India’s online grocery market could exceed USD 3 billion in sales in 2020, a substantial 76 per cent increase over the previous year following a demand spike for the home delivery of fresh produce,” Goenka said in his address to shareholders in the company’s Annual Report for 2019-20. With increased access to smartphones and low data costs, shoppers now prefer an omni-channel shopping experience, he added. Spencers Retail is attractively positioned to capitalise on the omni-channel opportunity, he said. “The company did not just respond to this sectoral inflexion point with a relevant mobile application and home delivery; it invested in enhancing proximity to consumers through phone call-based delivery, Chatbots and WhatsApp-driven product delivery using its stores as hubs,” Goenka said. Besides, the retail chain collaborated with Uber and other delivery partners for product supply, strengthening its last-mile capability. According to Spencer’s Retail CEO Devendra Chawla, the company’s online business experienced a milestone in FY20 where it not only consistently scaled the number of monthly active users but also positively turned around its unit-level economics. “Our unit-level economics grew 45 per cent with a substantial increase of 125 per cent in our registered customer base. On the overall, the number of orders grew 175 per cent, which helped us significantly moderate delivery costs,” he said. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the company operated 90 per cent of its stores across the country “We will accelerate our transformation and deepen our relevance,” said Goenka. “We believe that our competitiveness will be derived from omni-channel consumer access, judicious store rollout, distinctive positioning in the minds of our consumers, a balance of lifestyle and essential products, a shift towards nonfood & apparel in the product mix.” Headquartered in Kolkata, Spencer’s Retail operates 191 stores (including Nature’s Basket) of various formats in 42 cities. Spencer’s Retail posted a revenue of Rs 2,373.29 crore in FY 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-online-grocery-market-can-exceed-usd-3-bn-sales-in-2020-goenka/story-4qhkMBm2pnlQqm7Pcoo5TN.html
12-07-2020||India||SC to deliver verdict on 9-year long Padmanabha Swamy temple management case tomorrow||After a nine-year legal battle, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court will deliver its verdict over the management of the Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram, one of the richest shrines in the world, on Monday.Devotees are upbeat as they hope uncertainty over the management of the temple will be over facilitating smooth functioning of the shrine. A spokesperson of the royal family also expressed confidence that a favourable verdict will be given to preserve the age-old shrine.“Sanctity of the temple is supreme. We hope everything will be settled,” said Velayudhan Nair, a regular at the temple for 52 years. The Fort Association of Residents, an umbrella organisation comprising devotees around the temple, is also upbeat.The temple shot to fame after an estimated wealth of Rs one lakh crore was unearthed during the SC-ordered inventory from one of the subaltern vaults of the sixth century temple in 2011. After this the number of visitors increased manifold and it turned into a major pilgrimage and tourism spot in south India.The erstwhile royal family of Travancore had moved the apex court in 2011 against the High Court order that handed over the temple management and assets to the state government. The apex court had later stayed the HC verdict and ordered the inventorying of the temple.When one of the secret vaults was opened in 2011, treasure estimated at Rs one lakh crore was found. There are six chambers-- later coded A to F-- under the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. Of these, two are usually opened during the daily pooja and two twice a year and the remaining two (A&B) are secret vaults.The second secret chamber “B” is yet to be opened and devotees and temple officials claim it may contain more wealth than the “A” vault. But the erstwhile royals, former custodians of the temple, opposed it strongly saying “it was against tantric customs and rituals and may bring trouble to the city which originated from the name of the presiding deity” (Thiru Ananatha Puram-- the land of Sree Padmanabha, Lord Vishnu).During the hearing both the state government and the royal family had said they had no claim over the wealth found in one of the vaults as it belonged to the deity and the temple. The sixth century Vishnu temple was believed to be rebuilt by then King Marthanda Varma who defeated Dutch colonizers in the Battle of Colachal in 1741. The legend goes that after he won the war he dedicated his victory to the presiding deity and ruled the kingdom as ‘Padmanabha dasan’ (servant of Lord Padmanabha).A retired IPS officer T P Sundararajan, a staunch devotee, was the first to move the court in 2008, alleging large-scale pilferage at the temple. He claimed that many precious ornaments and jewels were smuggled out replacing them with lookalikes. Later the case was moved to High Court which handed over the management to the state government. While staying the HC order in 2011, the Supreme Court had ordered inventorying and later divested the royal family from managing temple affairs and formed an apex body to run the temple till the final verdict. In 2012, Sundararajan died while inventorying was half-way through.As the legal battle prolonged there were suggestions to preserve the wealth of the temple, now manned by a battalion of commandos. During the earlier NDA regime, Minister of State for Tourism K J Alphons mooted a high-security museum to keep the treasure.He had called on the royal family with an idea to build a Rs 300 crore underground museum near the temple. He assured the Centre will bear all expenses for the world-class museum and convert it into a major attraction of the country but the royals were not moved. With the final settlement round the corner, many feel there will be a decision on the wealth as well, lying in underground vaults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-deliver-verdict-on-9-year-long-padmanabha-swamy-temple-management-case-tomorrow/story-Rh6xbtCYoHoTP1LnBFiVeP.html
12-07-2020||India||Finance Ministry amends rules to disallow global firms from govt contracts up to Rs 200 cr||The Finance Ministry has amended rules for all government procurement disallowing global firms from participating in tenders up to Rs 200 crore, a move that is in line with the ‘Atamnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (self-reliant India) economic stimulus package announced in mid-May.“Now, no Global Tender Enquiry (GTE) shall be invited for tenders up to Rs 200 crore, unless prior approval is obtained from Cabinet Secretariat,” the ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The move aims to benefit domestic micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), it added.The statement was issued after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman reviewed implementation of various announcements of the Rs 20 lakh crore package that related to ministries of finance and corporate affairs. Sitharaman is also minister for corporate affairs.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an address to the nation on May 12, had announced about the financial package to stimulate Covid-19 pandemic-hit economy following which the finance minister unveiled details of the package in five-tranches from May 13 to May 17, 2020. While announcing the last tranche of the package on May 17, Sitharaman had said the Centre had also accepted the demand of states to raise their borrowing limit from 3% of their respective GSDP to 5% that would give them additional resources of Rs 4.28 lakh crore at this time of Covid-19 crisis. The increased limit was, however, conditional and depended on implementation of reforms by them in four areas — one-nation-one-ration-card, ease of doing business, power distribution and urban local body revenues, she had said.Sunday’s statement by the finance ministry also issued a formal communication to state governments raising their borrowing limits by 2% of their projected gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 2020-21 subject to implementation of specific state-level reforms, the statement said.In order to give relief to contractors, the department of expenditure (DoE), an arm of the finance ministry, has issued instructions to central agencies such as railways, ministry of road transport and highways and Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to give them additional time up to six months for completion of contractual obligations, it said.Giving details of the Rs 3 lakh crore collateral-free automatic loans for businesses, including MSMEs, it said loans worth Rs 1.20 lakh crore have been sanctioned under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and moans worth Rs 61,987 crore have been disbursed. “Fund was registered on 26.05.2020. In a short period of about one and half months noticeable progress has been achieved in identifying units, sanctioning as well as disbursing of loans to MSMEs,” it said.The package also announced a Rs 45,000 crore Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme to strengthen non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and micro finance institutions (MFIs), where the Union government would provide 20% first loss sovereign guarantee to public sector banks. “Banks have approved purchase of a portfolio of Rs 14,000 crore and are currently in process of approval/negotiations for Rs 6,000 crore as on July 3, 2020,” the statement said.It said that Rs 24,876.87 crore has been disbursed to small and marginal farmers as on July 6, as a special facility for kharif sowing. The scheme envisages Rs 30,000 crore additional emergency working capital funding to farmers through the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).The statement said the Central Board of Direct taxes (CBDT) had already issued refunds in over 20.44 lakh cases amounting to more than Rs. 62,361 crore between April 8 and June 30. “Remaining refunds are under process,” it added.It said the ministry of corporate affairs is finalising a special insolvency resolution to provide relief to the MSMEs and the same would be notified soon.Reacting to the finance ministry’s Sunday notification, Ranen Banerjee, leader - Economic Advisory Services at consultancy firm PwC India, said that there is a need to speed up the disbursements under the guaranteed collateral free loans as it is still under 25% of the allocated Rs 3 lakh crore.“The additional borrowing limit to the states is conditional. It will have to be seen how many states are able to move quickly to be able to meet the conditions. Some states may not need the additional limits as they have been constrained in their ability to spend,” he said.The government has moved fast in putting the necessary notifications and guidelines in place, he said. “It will now be for the implementing agencies to demonstrate the urgency. The actions clearly work in progress and we need to move fast with the approvals and disbursements under the various liquidity measures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finance-ministry-amends-rules-to-disallow-global-firms-from-govt-contracts-up-to-rs-200-cr/story-MpMq6Trz5sD5fyC4fBGKUM.html
12-07-2020||India||CCTV monitoring, powerless water coolers on trains soon as Railways to launch 20 in-house innovations||The Railway Board has decided to implement 20 innovations by its employees to make train journeys safer and improve passenger comfort - such as a bell warning to alert travellers minutes before a train departs, real-time CCTV monitoring inside coaches, printing of unreserved tickets through mobile applications - on a mass scale.The Railways launched a dedicated portal in 2018 to solicit the good ideas attempted by its employees across zones, aiming to implement some of them across its network. Since then, zonal railways have uploaded their entries on the web portal.From September 2018 to December 2019, the portal received 2,645 entries.Of which, the Board has identified 20 for initial mass scale implementation across the railway network, according to an order issued by it on July 10.An official said that an order has been issued to all zonal general managers and production units to gear up for the implementation of these ideas.Most of the 20 innovations are aimed at technical improvements to boost safety.The North Central Railway has developed a vehicular system for ultrasonic flaw detection of rails, which is currently done manually. The Malda division of Eastern Railway has used pyrometers to monitor speed and temperature of tracks. The carriage and wagon department of Allahabad division of North Central Railway has developed a detector for hot axle box in running trains much before a possible derailment due to seizure.Some of the innovations are also directed at passenger comfort.The Western Railway has developed natural water coolers, with zero electric consumption, each at a cost of Rs 1.25 lakh and a lifespan of ten years. The system works on principle of heat transfer where water is passed through copper coils which are covered with cooling fabric active through a water dripping system. These coolers have been installed at Borivali, Dahanu Road, Nandurbar, Udhana and Bandra railway stations.A bell system -- developed by Allahabad division -- alerts passengers at platforms that the train is ready to depart within two minutes and they should occupy their seats. This is already in use on platform number one of Allahabad junction railway station.On the list is also a system to monitor real-time CCTV footage on board trains. While the coaches in Humsafar trains have CCTV surveillance, the footage is not monitored in real time. The NCR has developed a system for real-time monitoring inside trains and has installed it in all 18 coaches of Humsafar trains.The CCTV display unit is provided in the guard’s compartment and the videos can be recorded and viewed later; it is aimed at quick resolution of crimes on board trains.Another innovation the Railways is looking at is air quality monitoring equipment developed by NCR and installed at Allahabad railway station.With the coronavirus pandemic encouraging people to go contact-less, the Northern Railway developed a system through which they issued unreserved tickets through mobile apps and bluetooth printers.This pilot project helped Railways to open online UTS ticketing counters at stations, platforms, tent cities and passenger holding areas without UTS connectivity and uninterrupted power supply as these devices work on lithium-ion batteries and SIM cards.The Railway Board has instructed the zones to furnish implementation reports of these 20 innovations within the next three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cctv-monitoring-powerless-water-coolers-on-trains-soon-as-railways-to-launch-20-in-house-innovations/story-pd0iXJfwKo4mJsG87tm7CK.html

12-07-2020||India||Not a conducive time for polls; impose President’s Rule if needed: Tejashwi Yadav||Leader of Opposition in the Bihar assembly, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)’s young face, Tejashwi Yadav will encounter his biggest political challenge in the upcoming state assembly polls he has to contest in the absence of his incarcerated father, Lalu Prasad. He spoke about the political landscape in an interview:1) Is the ground situation conducive for free and fair polls in Bihar, given the pandemic? A: On Covid-19, I have been requesting the government since March that testing be done on larger scale and the capacity of institutional care be enhanced. However, it fell on deaf ears. The abject failure of the Nitish government in handling the pandemic and the migrant workers issue has led to chaos and insecurity among the people. There seems to be no containment and mitigation strategy in place. Bihar is worst hit and health experts fear countless deaths primarily because of the abysmally low testing and dilapidated medical infrastructure. In my opinion, this is not the appropriate time to conduct elections considering the alarming spread of this disease. I will be the last person to have an election on dead bodies. If Nitish Kumar acknowledges that Covid is still a crisis, elections can be postponed until the situation improves but if he thinks Covid is not a problem, elections must be conducted with traditional means of electioneering. Let there be a fair ground for all parties, and allow rallies, door-to-door and full-fledged campaigns. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United) are parties of capitalists and have immense resources. (So) restricting the medium of campaign would be antithetical to the very purpose of election in a democracy. President rule could be a stop-gap interim arrangement if constitutional obligation requires it.​​​​2) Is the RJD ready to contest if elections are held on time? How prepared are you to reach out virtually to the electorate?A: RJD’s campaign will not be about spending big monies. We will enter the election with principled-politics that speaks to the marginalised and the poor in a down to earth manner. Our campaign will not be a spectacle, it’ll be based on genuine communication of our plans rooted in the aspirations of the people. We shall go to the people with a robust blue-print for transforming Bihar in education, health, agriculture, employment and industrialisation.The political wisdom of the people from my state is unmatched. They are fed up with the ever rising corruption, crimes, unemployment, inflation and flip-flops of Nitish Ji. Yes, it’s going to be a challenge to switch to virtual canvassing. For poor parties like us and others, who don’t have money to pay for such huge expenditures to counter them, it would be unfair and amount to robbery of democracy and mandate. Sensing defeat, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has started tweaking the rulebook of Election Commission (EC). Postal ballots for Covid patients, virtual rallies and all should be seen in that context. Physical canvassing helps in understanding the problem and needs of the voters as its more interactive.3) The RJD-led alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls could win only one seat that was in the Congress quota. So there are questions about the combine’s viability. A: Parliamentary and assembly elections are two different things. Issues and circumstances are different. Assembly elections are fought on local day to day governance issues concerning the people’s basic needs: education, migration, infrastructure development, job creation, and of course, health. Despite the machinations at the BJP-JD-U’s disposal, our alliance will sweep this election. This ruling combine can’t always fool and cheat the people with false promises and by fomenting fears. They have pushed Bihar further into backwardness in their 15 years of rule. Everyone in Bihar knows how the mandate was hijacked in 2017 (when Nitish walked out on RJD). The BJP is in power with Nitishji without any reason and vision.4) Some of your smaller allies including Jitan Ram Manjhi have reservations about your projection as the combine’s chief ministerial face. You also have detractors in the Congress’s state unit.A: This is not the time to be bogged down with such considerations. We must have credible plans for a historical alternative for Bihar. Democratic politics is nothing without such pushes and pulls. Only a delusional person can think that he has no opposition or no detractors. My eyes and mind are all open. In any alliance, it’s a settled principle that the party having a larger presence is chosen its leader.5) How confident are you of keeping the alliance intact? Have you had talks with Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders to expedite an electoral pact?A: Consultation and deliberation on seat sharing and common minimum program are underway. I am confident of bringing together a credible, committed and progressive alliance. Anyone familiar with the history of RJD knows that we have a stellar record of building alliances. Laluji facilitated the most historic, progressive alliances that gave alternatives in politics. But it’s important to note that the RJD has been equally comfortable in the opposition. We never climbed into any “winning permutation”, we never abandoned our principles in exchange of morsels of power. 6) You recently sought forgiveness for mistakes, if any, during the 15 year rule (from 1990-2005) of your father and mother. Is that your way of reaching out to forward caste communities with whom your party has a history of troubled relations? The question’s pertinent as Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, an old colleague of your father recently quit as vice president of RJD.A: No person or regime can be perfect. If anyone thinks he’s perfect, he is mistaken. Our 15 years took governance to the doorsteps of the poor and marginalised. That’s why the people rewarded us for 15 years. I wasn’t around then, still I don’t hesitate to accept shortfalls if there were any.One needs to understand the history of Bihar which has been a victim of chronic neglect. The problems are many and difficult to tackle. Laluji and Rabriji privileged social justice in a deeply feudal society. A sense of equality, a possibility of egalitarian governance was communicated to the people.We are committed to reaching out to all sections of the society. Bihar cannot progress if all communities do not participate. Raghuwansh Babu is a senior leader and a fatherly figure to me. He is there in the party. But will Nitishji tender apology for the mandate he violated before the 2014 polls and by walking out on the RJD in 2017? Will he seek forgiveness for 55 scams, the Muzaffarpur shelter home case, the migrants’ issue, highest unemployment and deteriorating education, health and law and order in Bihar?7) The regret you qualified with an IF is seen also in the context of chief minister Nitish Kumar’s challenge to debate his 15 years with those of your party’s rule.A: Nitish Kumar is such a winning face that in his entire life he hasn’t ever fought elections on his own. Why doesn’t he fight alone and see the result of his 15 years of rule? Let him showcase his achievements if he has any and seek mandate. The fact that he constantly talks about the predecessor government is a testament that he has nothing to talk about his own performance. He should explain as to why Bihar ranks the lowest on all indicators of NITI Aayog, NHM and other evaluating agencies. Can we progress if we constantly talk of the past? I would not let fear mongering drive the upcoming election.8) In the 2015 elections, you had your father by your side and Nitish Kumar on your side. Now Nitish is with BJP and you have to make do without Lalu Yadav’s real-time presence in the campaign. The odds seem daunting….A: Laluji is always with us. His guidance comes not just from his words in real time but from his principles and his example. The magnitude of the task is big but I’m not alone. I belong to a party of people who stood their ground in the era of horse-trading. I belong to a generation of young people who are inspired by his brand of Laluwadi politics.Lalu Ji’s absence is something which can never be compensated but as party workers we have his blessings, motivation and guidance. We have taken the resolve to fight and win this election as a tribute to the sufferings Lalu Ji is made to go through by this fascist government. I am confident that the resilience, hard work and passion of each RJD worker would bear fruit in the upcoming polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-conducive-time-for-polls-impose-president-s-rule-if-needed-tejashwi-yadav/story-KLflIHjhjNm66Twq35605O.html

The DGTR is a single-window agency providing a level-playing field to domestic industry against unfair trade practices of countries like China.“Evidence show there are no producers in Cambodia and Singapore, and Chinese producers are apparently exporting through these countries,” the official said quoting DGTR’s investigation report. HT reviewed the report.“The examination of the evidence is indicative of the fact that significant imports have been reported from Cambodia and Singapore, which are allegedly Chinese origin products,” the report said. Dumping is an unfair trade practice that entails the export of a product at a price lower than its value and is countered by a punitive duty, which is an acceptable measure under multilateral trade agreements.Mekhla Anand, partner at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said numerous such cases were noticed by the government that saw amendment of the Customs Tariff Rules, 1995 last year to widen the scope of anti-circumvention measures. “Antidumping duty measures have to be coupled with measures to prevent circumvention of the rules so as to ensure that the domestic industry is not unfairly targeted by non-domestic players,” she said.DK Aggarwal, president at the PHD Chamber of Commerce & Industry said that China has been resorting to unfair trade practices. “As a result, unfair competition from low cost imported (Chinese) products has impacted the sentiments of domestic manufacturers, resulting in significant effect on production processes and employment creation,” he said.“Anti-dumping duties significantly help in supporting the domestic industry, however, it is not very much helpful in case of China due to its extreme unfair trade practices,” he said, adding that the government should strictly impose quality assurance norms to check the import of counterfeit products.On May 11, HT reported that India could extend anti-dumping duties and safeguards on more than two dozen Chinese goods ranging from calculators and USB drives to steel, solar cells and vitamin E amid concern that a flood of imports would kill domestic manufacturers who will lose duty protection soon against such products. Anti-dumping duties on these products were imposed five years ago and are expiring this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-imposes-levy-on-all-imported-measuring-tapes-as-chinese-dumping-continues-via-third-countries/story-HSR5eKcZNjYvrntAq3JSsN.html

With passing time, that role changed to performing the last rites of people who lost their lives in road mishaps and their bodies were not claimed.Amid these pandemic-ravaged times, the organisation continues to serve the city quietly and selflessly to grant dignity to the dead.For three years, urns containing the ashes of the unknown are preserved with the organisation before they are immersed in the Ganga at Soron, near Kasganj. Even for Covid-19 fatalities, Kshetra Bajaja retains the ashes of the dead so that if a bereaved next of kin turns up, they may be handed over the ashes of their loved one.Also read: Kejriwal says Delhi is able to minimise Covid-19 deaths due to ‘protective shield’Kshetra Bajaja Committee is a body active since 1885. At that time, the cloth merchants of Agra gathered together and decided that instead of doing charity on a small, personal level, the society would benefit more if a collective effort, channelled towards a single cause was made. And thus, was born the Kshetra Bajaja Committee.Over the years, so concerted and well-directed have the efforts been that they were asked to manage the traditional crematorium, and in 1996, when the electric crematorium was built, the Agra district administration immediately handed over affairs of its functioning to the Kshetra Bajaja Committee.Today, its members - some 700 cloth merchants of Agra - contribute to arrange for the requirements of the electric crematorium and wood for the traditional crematorium and other requirements, like the running of the five vehicles used to take bodies to the crematorium.And it is not just the crematoriums the organisation runs but also an ayurvedic hospital in the city and is also actively involved in meeting the needs of the impoverished sick in the city’s hospitals, like providing medicines, arranging for oxygen cylinders, etc.At the electric crematorium, there are 15 to 25 bodies cremated every day in its three furnaces. “Sometimes, the number goes up to 30 as bodies of Covid-19 patients are also brought for cremation,” said Kshetra Bajaja Committee president Sunil Vikal.“Our members are selflessly contributing to this service despite them facing a tough time themselves in these times. In such a situation, we do expect the administration to extend a helping hand to the Kshetra Bajaja Committee in serving mankind,” Vikal added.He said that when the lockdown was imposed, there was a restriction on vehicles which drastically brought down the number of fatalities in road mishaps and the number of unclaimed bodies coming for cremation dropped.“We have been preserving the ashes of those unknown or unclaimed bodies which we cremated and immerse them in Ganga at Soron near Kasganj after every three years. In these times of the pandemic, family members of a deceased Covid-19 patient are in quarantine and are unable to attend the last rites or collect the ashes. We have been preserving ashes in such cases also and wait for family members to come and collect them.“There are 50 to 60 urns of such Covid-19 cases cremated at the electric crematorium and we have saved the ashes with dignity with a condolence message wrapped around them, awaiting family members to come and collect them. Many came in the unlock phase and took the ashes, thanking the committee,” Vikal said.“The acceptability of the electric crematorium among citizens has seen a surge in these times of the pandemic,” he said.However, this acceptability is new-found. “In the beginning, no one was prepared to cremate their dear departed in the electric crematorium even though it saved precious trees from being felled. There were various awareness campaigns launched to make the electric crematorium acceptable among people but that acceptance was slow to come,” Vikal said.“There was a time when only the socially aware and environmentally concerned would come to the electric crematorium but slowly and steadily, people have begun to opt for the electric crematorium without any bar of caste or economic status. That acceptability has been enhanced due to the pandemic as the cremation here at the electric crematorium is less cumbersome and manageable by a few,” he said.“With the pandemic raging, cremations at the electric crematorium have exceeded those in traditional crematoriums as our staff extends help to the few next of kin accompanying the body while wearing personal protective equipment. Otherwise too, cremations in the electric crematorium are less cumbersome and get over faster as we have three separate furnaces operating at 800 degrees Celsius,” Vikal said.“The number of cremations at the electric crematorium is thrice the number of traditional cremations where family members have to carry wood and prepare funeral pyre on their own. Now, only a limited number of family members accompany the dead, even if it’s a non-Covid death and thus, the utility of electric crematorium is being realised by Agra residents,” he added.The Kshetra Bajaja Committee also working toward creating eco-awareness among Agra citizens by organising seminars and talks about the utility of an electric crematorium while listing the ecological damage in preparing for a traditional cremation. With that aim in mind, it also organises walks for school children. However, it is left to family members whether to opt for the traditional method or use the electric crematorium. The committee never contacts bereaved families but has its staff at the electric crematorium which arrives to work the furnace if a body is brought in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agra-s-kshetra-bajaja-committee-is-providing-dignity-in-death-to-deceased-covid-19-patients/story-vEaoDkwkvk1hBhfeSZrK9N.html

12-07-2020||India||UP govt forms judicial commission to probe Kanpur ambush, Vikas Dubey encounter||The Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday appointed one member judicial commission to probe into the Kanpur ambush and various other incidents including the police encounters with gangster Vikas Dubey and his aides.A spokesperson of the state government said the commission, to be headed by retired justice Shashi Kant Agarwal, has been mandated to probe into the various incidents that took place between intervening nights of July 2-3 and July 10, including encounters between criminals and police at various spots. The commission will submit its report within two months, he said.The constitution of the judicial commission comes a day after the Yogi Adityanath government set up a three-member special investigation team (SIT) headed by senior IAS officer Sanjay Bhoosreddy to probe different aspects of the Kanpur ambush case.According to a state government statement, the SIT will also look into a failed raid that eventually led to the ambush, the nature of action taken against Dubey and his group in the past few years, and the gangster’s alleged links with policemen and government employees.Dubey was killed on the morning of July 10 when he allegedly tried to escape the custody of Special Task Force (STF) following an accident involving the vehicle in which he was being taken to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh.The STF had come under fire from various quarters with the opposition alleging that the encounter was staged to eliminate a criminal who could have possibly revealed uncomfortable details of a police-criminal-politician nexus in the state.The STF claimed that Dubey was shot dead after he opened fire and refused to lay down the weapon. He had been arrested in Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday morning, a week after he and his gang members ambushed a police team killing eight policemen.The gangster and four of his aides have been killed in separate encounters between July 3 and 10.The one member judicial commission, which will be headquartered in Kanpur, will probe into the ambush on the police team by Vikas Dubey and members of his gang on the intervening nights of July 2-3 in which eight policemen were killed and several others were injured, the government spokesman said.It will also probe into the July 10 encounter between police team and Vikas Dubey as well as all the encounters between police personnel and members of Vikas Dubey gang that took place between July 3 and July 10 at various spots, he said.It will also inquire into the nexus between the Vikas Dubey, members of his gang with policemen as well as the personnel of other government departments and people. The Commission in its report will also give its recommendation to the state government to check the repeat of such incidents, the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-forms-judicial-commission-to-probe-kanpur-ambush-vikas-dubey-encounter/story-odRx9RjUwBHaK6BkrkC6NO.html

12-07-2020||India||Dubey aide Arvind Trivedi sent to judicial custody, will be taken to UP for interrogation||The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) produced Arvind Ramvilas Trivedi, a close aide of slain gangster Vikas Dubey and Trivedi’s driver Sushilkumar Suresh Tiwari in Thane court on Sunday and both the men were sent to judicial custody till July 21. ATS officials said, the Uttar Pradesh police are on their way to Mumbai and will take them to Kanpur to investigate their roles in connection with the case of eight policemen killed by Dubey and his associates.According to an ATS official, Trivedi and his driver fled from Uttar Pradesh soon after the killing of eight policemen at Bikru village near Kanpur, in the intervening night of July 2 and 3, by Dubey and his associates. “Both went to Madhya Pradesh and from there they came to Pune hiding in a truck. After that they changed the vehicle and took another truck and arrived at the Kolshet area in Thane,” he said.ALSO READ | Vikas Dubey’s close aide arrested from Thane by Maharashtra ATS team“The Juhu unit of the ATS received a tip-off regarding Trivedi, known by the alias Guddan. The Juhu unit under the guidance of superiors laid a trap at Kolshet Road, Thane and nabbed accused Arvind Ramvilas Trivedi and his driver,” ATS officials mentioned in their statement.Dubey, who was a history-sheeter and has approximately 60 criminal cases against him, absconded and was ultimately arrested in Ujjain on July 9. He was killed in an encounter on July 10, while being brought back to Kanpur by UP Police. Trivedi is suspected of being involved in the murder of UP state minister Santosh Shukla, who was killed inside the Shivli police station in Kanpur, in 2001. Dubey was the main accused in the case, which saw 25 policemen, brought in as eyewitnesses to the murder, turn hostile in court. The UP state government had announced a reward of Rs 50,000 in exchange for information on Trivedi’s whereabouts.Following Trivedi’s arrest, the UP Police issued a press statement confirming Trivedi was an associate of Dubey. “Following the arrest made by Maharashtra ATS, it has come to light that Arvind Trivedi is an old member of Vikas Dubey’s gang. Investigations are being conducted to ascertain if he was involved in the incident at Bikru village. Arvind has not been named in the FIR,” the UP Police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dubey-aide-arvind-trivedi-sent-to-judicial-custody-will-be-taken-to-up-for-interrogation/story-XKr66ehP0Vi2pOWzOYAXvJ.html
12-07-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot marginalised Pilot, Congress failed to settle issues in Rajasthan||The simmering tension between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot reached a tipping point when the latter got summoned by his state police on July 10 for an investigation into a plot for destabilising the government.It underlined, according to a senior Congress leader, the deep distrust of Rajasthan CM towards his able deputy chief minister and a bid to marginalize Pilot in the party and in the government that was formed in 2018. Although a similar notice was sent to Gehlot, asking him to record his statement, but a Pilot loyalist said that the deputy chief minister felt the probe is set to target him. A similar notice was sent to Gehlot but pilot loyalists said that the deputy chief minister felt he was the target of the probe.There were several bids to undercut Pilot in the past two years. But the Congress central leadership chose to ignore the warning signals. Finally, the party formed a coordination committee for Rajasthan in January this year but that panel so far has held just one meeting.The Congress’ inability to nip problems at the bud was aptly expressed by Kapil Sibal. As news of Sachin Pilot screamed headlines, Sibal tweeted, “Worried for our party... Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables ?” Just four months ago, the Congress lost its government in Madhya Pradesh in a similar script: party veterans sidelining Jyotiraditya Scindia. Worried for our party Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables ?To be sure, the start of the new Congress government in the desert state was not exactly a smooth affair. Pilot, who left his family in Delhi to sweat it out, led the Congress campaign as the president of the party to victory, but Gehlot outstepped him to become the chief minister, primarily weighing on caste equations.Party insiders added that for the past few months, the Gehlot camp has been demanding a change of guard in the Rajasthan Congress in a bid to remove Pilot from the state president’s post. They have started lobbying with Congress functionaries in Delhi that a new state chief is required (Pilot is holding the position for 6 years) before the ensuing panchayat election in the state.Even as then Congress president Rahul Gandhi met the two leaders over several rounds to hammer out a solution, the uneasy equation between the Congress’ old generation and the new generation came to the fore.Last year, chief minister’s son Vaibhav Gehlot lost the Lok Sabha election, and senior Gehlot lost no time to blame Pilot for the defeat. He publicly stated that “Pilot should take responsibility” even as many party leaders questioned the chief minister’s inability to ensure victory for his son.Earlier this year, Pilot had expressed concern about deteriorating law and order situation in some areas of the state - seen as a comment on Gehlot who holds the home portfolio in the government.A few months ago, the Rajya Sabha elections too saw tension rising between the two. Gehlot fielded Neeraj Dangi, a secretary of Congress party, for the coveted Rajya Sabha seat. Pilot wanted a bigger, well-known name but Gehlot stuck to his choice. And then, ahead of the polls, Gehlot alleged that Congress MLAs are being lured, indicating the party might lose a seat. The results proved to be otherwise and Congress secured seats for both candidates.Pilot, who was credited for the victory, maintained that “Any kind of doubts and suspicions spread around earlier were baseless.”The death of 107 children in Kota also brought out the difference between the two in which Pilot maintained that the state government needs to do more to prevent such incidents.Another party insider points out that Pilot’s people are not being rewards. Many posts for political appointment are lying vacant and Gehlot is in no hurry to accommodate Pilot loyalists in these posts.Last month, at a function at party headquarters to observe Sanjay Gandhi’s death anniversary, Pilot announced that as the party president in Rajasthan, he owes it to the Congress grassroot workers who worked very hard and therefore they need to be rewarded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-marginalised-pilot-congress-failed-to-settle-issues-in-rajasthan/story-YG59eQqehsVI6Zl1dy1ddJ.html
12-07-2020||India||Authorities order partial lockdown in Srinagar to combat Covid-19; over 60 containment zones designated||Authorities on Sunday ordered a partial lockdown in Srinagar by designating over 60 containment zones amid a surge in coronavirus cases over the past week, officials said. The lockdown will be imposed in 68 containment zones of the city from Monday and no movement would be allowed in these areas without permission, they said. “In view of the major spike in Covid-19 cases, we will have to carve out containment zones for effective restrictions in different areas of Srinagar. Local cooperation is solicited in best interest of public health,” District Magistrate, Srinagar, Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said. He confirmed the reimposition of the lockdown. The decision to reimpose the lockdown in these areas of city was taken at a meeting late Saturday evening, the officials said. The city has witnessed a spike in the number of coronavirus cases over the past one week. The total number of positive cases has reached 1,611, out of which 1,075 are active. While the union territory administration had first announced a lockdown across Jammu and Kashmir on March 22 as part of its efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus, restrictions were imposed in many parts of the valley, including in the city, on March 19 after the UT saw its first positive case from Srinagar. The lockdown was then gradually eased in June and the markets in the city reopened after about three months in the second week of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/authorities-order-partial-lockdown-in-srinagar-to-combat-covid-19-over-60-containment-zones-designated/story-UTVTXy7mzq2LeBi8QmVx4L.html
12-07-2020||India||Those testing negative for Covid-19 but showing symptoms should be treated: Experts||Test results may come out  negative even if one has contracted Covid-19, experts have warned, advising that those showing symptoms of the disease must be treated without waiting for a confirmatory test to prevent aggravation of the infection.There have been several cases where patients showing clinical symptoms of Covid-19 have tested  negative for the virus multiple times.They were confirmed positive after repeated tests, doctors said.The general perception of the experts now is that a high degree of suspicion arising out of the clinical symptomatology and the CT scan reports should be the guiding factor for treatment rather than relying only on the RT-PCR test which has a sensitivity of only 70 per cent, Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor in the Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, said.Even the rapid antigen test has a sensitivity of only 40 per cent.“So many patients will be missed if we rely only upon these tests,” Dr Gupta said.The antibody tests has a sensitivity of 90 per cent but they are only useful for confirming past exposure for SARS-CoV2 and have no value in the early stages of the disease.“All the treatment strategies should be guided  towards preventing the progress of the disease from its mild to moderate or moderate to severe and for that we cannot wait on test reports. We have to go by clinical symptoms,” he explained.Dr Vijay Gurjar, an assistant professor in the department of Geriatric Medicine at AIIMS here, said there have been several instances where the patients tested negative even after three or four RT-PCR tests despite clinical presentations and CT scans indicating atypical pneumonia which is highly suggestive of Covid-19.  Later on, they were found to have antibodies against coronavirus which means they had the infection but their results had not come out positive in the RT-PCR tests, he said “Thus, if patients have the symptoms, more so, if he or she is an elderly or has co-morbidities, they should be treated on the lines of Covid-19 and managed accordingly without waiting for the test confirmation,” Dr Gurjar said.According to Dr Nikhil Modi, senior consultant of Respiratory, Critical care and Sleep Disorder at the Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, one of the main reasons behind incorrect test results is the improper procedure of sample collection from the throat and the nose.“If the sample is not collected in a proper manner, then it may lead to incorrect results. Also the viral load plays an important role, as when low, the test results may come out negative even if the patient has the infection,” Dr Modi said.“In cases where symptoms are highly suggestive of Covid-19 and the RT-PCR test continues to be negative even after repeated tests, a CT scan of the lungs can be useful in reaching a correct diagnosis,” he elaborated.The AIIMS’ Resident Doctors’ Association recently had written to the ICMR seeking formation of an expert committee for provision of professional enquiry for the unexpected, unexplained deaths during the pandemic.  A comprehensive diagnosis of Covid-19 verified by the expert committee involving clinical history, examination, imaging, biochemical, molecular testing and forensic investigations must be considered as cause of death in absence of an alternative diagnosis so as to help the bereaved families of the frontline healthcare workers to get compensation, it said.“This is to bring to your kind notice that many of the healthcare workers have lost their lives in line of their duty in Covid-19 pandemic. As per the literature sensitivity of none of the tests performed for Covid-19 diagnosis is 100 per cent.“This has led to alleged misdiagnosis of some health workers who succumbed to Covid-19-like illness,” the letter stated.The AIIMS RDA mentioned the recent death of Dr Abhishek Bhayana, junior resident, from the department of Dental surgery at Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences, New Delhi, who presented with symptoms of sore throat and breathlessness.The death summary clearly mentions manifestations consistent with Covid-19 but his test results had come out negative, the RDA said. Dr Gurjar said that major policies regarding compensation for corona warriors should not be decided just on the basis of microbiological reports.  “The clinical presentation and other findings shouldn’t be ignored.We should have a comprehensive approach for Covid-19. Timely response and intervention will definitely help in improving patient’s outcomes with suspected Covid-19 clinical presentations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-testing-negative-for-covid-19-but-showing-symptoms-should-be-treated-experts/story-8tsLKYLLXobInHBQZUoDqK.html
12-07-2020||India||Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot’s supporters come to Gurugram resort, call police summon a joke||At least 19 Congress legislators are now supporting Sachin Pilot, the deputy chief minister of Rajasthan who by his absence from the state this weekend has fuelled major speculation about an imminent exit and split of the party. The absence came soon after the special operations group (SOG) of the state police’s anti-terror squad posted a notice at his residence to appear for questioning.The questioning is to take place in connection with the case registered on Friday by the ATS that there was a plot to bring down the Ashok Gehlot government. The first information report (FIR) and the alleged tapped phone conversations have put on record what has otherwise been an open secret—that chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy do not get along. Also read: ‘No meetings with Sachin Pilot,’ maintains BJP; says ‘no role in trying to topple Gehlot govtWhat everyone is now wondering is if this episode will push Pilot to quit the Congress party.A central Congress leader who reached out to Pilot said that he has not been taking their calls. “This was taking humiliation to a different level. He just got a call on Saturday that they had posted this notice and left. Is this how a deputy chief minister is treated?’’ a leader, who is close to Pilot, asked.While officials of the Rajasthan government say that the notice was also sent to the chief minister as well, the leader quoted above called the summon a “joke”.“The chief minister also holds the home portfolio, so how can they question him? This is all very sinister as this FIR will give them a reason to put surveillance on the deputy chief minister,’’ the BJP leader said.As the fallout of this very public saga slowly unravelled, the resort drama has now started.Pilot’s supporters are lodged in various resorts, including an ITC Grand Bharat in Gurugram. ITC Bharat has previously played hosts to rebel MLAs and it was where the Karnataka legislators were also brought during the crisis facing the Kumaraswamy government.Also read: Amid reports of turmoil in Rajasthan govt, Sachin Pilot meets Ahmed PatelPilot’s location was in Delhi on Saturday but unclear at present.Pilot came to Delhi and met senior leader Ahmed Patel to discuss the issue.

12-07-2020||India||As SOG sends notices to Rajasthan politicians, chief minister clarifies||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot clarified on Sunday that the notices sent to him and other leaders by Rajasthan Police’s Special Operation Group (SOG) are just meant to record their statements.“The SOG has sent notices to chief minister, deputy chief minister, chief whip and others ministers and MLAs to record their statements after a complaint by the Congress about the BJP’s attempt to buy legislators. Some media outlets are presenting it in a different way which is not right,” Gehlot tweeted in Hindi. एसओजी को जो कांग्रेस विधायक दल ने बीजेपी नेताओं द्वारा खरीद-फरोख्त की शिकायत की थी उस संदर्भ में मुख्यमंत्री, उपमुख्यमंत्री, चीफ व्हिप एवम अन्य कुछ मंत्री व विधायकों को सामान्य बयान देने के लिए नोटिस आए हैं। कुछ मीडिया द्वारा उसको अलग ढंग से प्रस्तुत करना उचित नहीं है।The SOG had sent notices to these leaders seeking their time for recording statements in connection with the alleged attempts to topple Congress government in the state.The notices stated that the SOG had urged the leaders to provide a suitable date and time for recording their respective statements.The SOG had said on Saturday that it has arrested BJP members Bharat Malani and Ashok Singh for allegedly trying to topple the government by offering Rs 20-25 crore bribe each to unspecified legislators - a charge levelled by Gehlot. A First Information Report (FIR) was filed against the two under Indian Penal Code’s sections related to sedition and criminal conspiracy on Friday.The complaint is based on a purported conservation between the two over the phone. According to the FIR, the attempts to topple the government started last month.The Congress has 107 members in the 200-member House and also enjoys the support of 18 other lawmakers. The half-way mark in the assembly is 100; the BJP has 72 legislators.Gehlot had on Saturday accused the BJP of trying to “buy legislators like goats” for the purpose amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He had further said at a virtual press conference that the BJP’s “brazen attempt” was thwarted by the Congress.“The BJP needs to realise that it is not Madhya Pradesh. They have succeeded in MP, but we are alert now, they will not be able to destabilise the government here,” he had said.Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia dismissed Gehlot’s allegations and said they were a result of infighting within the Congress. “This entire strategy has been worked out by the chief minister to prevent factionalism from coming out in the open.”His reference was to the alleged uneasy relationship between Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-sog-sends-notices-to-rajasthan-politicians-chief-minister-clarifies/story-aVA1wNyPQhnwzObUQnbtzO.html

They held discussions over the present political situation.“The ministers and MLA are meeting the CM. Most of the party legislators and independent MLAs have met the CM since yesterday. Around 95 of 107 MLAs have in written expressed faith on the party and his leadership,” said a close aide of the government.Independent MLA Babu Lal Nagar, said, “We are meeting the CM to express faith and confidence in his leadership. The MLAs have confidence in Gehlot’s leadership.”Nagar said that he has also received a notice by Special Operation Group (SOG) of Rajasthan Police for his statement.

12-07-2020||India||‘India’s main opponent is China not Pak, govt’s foreign policy has failed’: Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and former defence minister Sharad Pawar said that the issues with China should be resolved with dialogue and diplomatic strategies with the help of intervention by other nations and the United Nations. Pawar also said that India’s main opponent is China and not Pakistan but New Delhi cannot afford a direct war with it.Pawar, in the second part of the three-part interview to Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, said that the Modi government tried to take a different stand on India’s relations with other countries but it did not work.“We never changed our foreign policies for the relations with other countries and they were in continuation since Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi or even Atal Behari Vajpayee’s rule. Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to take a different stand by calling Chinese President Xi Jinping on friendly visits and treated him on a swing (at the banks of Sabarmati). Modi tried to create a picture of having created ties of friendship with the neighbour. But these efforts have not worked,” he said.Also read: CM made a cautious decision to ease lockdown - Pawar in Saamana interviewPawar said that China has successfully wooed all neighbouring countries including Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka against India. “PM Modi’s first visit after taking over as the prime minister was to Nepal, but the neighbour now stands by China. Pakistan has already shifted its loyalty. India played a major role in the liberation of Bangladesh, but the country recently inked an agreement with China. Same is the case with Sri Lanka. This means all the countries surrounding India have started talking against it. The disagreement in relationship with these neighbours is the ‘latest contribution’ (of Modi government),” he said.The NCP chief said that the issues with China cannot be resolved by war. “Our military strength is just a tenth of China’s and in such a backdrop, we cannot have direct war with the neighbour. It is true that we have readied our military forces and could have a war and are ready to pay the price if the need be. But instead of that, we should try to solve it with diplomatic strategies and dialogue. We have lost our territory to China more than 50 years ago and we have our dispute with it over it. We should build pressure with the help of other countries and the United Nations to regain it,” he said.Pawar said that though China’s first enemy, almost three decades back, was the United States or Japan, it has now started posing against India and it was its strategy. “When I visited China as defence minister in 1993 and met the then president of China, he had hinted at this. He had said that the country does not want to have any clashes with the neighbouring countries as their main target at that point of time was the US. He had said that they will look at neighbouring countries after about 25 years,” he said.Pawar, while replying to a question by Saamana’s executive editor Sanjay Raut, said that the country’s economic crisis needs to be handled differently. He said that the Modi government needs to adopt a different policy for the revival of the economy which has been in the crisis in the view of the global Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-main-opponent-is-china-not-pak-govt-s-foreign-policy-has-failed-pawar/story-zmsbw8V8CAzC4Bs0EflKdN.html
12-07-2020||India||India at good position in battle against Covid-19 : Home minister Amit Shah||India is at a “good position” in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic and the country will fight the disease with determination and enthusiasm, Union Home minister Amit Shah said on Sunday. Shah spoke after participating in a mega plantation drive initiated by the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) that has a target to plant about 1.37 crore saplings in their country-wide campuses by this month-end. “The world is seeing that if a successful battle has been fought anywhere across the globe against the coronavirus it is India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. “It was feared that how would a large country like ours would face this challenge given that we have a federal structure of governance, dense population of 130 crore people and no single chain of command,” Shah said. He was speaking after planting a peepal tree at the CRPF officers’ training academy campus in Kadarpur village here. The 130 crore people of the country, all the states and every individual fought this battle against Covid-19 as one nation, he said. Across the globe, governments are fighting this disease but in our country everyone has joined hands, Shah said. “We are at a good position in this coronavirus battle and will continue this fight with determination and there is no atmosphere of fear. We have the passion to battle it and enthusiasm to defeat it (coronavirus),” Shah said in his address to the chiefs of various CAPFs and troops who heard him over a webinar link. As the home minister of the country, I can proudly say that the security forces of the country have a “big role” to play in this battle fought by India, he said. Shah noted that Covid-19 is a very contagious disease that challenges the very existence of the human kind. Saluting the ‘corona warriors’ of the CAPFs and other security and police forces, the minister said they have set a new example of rendering their duty and fighting the pandemic at the same time. He said over 31 CAPF personnel have laid down their lives while rendering Covid-19 duties out of which ten personnel are from the Central Reserve Police Force. “I assure you that your sacrifice will not go in vain. Your sacrifice will be written in golden words,” he said. Talking about the importance of trees in environment protection, the home minister urged the personnel of these forces to adopt at least one plant and ensure that they protect it till it grows bigger than them. “Consider the plant like your child and treat it with the affection and care that you bring up your children,” he urged the personnel. “We are facing challenges of global warming, rise in temperature and depletion of the ozone layer.Only trees can save us from environmental challenges and they can help to lessen the existing pollution and nothing else,” he said. He said the home ministry, under the ongoing mega plantation drive, has chosen the maximum of those plants which have a life span of over 100 years so that they can help preserve the nature for long. Shah also said that he believes that his ministry should have a culture that all projects or initiatives launched by it should reach successful completion. The Modi government, he said, is working to bring in more clean fuel and as part of that we are enhancing the usage of ethanol over petrol. “I am happy to say that between 2014 and 2020 the production and consumption of ethanol in the country has risen by 20 per cent and we further plan to increase it by another 10 per cent,” he said. During the event, CRPF chief A P Maheshwari informed the minister that all the CAPFs are undertaking the mega plantation drive and his force will plant over 22 lakh saplings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-at-good-position-in-battle-against-covid-19-home-minister-amit-shah/story-03lcSg4OiQbMKl0EZGduAO.html

Deepak Paliwal, didn’t feel inhibited or have second thoughts before deciding to volunteer for a human trial for coronavirus vaccine led by the Oxford University.In an interview with the BBC, Paliwal said he kept thinking how could he contribute to the global fight against coronavirus and decided to enrol as a volunteer for the human trial. He thought his brain may not be of any use but his body can certainly contribute.Also read: India now recording 12% of daily global Covid-19 cases, shows dataPaliwal said he learnt about the trial on April 16 and visited one of the five centres in London for his preliminary check-up and screening on April 26. His wife did not support his decision at first. He said he had only informed his close friends and wife about his decision.Paliwal said his friends played a huge role in supporting him. During the course of the trial, he was told about various hazards that he could face, the possibility of him collapsing or suffering organ failure. He even read a report about a volunteer dying amid the trial. But all this could deter Paliwal in his resolve. Forty-two-year-old Deepak Paliwal hails from Jaipur, Rajasthan and lives with his wife in London, United Kingdom.

12-07-2020||India||Revolutionary writer Varavara Rao is unwell in, hallucinating, says his family||The health of prominent revolutionary poet and Maoist ideologue P Varavara Rao, who has been lodged in Mumbai’s Taloja Jail, has deteriorated, his family said on Sunday.Rao is facing trial in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence case of January 1, 2018, and also on charges of being part of a plot hatched by Maoists to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.He was arrested in by Pune Police first in August 2018 and after he was released on bail following a court order, he was rearrested in November 2018. He was first lodged in Yeravada Jail in Pune and later moved to the Mumbai prison.Rao’s wife Hemalatha and daughters Sahaja, Anala and Pavana said while speaking to reporters they were worried about his deteriorating health, as was evident from the phone call they had received on Saturday.“He appeared to be in a state of delirium and hallucination, as he was talking about the funeral of his father and mother, the events that happened seven decades and four decades ago respectively,” Hemalatha said.“His co-prisoner took the phone from him and informed us that he is not able to walk, go to the toilet and brush his teeth on his own. We were also told that he is always hallucinating that we, family members, were waiting at the jail gate to receive him as he was getting released,” she said.Rao’s co-prisoner also told the family that he needed immediate medical care for not only physical but also neurological issues.“The confusion, loss of memory and incoherence are the results of electrolyte imbalance and fall of Sodium and Potassium levels leading to brain damage,” Hemalatha said.She pointed out that her husband’s health has not been good for over six weeks now, ever since he was shifted in an unconscious state to the JJ Hospital from Taloja Jail on May 28.“Even as he was discharged from the hospital and sent back to jail three days later, there has been no improvement in his health. The earlier two calls on June 24 and July 2 were also worrying with his weak and muffled voice, incoherent speech and abruptly jumping into Hindi, which was quite worrying,” she said.The family said they were not bothered about issues like whether the case against the revolutionary writer was fabricated, that he had to spend 22 months in jail as an undertrial with the process turned into punishment and his bail petitions getting rejected at least five times now.“His life is the topmost concern for us right now. Our present demand is to save his life. We demand the government to shift him to a better hospital or allow us to provide required medical care,” the family said in a statement.“We want to remind the government that it has no right to deny the right to life of any person, much less an undertrial prisoner,” they added.In April, around 40 prominent writers wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting Rao’s release in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Several members of Parliament, cutting across various political parties, also wrote to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with a request to provide medical care to Rao and to shift him to a hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/revolutionary-writer-varavara-rao-is-unwell-in-hallucinating-says-his-family/story-oGX4FhshP8Hekeonst8HYJ.html
12-07-2020||India||On foot, boats health workers visit 1.8 lakh houses for malaria eradication drive in Bastar||A usual day for Mukesh Bakshi, a rural medical assistant, and his team starts at 9am in the morning. They enter the deep jungles of south Sukma, a severely Maoist-affected region of Chhattisgarh, with their elaborate medical kit for screening and treatment of malaria patients under a campaign started by the state government.Under the Malaria Mukt Bastar Abhiyan, the state government is conducting community-based active screening and treatment in seven districts of Bastar division to reduce malaria parasite load.Bakshi and his team have covered six Maoist-affected villages, where no one from the government other than health workers can enter, in the last 10 days under the campaign.“We are actually working in the core area of Maoists… This is the Chintagufa area, which is dominated by Maoists but they have never interrupted our movement for work,” Bakshi said while speaking to HT.“As we enter any village, we are stopped by some lower-rung cadres and once they are assured that we are health workers and working for the eradication of malaria, they let us go,” he added.There are 6,607 people deployed in 2,804 teams to conduct the anti-malaria campaign in these seven Maoists-hit districts. The teams comprise Mitanin workers and trainers of the community health volunteer programme and Anganwadi workers.Supervisors, medical officers, AYUSH doctors and rural medical assistants (RMAs) have also been also engaged for supervision at the local level.These survey teams have to cross rivers and streams on boats and travel on foot—sometimes walking for around 10 to 15 kilometres—through forests and hilly areas to reach the targeted villages.Tulsi Thakur, who covers the borders of Dantewada and Narayanpur that are not easily accessible, said villagers in deep jungles give easy entry as malaria is the biggest problem in the region and tribals want to get rid of it.“I have to cross two rivers to reach my area and till now I have covered about 1,000 people under the campaign,” said Thakur.According to state government data, 318 people have died in the Bastar division in the last 10 years due to malaria. Bijapur district with an annual parasite incidence of 44.31 and Sukma with 31.33 were among the worst-hit districts by malaria in the country in 2019.The government says malaria is also the main cause behind anaemia and malnutrition in pregnant women and children in these areas.“One of the various objectives of this screening is also to reduce IMR (infant mortality rate) and MMR (maternal mortality rate) in the area. Reduction of malaria prevalence in such areas would also lead to an improvement in the socio-economic condition of the tribal community as it would lead to less expenditure on morbidity and also would prevent wage loss happening due to constant morbidity,” Priyanka Shukla, the director of National Health Mission (NHM), said.The first round of the Malaria Mukt Bastar Abhiyan was held from January 1 to February 23 this year during which door to door visits were made by health teams to around three lakh households.“Usually there is a spike in cases during and immediately after monsoons. Therefore, we started the second phase now and have combined surveillance for Covid-19 along with it since our teams are going door to door anyway,” Niharika Barik Singh, the state’s health secretary, said. The second round of the campaign is currently continuing in a phased manner in the seven districts of Bastar division. A total of 23.46 lakh population has been targeted for this round.Till July 10, health teams made the door to door visits to 177,985 houses in which 17,509 people were found to have malaria. Out of the positive cases, 10,890 or 62.8% cases were asymptomatic.“As compared to 2018 (same period), a 27% decline has been observed in malaria cases after the first round. With the second round ongoing and third round to be organised in November after the intensive implementation of the campaign, more promising results are expected in the days to come,” said NHM’s Shukla.“This would also have a tremendous long term impact on health indicators especially maternal and child health,” she said adding that the second phase is ongoing and 65% of the target population still remains to be covered.People in Bastar say they are expecting positive results for this campaign and are supporting the health workers engaged in Maoist-hit areas.“The health workers are doing a tremendous job by giving us treatment and creating awareness about malaria. We people have also supported them and sometimes we accompany them to other deeper villages,” Dharmendra Sethiya, a resident of Chintagufa village, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-foot-boats-health-workers-visit-1-8-lakh-houses-for-malaria-eradication-drive-in-bastar/story-c5etmG1lCRHVchK078HLnM.html
12-07-2020||India||Amid reports of turmoil in Rajasthan govt, Sachin Pilot meets Ahmed Patel||Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot and his supporting legislators in the state may have left Jaipur on Saturday, setting off alarm bells about a split in the Congress party in the state, but he had tried to warn the top brass two weeks ago.Hindustan Times has cofirmed from leaders of both sides that Pilot came to Delhi and had a special one on one meeting with senior leader Ahmed Patel to discuss this issue. In the meeting, Pilot told the senior leader known to be a close aide of party president, Sonia Gandhi, that his differences with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had gone too far.“There were a long list of grievances that he spoke about,’’ said one leader aware of developments. However, it is unclear if there was any follow-up action to that meeting. Pilot also met other senior leaders like general secretary in charge of organisation, KC VenugopalThe two leaders have had a rivalry that’s well known in party circles. When Congress won the 2018 elections by 107 in the 200 strong assembly, the fight between the two factions came to the fore as Pilot refused to sit back after having worked as the state president and claiming the victory as part of his efforts. Gehlot dug in his heels as well and finally then party chief Rahul Gandhi found a middle path where he made Pilot the deputy chief minister.However, as one leader pointed out, this turned out to be more on paper than in reality. “The deputy chief minister had limited powers and wouldn’t be consulted on any decisions in the state. Most of the times he found out about cabinet decisions from media reports,’’ said one leader who didn’t want to be identified.While it is unclear what emerged from the Delhi meeting, as both Ahmed Patel and Sachin Pilot were unavailable for comments, senior leaders are now speaking out.

And in all inter-state checkposts you need an entry pass. It is certain high-ranking officials had escorted them,” said president of the BJP’s Kerala unit K Surendran. He added that it was another blot on the state government.The Congress has also sought a high-level probe. “Almost a week has passed since the case came up. Not a single FIR was filed against Swapna Suresh though many cheating incidents against her surfaced including fake degree certificate. Her escape adds to the mystery,” said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala.The police, meanwhile, said they will investigate how Suresh and Nair escaped amid triple lockdown and travelled more than 800 kilometre. Suresh is set to be produced at the NIA office in Kochi on Sunday.The scam came to light after the Customs department seized 30 kg of gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to the country’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram last Sunday. Suresh, who was working as an IT consultant under the state IT Ministry, had gone underground after the seizure.Later, chief minister Vijayan had transferred his principal secretary M Sivasankar who was reported to be close to Suresh. The Union home ministry had later handed over the probe to the NIA which arrested the accused from a hotel in Bengaluru.Who is Swapna Suresh?The life of Suresh (42) is shrouded in mystery. She is believed to be close to many high-ranking officials and politicians. An Inspector General (IG) of Police had made a complaint to Kerala police chief Loknath Behra to order an inquiry against Suresh.She was employed in Space Park and Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited (KSITL), which comes under the state IT department. Suresh has earlier worked with Air India-SATS (a joint venture between Air India and SATS Limited for airport service and ground handling operations).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-bjp-congress-question-how-swapna-suresh-other-accused-managed-to-cross-state-s-border/story-PcUvtmTBkLYmyvUAuUa7VK.html

12-07-2020||India||Interstate bus services in Delhi may resume this week. What you need to know||Authorities have said interstate bus services to and from Delhi are likely to resume from Monday or Tuesday after they were suspended in March following the coronavirus pandemic.All the three interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi—Anand Vihar, Kashmere Gate, and Sarai Kale Khan—would reopen after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) gave its nod to resume interstate buses in the national capital.The three ISBTs witnessed a combined footfall of more than 250,000 every day before the pandemic.More than 3,400 buses from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Chandigarh would ply daily.According to government reports, the transport department is losing more than Rs 5 crore every month after the three ISBTs were shut.Here is what you need to know:* Officials have said fewer passengers than usual may board buses and no passenger will be allowed to stand once the ISBTs are operational.* Provisions are being made for the disinfection of buses after each trip along with the screening of passengers.* Departures and arrivals of buses will also be staggered to avoid crowding.* Passengers can travel across state borders without travel passes under the Unlock 2.0 guidelines issued by the central government on June 30.* Transport officials said some neighbouring states are apprehensive about resuming services as of now because of the high number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital.* They said Rajasthan has shown an interest in resuming interstate services with 70 buses initially.* Dheeraj Sahu, Uttar Pradesh’s transport commissioner and managing director of Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC), has said the state is not plying any buses outside UP as a precautionary measure. * “The UP government will decide when our interstate bus service will resume,” Sahu said.* Dr Amarpal Singh, Punjab’s state transport commissioner, said the state has resumed interstate transport services.* “As far as we know, the Delhi government’s interstate bus services are shut. We will consider restarting our bus services to and from Delhi once we hear from them,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interstate-bus-services-in-delhi-may-resume-this-week-what-you-need-to-know/story-YDsVKXri1jueqDbYXl0UtI.html
12-07-2020||India||No buffer zone on LAC, only suspended patrolling to avoid flareup on border||Soldiers of China’s People’s Liberation Army and Indian Army have moved back at least 600 metres from the four friction points in east Ladakh where they were in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times after an on-ground verification by the army.The PLA soldiers, who had maintained an aggressive posture, have also taken a step back at other locations along the 1,597 km Line of Actual Control in the western sector.Initial reports had indicated that the PLA troops had moved 1.5 km from the stand-off point.Military officials said this implied that there was no buffer zone.“All we have done is that both sides have withdrawn to rear positions so that no accident or flare-up takes place,” a senior military commander said.It was in this context that external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Saturday described the “disengagement and de-escalation” process with China as “work in progress”. Jaishankar said the process had been mutually agreed upon and just commenced.“What’s happened is that we have agreed on the need to disengage because the troops on both sides are deployed very close to each other,” the external affairs minister told an event organised by India Inc, a UK-based media house. India and China on Friday said they would push forward efforts aimed at complete disengagement and easing of tensions along the LAC even as differences remained over issues such as Beijing’s insistence of claiming ownership of Galwan valley.Officials said the disengagement had been completed at Galwan with neither of the forces sitting on or next to the LAC. The situation at Patrolling Point 15 (Gogra) and Patrolling Point 17 (Hot Springs) is that troops on both sides have disengaged although they are still some distance away from their positions on April 20, the day when the PLA’s troop buildup started. The first violent clash between Indian and Chinese patrols on the northern bank of Ladakh’s Pangong lake took place a fortnight later. Scores of soldiers (from both sides) were injured in the skirmish involving 250 men.At Pangong Tso, the Chinese PLA has withdrawn from Finger 4 relief but some troops on both sides are still sitting on the ridge-line above it. Troops are also in close proximity at the Depsang Plains area but the broad indications are that both sides want to end the impasse.Military and diplomatic officials said the two sides had decided to halt patrolling at the four stand-off points - Galwan, Gogra, Hot Springs and Pangong Tso - without prejudice to their patrolling rights as a precaution. This will help reduce temperatures on the border and avoid any chance of an accident.India and China had agreed to a similar suspension of patrolling after similar stand-offs at Finger 8 in Pangong Tso in 2008 and at Depsang Bulge in 2013 were resolved.The senior military commander cited above said the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is dismantling structures and moving vehicles back at the stand-off points in daylight to maintain transparency. It also wants Indian troops to move back the same distance as there is a trust deficit between the two sides. “It only requires a spark to catch fire and undo all the dialogue,” said a senior military commander.Military commanders of the two countries are expected to hold the fourth round of dialogue next week to build on the icebreaker conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. On Friday, the joint secretary-level Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs held their meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-buffer-zone-on-lac-only-suspended-patrolling-to-avoid-flareup-on-border/story-agU8TnnMk0EjhdLzfz6GFM.html
12-07-2020||India||Political killings cause fear among youth leaders in J&K, BJYM Baramulla chief tenders resignation||After killings of a number of political leaders by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir, a sense of fear and insecurity has started creeping into politicians in the Valley.And first to express it is BJYM president from Baramulla, Marouf Bhat, who on Saturday tendered his resignation.“I hereby resign from the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a member and from any post I held in BJYM. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to work for the Party,” Bhat posted on his Facebook account. BJYM is the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).BJP leader Sheikh Waseem Bari, his brother and their father, and Congress Sarpanch Ajay Pandita were recently killed in the Valley.Talking to HT over phone, Bhat said, “We can sacrifice our life for the nation but not of our children. I have been attacked twice in the past but nothing has been done so far. I have not been given even a single PSO (personal security officer).”Bhat informed that he would send his resignation in due course of time to J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina.“They (the militants) are not only targeting us but our families also. We have not been given any security and accommodation in a secured place. Now, our families are at risk,” he said.Bhat claimed he has support of over 400 workers with him in Baramulla.“We have small children. God forbid, if something untoward happens to them, we won’t be able to forgive ourselves,” he said.The BJYM president from Baramulla claimed that many BJP leaders like him in north and south Kashmir were scared after what happned to Bari and his family.He urged the party high command to look into the matter in right earnest.BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav is likely to visit Kashmir on Sunday to meet the family of Bari who was killed in Bandipora last week (July 8).His visit was being seen as an attempt to boost the morale of the party leaders and cadres in Kashmir Valley.On the evening of June 8, 40-year-old sarpanch Ajay Pandita was killed in Anantnag district by the terrorists. Pandita aka Bharti was associated with the Congress and belonged to the minority Kashmiri Pandit community that was first persecuted and then driven out of their homes by terrorists in 1990.Following Pandita’s gruesome killing, over half a dozen Panchayat members - all Kashmiri Pandits - had fled the Valley and reached Jammu. They had sought security cover.J&K lieutenant governor GC Murmu in a recent interview to Hindustan Times had said that security cover to Panchayat members could be thought of in cases where threat perception was more.Following the killing of Bari and his family, the BJP’s senior vice president Narinder Singh has also demanded an immediate security review and enhancement wherever required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-killings-cause-fear-among-youth-leaders-in-j-k-bjym-baramulla-chief-tenders-resignation/story-3oYHB3zq9pgNgboQHqyG1O.html

Jalpaiguri recorded 93 mm rainfall in 24 hours till 8.30 am on Saturday, while Siliguri recorded 61.4 mm.More showers are expected in the region over the next two days.Kolkata too was lashed by rainfall, leading to traffic snarls in parts of the city. A yellow weather warning has been issued for heavy rainfall in middle hills of Himachal Pradesh on Sunday, Shimla Meteorological Centre Director Manmohan Singh said. The weather office issues colour-coded warnings to alert people ahead of severe or hazardous weather that has the potential to cause “damage, widespread disruption or danger to life”. Yellow is the least dangerous of all weather warnings.Una was the hottest place in the hill state with a maximum temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius.The maximum temperatures in Haryana and Punjab hovered close to normal with forecast for some spells of rain in the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flooding-in-parts-of-north-bengal-yellow-weather-warning-for-heavy-rain-in-himachal/story-28tNxMp5E3uaOokVvx5wqJ.html

Talking about the restrictive practices and roadblocks created by certain countries for the Indian film industry, he said India will reciprocate in similar manner, if such issues are brought to the notice of the Government. “Goyal said that single-window clearances for various permission for film shooting in the country, simplification of processes, online clearances, implementation of e-governance are genuine demands of the industry which need early consideration,” the commerce ministry said in a release. Goyal also expressed concern “at the unregulated OTT platforms, where the content is sometimes objectionable, contains misinformation, portrays poorly our country and society, and is just not worth watching with family”.Goyal lauded the role of the Indian Cinema for its contribution in fight against Covid-19, and playing an important role in spreading the awareness about various health precautions. He said that film industry, which is a symbol of Indian soft power, has been contemporary, and reflects the aspiration of the young Indians. He said that 1.35 billion people of the country have the aspiration and big appetite for entertainment, and the film industry always rose to the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unregulated-otts-a-concern-says-piyush-goyal/story-YUeEOCGt4Mil5m6h5mw71L.html
12-07-2020||India||Existential WFH Qs for the weekend (it is the weekend, right?)||If I’m working from home, do I need to get dressed for work every day? In the interests of decency, yes, unless you are not going to be doing any video conferences — in which case, it’s entirely up to you. Victor Hugo, legend has it, did his best work when nude.a. Do I need to dress up for work every day? Most workplaces went casual long before the pandemic (Brooks Brothers has applied for bankruptcy), and athleisure has been a trend for well nigh a decade-and-half, so there is no need to dress up. Try and avoid shorts, though, especially if you are going to be on a video conference that requires a jacket.P.S. In general, avoid shorts. Most people pay scant attention to their legs when working out and, therefore, to quote a line from a film magazine I read in a doctor’s waiting room in my school years, have legs that look like “a road roller ran over their bottom half”.b. What do you wear to work every day? Now, we are getting personal. Still, my work uniform (that’s how I have defined it for years now) has changed — from jeans and a white shirt (the same brands and styles always) to linen trousers and a T-shirt made by an Indian start-up which makes the best T-shirts in the world (no names). And once in a while, I wear one of my old Grateful Dead T-shirts — but I used to do that even when I was going into office.Will people judge me by my Zoom background? You bet they will. People think books are a neutral background, but if the video conference is long and boring (most are), enough participants will read the spines and then judge you for not just the background, but also your reading habits.a. What’s your Zoom background? We are getting personal again. Right now, it’s the album cover of King Crimson’s The Court of the Crimson King (Great music, Mellotron and all that; and it turned 50 late last year).It’s also a good way to judge people in reverse — depending on whether they are able to recognise the background. I’ve been in three work-related Zoom calls in the past few days (I usually use MS Teams, which is boring when it comes to backgrounds), one with economists and fund managers from a sovereign wealth fund (no one recognised it), another with consultants from a global consulting firm (no luck again), and a third with a panel of people including the director of the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta (she did, so you know the answer if your next question is on what I consider to be the best B-school in the country).Should I have a time by when I log in to work and a time when I log out? Ideally, yes, but the unfortunate truth is that most managers (including me, I’m sorry to add) believe that they can call anytime and also set impossible deadlines (I’ve noticed that I am suffixing most of my requests with, “After all, you are working from home...”)a. When do you log in and log out? Personal again. But you don’t want to know lest your manager reads this.Is it alright to take an unscheduled break from work to throw a ball for your dog in the garden? It is alright to take a break from anything, and at any time, to throw a ball for your dog in the garden.What day of the week is it? I don’t know.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/existential-wfh-qs-for-the-weekend-it-is-the-weekend-right/story-qB0YDWCZVuuMVcegOboCpI.html
12-07-2020||India||No deaths in home isolation in 10 days, says Delhi govt||The Delhi government on Saturday said its home isolation model for Covid-19 patients is largely successful with no reported deaths among those recovering at home in the last 10 days.Data provided by the government, which was also presented before chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by the health department on Friday, showed that the number of Covid-19 deaths in Delhi has declined over the past two weeks. Delhi’s fatality rate also declined from 3.64% (before June 24) to 3.02% (between June 24 and July 8).According to Saturday’s bulletin, 34 people died in a single day, which is the lowest number of deaths reported in a single day in a month. The number of Covid-19 cases in the Capital now stands at 110,921, which includes 87,692 recoveries and 3,334 deaths.During the fortnight between June 24 and July 8, 691 people died of Covid-19 in Delhi (an average of 46 deaths per day), the government said. The daily health bulletin reported 93 fresh deaths on a single day on June 16—the highest number of deaths in a single day in Delhi so far.While sharing the data, the government, however, did not give the number of Covid-19 deaths in Delhi based on the ages of the deceased persons. The categorisation of deaths based on co-morbidities and non-co-morbidities was also unavailable when this report was filed.“Of 691 deaths that took place during the last fortnight, only seven deaths took place in home isolation (between June 24 and June 30). Not a single patient in home isolation died in July. We can attribute this to the chief minister’s decision to distribute pulse oximeters to all patients in home isolation. The use of these oximeters alerts the patients of a drop in oxygen levels, which is an early sign of deteriorating health,” read the government statement.The report prepared by the health department also stated that Delhi’s overall death rate in June came down to 3.02% from 3.64%. It stated that during these two weeks, the delay in hospital admission was among the cause of death of 28 Covid-19 patients. Of the 691 deaths, 505 patients were in serious condition when admitted to hospitals. Of the 505 patients, 291 were already in a hospital by the time their test results came out, government officials said.A media advisor to the chief minister said that 15% of the 691 deaths took place during the first 48 hours of hospital admission, while nationally, 45% deaths in India have been taking place within this time frame.“One reason for the declining fatality rate is that the condition of moderate patients is not turning severe because of plasma therapy. The therapy seems to have favourable initial results. This could further bring down the mortality rate in Delhi,” a government official said.On Friday, Kejriwal led a review meeting to discuss what measures need to be taken to further reduce mortality.“Since now, almost all deaths are taking place in hospitals and not in home isolation, it was felt that systems in each hospital need to be examined in detail. The CM has asked for the ratio of deaths to the total number of patients discharged in each hospital,” the CM’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-deaths-in-home-isolation-in-10-days/story-MIxXmyldMXlus9sG5ul2UL.html

However, the counsel for the Delhi government contended that the emails were sent from the mobile phone of a contractual employee.Two branches of Apeejay School-- Saket and Sheikh Sarai-- were sealed by the Delhi government’s education department on May 4 for charging hiked fees from students in violation of the directions issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, enforced in the city amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Later on May 5, the schools were de-sealed by the high court.The Delhi government had also ordered the registration of an FIR against the schools, alleging that they had forged emails to justify hiking the fees. The police are investigating the matter and an FIR is yet to be registered. Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said, “This is a fraud fee enhancement case. Fee is not decided on emails sent to individuals like this. How can a fraud email be used to justify fee enhancement when the department (education) is saying it has not given any such order.”During the hearing in the case on Thursday, the Delhi police submitted an affidavit, saying that the IP addresses from which the schools claimed they received emails were registered with Google in the name of the Deputy Director of Education Act-1. However, additional standing counsel Gautam Narayan, told the court that all the emails were generated from the mobile phone of a contractual employee. The court will now hear the matter on August 6. Calls and text messages to Binay Bhushan, director of education, remain unanswered.“Delhi Police report has vindicated the stand of Apeejay Schools,” the Apeejay School said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apeejay-case-cops-say-emails-sent-from-ip-address-of-education-dept/story-42fkWXrQAgWFV0psdLconL.html

12-07-2020||India||Cong flays govt over handling of Covid-19||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s sustained attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government on their handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and Chinese transgressions in Ladakh came in for praise from the party’s Lok Sabha members at a virtual meeting on Saturday, people familiar with the developments said.The leadership issue also resonated at the meeting, chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, with many members demanding that Rahul Gandhi should once again assume the reins of the party, a Member of Parliament (MP) said on condition of anonymity.“It was decided that members would take the issues raised by Rahul Gandhi to the people in their respective constituencies over the Centre’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the India-China border standoff,” the MP said. Of the 52 Congress MPs in the Lok Sabha, 41 spoke at the meeting in which the issues that came up for discussion included the pandemic, the impact of Covid-19 lockdown and Chinese transgressions.Rahul Gandhi once again highlighted the alleged failures of the government in tackling Covid-19 and its handling of the lockdown.A Lok Sabha MP from Kerala said Rahul Gandhi also said the “impact of lockdown on the economy will be huge” but the government does not have a plan to bring the economy back on track. On China, he alleged the PM had been lying to the people, this person said. Rahul Gandhi also targeted the PM CARES Fund and asked for the government to be transparent about its funding, people at the meeting said. Sonia Gandhi said the government is not convening Parliament and shying away from important questions on critical matters.BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said the statements praising the Gandhis are scripted. “The party is divided into two camps, those who support the party and those who support the family. So these scripted statements are being made,” he said. On questions being raised by the Congress on the standoff with China and the PM CARES fund, Hussain said the Opposition has no issues to raise, and, therefore, is creating controversies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-flays-govt-over-handling-of-covid-19/story-iLZf9dspAZ6RLm3e89SMrI.html
12-07-2020||India||Disengagement in progress: Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Saturday described as “work in progress” the “disengagement and de-escalation” process with China in East Ladakh. Discussing the India-China face-off in Ladakh at India Global Week 2020, organised by India Inc, a UK-based media house, Jaishankar said the process had been mutually agreed upon and just commenced. “What’s happened is that we have agreed on the need to disengage because the troops on both sides are deployed very close to each other.” On-ground verification in East Ladakh has shown that Indian and Chinese troops have moved back from positions where they were in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation by at least 600 metres at the four stand-off points as well as all along the 1597 km Line of Actual Control in the western sector, top military and diplomatic officials said on condition of anonymity. According to the officials, the two sides have decided to temporarily halt patrolling at the four friction points, Galwan, Gogra, Hot Springs and Pangong Tso — but without prejudice to their patrolling rights — so that temperatures are reduced on the border and any chance of an accident is avoided. This is not the first time that India and China have agreed to such measures, they pointed out; it was done at Finger 8 in Pangong Tso in 2008 and at Depsang Bulge in 2013 after similar stand-offs were resolved.The officials denied that there was a buffer zone. “There is no buffer zone. All we have done is that both sides have withdrawn to rear positions so that no accident or flare-up takes place. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is dismantling structures and moving vehicles back at the stand-off points in daylight to maintain transparency. It also wants Indian troops to move back the same distance as there is trust deficit between the two sides... it only requires a spark to catch fire and undo all the dialogue,” said a senior military commander.During the third virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on Friday, India and China said they would push forward efforts aimed at complete disengagement and easing of tensions along the LAC even as differences remained over issues such as Beijing’s insistence of claiming ownership of Galwan valley. A date for the meeting of senior military commanders next week is being worked out, and the situation on ground reveals a complete disengagement at Galwan with neither of the forces sitting on or next to the LAC. Jaishankar also emphasized that there is bipartisan consensus in the US to strengthen the relationship with India. “ Think back of the last four US Presidents—Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George Bush and Bill Clinton—and you would agree that you cant’ find four people in world less similar.... Yet one thing on which they agreed is importance of India.... Maybe some of it is our charm but I think a lot of it is also their thinking. We have a very strong political, strategic, security, technology, economic cooperation and defence cooperation with United States,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-in-progress-jaishankar/story-sEhYmNfVxYJDo75AbtfNXJ.html
12-07-2020||India||A peek inside Covid-19 war room: Tales from the ER||When the pandemic began to grip Delhi in early April, the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) hospital was the first in the city to be declared a dedicated Covid-19 facility. So far, LNJP has successfully treated 3600 patients. Even as Delhi now has seven dedicated Covid-19 government hospitals, LNJP remains the biggest facility in the city, housing 522 patients at the moment. LNJP is also a teaching hospital that houses the prestigious Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), and in the fight against the pandemic, the service of around 450 postgraduate students of the college — resident doctors — has been invaluable. They form the backbone of the medical force on the ground, taking care of the wards in 14-day shifts, of varying hours, at a time. The “senior residents”, or doctors in their final year of postgraduation, were to have appeared for exams in April, received their degrees, and got jobs by now. But the pandemic put a halt to that, and they were pressed into service. This is the story of the experiences of two senior residents, Dr Saurav Kumar, 26, doing his MS in general surgery, and Dr Richa Narang, 29, doing hers in anesthesiology, as recounted by them over multiple phone calls. The conversations highlight the Covid-19 journey from the viewpoint of health care professionals on the front line – their anxieties and challenges, and the emotional and physical load it has taken on them. It also highlights the shortcomings in the medical infrastructure and system — many of which, particularly at LNJP, have been addressed, improved and strengthened over the past three months, which these accounts also reflect.Dr Richa Narang: During my first posting, I was very scared. This was in April. The hospital was unprepared. We had an ICU [intensive care unit] on the fourth floor with 15 beds, already occupied with patients, and then suddenly, Covid-19 patients started coming and we had to make another ICU. We scrambled to turn some disused rooms into ICUs.The isolation was not proper at all and we were very scared. Our counter was right in the patient’s room. The PPE [personal protective equipment] kits were faulty. In those initial days, we did not have enough ventilators, oxygen masks, cannulas. It was chaos. We did not know who was doing what or going where, whom to admit, whom not to admit... then things got better. Dr Saurav Kumar: The day we had to shift from the surgical block in the first week of April was very hard. Some of our friends who were working at the casualty called and said, ‘Today we will get around 150 Covid patients’. I said, ‘Boss that must be a rumour, we can’t possibly get that many patients in one go’… then they started to come, and we got a message that we will have to clear out the surgical ward. That’s 36 beds. I had been working in that ward for three years and I knew it like the back of my hand. In one hour, we were completely uprooted. When the order came, the first thing we did was go around and ask patients who could be discharged if they wanted to be discharged and sent to another hospital since LNJP would become a Covid hospital. Some of them agreed. But we also had eight patients with open wounds or in post-surgical care whom we had to shift out. There was one diabetic patient whose foot and leg had become gangrenous and had to be amputated from below the knee. His wound was open and required dressing every day, his immunity was low, electrolytes were all over the chart, he needed close monitoring, lots of care. Shifting someone like him was so hard, but we managed, and he was safe.But now (in the new ward) we did not know where the duty room was, where the nurse’s station was, where the toilets were.PPE CHALLENGE Narang: The day before my first posting, I got a message saying I was to be on Covid duty from the following day. In the morning, I attended a seminar at 11am on safety, basically how to don and take of the PPE. My first thought was, ‘When will I get to see my parents?’ We had our final exams scheduled for April, so I was busy preparing for it and had not gone home since February. Then the pandemic started, and all plans went out of the window, and now here I was, heading into a Covid ICU. I did not tell my parents about my posting.Kumar: We took the place, which used to be our OPD [out-patient department] block in non-Covid days, to create a donning area. It is not connected to any Covid wards, so no cross-infection would happen. You change there, and then you go to whichever ward you are posted in. Four doctors are posted together on a floor with two wards (each floor has 72 beds), and we reach the donning area together and help each other. First we do our handwashing, then we wear the first layer of gloves, then the shoe covers, then the coverall, then an N95 mask and a surgical mask on top of that, then the cap, then a second layer of gloves, then goggles or face shield.Narang: PPE suits are heavy and depressing. I felt suffocated; the headgear, the mask, the goggles, everything has to fit tightly. After a few hours, the goggles start to fog up and there is no way to wipe it, so you have to work with poor visibility. It is so hard to do anything. Imagine intubating a patient while wearing all of that, and sweating in that heat.Communication was such a problem. No one could hear me unless I screamed. When you are handling critical patients, every word is important. So we put in place a system of hand gestures between the doctors and the nursing staff. Also, you can’t go to the bathroom after wearing your PPE, or drink water, or eat. ICU shifts were of six hours, so we had to endure that for the entire duration. There were times when I would be terribly thirsty, desperate to go the washroom, drenched in sweat and finding it difficult to see through the fogged goggles — all at the same time.Kumar: May 13 was the first time I worked in the Covid ward. I worked for the next 14 days. That’s the first time I wore PPE. Within 15 minutes, I was drenched in sweat. It was like someone had poured a bucket of water on me. It’s supposed to be impervious to water, so it has a laminated layer of plastic. In May, with the heatwave on, it was terrible. After half an hour, sweat was dripping like a waterfall from my forehead. The donning area is on the fourth floor — we stopped using lifts, and we blocked off the walkways so that people don’t walk between the wards. So I wore my PPE, walked down four floors, out of the OPD building, walked 200 metres, and then climbed up four floors again to my Covid ward. As I was walking down the stairs, my first thoughts were: ‘Is this thing open from somewhere? Is there a gap I missed? Did I wear it correctly?’When I reached the ward, the first thing I did was to ask the nursing staff to recheck everything. Then I was telling myself, there is nothing to fear, you have been here for three years, it’s the same hospital, there is nothing to worry about. I was reminding myself, that I am the kind of person who wants to volunteer, who wants to be challenged... But before I started my shift, I had spoken to a colleague who had already finished his. First thing I asked was: ‘How scared should I be?’ I was posted at the Covid ward in the surgical block, where the stable patients are housed. The conditions of patients at the Covid ICU and Covid medical block is worse; this is where they are shifted when they need oxygen support. My colleague told me, ‘These patients are stable, but they all have surgical elements, fractures, abscesses, some need dialysis, so treat the patient as a whole, don’t only think Covid, Covid, Covid’. He said, ‘Before you change into your PPE, you should know what you are supposed to do, step by step, when you enter the ward. Don’t plan after you put on your kit. The main work in the morning shift is to do the patient round, and to take samples that are listed for testing. Also, you have to be very cautious with Covid patient because they can deteriorate very quickly.’ SILENT KILLER Narang: Covid is known to create Silent Hypoxia — oxygen levels decrease, but the patient is not symptomatic till the level falls to a critical value. Normally the oxygen saturation in our blood is 99-100%. If it falls to a level below 92%, you need oxygen support to prevent possible damage to your organs. Normally, when the saturation falls below 92%, there are symptoms like difficulty breathing, restlessness, drowsiness. But in Covid patients, the saturation can fall to 80% without the patient showing any symptoms. That’s Silent Hypoxia, that’s what makes this disease so dangerous. So one of our main jobs is to constantly monitor saturation levels.Kumar: On my first day, one patient, a 58-year-old male, was not in a good condition. He was the only one on oxygen support at my ward. He was not able to maintain saturation, it kept dropping. After two days, I had him transferred to the ICU. On the second-last day of my shift, a 70-year-old woman was not maintaining oxygen saturation. We did an X-ray. It did not look too bad, but she was deteriorating. I spoke to another doctor, and then we decided that she needed to be given oxygen and monitored for 24 hours. After this conservative approach, her condition did not improve, and I had to transfer her to the ICU. She was also hypertensive and she had diabetes.Narang: Patients suddenly develop critical symptoms when the saturation drops below 80%. We call this “air hunger”. Normally, we would intubate a patient whose oxygen saturation is so low without thinking twice. With Covid, we learnt that we need to keep a higher threshold, because we saw that once a patient is on a ventilator, there is not much more you can do, and very few came back from that stage. So we adopted an unconventional approach. First, supply oxygen through a non-rebreather mask. If that didn’t work well, then we use a technique called “awake proning” — put the patient on the stomach while continuing oxygen therapy. This opens up the lungs more. This is a technique used for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) patients, which is a critical illness of the lungs, a seizure form of pneumonia, and Covid symptoms closely resemble ARDS. I have had great success with putting patients in the prone position. I had a 64-year-old hypertensive patient, admitted with great respiratory distress. His saturation was 80% when he came in. We put him on a non-rebreathing mask and the oxygen saturation began to improve... 80 to 86, then 90, then 94. Two days later, his condition deteriorated again; this time I applied high-flow nasal oxygen — it provides oxygen at 60-65 litres per minute, compared to non-rebreathing mask which provides 10-15 litres. His condition stabilised for another 2-3 days but again began to deteriorate. At this point I started doing proning. The very first night, he felt so relieved that he fell asleep in the position; his saturation was at 97%. After 18 days, the patient was discharged. Kumar: The first order of the day at my ward was always to take samples. The night shift keeps everything ready — swabs, vials, ziploc covers, pens, micropore, cotton and a chart with the details of who has to be tested. The samples need to be collected and ready before noon, because after 1pm, the lab will not receive new samples. The way it’s done is an art. We had seen videos and demonstrations, but nothing compares to actually inserting a swab into a patient’s nose or oropharynx. There is a gag reflex. The patient might vomit on you, which happened to a colleague. Or the patient will grab hold of your hand really hard.Narang: The first time I went to test a patient and I inserted a swab in a patient’s nose, the patient coughed really hard, straight at me. I was standing right in front of him because I had no experience of doing this. That first incident was scary.Kumar: Once you put on PPE, you can’t be heard. I am screaming from behind my mask and shield, and the patient still can’t hear me. All the ACs had been shut down to prevent the virus from aerosolising in the central ducts; we had arranged for some coolers to run, and they make a noise too.I line up the patients with social distancing, and call them one by one.‘What’s your name?’ I shout, as if declaring war.Then, at the top of my lungs, I explain the procedure. I tell them, ‘Now we will test you for the virus. This cotton bud here, I will put it inside your nose, and touch it to a place at the back of the nose...I will just dab it, I won’t hurt you, and then I will take it out again’ it will take 20 seconds. But when this swab goes in, you will feel uncomfortable, maybe nauseous, like stopping me or holding my hand, but if you can just bear it for a few seconds, it will be done, and you will get the right report.’ You get patients who are very calm, and patients who panic.LURKING FEAR Narang: In April, I had two mortalities on my shift. One of them was a lady who was there throughout my shift but died on my final night. She was 54, diabetic. She was on my mind for many days. I had become close to her. I used to stop by at the end of the day and chat with her. Her granddaughter’s birthday happened when she was at the ICU and she told me about it. To see her craving for oxygen, it was very hard. I had to do prone position with her every day, and her breathing was really improving. She was showing good signs. But in the last seven days, her X-rays showed that her lungs were deteriorating. We could not understand why or what to do. The last two days, she was on ventilator. Then on my 14th day, she passed away at 4am. I was there with her. I cried very hard.In May, by the time my second rotation came, I was full of enthusiasm and excitement that I will save every person under my care. I was very affected by the way patients died on my first shift: unable to breathe, no family members around, having spent all the time in hospital in isolation without your loved ones. Under any other circumstance, you can have any disease, but at least you can meet your family and friends. Here you are lonely, isolated, disconnected. Isolation for a healthy person is difficult, for a suffering patient it must be doubly hard. It’s so depressing for us as well, we are isolated too. Nobody could meet us, we could not meet anybody — it was just isolation and quarantine (which every doctor must go through after a shift).Kumar: There is one good reason to segregate patients according to the severity of their symptoms, so that those who are alright don’t get to see others in critical conditions. Then the patients who are stable start developing a fear. ‘Is this where I am headed? Will this happen to me in 10 days?’ For me, it was a different kind of exhaustion. For us, it was two doctors and four nursing staff working in a 12-hour shift for 72 patients. We had patients on dialysis, patients on drip, patients who needed bloodwork done, someone was anaemic, someone needed a wound dressed, an ECG [electrocardiogram], a X-ray, someone needed to be seen by a specialist. You are consumed by your work for those 12 hours, you think of nothing else. After sweating everything out, you get back to your room, drink lots and lots of water, or ORS, and just pass out. Those 14 days that’s all I did: work, sleep, work, sleep. Even then, the most time -consuming thing was the paperwork. Why not take some of the paperwork off the doctor’s hands? Doing data entry can easily be outsourced and it will halve our burden. That way, patients would get much better care. Narang: Most patients in the ICU were diabetic or had heart disease. We had 10 beds in the ICU to start with, then 15. We were two doctors, my senior and I,and four nursing staff; total shift was six hours.In my May rotation, I did not have a single mortality while on duty. I was very proud of myself. There were mortalities — our own OT [operation theatre] technician, a 13-year-old diabetic girl, a patient with a kidney failure, an elderly patient with cerebral aneurism — just not on my shift. We’re the ones who go and declare the passing of the patient to the relative. For me, facing a crying relative is the hardest part of my job.My first posting in ICU — that was in 2018 — was also the first time I had to tell a relative that we could not save someone. I remember two incidents. I can’t remember which one came first. Both were young, both were in RTAs (road traffic accidents). One was a girl, 10 or 12, and one was a man in his mid-20s. Both were on bikes. The man was riding; the girl was pillion on her brother’s bike. She had fractures all over her hips, legs, and spinal cord; her bladder was gone. The man’s face had been smashed, his skull fractured, and he bled profusely; the whole bed was soaked in blood.We could not save them. I still remember the bed numbers; the man was on 3, the girl on 14. It was very, very hard for me to go and tell the relatives. My first feeling was intense anger. I want to take all the people who drive badly and give them a tour of the ICU and show them what it actually looks like and feels like to be in an accident. I don’t think they will ever drive badly again.Kumar: Once a patient was brought in by a whole lot of men, aggressive, shouting, threatening us (to save that man)... on investigation, I found that he had perforations in his intestine, we needed to operate, we needed blood. We told that large crowd that we needed at least four people to donate blood, and most of the people vanished. One person came and said, here’s a thousand rupees, make some arrangements. Humanity comes naked to you when you are a resident doctor in a government hospital.INDOMITABLE DRIVE Narang: A time comes when there is no one except the lonely patient. I have a drive, I want to save lives, I want to keep trying. I have always wanted to be a doctor, ever since I can remember. My sister who is 12 years older to me is a doctor. We are four siblings, I am the youngest. The oldest is my brother, who is 15 years older. He is an advocate in the Delhi high court, like my father. My mother is 80 and she has polio so one of her legs doesn’t work, but through this entire lockdown, she and my father did everything by themselves in their house. There was no one else with them; I was very worried. I grew up in a single-storey house in Karnal. Even though I have always wanted to be a doctor, it did not feel like I was living my dream when I started my MBBS. It was just studying, studying, studying, it was quite a nightmare! The first time I felt like I was living my dream was when I walked into an ICU. The rush of being in the ICU, where there is only thing to think about — save lives — is what drives me.Kumar: I want to specialise in GI [gastrointestinal] surgery and liver transplantation. In three years you get to know what you want to do. For me, when I open the abdomen up, it fascinates me. Suturing a bowel is technically demanding. Imagine you have a puncture in a cycle.You patch it, if it leaks again, you patch it again. But here, when we suture, if there is a leak again, the patient will die. If you suture too tightly, the blood supply will get cut off. There is no room for a mistake. It’s fine work, very fine work.When I was growing up, I was fascinated by farming. The harvest season was the best time: all the tractors, threshers, everyone out on the field. All day long, I would follow them. My ears would be tuned to hear if Papa’s bike was coming up the road. My father taught botany at the government college in Araria (Bihar), and he was a strict man. There was great discipline at home; even though we lived in a large joint family. I was the older child, and I was told that I must always lead by example. My brother is also a doctor, doing his internship at the Army hospital in Jammu.When I got into MBBS, I was not just becoming a doctor; for me, it was a generational leap. In 26 years, I’ve seen two completely different lives, one in the village where I grew up, and one here in the city. And now I am experiencing being on the front line in a pandemic. Narang: I like to look good, so I would go to the hospital nicely made up — even in my PPE, and even though the duty was exhausting and hectic. I would also go for 45-minute runs every day, inside the park at MAMC. When I went back to the hotel room (she was quarantined at the Hotel Lalit, which was attached to LNJP), I did more reading on Covid. I searched articles in medical journals, I asked my sister to send me articles, I attended a webinar. Then I referred to my own books to read up on ARDS and ventilators. By the end of April, I told my consulting doctor that I want to do a study on the disease. At this point, something horrible happened to me. Someone mirrored my phone pretending to be a bank executive and stole ~14 lakh from my account. That’s like a year-and-half of my salary. I almost gave up. But I was back on shift in May. INFRA struggle Kumar: At some point, just because of the exhaustion, because your body is aching, you are in pain, you start to feel like you are being punished. You start to forget life was different before this.Before Covid, I spent lots of time on social media. I liked playing basketball, badminton, watching Netflix. Before all this started, a group of four or five of us friends would sometimes study or work late into the night, and then we would go out for a walk. One place we liked to go to is Alam bhai’s Maggi point, which is next to Lady Hardinge [medical college], and is open all night. But things are very bad in Delhi now. The government can deny and say there is no community spread; but clearly there is. Also, our hospital conditions are as bad as they were decades ago. Why is health and education not a priority? We have the worst doctor-patient ratio in the world. In hospitals, the biggest problem is the shortage of manpower. It’s not just about doctors but also nursing staff, sanitation workers, all of them are needed in the system.Narang: The images of dead bodies lying around in wards at LNJP — that was at the medicine block. We don’t have enough nursing orderlies, they are the ones who have to carry out the bodies. If someone dies at 6pm, the body may be removed at 10pm, after repeated requests, after searching for the orderlies... The first death I had on my shift — I spent three hours trying to arrange for a nursing orderly, then an ambulance. This should have happened in 15-20 minutes.Kumar: What people saw in the images was not the fault of health care delivery, it was a collapse of infrastructure. Actually government hospitals in Delhi are much better than the government hospitals in most other states.Narang: But since there is so much focus right now on medical care, I think things will improve. They will spend more on health infrastructure. Just to tackle the pandemic, we have had to make huge improvements already, like in the number of ventilators, oxygen support, equipment...Kumar: Right now I am talking to you from a park in front of the library; there is a slight breeze, and lots of trees so the heat is not unbearable. I tested positive for Covid, and I have just recovered. I was more or less asymptomatic, but I had a lot of fatigue, and also some joint pain. I was in Guru Nanak Eye Centre for five days. There is a special ward for health care workers, it was really good; a fantastic set-up. For me it was just depression, being stuck in a room with nothing to do but watch the fan rotate... no Wi-Fi, phone signal was not good. I carried my books, my exams were supposed to start on June 16. I was fully prepared, I had my admit card, I knew the exam centre, and then on the 15th evening, they cancelled it. Narang: My quarantine period is also over. We are very uncertain because our exams are not happening. Our contracts were extended till June 30. When will we get a degree? Where will I work? But we understand, the situation is grave. Anyway, I think I’ll go for a run now. (The final-year students’ exams began on July 10).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-peek-inside-covid-war-room-tales-from-the-er/story-46RIYFd1qvzr0RdkCtKjHP.html
12-07-2020||India||NCR areas should follow Delhi: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday appreciated the efforts of the Centre and Delhi government in containing the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the national capital and directed that a similar approach against the pandemic be adopted in the entire National Capital Region, remarks that came at a meeting to review the public health crisis.Delhi recorded 1,781 fresh Covid-19 cases on Saturday, taking the tally in the city to 110,921, while the death toll from the disease climbed to 3,334. On June 23, the national capital reported the highest single-day spike so far of 3,947 cases, but the daily cases have since reduced amid increased testing. “Priority is close monitoring and guiding the containment works in regions where the infection rate is high,” the Prime Minister tweeted after the meeting to take stock of the Covid-19 situation in various parts of the country and the preparedness of state governments.He said there was no room for complacency in the battle against Covid-19, with the review meeting focusing on ramping up testing and keeping the death rate low. The meeting was attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and other senior officials.Shah has held a series of meetings with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and senior officials over the strategy to augment Delhi’s health care infrastructure amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Kejriwal said recently the situation in Capital appeared to have come under control amid joint efforts by the Centre and the Delhi government. Among the efforts launched in Delhi recently were widened testing, a serological survey to gauge the prevalence of the disease and a more refined strategy on containment zones.People aware of the developments said Modi asked for better coordination between the Centre and other states of the National Capital Region during the meeting. This comes weeks after the Union home minister emphasised the need to have a unified strategy in Delhi-NCR to tackle Covid-19, adding that suburbs such as Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad can’t be separated from the Capital in the public health emergency.According to an official, who did not wish to be named, discussions were held on the situation of different states and Union territories including Delhi, supported by data on the Covid-19 outbreak. “The Prime Minister appreciated the concerted efforts of the Centre, State and local authorities in containing the pandemic situation in Delhi. He further directed that similar approach should be adopted with other State Governments in containing the Covid-19 pandemic in entire NCR area,” an official statement by the Prime Minister’s Office said.The Prime Minister said that real-time national monitoring and guidance should be provided to all affected states and places with high test positivity rates.He said that the need to observe personal hygiene and social discipline in public places must be reiterated. “The awareness about Covid should be disseminated widely and a continuous emphasis on preventing spread of the infection should be laid. He (the PM) said that there is no room for any complacency in this regard,” the statement said.The official quoted above said that testing will be intensified for vegetable vendors and grocery sellers as they have a high rate of mobility and interaction with people.The PM’s directions came after NITI Aayog member VK Paul made a presentation on the Covid-19 situation in the country, according to the official. The discussions focused on ramping up tests, with those present stressing that intensified diagnoses can bring down the positivity rates in several places and contain the pandemic, the official added. The meeting discussed how Delhi increased its daily tests to about 22,000 and the positivity rate in the Capital reduced to 10%.Paul’s presentation also spoke of the urgent need to curb the number of deaths, especially in states where case fatality rates have shot up in the recent weeks. The Prime Minister, according to a second official, agreed on the issues raised by Paul. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was a detailed discussion on ways to suppress the transmission of Covid-19. Paul’s presentation suggested that the best way to suppress transmission was to ensure that in at least 80% of the new cases, the patients’ close contacts are traced within 72 hours and kept in quarantine. The Prime Minister also spoke about the need to ensure quality care and that there must be a standard that is followed across the country, the official added.Other suggestions by Paul included revamping India’s ambulance system and monitoring their response time to address the needs of patients, the official said.The “successful example” of surveillance and home-based care through ‘Dhanvantri Rath’ in Ahmedabad was also highlighted, and it was directed that it could be emulated in other places, the statement said.“Also discussed ways to further step-up our capacities to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We also highlighted successful initiatives being undertaken across India to ensure the Coronavirus is kept under check,” Modi said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncr-areas-should-follow-delhi-modi/story-QLqH5zwIrgLaG7dMf8wRJK.html
12-07-2020||India||Current crisis worst of century: RBI||Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das asked banks and finance companies on Saturday to conduct so-called stress tests even as he emphasised that the central bank’s primary focus will be on reviving growth and ensuring the stability of the financial system. The economic fallout of the coronavirus disease pandemic may lead to higher non-performing assets, or bad loans, and capital erosion at Indian banks, he warned, terming the Covid-19 outbreak the worst economic and health crisis in a century.A recapitalisation plan for public sector banks and private banks has become necessary because of the compression in economic growth during and after the Covid-19 lockdown, Das said at the seventh banking and economics conclave organised by the State Bank of India (SBI), stressing the need for banks to raise capital and build cash buffers to ensure credit flow and resilience of the financial system, and to be prepared for more frequent and bigger risk events.“While the NBFC [non-banking financial company] sector as a whole may still look resilient, the redemption pressure on NBFCs and mutual funds needs close monitoring,” Das said at the digital conference, referring to the emerging stress points in the financial system. “Mutual funds have emerged as major investors in market instruments issued by NBFCs, which is why the development of an adverse feedback loop and the associated systemic risk warrants timely and targeted policy interventions.”“Increasing share of bank lending to NBFCs and the continuing crunch in market-based financing faced by the NBFCs and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) also need to be watched carefully,” the RBI governor cautioned.The RBI governor ended his speech on a cautiously optimistic note, saying the financial system was functioning well and the economy had started showing signs of getting back to normalcy after the easing of lockdown restrictions. “It is, however, still uncertain when supply chains will be restored fully; how long will it take for demand conditions to normalise; and what kind of durable effects the pandemic will leave behind on our potential growth.”The need of the hour is to restore confidence, preserve financial stability, revive growth and recover stronger, he added.Das said: “While the multipronged approach adopted by the Reserve Bank has provided a cushion from the immediate impact of the pandemic on banks, the medium-term outlook is uncertain and depends on the Covid-19 curve. Policy action for the medium-term would require a careful assessment of how the crisis unfolds. Building buffers and raising capital will be crucial not only to ensure credit flow but also to build resilience in the financial system.”India’s economy, which was already in the grip of a slowdown when the outbreak began at the end of last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly around the world, grew 3.1% in the quarter ended March from a year ago and 4.2% in the full fiscal year.India’s economy will likely shrink 5% in the year through next March, Goldman Sachs said in a report in the last week of May. The International Monetary Fund has slashed its 2020-21 growth projection for India to 1.9% from 5.8% estimated in January.“We have recently [19th June and 1st July, 2020] advised all banks, non-deposit taking NBFCs [with an asset size of ₹5,000 crore] and all deposit-taking NBFCs to assess the impact of COVID-19 on their balance sheet, asset quality, liquidity, profitability and capital adequacy for the financial year 2020-21. Based on the outcome of such stress testing, banks and non-banking financial companies have been advised to work out possible mitigating measures including capital planning, capital raising, and contingency liquidity planning, among others. The idea is to ensure continued credit supply to different sectors of the economy and maintain financial stability,” Das said in his speech, a transcript of which was posted on the RBI website.The growth woes began much before Covid-19 struck. In September 2018, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd, a major lender to all kinds of businesses, defaulted on its debt obligations, triggering a rippling liquidity crisis in the financial services market. Borrowing costs rose sharply. Private demand began collapsing too.“The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic is unambiguously the worst health and economic crisis in the last 100 years during peace time with unprecedented negative consequences for output, jobs and well-being. It has dented the existing world order, global value chains, labour and capital movements across globe and needless to say, the socio-economic conditions of a large section of world population,” Das said.RBI has cut its key interest rate by 115 basis points (BPs) since the coronavirus crisis began, having pared it by 135 BPs between February 2019 and the onset of the pandemic. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.The liquidity measures announced by RBI since February 2020, after the onset of Covid-19, aggregate to about ₹9.57 lakh crore, equivalent to about 4.7% of the 2019-20 nominal gross domestic product, according to Das, a former civil servant in the central government who was appointed the RBI governor in December 2018 to replace Urjit Patel, who resigned over differences with the government.“Consistent with this [accommodative] policy stance, liquidity conditions were also kept in ample surplus all through since June 2019. The lagged impact of these measures was about to propel a cyclical turnaround in economic activity when Covid-19 brought with it calamitous misery, endangering both life and livelihood of people,” Das said.Heading into the pandemic, the financial system was in a much improved position, owing mainly to various regulatory and supervisory initiatives of the Reserve Bank, he said.“We had put in place a framework for resolution of stressed assets in addition to implementing multiple measures to strengthen credit discipline and to reduce credit concentration. For the five years between 2015-16 and 2019-20, the government had infused a total of ₹3.08 lakh crore in public sector banks. As a result of the efforts by both the Reserve Bank and the government, the overhang of stressed assets in the banking system had declined and capital position had improved,” he said.The overall capital adequacy ratio — an indicator of financial strength expressed as a ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets — of commercial banks was 14.8% in March 2020, compared to 14.3% in March 2019. The ratio of public sector banks had improved from 12.2% in March 2019 to 13% March 2020. The gross non-performing asset ratio and net non-performing ratio of commercial banks was 8.3% and 2.9% March 2020, compared to 9.1% and 3.7% a year ago.Das said the Reserve Bank would reinforce its focus on developing financial institutions’ ability to identify, measure, and mitigate risks. “The new supervisory approach will be two-pronged — first, strengthening the internal defences of the supervised entities; and second, greater focus on identifying the early warning signals and initiate corrective action.”Ram Singh, professor at the Delhi School of Economics, said, “RBI governor has rightly said Covid-19 is the worst health and economic crisis in last 100 years. It has adversely impacted the entire economy. The RBI must take all necessary actions to keep the banking sector healthy, but at the same time it should also ensure smooth flow of credit especially to MSMSe and NBFCs so that the economy will revive expeditiously.”Niranjan Hiranandani, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), said, “Given the unprecedented total shutdown of the Indian economy, no one could guess how the restart would work out. In this reference, the RBI governor’s statement makes perfect sense. Yes, the economy does show signs of getting back to normalcy. India is on the right path, but the destination is yet to be reached, and we all need to work together, keeping the safety precautions as also social distancing norms in place, to restarting India’s economic engine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/current-crisis-worst-of-century-rbi/story-rcXaQuF22jkZWHt9awMa7M.html
12-07-2020||India||Ventilation key to mitigating Covid-19 risk||As the economy opens up, people return to work and transportation and other services resume, there is an increasing focus on optimising ventilation and managing indoor airflows to limit the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in closed spaces.The new coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) primarily spreads when infected people expel infected respiratory droplets when they cough, sneeze, or speak and these are inhaled by others around them. Reversing its earlier position, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently said airborne transmission of the coronavirus is possible indoors, especially when people spend extended periods in crowded and poorly ventilated rooms.An increasing number of outbreaks implicate the role of aerosols in the spread of infection, which can be spread by presymptomatic and symptomatic people. Aerosols are tiny droplets that stay suspended in the air for longer than large droplets.Remodelling and modifying heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems can help lower risk of infection. “Changing settings and design of HVAC systems is useful in reducing transmission. The entry of fresh air and stale air exhaust and filteration are the two key elements. Some people have tried UV, too, but I can’t say whether he UV solution works but the other two do,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, pulmonologist and director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Delhi.Indoor spreadSeveral outbreak investigation reports have shown that Covid-19 transmission is particularly efficient in crowded, confined indoor spaces such as workplaces, restaurants, parties, shopping centres, dorms, cruise ships and transport, according to the European Centre of Disease Control (ECDC) guidance on ventilation of indoor spaces. In a study of 318 outbreaks in China, transmission in all cases except one occurred in indoor spaces, with the only case of outdoor transmission identified in this study involving two people.Studies have shown that the “attack rate” (percentage of people who get infected in an at-risk population) depends on the amount of time spent indoors. Sixty-one people spending two and a half hours in choir practice in Washington, US, led to a 85.2% attack rate, with 52 people getting infected. A call centre in South Korea recorded an attack rate of 43.5% among 216 employees, indicating extensive transmission in a crowded indoor environment. There was no link infection risk and the distance from the index case, which indicated the amount of time spent in contact played a bigger role than proximity.“In labs, we increase the exhaust with maximum fresh air and don’t have crowding even at full occupancy. Currently, the lab occupancy is less than half to ensure social distancing,” said Dr Agrawal.Two outbreaks in China from recirculating air have been documented. In January, 10 people across three families got infected after having lunch in a restaurant without windows in Guangzhou, China. Their tables were more than a metre apart but those infected were sitting along the line of the air-conditioning airflow. The diners in other parts of the restaurant were not infected. People who shared a 100-minute bus ride with patient zero had a 34% attack rate (23 out of 67 passengers), but those sitting close to an open window remained healthy, with the exception of the person sitting next to the index case.Cleaning the airHigh efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters used in aircraft and in health care settings have demonstrated good performance with particles of the Sars-CoV-2 virus size (around 70−120 nm), but their role in buildings outside of health care settings in preventing transmission of infectious diseases is unclear.A NASA study documented HEPA filters stopped particles as small as 0.1 microns, which is the approximate size of the coronavirus, but other direct research is limited, according to a McKinsey paper titled ‘Can HVAC systems help prevent transmission of Covid-19?’ It noted that the official US ratings system specifies the efficacy of HEPA only for particles of 0.3 microns.Among steps suggested by the McKinsey paper to make indoor air safer are configuring ducted HVAC systems to increase the rate of exchange of fresh air to reduce recirculation, enhancing the control of airflow by replacing fixed-speed fan motors with variable-speed ones, allowing smoother adjustments of airflow by using control systems sensitive to pressure, and installing high-performance air-purification systems. HVAC systems can also incorporate ionic purifiers, ozone generators, and other devices for cleaning air, it noted.Cheaper options for airflow management are through the use of a vertical laminar for slow, steady air flow in a straight path to push out potentially contaminated air. “Vertical laminar is used in hospital ICUs, operating rooms and commercial aircraft to minimise contamination, so that the airflow systems direct air from the ceiling to the floor,” said Dr Yatin Mehra, chairman, Medanta Institute of Critical Care and Anaesthesiology, Gurugram. Simpler and cheaper changes include installing air curtains at doors and creating overpressure on the ceiling.The takeway? Recirculated air can spread new coronavirus aerosols through HVAC systems for longer distances within indoor spaces, so there’s a need to lower risk by increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation, and increasing the use of outdoor air. Still, the risk of transmission in crowded indoor remains, which makes it vital to bundle prevention measures, such as wearing masks, social distancing, washing hands, and sanitising indoor spaces||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ventilation-key-to-mitigating-risk/story-1n4HruTKfaEc05rLYtVseN.html
12-07-2020||India||DCGI approves limited use of psoriasis injection for Covid-19||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved restricted emergency use of Itolizumab injection for treating moderate to severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. The approval has been granted based on clinical trial data that has shown promise, officials aware of the matter said.Itolizumab is a monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made proteins that act like human antibodies in the immune system and fight against foreign molecules.The drug is manufactured and marketed by Biocon for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. It has been in use since 2013 under the brand name of Alzumab. This indigenous drug has now been repurposed for Covid-19 treatment.Also Read: ‘50K vials of remdesivir ordered, tie-up with firm for tocilizumab’In a statement, the Union health ministry on Saturday said Biocon presented the phase II clinical trial results generated in Covid-19 patients to DCGI. “The results of these trials were deliberated in the Subject Expert Committee of DCGI’s office. Details of primary endpoint of mortality, other key endpoints of lung function such as improvement in PaO2 and O2 saturation were presented. Key inflammatory markers IL-6, TNFα etc., were presented to have reduced significantly with the drug thereby preventing hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 patients.”Also Read: Health ministry issues revised clinical management protocols for Covid-19 and spurt in casesThe committee looked into the data related to the drug for its impact on Covid-19 patients. “After detailed deliberation and taking into account the recommendations of the Committee, DCGI has decided to grant permission to market the drug under Restricted Emergency Use of the drug for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients due to COVID-19…,” the ministry statement said.The emergency use authorisation involves fulfilment of certain conditions. They include taking informed written consent of patients and apprising them of risks and benefits of the drug and putting a risk management plan in place to manage any adverse effects. The drug is to be given only in hospitals and medical institutions and is not meant for sale at retail pharmacies.“This is done to protect the misuse of [such a] drug as it must be given under strict medical supervision,” said an official in the DCGI’s office.The health ministry said the drug is also cheaper than the other repurposed medicines approved for the treatment of Covid-19. “The average cost of treatment with this indigenous drug is also lesser than comparable drugs that are part of the ‘investigational therapies’ indicated in the clinical management protocol for Covid-19.”The drugs approved for use in Covid-19 treatment in India include antivirals such as remdesivir, and immunosuppressant tocilizumab, steroid dexamethasone, and anti-malarial hyrdoxychloroquine.Medanta Hospital’s critical care department chairman Dr Yatin Mehta said there is no specific medication for Covid-19 at the moment and world over these medicines are being tried to treat hospitalised patients. “However, there are certain contraindications in the use of these medicines. So, the medicine is not for everyone and needs to be started under strict medical supervision.”“Itolizumab is the first novel biologic therapy to be approved anywhere in the world for treating patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 complications. Biocon has repurposed Itolizumab… for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in moderate to severe ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) patients due to COVID-19,” said Biocon Ltd. in a statement.“The approval of Itolizumab, from the DCGI is based on the results from the successful conclusion of a randomized, controlled clinical trial at multiple hospitals in Mumbai and New Delhi. The study focussed on the safety and efficacy of Itolizumab in preventing CRS in moderate to severe ARDS patients due to COVID-19. The primary endpoints for reduction in mortality rate were met and other key secondary endpoints for efficacy and biomarkers were also achieved.”Also Read: NCR areas should follow Delhi: PM ModiKiran Mazumdar-Shaw, executive chairperson, Biocon, said: “As an innovation-led biopharmaceuticals company, I am proud of the successful outcome of the pivotal study we conducted with our novel immuno-modulating anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody, Itolizumab, which has proven to be an efficacious intervention in treating the serious hyper immune response seen with COVID-19. The data is compelling and I am confident that this ‘first-in-class’ biologic will save lives and help reduce the mortality rate in our country.”The drug will be manufactured and formulated as an intravenous injection at Biocon’s bio manufacturing facility at Biocon Park, Bengaluru. The company plans to take this therapy to other parts of the world impacted by the pandemic.“At the time of this COVID-19 pandemic, we do not have any specific treatment for patients who are losing the fight against the disease in spite of best supportive care. Lok Nayak Hospital was one of the sites of the Itolizumab study wherein we used Itolizumab to treat eight patients. These patients did extremely well even with a single dose of Itolizumab.

12-07-2020||India||As cases rise, several states impose localised lockdowns||Bengaluru/Guwahati/Lucknow Karnataka, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya on Saturday imposed or extended lockdowns for varying periods in areas reporting alarming surges in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), moves that were aimed at containing clusters and preventing the emergence of fresh hot spots in high-risk areas.The Karnataka government announced a complete week-long lockdown in Bengaluru from Tuesday, while Uttar Pradesh enforced curbs for the weekend to check the spread of the infectious disease. In the North-east, the Assam government extended the Covid-19 lockdown in Guwahati by another week.Assam chief secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna said the 14-day lockdown in the district was scheduled to end at 6pm on Sunday but the district magistrate reported that rising cases may be a major threat to public health, hygiene and safety of the general population.“Due to extensive testing, isolation and other restrictive measures, community spread of Covid-19 has been contained to some extent and this necessitates further extension of prohibitory measures to contain the spread of the pandemic,” he stated.Guwahati city has reported a surge of positive cases with 6,221 since June 24 following which a complete lockdown was imposed in the entire district on June 28.While the Meghalaya government announced a two-day total lockdown in capital Shillong from Monday, the restrictions in Arunachal Pradesh’s capital complex were extended for another week in view of the rising cases. The previous lockdown which was imposed in the capital complex comprising Itanagar, Naharlagun, Nirjuli and Banderdewa on July 6 was scheduled to end at 5 pm on July 13.State governments have been enforcing localised lockdowns amid rising Covid-19 cases even as the Centre issued guidelines around a fortnight back for the second of a three-phase plan to lift restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the disease in March. The Covid-19 cases in the country climbed past the 800,000 mark on Friday.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Saturday announced the week-long hard lockdown in Bengaluru’s urban and rural districts from 8pm on July 14 to 5am on July 22. He said everything would be shut except essential services such as hospitals, pharmacies, milk shops and vegetable and grocery stores. Bengaluru has reported a sharp spike in cases in the recent days, fuelling the outbreak in the southern state.The Karnataka government also released guidelines allowing Resident Welfare Associations, Apartment Owners Associations, as well as companies, to establish Covid-19 care centres. As of July 11 evening, cumulatively 36,216 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the state, which includes 613 deaths and 14,716 discharges, a government bulletin said. Bengaluru urban district tops the list of positive cases, with a total of 16,862 infections.In Uttar Pradesh, roads, markets, commercial establishments and offices were empty across the state as it implemented a lockdown from 10pm on Friday for the weekend. The lockdown will end at 5am on Monday. Expect essential services, everything else will be barred during this period.Municipal bodies across the state also launched a three-day cleanliness drive. A sanitisation drive was carried out in Lucknow’s containment zones and nearby areas. “We have deputed over 600 staff with backpack kits for the sanitisation purpose...,” said Lucknow municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi.In Bihar, 17 out of 38 districts have enforced three- to seven-day lockdowns. The state has reported half of its total cases this month. A lockdown was imposed in Bihar’s capital Patna from Friday.A weekend lockdown began in Odisha in 23 of the 30 districts. The weekend lockdown was imposed in the state’s 11 districts in June. Odisha has reported 57% of its total Covid-19-related deaths this month.The ongoing 14-day lockdown was also extended in Guwahati and rest of Kamrup Metro district by another week beginning Sunday evening. The region has been under total lockdown since June 28.Officials said the lockdown has helped “contain community” spread to some extent and the numbers are showing “encouraging downward trend”, which necessitates further extension of the lockdown.Meghalaya also announced a two-day lockdown in capital Shillong from July 13. Nagaland has also decided to extend the ongoing lockdown in the state till July 31. The ongoing lockdown in the state was supposed to end on July 16.With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cases-rise-several-states-impose-localised-lockdowns/story-txNMUZir3ISFUdhkCGrHqI.html
12-07-2020||India||After Adhir’s proposal, PAC refuses to study govt’s Covid response||Attempts by Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is also the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament, to get it to study suo motu the government’s response to Covid-19 were not supported by the other members, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The committee met on Friday. It is understood that a scrutiny of the government’s response to the pandemic would have also involved going into the details of Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) and the PM CARES Fund, which was set up essentially to deal with the damage inflicted by the pandemic.Some of the members were of the view that because the government doesn’t fund these relief funds, PAC cannot and should not examine them, the person cited in the first instance added. News agency PTI reported on Friday that members of the PAC, in which BJP enjoys majority, thwarted Chowdhury’s attempt to have the PM Cares Fund examined, claiming that because it wasn’t funded by government, the committee could not do this. “It is not that the PAC has never taken up issues suo motu. It has happened in a few instances. But generally it is done when there is consensus. In this case the proposal hardly got any support,” said the person cited above.“The chairman wanted a few subjects to a be taken up suo motu by the committee. But there was no unanimity or consensus. In fact, there was hardly any support for the proposal.” In the meeting on Friday, the PAC decided to examine various subjects with special focus being given to the CAG report number 5 of 2017, a performance audit of the Sino-India Border Roads, and CAG report number 13 of 2019, which is on the provisioning and procurement of high altitude-clothing, equipment, ration and housing for soldiers.Friday’s meeting of the 22-member PAC was attended by 17 out of 20 members. Two seats on the committee are vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-adhir-s-proposal-pac-refuses-to-study-govt-s-covid-response/story-xDd2HRW5JbT1HOuxoWHUSK.html
12-07-2020||India||Hardik appointed Gujarat Cong working president||The Congress party has appointed Patidar (or Patel community) leader, Hardik Patel, 26, as the working president of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee, perhaps the first time the 135-year-old party has appointed a person so young to such a key position. The move is aimed at injecting some fresh blood into the Gujarat Congress that has been out of power for three decades in the state, and which recently saw a wave of defections. A commerce graduate, Patel hit the headlines in 2015 when he became the face of upper caste dissatisfaction against the BJP government in the state, seeking reservation in educational institutions and jobs for a once-dominant agrarian community. With no political background, Patel was able to mobilise crowds that challenged then chief minister Anandiben Patel’s rule. The violence and protests that ensued led to sedition charges against him but also established him as a man whose Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) was an entity that major parties had to reckon with. Ahead of the elections in December 2017, Patel officially campaigned for the Congress party; he joined it ahead of the Lok Sabha polls last year.”30 years we have been in exile (in the state). I want to travel to 12,000 villages in Gujarat to tell people to forget the mistakes that Congress made, to just give us one more chance,” Patel said over phone soon after his appointment. The Congress was in power since Gujarat was formed in 1960, but has failed to come back to power since Madhav Singh Solanki lost to Chimanbhai Patel in 1990.“We need to reach the people in the state. There are so many issues they have, and we need to highlight how this current government is inefficient,” he added.A senior Congress leader in Delhi said on condition of anonymity that the appointment was also meant to ensure that Patel wouldn’t walk over to the BJP like Alpesh Thakor, the OBC leader who joined Congress around the same time as Patel; he switched over to the BJP last year. Other than Thakor, the party has seen a string of exits and crossovers to the BJP. Ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls last month, three legislators quit while five others did so in March.Patel’s appointment is also part of the Congress’ efforts to address the concerns of the young, a party leader said. “Hardik isn’t just popular in Gujarat but has nationwide appeal among the young. His priorities are jobs and youth issues and these are in perfect unison with the Congress party’s . This (his appointment) part of the new plans we have for the party,’’ said Rajya Sabha MP, Rajeev Satav who was part of the team that worked on the Gujarat polls.The BJP was dismissive about the impact of Patel’s appointment. “He has never been a factor in the state,’’ said BJP’s Mukesh Dixit. “The Congress has a paucity of leaders in the state and that’s why they had to go with him. The Patel community is just 16% in the state so how can he make that much of a difference?’’While the Patels are a minority, they are politically influential. The BJP did win the 2017 elections despite Patel campaigning for Congress, but it was with a significantly reduced margin of 22 seats (it won 99 while the Congress won 77).Now with the BJP, Thakor was much more muted in his response to his peer’s promotion in his former party. “I can only wish Hardik Patel luck in this new assignment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hardik-appointed-guj-cong-working-prez/story-7kD2DwSwYRJkhWov1dK3mO.html
12-07-2020||India||Accused in Kerala gold smuggling case held by NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday detained Swapna Prabha Suresh, the main accused in the Thiruvananthapuram airport gold smuggling case, from a hotel in Bengaluru, officials said.The move has come a day after the agency filed a case under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).Suresh, the officials cited above said, was traced to the hotel in BTA Layout in Bengaluru along with her family. She is currently being questioned under ‘detention’, the officials said. Suresh was absconding since the gold consignment was seized at the airport on July 5.Suresh is likely to be formally arrested “very soon”, an official familiar with the development said.Apart from Suresh, the agency has also detained Sandeep Nair, another accused in the case, from Bengaluru.The central agency had named Suresh, Nair and two others – Sarith and Fazil -- in its FIR registered in connection with the seizure of 30 kg of 24 carat gold worth Rs 14.82 crore by Customs on July 5 purportedly found in baggage meant for UAE’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram.The agency has said that the matter pertains to “national security” and hence the UAPA law has been invoked in the FIR.The Kerala high court had on Friday deferred Suresh’s bail application.She was working as the operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT Ministry.In a statement on Friday, the NIA had said that the consignment was camouflaged in diplomatic baggage from UAE that is exempted from inspection as per the Vienna Convention.“As the case pertains to smuggling of large quantity of gold into India from offshore locations threatening the economic stability and national security of the country, it amounts to a terrorist act as stated in section 15 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967,” NIA said.The statement added that the case has national and international linkages and the initial enquiries have revealed that the proceeds of smuggled gold could be used for financing terrorism in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case-held-by-nia/story-ORR3jGNH9PGzHsUYU2e7gO.html
12-07-2020||India||India’s tiger census creates Guinness record||India’s 2018 tiger census has entered the Guinness Book of World Records for being the world’s largest camera trap wildlife survey. For the survey, camera traps were placed at 26,838 locations across 141 different sites. A Union environment ministry statement on Saturday called India’s tiger conservation efforts a “gold standard” for the world. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted, “The All India Tiger Estimation is now in the Guinness World Records for being the largest camera trap wildlife survey, a great moment indeed and a shining example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat.” He also said that India fulfilled its target of doubling tiger numbers four years in advance of its promised 2022 deadline.The 2018 All India Tiger estimation had found 2967 tigers in the country, compared to 2,226 in 2014.The minister also shared an image of the World Record citation on his official Twitter handle. “The fourth iteration of the survey – conducted in 2018-19 - was the most comprehensive to date, in terms of both resource and data amassed. Camera traps (outdoor photographic devices fitted with motion sensors that start recording when an animal passes by) were placed in 26,838 locations across 141 different sites and surveyed an effective area of 121,337 square kilometres (46,848 square miles). In total, the camera traps captured 34,858,623 photographs of wildlife (76,651 of which were tigers and 51,777 were leopards; the remainder were other native fauna). From these photographs, 2,461 individual tigers (excluding cubs) were identified using stripe-pattern-recognition software…,” the citation on the website of the Guinness World Records read.The estimation methodology, however, was criticised by academics for being misleading. A scientific paper titled “How sampling-based overdispersion reveals India’s tiger monitoring orthodoxy” by Arjun M Gopalaswamy from the Indian Statistical Institute, K Ullas Karanth from the Centre for Wildlife Studies, noted tiger expert Mohan Delampady from the Indian Statistical Institute, and Nils C Stenseth from the University of Oslo, in the Journal Conservation Science and Practice on November 4, 2019 flagged photographic manipulation and mathematical flaws with the survey.A major issue, according to the authors, was the use of a survey methodology that relies extensively on models involving an ‘index of tiger abundance’ derived from field counts of tiger signs. The surveys assume that there is a strong relationship between real tiger numbers and their signs, which may not be the case.“The Wildlife Institute of India had applied for this Guinness World Record with our (NTCA) approval soon after the results were declared by the Prime Minister. We stand by our numbers and estimation methodology. In fact, out of the estimated 2967 tigers, 2461 tigers or 83 % of them have been individually captured. If anything, the numbers are conservative,” said Anup Kumar Nayak, former member secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority, who was in charge of the estimation. Nayak retired from his post on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-tiger-census-creates-guinness-record/story-GN7WK7dE0XLG4YuUBtNhBK.html
12-07-2020||India||Vikas Dubey had 22-year-old feud with slain officer||Gangster Vikas Dubey, who was gunned down by the police on Friday, had a long-running feud with deputy superintendent Devendra Mishra, one of the eight officials ambushed by Dubey’s men in Bikru village near Kanpur city, according to a person involved in the investigation into the July 3 attack on the policemen.“The seeds of their rivalry were sown almost 22 year ago when Devendra Mishra was a head constable. Over the years, Mishra rose to the rank of deputy SP,” a Kanpur police inspector said after interacting with Mishra’s family members on Saturday, requesting anonymity.“It was not the first time that Vikas Dubey opened fire on Devendra Mishra. He did a similar act when Mishra was posted as head constable at Kalyanpur police station [close to Bikru village] in December 1998. Mishra survived and opened fire in retaliation, but he missed the target. Dubey was arrested after a scuffle with police personnel in full public view,” said the inspector privy to the investigation.The inspector said records revealed that one Hari Mohan Singh was in-charge of the Kalyanpur police station in Kanpur at that time. In the 1998 firing, Dubey targeted Singh as well. Singh was under political pressure to release Dubey, but eventually the criminal was booked in two separate cases under narcotics act and the arms act. Later, a case was filed under the Gangster Act. These cases are still pending.Mishra was transferred from Kalyanpur after he was promoted to the rank of sub-inspector, and was posted in different police stations in Kanpur and districts. Mishra got promoted as an inspector in 2007 and as a deputy SP in 2016, the inspector said. He returned to Kanpur and took charge as the Bilhaur circle officer some time ago, he added.He said Mishra was aware of Dubey’s history and was going tough on him and his aides. Mishra also kept tabs on Chaubeypur station officer Vinay Tiwari, who has been suspended and arrested after the ambush.Mishra even wrote a letter to the former Kanpur senior superintendent of police, alleging nexus between Dubey and some local policemen. Officials are probing the letter.“The CO got two criminals cases registered against Dubey for extortion, murder and kidnapping since March 13 this year,” the inspector said.Dubey wanted to settle scores with Mishra, the inspector said. A tip-off on an impending raid by a police team to Dubey’s village helped the gangster plan the ambush and kill Mishra, three sub-inspectors and four constables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dubey-had-22-yr-old-feud-with-slain-officer/story-nSFPquoo2P4iDzvIsH12fJ.html
12-07-2020||India||Delhi govt cancels all state university exams amid Covid-19 crisis||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday announced all examinations, including final exams, to be conducted in universities under the city-state’s government stand cancelled in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. The minister added that degrees will be awarded to students on the basis of evaluation parameters decided by the universities. “In light of the major disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Delhi govt has decided to cancel all Delhi state university exams including final exams,” Sisodia tweeted. The move will apply to semester as well as terminal exams at various state universities across Delhi. During a press briefing, Sisodia - who also handles Delhi’s education ministry - said that schools and colleges have been shut throughout amid the Covid-19 crisis. In light of the major disruptions caused by the Coronavirus pandemic, Delhi govt has decided to cancel all Delhi state university exams including final exams https://t.co/g4SFLqaBQK“For schools in Delhi, we had decided not to conduct examinations for classes 9th and 11th and promote them based on other evaluation parameters,” Sisodia stated. “We requested the Central government to follow the same pattern for the CBSE board exams in the national capital and it is finally happening,” he added. The minister added that while the matter with schools was sorted, universities posed another challenge as this entire semester no practicals, field or lab research could be carried out. “Keeping this mind, the Delhi government believes there is no point conducting university examination for a semester where no studies took place,” he said.The education minister added that students who already have job offers need to get their degrees to start working and support their families at the time of an economic crisis created by the pandemic. “Extraordinary times like these call for extraordinary measures,” Sisodia said quoting chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Delhi has several state universities such as Ambedkar University, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi Technological University, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW), National Law University Delhi, among others. This comes after the University Grants Commission (UGC) on Monday announced that universities must conduct exams for final-year students by September. Sisodia said that the government was planning to approach the Centre on the matter.“Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will write a letter to the Prime Minister requesting him to cancel exams for students across all central universities as well,” he said.Delhi’s coronavirus cases have crossed the one-lakh mark and stand at 109,140 of which over 80,000 people have recovered from the infection. Covid-19 death toll in the national capital has jumped to 3,300.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-cancels-all-state-university-exams-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-I1JpeIFzm5dw0zVI50QtiK.html
12-07-2020||Editorials||The roots of the Rajasthan battle | HT Editorial||The war between Rajasthan chief minister (CM) Ashok Gehlot, and deputy CM and state Congress chief, Sachin Pilot, is now out in the open, threatening the survival of the Congress government in the state. When the party won in 2017, Mr Pilot expected to be rewarded and made CM. But Mr Gehlot’s hold over the party organisation, and the desire of the party high command not to antagonise the “old guard” saw the CM post being awarded to Mr Gehlot. Since then — over the distribution of power in the government, appointments of bureaucrats, candidate selection in the Lok Sabha polls, and policy issues — both have been at loggerheads. But with a police summon to Mr Pilot for a case to do with destabilisation of the government (Mr Gehlot too has been summoned, but given that he is also home minister, this appears perfunctory); signs of rebellion by Mr Pilot and his loyalists; a public war of the words between the two factions; and speculation that the Mr Pilot is in touch with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the crisis within the Congress in Rajasthan has taken a new turn. While Mr Gehlot should have been more consultative in his approach, and Mr Pilot more patient about his ambitions, the issue is not specific to a personality clash between the two leaders. It is, yet again, evidence of the inability of the Congress leadership in Delhi to provide guidance, take decisions, manage conflicts, and accommodate aspirations. The party has not yet had a review of the reasons for its loss in two consecutive national elections. There remains an acute crisis of leadership at the top, with groups calling for the return of Rahul Gandhi as president, even as Mr Gandhi remains reluctant. Other voices calling for the democratisation of the organisation — through an independent electoral process to choose a new president and a new Congress Working Committee — are not being heard. In this backdrop, it is but natural that younger leaders will seek opportunities to sustain their political lives and grow, instead of merely waiting for the leadership to resolve its issues. What is happening in Jaipur is exactly what happened in Bhopal earlier this year. The party lost Jyotiraditya Scindia, who had been raising issues within internal forums for over a year but to no avail; the net impact — the Congress lost its government in Madhya Pradesh. Irrespective of whether the Rajasthan government survives, the Congress should be alarmed at its rapidly depleting political capital, its internal mismanagement, and the fury of some of its brightest, young political stars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-roots-of-the-rajasthan-battle/story-BBgg4QvazI5FQZhupB6q6I.html
12-07-2020||Editorials||A turning point for the financial sector | HT Editorial||In a speech on Saturday, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das pointed out that the pandemic could fritter away the gains made so far on the non-performing assets (NPA) front. The gross NPA ratio for scheduled commercial banks improved from 9.1% in March 2019 to 8.3% in March 2020. The economic disruption will impair the timely repayment of loans and therefore worsen the NPA crisis. While this is not surprising, the governor also said that it was uncertain when supply chains would be restored fully; when demand would get normalised; and “what kind of durable effects the pandemic will leave behind on our potential growth”. While the first two concern immediate economic recovery, durable effects on potential growth have policy implications. For example, RBI’s monetary policy framework, which must keep inflation within two percentage points of the mandated 4% level, uses an inflation targeting model. This requires a potential growth rate. Any significant change to this variable will render the present framework infructuous. The governor also pointed out how shocks to the financial system “dubbed as once in a lifetime events” seemed to be have become more frequent than even once in a decade. This, he said, means that the minimum capital requirement of banks may no longer be considered sufficient to absorb the losses. If the banks do not know about the rest of the economy, which is what uncertainty about potential growth means, and the economy does not know about the banks, which is what capital requirements becoming inadequate imply, it suggests India is entering into hitherto uncharted territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-turning-point-for-the-financial-sector/story-5B6yr0uZQeH2lyvaJ9sN5J.html
