18-07-2020||News||Need a practical system to award degrees in times of Covid | Opinion||Covid-19 has caused immense disruption in every sector of work including education. It has forced institutions to shut down campuses midway without finishing the courses and in certain cases even without completing the examinations. While the issue of public examination at the school stage has been addressed with the timely intervention of the Supreme Court, it is hanging fire in the university system because of lack of unanimity amongst policy makers and the rest of the stakeholders.The matter has reached such a sorry pass that besides students, even some of the states have come out in open to contest the guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission which requires all universities to conduct the final-year examination by September 2020. It is learnt that the Delhi Government has already asked all its universities to declare their results based on previous performance, letting out a sigh of relief by anxious parents and students.The entire issue needs to be examined from four perspectives.The first and the foremost is professional credibility. If students are promoted without ensuring the end product of instructional efforts and without determining whether the learning is sufficiently complete to move on to the next stage, then it raises legitimate questions about the professional credibility of the entire process. Clause 4.1 of the UGC (Minimum Standards of Instruction for the Grant of the First Degree through Formal Education) Regulations, 1985, stipulate that the University “shall” adopt the guidelines issued by the UGC from time to time in regard to the conduct of examination. Clause 4.2 of the same Regulations also mandates Universities to show separately the continuous sessional evaluation and the year-end examination marks. Though the UGC has not done any wrong in issuing the guidelines, they have created ripples which cannot be wholly discounted under the present circumstances.Secondly, if some of the students have really worked hard and are confident of a much better performance in the last leg than the previous ones, and they get promoted on the basis of earlier averages, then it raises the genuine question of its legal defensibility unless adequate provisions are made for addressing concerns of such candidates.Thirdly, if our institutions are not able to put in place infallible systems to shatter the coronavirus pandemic, which is lethal and not unfolding its mystery, then it raises serious questions about the safety and security of our students. In fact, it is this aspect which has led to serious reservations in the mind of parents and students about the resilience of most of our institutions and their safety and security measures.Fourthly, if the majority of stakeholders disregard the consequences of the earlier three standpoints because of the fear of worldwide mayhem caused by the pandemic, then it raises an undisputable question of its public acceptability which need not be dismissed without exploring reasonable alternative measures in these trying times.One of the serious shortcomings of our system has been that we have never made sincere efforts to institutionalise open book, take home and online examinations due to serious issues of integrity, quality, lack of motivation and adoption and scaling of information communication technology ICT tools. Though we have been talking about the digital transformation of higher education for over two decades, much leaves to be desired. Had we institutionalised the proctored online examinations in our teaching and learning, we would not have faced the current crisis as it allows the candidates to take online exams from any reliable location ensuring all the safety measures required for the conduct of a fair examination. But it is going to take a long time before it percolates down into the system.This is an issue that cannot be allowed to linger on as it is causing disquiet of limitless proportion amongst parents and students. Having regard to the harsh realities of the ground, we may allow the 2nd and 4th semester students to move on to the 3rd and 5th semester and their exams could either be taken during ensuing vacations, if the situation permits, or clubbed with the 3rd and 5th semester exams. The final semester candidates could be cleared and declared fit for the award of degrees on the basis of the aggregate performance of their previous semesters coupled with sessional evaluation of the final semester, which together would constitute over 83 percent of their course contents. A similar approach could be followed for the final year students of the four-year Bachelors and two or three-year Masters programmes. If there remain some candidates who do not subscribe to this offer, which of course is going to a miniscule number, then a provision could easily be made for their online or offline examinations maintaining all norms of social distancing.When risk and nervousness are gripping the mind of students and parents amid the pandemic, it is best to negotiate a little with the process of evaluation for the much-needed respite. The alternative suggested is to tide over divergent scenarios being perceived by stakeholders in higher education in view of Covid-19. But surely, no time should be lost any more to work out all dimensions of curriculum, its transaction and assessment, in an integrated manner. The future beckons to blended learning through offline and online modes. Let us move in that direction in real professionalism.[Prof Ved Prakash is former chairman of the University Grants Commission]||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/an-alternate-measure-of-awarding-degrees-in-times-of-covid-opinion/story-ttx8JfldbiT75nRfkHNwPP.html
18-07-2020||City||Gurugram: RWA donates 10,000 masks to city’s municipal corporation||Gurugram: Around 10,000 masks were donated to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) by the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) of The Legend condominia in Sector 57 on Saturday, during the civic body’s plantation drive in the area.According to a statement by the MCG, the masks were handed over to MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh who also inaugurated the plantation drive. “I have a garment manufacturing company where these cloth masks are made. We just wanted to contribute in some way with the anti-Covid-19 measures and hence made the donation,” said Naveen Jain, general secretary of the RWA.From June 27-August 3, the MCG is carrying out plantation drives during each weekend with the assistance of RWAs. The MCG is aiming to plant 80,000 saplings across the city and is providing the same to RWAs free of cost, who can then plant the sapling in their respective areas.“About 280 RWAs have registered for this initiative, and the MCG has provided more than 15,000 plants from its four nurseries to around 150 RWAs so far. On Saturday and Sunday, around 100 saplings will be planted at The Legend condominia. We are undertaking the drive in several other residential areas across the city as well,” said SS Rohilla, public relation officer, MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-rwa-donates-10-000-masks-to-city-s-municipal-corporation/story-QAb5Yv8KZHmI0qZg2EPEJM.html
18-07-2020||City||Gurugram: Now, MCG making efforts to curb vector-borne diseases||Gurugram: After diverting almost all its resources towards curbing the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is now pooling all its efforts in ensuring the city does not witness another outbreak, albeit this time of vector-borne diseases.In this regard, the MCG on Wednesday initiated a six-day fogging and larvicidal drive that will cover around 540 residential areas in the city. Although the MCG had started their anti-larval operations in May, officials said that due to most resources being diverted towards fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, their daily-coverage for fogging and larvicidal activities had been far lower than in previous years, with a maximum of one or two municipal wards being covered per day instead of a large number of areas spread across the city.“Fighting coronavirus still remains our number one priority. However, given that the virus has already stretched our heavily inadequate health system, we realised that another such outbreak like malaria, dengue, or chikungunya can further complicate matters. Hence, we have now amped our anti-vector borne measures and for the next four-six weeks during which we will be undertaking extensive fumigation drives across the city,” said a senior official in MCG’s health wing, asking not to be identified.The official further said that Gurugram has already recorded its first case of a vector-borne disease, with a city resident testing positive for plasmodium malaria.Although the health department and the MCG have together formed teams compromising 171 officials, who have 49 fogging machines at their disposal, MCG officials clarified that they would be initiating their six-day drive independently.“Around 100 MCG officials, who have 31 hand-held fogging machines, will be taking part in the six-day drive. It will be a continuous process and all efforts are being undertaken by the MCG to ensure the entire city is covered,” said Ashish Singla, chief medical officer (CMO), MCG. As per officials, for larvicidal operations, one gambusia fish hatchery has been developed in Wazirabad for the 2020 monsoon from where the MCG will be procuring and introducing the fishes into different water bodies or points of heavy water accumulation points in the city.Gambusia fishes feed on mosquito larvae.On Monday, an MCG release said that along with the district health department, 39,000 houses across the city have been surveyed from June 1 till July 12, and 90 people had been served notices for not destroying potential mosquito breeding sources.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, who asked not to be identified, since July 13, the MCG and the health department have surveyed 60,000 more houses across the city and served notices to 84 persons for violations.At least 22 cases of dengue and 15 cases of malaria were reported last year, the lowest in the city in the past four years.In 2018, however, 93 cases of dengue were recorded, 66 in 2017, 86 in 2016, and 451 in 2015. Thirty cases of malaria were recorded in the city in 2018, 48 in 2017, 36 in 2016, and 44 in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-now-mcg-making-efforts-to-curb-vector-borne-diseases/story-IwdDJkD1FGOG2CAN0L3scM.html
18-07-2020||Chandigarh||Amritsar GMC staff swaps bodies of Covid-19 victims||The Amritsar Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) staff on Saturday interchanged bodies of two Covid-19 victims while sending them to their families in Amritsar and Hoshiarpur.On Saturday, a 37-year-old woman of Damganj area of Amritsar had died of Covid-19 at the GMCH. Soon after her death, her body was sent to mortuary and authorities were told to pack her body in the personal protection equipment (PPE) kits before handling the body to her family members.The same day, a 92-year-old man of Hoshiarpur district, who was also undergoing treatment at the GMCH, died and his body was sent to mortuary. The hospital authorities, after packing the bodies in PPE kits, put wrong labels on the caskets.“The body of Amritsar woman was packed and sent to Hoshiarpur in an ambulance and the body of Hoshiarpur man was sent to family members of the woman. Since bodies were packed in PPE kits and were kept in a box, no one checked it, unless the bodies were taken for cremation. The members of both the families were shocked when they saw during the cremations that bodies of Covid-19 patients were swapped. This happened as hospital authorities put wrong name labels on the bodies,” said a GMCH doctor, reuesting anonymity.The family members had complained to the GMCH authorities after which principal Dr Rajiv Devgan and hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Raman Sharma called a meeting with the doctors concerned.Dr Devgan was unavailable to comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amritsar-gmc-staff-swaps-bodies-of-covid-19-victims/story-pMWpkukg61w9ZgqGpegVuO.html
18-07-2020||City||Gurugram: Three-layer police security to prevent crime across district||Gurugram: The police have decided to deploy personnel in three cordons covering all roads of the district to prevent criminal activities, senior officials said. The move comes after the police department conducted the crime mapping exercise using data of the past five years and identified 150 areas/spots from where maximum cases of theft, burglary, and robberies were reported.The police officials said they have started analysing the spots through the web-based software called Crime Mapping Analytics and Predictive System (CMAPS), which accesses the real-time data from the police control room (PCR). “The outer cordon will have cops deployed at the borders connecting to other districts and states. Barricading will be done and check posts will be set up to avoid unwanted entry, and all suspicious vehicles will be checked. The inner cordon will be deployed at the vulnerable spots from where most of the street crimes such as snatching, robbery, and vehicle theft have been reported. The last cordon will keep vigil on dark spots and focus on crime against women,” KK Rao, commissioner of police, said. At least 2,500 personnel will be deployed in the three layers to maintain law and order across the district, the officials said, adding that all wings, including traffic and crime investigation agency (CIA), have been assigned duties.Rao said deputy commissioner of police (DCP), assistant commissioner of police (ACP), inspectors, sub-inspectors, constables, special police officers and home guards will be deployed throughout the day. The officials said one of the prime concerns is vehicle snatching and theft for which they have started keeping a close watch on parked vehicles. Also, the traffic police have been asked to supervise the parking lots and to ensure that no miscreants are active in the area. The police commissioner said the crime data will be updated every three minutes and will reflect in the crime mapping.“We will collect information from the police control room on the geospatial map of the city, which will enable the department to pinpoint exact location of a crime. The crime teams will study the pattern of calls coming from a particular location. Suppose if there are too many burglary calls coming from an area which has many entry and exit points and less deployment of security guards, we can match those calls with past crimes in the area and understand if laxity of security is in any way responsible for this, and whether another crime is likely to occur there soon,” said Rao.The police have also started geofencing for setting the digital boundaries of PCR vans and patrol bikes. This will help reduce response time and tackle criminal activities in the district, said the officials.Also, a centralised data bank of criminals, miscreants, and history sheeters has been prepared that will help the police nab the proclaimed offenders and bail jumpers, said the officials.The police have identified 770 proclaimed offenders, 1,800 bail jumpers and 12 most wanted criminals who are on the radar and the list have been shared with all the crime teams which have been directed to arrest them at the earliest.The officials said they have identified more than 150 spots across the district and will add or subtract the areas as per the reporting of cases.As part of the new deployment plan, 79 PCR vans and 129 patrol bikes would be deployed in the three cordons of the district, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-three-layer-police-security-to-prevent-crime-across-district/story-aruTtdUhop6efUyN8wqBBP.html
18-07-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Diabetes, heart ailments common comorbidities in Covid victims||Among the first 100 deaths in Gurugram due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), diabetes, hypertension and other heart-related ailments were found to be the three most common comorbidities, according to data compiled by the district health department.At least 17 of the first 100 persons died as a result of complications due to diabetes, while at least 16 had a history of coronary ailments or events, as per the data, while at least 12 had hypertension (high blood pressure). These figures form the basis of a pattern which shows that 45% of the district’s first 100 patients who died had ailments which had some impact on the heart such as diabetes, hypertension or other related ailments.The district’s Covid-19 death toll had reached the 100-mark on July 5.Another 20 of the 100 fatalities had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), district health department data shows. “However, ARDS is not a comorbidity, per se. It is a symptom brought about due to infection. The comorbidity here is impaired respiratory function, but some of those who developed ARDS were also diabetic or hypertensive, making their condition prone to aggravation,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer, Gurugram, and member of the district death audit committee.Other comorbidities recorded by the death audit committee in Gurugram include cancer, or acute leukaemia (in five of the deaths), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (in 10 deaths), and pneumonia (in six deaths). The remaining 14 deaths were attributed to a range of other underlying conditions, including intracranial haemorrhages, lower respiratory tract infections and others. Of the first 100 fatalities, men accounted for 78 deaths, while 22 were women. According to the health department’s data, of the 100, the age group of 61-70 years saw 26 fatalities (including seven women), followed by 18 deaths (including two women) in the 71-80 years age group.Dr Piyush Goel, a pulmonologist at a private hospital in the city, said, “These numbers are not surprising. Diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac problems are among the most widespread comorbidities in India. In fact, a majority of the patients requiring intensive medical care usually have one of these illnesses, or a combination of them.” He said that it is important for people with these ailments to stay at home, for now, to protect themselves from the pandemic.Gurugram’s chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav reiterated that diabetics, and those with hypertension or cardiac issues, should exercise extra precaution.  “There is more and more evidence that Covid-19 isn’t just a disease that attacks your lungs. It can lead to a variety of other complications, impacting kidneys and other organs. When the body’s immune system works overtime, it adds a lot of stress on organs other than the lungs, causing conditions like inflammation of tissue,” he said. Comorbidities also affect the body’s natural ability to produce antibodies, and bring down the level of ACE2 receptors, which are essential for a healthy immune system, he added.“A comorbidity essentially compromises a patient’s ability to withstand the added stress, which can lead to entire organ systems shutting down, causing death,” the CMO added.Between July 5 and 18, the district reported 14 more Covid-related deaths. While health officials did not provide data on comorbidities for these 14 deaths, they said a significant number of them were either diabetic or had hypertension, while at least one had suffered a coronary event in the past.Till July 18, the district had reported a total of 7,594 Covid-19 cases. With 114 deaths, the case-fatality ratio (CFR) for Gurugram now stands at 1.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-diabetes-heart-ailments-common-comorbidities-in-covid-victims/story-yRhQkwV5FN0AnsvmGnmgpK.html
18-07-2020||City||Gurugram: Health dept to distribute pulse oximeters to Covid-19 patients||Gurugram: The district health department has procured 500 pulse oximeters, which it plans to distribute to Covid-19 patients, especially elderly patients, in large outbreak regions (LORs) to facilitate early medical intervention in case of an emergency. The move is a key intervention to stave off sudden Covid-19 related deaths, health officials said, adding that there have been close to 10 such deaths in Gurugram so far.“The infection causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, which lowers the patient’s oxygen saturation level. Pulse oximeters will be given to select patients, particularly older people, so that they can monitor the level of oxygen in the blood. If the saturation level of a patient dips to below 90%, we will immediately send an ambulance and give him/her oxygen therapy,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Gurugram. The officials said that the pulse oximeter, a small device that can be clipped onto the index finger tip, can play a significant role in reducing Covid-19 deaths by early detection of reducing lung function (a telltale Covid-19 symptom). “We will instruct patients on how to use the device. All our rapid response teams, which are doing door-to-door surveys in large outbreak regions, will be carrying the oximeters. When deemed necessary, they will be provided to patients,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. With positive cases of coronavirus disease crossing the 7,000-mark, the district administration on Wednesday announced nine new LORs and put them under lockdown till July 28. As per the order issued by the administration, the newly identified LORs include Rajiv Nagar, Om Nagar (Shivaji Nagar and Shanti Nagar), Nathupur (Ravinder Nath slum, Shamshan Ghat slum), Laxman Vihar ( Dayanand Colony), Block-H Palam Vihar, Feroz Gandhi Colony (Madanpuri, Baldev Nagar) and Patel Nagar (Nai Basti and Arjun Nagar).Till Saturday, Gurugram reported a total of 7,594 Covid-19 cases while 114 people have died due to the infection so far. The district surveillance officer said that the Delhi government, too, has adopted their use in response to the epidemic. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that the national capital has been able to “minimise deaths” of Covid-19 patients in home isolation with the help of pulse oximeters. “If patients detect their oxygen is falling, they reach out to us for help. We immediately send oxygen concentrators to their home or take them to a hospital,” Kejriwal had tweeted recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-health-dept-to-distribute-pulse-oximeters-to-covid-19-patients/story-sKJbzqYnZiVmXk0TqxhieO.html
18-07-2020||City||Shopkeeper alleges assault by police||Greater Noida: An 18-year-old shopkeeper has alleged that he, along with his mother and uncle, were assaulted by the police when they refused to give money to them for running the shop. The police, however, have denied the allegations. The incident came to fore on Friday when a video of the family members started circulating on social media in which they alleged that they were framed in a false case after they refused to pay money to local police personnel. They have also said that they wrote to the UP chief minister in this regard.The shopkeeper, a resident of Alpha 2 sector, runs a paan vend with his family members in a local market under the Beta 2 police jurisdiction. In his complaint to the CM, he alleged that on July 14, a few policemen came to their shop demanding Rs 300 per day for running the shop but the family refused.“They must have been miffed at our refusal to pay the money because when I was closing the shop that night around 9.30pm, they said that I was violating rules and one constable started assaulting me with a stick. When I tried to defend myself, they alleged that I had assaulted a policeman on duty and I would be sent to jail for this,” said the shopkeeper.In a video of his mother circulating online, she has claimed that she was also beaten up and her son and brother-in-law were sent to jail for two days in a false case after the family refused to pay the extortion money.“My son had told me that two police constables had been bothering them for at least 15 days. He got hurt severely while trying to defend me as well from the sticks of the policemen,” said the woman.The police officials have, however, denied all the allegations.“They were simply asked to close their shop as it was past the curfew time, but they refused. When the elderly man was detained, the youngster assaulted the police personnel with a stick. Two of them sustained injuries and we have their medical reports. Afterwards, they were both booked for interfering with government work,” said Sujeet Kumar Upadhyay, station house officer, Beta 2 police station.A case was registered against the shopkeeper and his uncle under sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant in the execution of his duty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the Indian Penal Code, the police said.The police officials said that a probe in the matter is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shopkeeper-alleges-assault-by-police/story-8cuVCZ5yjHCJwbynUN12DO.html
18-07-2020||City||Forest dept plans to plant 240 tree species in an hour, achieve a first in UP||Noida: The state forest department is working on a plantation drive across eight districts, including Gautam Budh Nagar, on July 28 during which it will attempt a record by planting spalings of 240 tree species within an hour.Forest officials said at least 12 saplings each of the 240 species shall be planted during the hour. Each of the eight participating districts will be getting a minimum of 30 species in a bid to conserve the biodiversity of Uttar Pradesh. They said the aim is to make a new record and conserve some of the native species once found in abundance but are now rarely spotted.“This is the first time that such a record is being attempted. The drive will be held across eight districts and the list of species is still being finalised,” Anupam Gupta, additional chief conservator forest (CCF) and mission director of the plantation drive, said.The participating districts include Gautam Budh Nagar, Meerut, Barabanki, Lucknow, Banda, Sitapur, Faizabad and Lalitpur.“Each species will be distinct, so we are aiming for species that have no subspecies. Apart from a few most of the species we shortlisted are indigenous. Only a few exotic species, such as vilayati babul (Prosopis juliflora), were included on the list as they are good at adapting. Our previous plantation drives usually targeted numbers, but this time we want to celebrate biodiversity and variety,” NK Janoo, CCF, Meerut, said.According to Janoo, some of the rare species being planted in Gautam Budh Nagar included camphor and miswak.“A number of species such as miswak, which once could be found in abundance across Rajasthan, will be planted in Noida. The rare camphor tree will also be planted in the city. There are many other species which have been lost over time, like the sal trees. They are now seen only in some forest pockets and have largely been replaced by teak trees. There are also the kadamb and tamal trees, which have become a rarity and will be accommodated in the list,” Janoo said.In Noida, the plantation drive will be led by the district forest department at a patch of land near Yamuna Expressway.“The saplings will be bought from different areas such as Saharanpur, Dhaulpur, Allahabad and Meerut. We will hold the plantation at a patch of green area in Sector 20 along Yamuna Expressway. The mock drill was held on Friday to ensure the main event goes without a glitch,” PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/forest-dept-plans-to-plant-240-tree-species-in-an-hour-achieve-a-first-in-up/story-PsUGTr9nZDd1ncJGfBd2rI.html
18-07-2020||City||80% of Covid-19 beds vacant in Gautam Budh Nagar hospitals||NOIDA: Even as the Covid-19 cases in Gautam Budh Nagar are on the rise, only one-fifth of the total number of beds in different Covid-dedicated hospitals in the district are occupied.According to officials, there are around 3,000 Covid beds in 12 different government and private hospitals in the district, of which only about 600 are occupied.The total strength of beds across the five L-1 category hospitals in the district is 1,530, of which around 250 are occupied, the officials said. The L1 beds include 100 in Kailash corona isolation centre (Greater Noida), 250 each in Tata hospital (Sector 125) and Noida Institute of Medical Science (Greater Noida), 900 in Bennett hospital and 30 in Community Health Centre (CHC), Bisrakh.Out of these L-1 category hospitals, Bennett hospital and CHC (Bisrakh) have been kept in reserve to accommodate patients in an emergency, said Dr Manoj Kushwaha, district surveillance officer. “In L-2 category hospitals, nearly half the number of beds at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) is occupied, while the Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital and Post-Graduate Teaching Institute, also known as Child PGI, has only 22% occupancy. Among other L-2 facilities, while Fortis has 30% occupancy, Kailash hospital (Noida) has around 25% of its bed strength occupied,” he said.In the L-3 category, the district has only one operational hospital. “While the Tata hospital (Sector 39), which has 250 beds, has not yet started, the 400-bed Sharda hospital is operational. But, only 10% of its beds are occupied as 42 patients were admitted there till Friday,” Kushwaha said.On Saturday, GB Nagar reported 90 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of positive cases to 4,030 in the district, according to the daily health bulletin released by the state government. The district has a total of 953 active cases, the bulletin said. As many as 3,033 patients have been discharged so far, while 38 have died of Covid-19, the bulletin said. Meanwhile, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the administration is all set to take care of Covid-19 patients in an effective manner. “To cope with any emergency, we have plans to raise the number of dedicated beds for Covid-19 patients in the district to at least 5,000. Also, since the state government has already announced price caps for per day treatment at private medical colleges and hospitals, many of them have already started developing exclusive facilities for Covid-19 patients,” he said.The DM also said that all private and government hospitals have been asked to ensure that all patients, coming to the emergency and other wards, must be treated without any delay. “If any hospital faces difficulties in treating patients, they can refer them to hospitals with better healthcare facilities. But, before referring those patients, that hospital will have to properly co-ordinate with the referred hospital so that the patients do not suffer. However, the standard protocol for Covid-19 will be followed at every step by all these hospitals,” he said.The DM also said that there is no dearth of doctors and paramedics in any of these Covid-19 facilities. “Since it is always better to have the maximum bench strength, particularly in a pandemic situation, some of these hospitals have also advertised for vacancies of doctors and support staff,” he said.About the projection of cases in coming months, Suhas said that despite increasing the number of tests, there is no rocketing surge in Covid-19 cases in the district. “The data analysis of July (when surveillance was accelerated in the district) so far indicates that the graph is consistent between the new positives and discharged patients. I hope the number of active cases in the district will never go beyond 2,000,” he said.The district’s acting chief medical officer Dr Nepal Singh reiterated the DM’s views, saying that the district has adequate capacity of beds to cater to Covid-19 cases. “All facilities are ready with their bench strength. Even the new facility in Sector 39 is all set to be kicked off. The process of appointment of doctors and other para-medical staff has already begun,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/80-of-covid-19-beds-vacant-in-gautam-budh-nagar-hospitals/story-TC8XeO41A7nzlraCPsxvRL.html
18-07-2020||Bhopal||Four illegal sand miners booked for hitting Assistant sub-inspector||Police registered a case against four illegal miners for hitting and abusing an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) in Sheopur district on Saturday while he was checking the transportation of illegally mined sand at a Morena-Sheopur border check post, said police.The miners also fled with four tractor-trolleys laden with illegally mined sand from the check post. The main accused was identified as Bunty Rawat, a resident of Morena while three others are yet to be identified, said Sampath Upadhyay, superintendent of police (SP), Sheopur. The SP also ordered an inquiry on the police personnel after a video of the incident went viral on social media in which two miners with a trolley laden with illegally mined sand are accusing police of taking money from them. “In the video, a miner can be seen hitting and abusing a police assistant sub-inspector Rajendra Jadon posted at Vijaypur police station while threatening him of dire consequences. He was also seen in the video accusing police personnel of taking money from them not for taking action but, they are heard saying, now police are stopping them. Another miner threatened the police personnel by saying that don’t call him and if he calls him it won’t be a good for him,” as seen in the video. Upadhyay said, “Bunty Rawat and three others, all residents of Morena, were coming from Morena in tractor-trolleys laden with illegally mined sand from Chambal river, where mining is prohibited since 2006. ASI Rajendra Jadon stopped them, they slapped him and also pushed him hard. Later, they threatened the police personnel and fled from the spot.”An FIR has been registered under section 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (Obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 332 (voluntarily causes hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty), 294 (obscene act) and 506 (criminal intimidation) on the complaint of Jadon, said Upadhyay.Upadhyaya said, “An inquiry has been ordered to check the claims of illegal miners of giving money to police personnel and the relation of police personnel with sand mafia.”Locals have raised question and saying there is a nexus of police and sand mafia.A political analyst and local activist Jayant Singh said, “A few days ago, the sand mining mafia attacked a team of district administration in Vijaypur area of Sheopur and fled with the tractor-trolleys by threatening a district administration team led by a sub-divisional magistrate . The SDM had asked for police protection but police reached after an hour of the incident. This is only one example. There are audio and video clips that went viral on social media in the past in which illegal miners can be heard they have police protection in Morena, Sheopur and Bhind and that’s why hardly any strict action was taken against them. We also believe this as we have never seen any strict drive against illegal miners in Chambal.” Meanwhile, former chief minister and MP Congress Committee state president Kamal Nath said, “With the change in government, the illegal sand mining returned to MP. Sand mafia is openly beating police personnel and accusing them of illegal recovery of money. Sand mafia is attacking on a government official and the state government chose to keep mum. Who is protecting sand mafia in MP? Why state government is not taking action against them.”BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Kamal Nath ji should first answer the allegations made by his own party leaders of flourishing sand mafia during his regime. Now, FIR is being registered by the police against sand mafia and all the measures are being taken to stop the illegal mining.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/four-illegal-sand-miners-booked-for-hitting-assistant-sub-inspector/story-qbmHY8VIMl6DJuKMHz3Y1O.html

18-07-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: For online studies limit children’s exposure to digital devices||The world today is not just grappling with the deadly Covid-19 pandemic, but its fallout too on people’s lives, their education, jobs and businesses.The student community has been hit particularly hard with schools closed for more than three months, forcing them to log into smart phones to access teachers’ lectures as classes go online.Serious concerns, therefore, arise in this scenario, about the youngsters’ health and wellness, and a pointer in this direction has come this week from the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry that Children in classes 1 to 8 should spend no more than two teaching sessions of 30 to 45 minutes each in a day. Only four such sessions have been recommended by the ministry to limit the time students spend in front of screens.A report in Hindustan Times said recently that the HRD ministry guidelines — which are not binding but are likely to be adopted by schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Kendriya Vidyalayas — are meant “to mitigate the impact of the pandemic” on the roughly 240 million children as schools stay shut to reduce the risk of infection. Schools will need to “remodel” and “re-imagine” teaching and learning methods by introducing suitable home and institutional schooling methods, reads the HRD ministry’s document.Focus should be on consolidation of learning and not attempts made to complete the syllabus quickly. “Plan the interventions keeping in mind students’ level, age, resource availability, nature of content, etc,” the guidelines suggest.Rather than relying too much on teaching in front of screens, schools have been asked to focus on the alternative academic calendar, which the National Council of Educational Research and Training is preparing for the year.Medical experts say children exposed to digital technologies or gadgets for a longer time are prone to severe health issues, underlining the need for age-appropriate schedules.HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank has said the guidelines, titled PRAGYATA, have been developed from the perspective of learners, with a focus on online, blended or digital education for students who are at present at home.The picture is very clear, it is not just teachers and schools that will now have to take the session forward this year; parents, family and peers too will need to chip in to support the youngsters. Not just studies; how children deal with everyday living; learn from experiences during this period and focus on mental health issues as well will be important.Virtual worldHow can children’s exposure to digital devices be limited? Should children be exposed for long hours to computers or smartphones while studying from home? How can blended education work in schools? Send your responses and a mugshot to Chandigarh@hindustantimes.com by July 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-chandigarh-our-take-for-online-studies-limit-children-s-exposure-to-digital-devices/story-ZnFLIDAsGljK6rJTQ6sURO.html

18-07-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University likely to win MAKA trophy for second year in a row||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, there is good news for Panjab University (PU). The varsity is likely to win the prestigious Maulana Abul Kalam Azad (MAKA) trophy for the best all-round performance in sports among Indian varsities for the second year in a row. PU has claimed 11,582 points for their performance at inter-university competitions, Khelo India youth and university games and international competitions for the year 2019-20. PU has claimed the highest points among universities who are in the race for the MAKA trophy.The varsity also won the inaugural Khelo India University Games organised by the Union sports ministry in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, in February this year. Last year’s first runner’s up, Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU), Amritsar, claimed 10,516 points and is likely to retain their second position. Punjabi University, Patiala, has claimed 8,145 points, while Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, has claimed 4,170 points.LPU, that has applied for the first-time, is likely to be placed fourth.The Union sports ministry has invited objections from contending universities and the last date for submitting objections are on July 23. The final announcement is likely to be made in August. “As per submission of points, we are number one and will definitely retain this position even when the calculation will be done after inviting objections,” said Panjab University sports director Parminder Singh. “But officially, we have to wait till the ministry announces the final ranking,” he added.In PU’s annual performance, shooting contributed to maximum points with 2,443, while swimming added to 1,180 points.

18-07-2020||Lucknow||Bulandshahr violence accused named PMJYA gen secy, felicitated by BJP leader||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been left red-faced following the appointment of Shikhar Agarwal as the Bulandshahr district general secretary of PM Jankalyankari Yojna Jagrukta Abhiyan (PMJYJA), purportedly run by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that has nothing to do with the party, but which appears to enjoy the blessings of a section of Union ministers.Agarwal, the former Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader, is an accused in the 2018 Bulandshahr cow slaughter violence case that led to the alleged murder of inspector Subodh Kumar Singh.He was released on bail last August after spending over seven months in jail. Although local BJP leaders have distanced themselves from his appointment claiming that PMJYJA is an NGO that has nothing to do with their party, a photograph of the July 14 programme shows Bulandshahr BJP district unit chief Anil Sisodia handing out a certificate to Agarwal. The certificate carries names of several BJP leaders, including Union ministers Ramesh Pokhariyal Nishank, Narendra Tomar, and Giriraj Singh, who are members of the NGO’s steering committee, or margdarshak mandal. “PMJYJA is an NGO, which has no connection with the BJP. It is an independent organisation that can take its own decisions,” said Sanjay Gurjar, general secretary, BJP Bulandshahr district unit.PMJYJA’s district president Priytam Singh Prem and western Uttar Pradesh (UP) president Dr. Yatendra Kumar Sain were unavailable for their comments.However, a BJP leader, on the condition of anonymity, said, “I was surprised when I came to know about his appointment. He was sacked from the party after his name figured among the accused in Bulandshahr violence”. Violence had erupted outside the Chingrawthi police post in Bulandshahr after an alleged incident of cow slaughter in the adjoining village of Mahav was reported in the intervening night of December 2 and 3, 2018.Sumit, a youth from Chingrawthi, was killed in alleged police firing and a mob cornered inspector Singh of Syana police station and allegedly shot him dead. Villagers also set the police post on fire and torched many vehicles. Over a dozen villagers and police personnel had sustained injuries in the clash.Agarwal and Yogesh Raj were among the 27 named accused and 60 more unnamed protesters were also included in the first information report (FIR). The cases were lodged under over a dozen sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 395 (dacoity), 333 (causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from his duty), and 124A (sedition).A special investigation team (SIT) was formed to probe the incident and it arrested rioters by identifying them through available videos and photographs. Later, the police claimed that bail was granted to those who were booked for rioting and none of those charged for murder had got bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bulandshahr-violence-accused-named-pmjya-gen-secy-felicitated-by-bjp-leader/story-3VBEP6h15w5rZqhslDwnbL.html
18-07-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Playing the role of women in the life of Maharaja Ranjit Singh||For most Punjabis, and Sikhs in particular, the golden period remains the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1801-1839) when the large state was ruled by the son of the soil who is referred to as Sher-e-Punjab (Lion of the Punjab). This was a time of progress and the glory of the land stretching from the borders of Tibet and touching the capital city of Delhi. The annexation of Punjab in 1849 by the East India company just 10 years after the passing away of the Maharaja was a sad blow as, among other things, the maharaja had stood for communal harmony and is lauded in the land and even across the border in Pakistan as the only Punjabi king the Land of the Five Rivers after King Porus who was defeated by Alexander in 326 BC.Post Independence in 1947 Punjabi writers, scholars, historians and artistes have turned time and again to look into this period and rejoice in its glory as well as the sad fate that befell it and it was lost to the British colonizers. The dirge by the court poet Shah Mohammad still brings tears to the eyes of many: It spoke of the British slighting the Punjabis and taking away the Kohinoor diamond from Kunwar Dalip Singh, in whom rested the hopes of the community, to England. Interestingly, the recent times have also seen recognition and celebration of the strong women in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.Women of substanceIn fact, much attention has been paid to Rani Jindan, the beautiful and somewhat scheming young queen of the ageing maharaja, and the reason for this was the resilience she showed against the British oppressors even in the worst of times. But there were others too like Rani Sada Kaur, mother-in-law of the maharaja, who played a pivotal role in the Maharaja’s rise to power. Yet another woman who showed her guts was the dancing girl of Lahore, the young and beautiful Moran of Hira Mandi who married the monarch on her own terms and remained true to Islam, the faith that she was born to, even as the consort of the Sikh ruler. This perhaps was due to the cultural panmixia of the border land in which people learned to live together in harmony even when they belonged to different faiths.It is interesting indeed to talk to two veteran actors — Chandigarh’s own Rani Balbir Kaur and Amritsar bred Neeta Mohindra who now lives in Mumbai. Both have played queens of the then Punjab with Rani giving a memorable stage performance as Rani Jindan and Neeta acting out the political acumen of Rani Sada Kaur in a tele serial. Why we mention them is because these days a 56-episode serial, Maharaja Ranjit, made in 2010-2011 at Amritsar, is being streamed again.Role to rememberFor Neeta it was a role to remember. Looking back, she says, “I was teaching those days in Amritsar and Raj Babbar asked me to help them in the local casting. In the course he asked me to do the role of Rani Sada Kaur. To be honest I had not heard of her but when I did get to know, I was amazed. The Rani mothered, trained and got her daughter married to the Maharaja because she saw that he was meant to be king. Not just that, she also marched into battlefields with him with a sword in hand, one of the rare women to do so in those times. Of course her end was somewhat tragic when she fell apart with the Maharaja and became a prisoner. But I loved her for her political acumen.”These days when people are locked in at home, Neeta is watching the serial all over again. “Of course, watching it now I feel that I could have acted her character still better!” Why not Neeta, one would love to a see a solo performance of Sada Kaur from you!Rani as Rani JindanIn the 1980s Rani Balbir Kaur gave a wonderful performance as Rani Jindan, perhaps one of her best in a play which toured abroad but was sadly banned for some reason by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) in India. Of course such bans are now over and one has seen even a Shabana Azmi play Jindan in a film in recent years. But it was Rani who looked her part with her daughter-of-the soil good looks and majestic gait. Talking about the character of Rani Jindan, she says: “I was resurrecting history not just by playing a role and my connect with Gurbani was my greatest support because never mind her follies she was a religious and pious woman.” She adds that when she played the role she wept as Jindan and as Rani too for it was a matter of faith lost to fate.Why not Moran?What comes to the mind after all of this, however, is: Why has no one dramatised the character of Moran, the bewitching dancing girl of Lahore who was deeply rooted in faith and love? Will some young Punjaban this side of the border or that be brave enough to enact the role of Moran of the Pul Kanjri fame?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-playing-the-role-of-women-in-the-life-of-maharaja-ranjit-singh/story-RzvEWg2L4wbiI9hNSzHhmK.html

Patients can consult a general physician or specialist through an android smartphone or a PC/laptop. At the end of the teleconsultation, he/she will receive an electronic prescription.C-DAC director general Dr Hemant Darbari stated that the telemedicine solution is dedicated to human life betterment and would prove to be a turning point in tele-OPD consultancy.GMCH-32 director principal Dr B S Chavan said telemedicine will help patients seek specialised healthcare services from experts from the comfort of their homes, while reducing the risk of infection. “Due to the fear of catching infection from hospitals, many patients prefer to seek medical help through telemedicine,” he said.C-DAC executive director Dr P K Khosla said the teleconsultation will offer two way audio-visual consultation and a prescription slip at the end. The centre is continuously enhancing the capabilities of eSanjeevaniOPD and it has been accepted country-wide by clinicians and patients alike, Khosla added.Presently, GMCH-32 is providing telemedicine services through the audio mode where patients calls the doctors on dedicated phone lines and seek consultation. The esanjeevani software will allow video discussion between the parties and give a feel of real in-person consultation. The feature is free of cost and saves travel time too. To begin with, the deptartments of psychiatry, ENT, skin, eye and orthopaedic will start esanjeevaniOPD from Monday for which people need to register on esanjeevaniopd.in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gmch-32-to-start-online-consultation-through-e-sanjeevaniopd-from-tomorrow/story-fMGDus8kpNLL1IMLLMzRMN.html
18-07-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: Philosophical ruminations on a monsoon afternoon||The goings on in the interiors of the human mind are usually ceaseless and their extent is unimaginable. No space is taboo, no frontier too far to conquer. Unending are the array of thoughts that assail the human mind; all of its own creation, but with a life of their own. Almost Frankensteinesque they are, in that their creator becomes the hunted, his peace unsettled forevermore. And the thoughts generated by our minds do not even belong to us in totality. They have a trajectory of their own, a zeal of their own, and even perhaps a karma of their own.In the Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda quotes Thayumanavar, a saint of South India, who wrote this “challenging” poem:You may control a mad elephant; You may shut the mouth of the bear and tiger; Ride the lion and play with the cobra; By alchemy you may earn your livelihood; You may wander through the universe incognito; Make vassals of the gods; be ever youthful; You may walk on water and live in fire: But control of the mind is better and more difficult.Those of us who think otherwise, might want to practice silence of the mind and try to control each thought that attempts to disturb its peace. Long term practitioners of meditation will vouch for the fact that even after years of practising meditation techniques, their minds will play truant at the drop of a hat. A faint sound from the next room might remind them of an unfulfilled errand, which might lead to ruminations on the need to get the car repaired and even the necessity to visit New Delhi to meet an old friend.When the monsoon rains pelt down uninhibitedly, though they’ve been relatively sparse this year, the mind tends to become philosophical. While admiring the splash and splendour of the annual visitor, one tends to wonder at nature and its act of largesse that somehow saves the inhabitants of our land from the impact of months of relentless heat and sun.One also tends to ponder over the meaning of life at such times. Although such thoughts can come to most human beings at any time, the rains somehow encourage them to sprout a little more effervescently. The ephemeral nature of life, which has been compared to the existence of a dew drop on a leaf, becomes apparent when one tries to view its bigger picture.And as I type these lines, a mellifluous song from the 1965 classic, Waqt, emanates from a nearby device. “Aaage bhi jaane na tu, peechhe bhi jaane na tu…(you don’t know what’s going to happen in the future or what happened in the past),” croons the matchless Asha Bhonsle, her voice adding depth to the truly meaningful lines penned by the inimitable Sahir Ludhianvi, with lilting music composed by the legendary Ravi.The transient nature of life and its rocky spectrum become apparent to a writer in such settings. All the more reason for human beings to buckle down and make the most of their time on earth, one would think. While family, career and interests should clearly be priorities for each of us, why waste the human avatar on needless gossip?Books are easily a favoured pastime in such scenarios as well. The consumption of luscious mangoes doesn’t go too well with the act of reading a book, so one tries to plan one’s day in a manner that the two are mostly kept apart. And the hands of course have to be kept washed as well as dried anyway. We do live in those “twenty-seconds is a must” times!The faraway skies take on tinges and hues that seldom make their presence felt at any other time of year. Monsoon evenings can be sultry or cool, but the sky is always alive and vibrant. An amateur photographer might find even more to celebrate about the beauty of nature than a writer does. And the poet can wax lyrical with aplomb at such times.Work from home norms and webinars by the dozen notwithstanding, the monsoons of 2020 have not disappointed. There is every excuse to think more deeply. Yet, there’s every reason to try and quell those rampaging thoughts. To endeavour is human, to respond is up to Him.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/philosophical-ruminations-on-a-monsoon-afternoon/story-nSzPZQCjyQNFBjm6b3pXgP.html
18-07-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Star Wars over Pangong||There is no shortage of words in the exchanges between India and China over the turquoise blue Pangong lake. Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday delivered a loaded speech at the famed lake. But words fail us when it comes to the cosmic spectacle that unfurls over the lake in the dark when mere mortals sleep and the Gods slip out from the crevices of cosmic infinity.Those who have viewed that spectacle and are currently locked out of the mountains due to Covid-19 restrictions are revisiting the photographs and videos of the “good old days when Corona was nothing more than a heavenly beer”! A software engineer with Tata Consultancy, Dipyaman Santra, is a mountain addict. He drove on a motorcycle all the way from Kolkata to Pangong taking nine days in September 2018. He took a photograph of the Aakash Ganga (Milky Way galaxy) over the lake at 11.21 pm. In his own words, then, are those moments of magical glimpses that uplift the sufferance of human existence to a momentary merger with cosmic divinity. The romantic realisation dawns that we are all made of star dust. Santra recalls the Pangong night sky with a fervid pining for a return to the lake of a lost horizon. “We missed the beautiful view of Pangong lake during the day as it was already dark when we reached there. We usually love riding through the mountains during the dark but the road was not supportive. So, when we reached there (at around 8:30), we were way too exhausted. Our first concern was to find a place to stay and we were thus distracted by mundane concerns. We found some tents and we went to the lake. I glanced at the sky and it felt like I was waiting for this for a long time. The place was totally dark as most of the lights had been turned off,” Santra told this writer.“The sweet sound of the water splashing created a pure ambience. Unlike the chaotic sound of waves crashing on a beach, the sound of waves at Pangong was like the peace of a monastery, of bells tinkling in a shrine. When I looked above from the water, these stars and the Aakash Ganga view was a spiritual treat! I wondered how Nature had fabricated this infinite black canvas with lots of small glittering dots, so randomly, and yet so beautifully! I can try to search for more words to describe the view but what I felt, what I saw, I don’t think any word is enough to describe that. I can only say, even today, when I think about the day, I still see everything vividly in front of my eyes, I still hear the sound of the water splashing, I still feel the purity,’’ recalls Santra.MONITORING WEIGHTS & MEASURES We would like the weighing machine kept in our washrooms to not tell us the truth about our ballooning bellies. We would not mind being flattered if the machine under-weighs the fat layers and flashes a coy number. On the other hand, we are very particular about weight devices used by retailers selling groceries, grains and fruits in mandis and kiryana shops. Electronic weight measures used by unscrupulous retailers overestimate the weight of goods sold, thus cheating shoppers. The common swindle is realised when diligent householders check the goods purchased on a reliable weight measure kept at home in the kitchen. The truth of this came to the fore again in rather a kinky context. The tricity’s snake-rescue expert, Salim Khan, had rescued a huge Bengal Monitor lizard (Goh) from a house at Swastik Vihar, Panchkula, on Tuesday.Impressed by the size of the Goh, I asked Khan to get its weight measured to obtain an idea of the dimensions of the specimens rescued in the tricity as popular lore has it that the big ones weigh 10-12 kg. Just as big, rescued pythons (without prey ingested) are routinely estimated to weigh 100 kg with length of 20 feet by onlookers when the actual weight is less than half or a third, and length far more conservative than those fanciful estimates attached to WhatsApp forwards. That is, the mind playing optical tricks!So, Khan took the Goh in a cage to a kiryana store, which did not enjoy a good reputation in the mohallah but was located at a key junction so sales were high. That measure showed the cage weighing 4 kg. Deducting the weight of the cage, the Goh thus weighed 2.9 kg. Unconvinced by the reliability of the measure, Khan then went to another kiryana store, which carried a better reputation in the mohallah. The second measure showed up the Goh, after deducting the carrier weight, as 2.1 kgs. There was thus a difference of 800 g in the digital measures of weight thrown up by two different kiryana stores in the same mohallah!Just imagine how many poor blokes the first kiryana store must have cheated in supply of weight-inflated provisions.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-star-wars-over-pangong/story-vsMkObirz93HuSVRUl5pKL.html

18-07-2020||City||Married daughter can’t be denied compassionate appointment: HC||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled that a daughter, if otherwise eligible, can’t be denied compassionate appointment, merely because she has got married.The high court bench of justice AG Masih struck down the provisions of Punjab government’s compassionate appointments policy of 2002, which did not have ‘married daughter’, as a ‘dependent family member’ for consideration for appointment on compassionate grounds. The high court said that classification, if any, has to be based upon reasonableness, which is justifiable on the anvil and touchstone, furthering the policy for which the same had been framed. Violation of gender equality would amount to violation of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution as guaranteed to all citizens of India, which guarantee equality; protection against discrimination on the basis of caste, sex etc; and protection of life and liberty, respectively. The HC directed the Punjab DGP to issue appointment letter within one month to the woman, who was declared ineligible in 2015, citing that her marital status was a bar against consideration for appointment. Following this, the woman, Amarjit Kaur, had approached the high court, challenging the decision. Daughter of a head constable, Kashmir Singh, who died in October 2008, she now lives with her widow mother, Jasbir Kaur along with her husband and kids. An internal report upon verification of source of income had stated that they were surviving on pension benefits of the late head constable and that family was sustaining ‘with great difficulty’. “Equality cannot be achieved, unless there are equal opportunities for all. If a woman is deprived at the threshold by rendering her ineligible for consideration merely because of her marital status of being a woman, especially when the same is not true for the man, would amount to discrimination on the basis of gender identity,” the bench observed.It said that the determinative factor to ascertain eligibility for consideration for appointment is the financial status of the family. “The only reason why the petitioner has been deprived appointment under the scheme is that she is a married daughter of a deceased government servant, whereas had she been unmarried or had it been the son, despite the marital status, the claim would have been considered. If this is not discrimination, what else can it be termed?,” the bench questioned and struck down the provisions of the 2002 policy, which made a married daughter ineligible for consideration of appointment on compassionate grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/married-daughter-can-t-be-denied-compassionate-appointment-hc/story-kE8Rr7A7pqVoYlt23EedEN.html

18-07-2020||Patna||Bihar migrant workers set up cricket bat manufacturing unit||Bihar could be staring at a quiet cricket revolution because of reverse migration of a section of workers, who are skilled at making bats.The workers, who have come back to their native state amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, are hoping to ply their bat-making skills back home in Bihar’s West Champaran district and make a living for themselves.They have honed their skills at Jammu & Kashmir’s bat-manufacturing units in Anantnag, Awantipora and Qazigund.Around 10 migrant workers have set up a local unit at Sahodra village in West Champaran district, which is located about 280 kilometres north of Patna.“There is no place as sweet home. Nothing can be more satisfying if you get to stay at your native place and also earn a living,” said Abulesh Ansari (30), of Parasauni village, who moulds logs of Poplar tree, whose wood is used for making exquisite cricket bats. “Making a bat is all about precision, which involves judgment, adjustment, and calculation all rolled into one. It’s also an art,” said Ansari, who learned the craft at a factory in Anantnag.The homegrown factory was set up a month ago amid the pandemic and has churned out around 50 bats that have found instant buyers.“The lightness and stroke-making are the major differentiators in the available assortment of bats that cost below Rs 1,000,” said Afroz Alam, a buyer. “It’s difficult to scale up the volume because the production is still manual. We aim to sell each bat for Rs 800. West Champaran can emerge as a hub for making cricket bats because poplar tree, a basic ingredient, grows in abundance in the district,” said Dilshad Alam (29), who worked at a bat-making factory in Qazigund.Fortunately, they found big logs of poplar trees that had uprooted due to monsoon rains. The workers believe that poplar is as good as English and Kashmiri willow to make bats.However, the biggest deterrent is a lack of finance to give the fledgling unit a mechanised push.“We used to make 12 bats a day in Kashmir. However, our work is at a low key because of the lack of mechanised equipment and the unavailability of dry wood because of the rainy season. But, the sector has the potential to grow in West Champaran district,” said Naushad Alam, another migrant worker.The workers have also approached government officials for financial assistance. “We are satisfied with the bat samples. We will provide necessary financial aid to them,” said Raju Ranjan Shrivastava, circle officer (CO), Gaunaha block.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-migrant-workers-set-up-cricket-bat-manufacturing-unit/story-Iaa9yL1HC2zNMcr6olZprJ.html

18-07-2020||City||Days after general secy’s exit, United Akali Dal set to merge with Dhindsa-led outfit||Nearly a week after its general secretary and former Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) chief Wassan Singh Zaffarwal stepped down, the United Akali Dal (UAD), one of the splinter Akali factions, is all set to merge with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) recently formed by Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa.The UAD, floated in 2014 and headed by former Damdami Taksal spokesperson Mohkam Singh, played a key role in organising Sarbat Khalsa (grand Sikh assembly) in November 2015, during which parallel jathedars of Sikh temporal seats were appointed. It got a jolt last year when its co-founder Gurdeep Singh Bathinda and his aides parted ways with Mohkam Singh.Dhindsa floated his party on July 7 but he has remained in touch with the core leadership of the UAD. After paying obeisance at the Golden Temple on July 9, Dhindsa with his son Parminder Singh Dhindsa met Mohkam Singh and other key leaders of the group. However, the merger could not be finalised on the occasion.Sources said the presence of Zaffarwal in the UAD was the main hurdle in the way of the merger as Dhindsa and his aides did not want to court any controversy by taking the former militant into the party fold. Interestingly, Zaffarwal resigned after a few days. Mohkam Singh said, “Our merger with the party led by Dhindsa has been finalised. All kinds of doubts between us have been removed to pave the way for the merger”.“We are ready to ink a pact with anyone to expel those who played a role in committing sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib or who gave shelter to the perpetrators of the sacrilege, from the panthic scene. And we have high hopes for the Dhindsa-led party that it has potential to do this task. So, we are joining it”, he added.A formal announcement of the merger is yet to be made. Sources said efforts are also being made to take the leaders who parted ways with Mohkam Singh into the fold of the Dhindsa-led party.The majority of the UAD leaders have been supporters of the idea of Khalistan, but after floating this party, they abandoned the agenda and vowed to fight for the Anandpur Sahib resolution that was once adopted by SAD advocating more powers to the states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/days-after-general-secy-s-exit-united-akali-dal-set-to-merge-with-dhindsa-led-outfit/story-YOKQrOzpL7vKXaejqRd2gI.html

18-07-2020||Chandigarh||126 Punjab urban bodies likely to go to polls in October||The elections to 126 urban local bodies (ULBs) in Punjab — nine municipal corporations and 117 municipal councils and notified area committees — are likely to be held in the second week of October even as the final decision on it will be taken keeping in view the Covid-19 situation. The state has a total of 167 urban local bodies. In a meeting chaired by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh through video conferencing, the ministers were near unanimous on the issue. Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra is learnt to have suggested October 11 as the date of polling. The Punjab government is expected to recommend the date to the state election commission. As per the Municipal Corporation Act, 1911, the civic bodies must go to the polls within six months of expiry of their term. The terms of these urban bodies concluded between March 8 and April 26. The government has appointed administrators to run the operations of the bodies, including the Mohali, Bathinda, Moga, Batala, Hoshiarpur, Phagwara, Kapurthala and Pathankot municipal corporations. The CM pointed out that the pandemic was projected to peak in the state in September and therefore it would be better to take the developments into account before finalising the date.Sources said discussion was also held to conduct these polls in November if the Covid-19 situation worsens. In the meeting, the possibility of holding the polls in August was ruled out, given the increasing number of cases of infection. It also took note of the fact that crop procurement and the festival season will start in mid-October and thus it would not be feasible to hold the elections at that time. The ministers agreed on holding of elections at the earliest possible while taking all the factors into account.The local bodies minister said in the meeting that his department will complete all formalities related to delimitation of wards by the end of this month. This time, only women will contest from the odd-numbered wards while the even ones will remain open for candidates of both the genders. A decision to this effect was taken last month by Mohindra on the lines of a law passed in 2017 by the Congress government as per which 50% wards should be reserved for women candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/126-punjab-urban-bodies-likely-to-go-to-polls-in-october/story-UWZ7W0ED9QgGlJHGdMtTxI.html

The teachers had said that the board should have taken the decision in April when the new academic session had begun.The board, in a recent circular, has clarified that if any school has covered topics that are not a part of the revised curriculum for the session 2020-21, they can include them in the internal assessment and the credit to students should be given for board exams 2021.Now, the teachers have been directed to cover these topics by devoting less time and to inform students that these topics will be covered under internal assessment. In Class 12 English, out of 16 chapters and six poems, six lessons and one poem have been deleted.Anupam Baghria, post graduate teacher (PGT) in English at Nankana Sahib Public School, said, “We have already covered literature topics including ‘Poets and pancakes’, ‘The interview’; and poem ‘The roadside stand’ from Flamingo. From Vistas, ‘Journey to the end of earth’ and ‘The tiger king’ and in writing tasks, posters and speech have already been done in class. Now we will cover these topics in the internal assessment which is of 20 marks.”She said, “In Class 10, we have covered first two poems—‘How to tell wild animals and trees from first flight’ and first two chapters from Footprints without feet- ‘The midnight visitor’ and ‘A question of trust’. In grammar, preposition and passive voice topics have been covered.”In physics, the board has removed a few topics from selective chapters. Nishad, a physics teacher at BCM School, Basant Avenue, Dugri, said, “From few chapters, one or two topics have been removed. But in physics, every topic is interlinked with the other so it is very important to cover all topics, otherwise, students will not able to understand concepts. I am trying my best to cover all topics and will spend less time on those which have been removed.” Out of 14 chapters, the board has removed various topics and experiments from 10 chapters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/teachers-give-thumbs-up-to-cbse-s-decision-to-use-deleted-topics-in-internal-assessment/story-dSa8obYN350eeaX2wwoglI.html

However the PSERC, through its orders dated July 17, has announced that charges cannot be waived off and would be collected in six installments starting from September.President of All Industries and Trade Forum (AITF), Badish Jindal said that the state government has committed fraud with the industry by making fake announcements. “If the government is committed for the betterment of the industry then it should announce a subsidy equal to the fixed charges which have to be recovered from the industry,” said Jindal adding that the industry is being forced to pay fixed charges for the lockdown period. President of Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO), Gurmeet Singh Kular and general secretary Rajeev Jain said that the industry would not be able to bear the charges at this time of crisis when the units are being run at 30% capacity due to shortage of labour and economy slowdown. “The government should rather waive off the fixed charges for a year so that the industry could come back on track,” he said adding that PSERC should add another licensee for distribution of power as it would create competition and the charges would also be reduced.The members of the Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association have also demanded that the PSERC should be dissolved and the state government should announce relief for the industry.President of the association, Jaswinder Thukral said, “The PSERC is putting a burden of crores of rupees on the public in terms of infrastructure and salaries, but it has never provided relief to residents. The state government should dissolve the PSERC and waive off fixed charges till March next year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-industrialists-slam-pserc-over-collection-of-fixed-charges/story-pOvtAUPLimwEsRGSN1w6yM.html

Under the policy, illegal buildings that sprung up in the state before June 30, 2018, were to be regularised. The policy was conceptualised during the tenure of former local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, but was put in cold storage after Brahm Mohindra took charge in June 2019. Mohindra termed the policy as faulty and asked officials to revise it before re-implementing it.Mohindra says the policy was held back as it received a lukewarm response. “Around 400 applications were received under the policy. However the number of buildings expected to be covered under the policy is in lakhs,” Mohindra said.Overall, the regularisation policy was meant to ensure that existing unauthorised buildings were aligned with parking, fire and safety standards across the state, as it was no longer feasible for the government to demolish such buildings.“The policy was meant to check illegal construction and help state’s local bodies generate revenue by regularising such appointments. Over time, the policy lost sheen,” an official said, on the condition of anonymity. Mohindra added, “We are consolidating suggestions for redrafting of the policy, which is in the final stages,” he said, adding that the new policy envisages that the applicant shall have to make structural changes in the building, if required, to fulfil the requirement of fire safety and parking within a period of two months from the date of submission of details and shall also submit mandatory clearances from other departments.Building by-laws prove ineffectiveTo check the mushrooming of unauthorised buildings under Urban Local Bodies (ULB) limits, the Punjab local government department had introduced new building by-laws in December 2018. However, these by-laws have turned out to be ineffective with rampant violations being reported. The new rules state that in the case of unauthorised development, the authority shall take suitable action which may include demolition of unauthorised works, sealing of premises, prosecution and criminal proceedings against the offender. Municipal employees, who by their act of commission or omission have allowed unauthorised construction, will also be liable for similar action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ots-policy-for-unauthorised-construction-on-hold-violations-continue-unchecked/story-UY2zng3k79wlUXSuGSKn1L.html

Of 155, only around 24 residents have collected the tokens. Any pet without a licence and MC token will be taken away by the civic body. Requesting anonymity, an MC official said, “The response is quite low due to the lack of awareness among the residents. The last date to apply for registration of pets is December 31. Due to a rise in Covid-19 cases, the residents are hesitant in visiting the MC office to collect tokens.”MC senior veterinary officer, Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “The civic body is spreading awareness among the residents through animal lovers. The residents should make sure that they collect the token from MC Zone A office and tie it around the neck of their pet. This exercise would also help the MC in finding the owner of the pet in case a pet is lost or abandoned,” said Dr Dhalla.Commencing pet registration in the city on June 25 against the annual fee of ₹400, the MC directed the residents to register their pet dogs and cats by December 31, failing to which a penalty of ₹4,000 would be imposed on the owner for each pet. The initiative was also opposed by the few NGOs and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) stating that the MC should not have levied another tax on the residents at this time of crisis.Residents can visit suvidha kendras for pets’ registration To facilitate residents, who face difficulty in the online registration process, the MC has decided to depute staff at suvidha kendras.Dr Dahlla said, “The staff, which would be deputed at suvidha kendras from Monday onwards to help residents in completing the online process. A pet owner needs to submit a copy of his Aadhaar card, self-photo, pet’s photo “ For registering the pets online, owners can visit the MC’s website (mcludhiana.gov.in).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/online-pet-registration-gets-lukewarm-response-in-ludhiana/story-BCRokxEsb0cJQP2KoCrXVI.html

As per an inquiry, Kumar had disposed of the cannabis recovered from a peddler and showed 12 bottles of illicit liquor as the recovery. The case was thus registered under the Excise Act instead of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, allowing the accused to apply for bail. It may be mentioned that cases under the Excise Act are bailable offences while those under the NDPS Act are non-bailable.When the matter came to the knowledge of police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, he marked an inquiry to assistant commissioner of police (ACP, South) Jashandeep Singh. The inquiry revealed that the head constable had recovered 500-gm cannabis but he registered the case under the NDPS Act after receiving a bribe of ₹50,000. The cop has now been arrested under Prevention of Corruption Act and around ₹8,000 of the bribe money has been recovered from his possession. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said the head constable has been suspended with immediate effect and a departmental inquiry has also been marked.The accused in the drug peddling case, Sanjay Upadhyay, is also in police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/head-constable-changes-fir-for-bribe-of-50-000-held/story-r4VnZuDebLtq8h4K0BxW3N.html

With no cash inflow, this is becoming increasingly difficult,” says Darshan Lal Pappu, who has been in the business for the last 25 years. He says that they were getting bookings until April but once the state government imposed a 30-guest limit in July, people started opting out. “People are either postponing their weddings or leaving out the brass band and mares,” he says, adding, “The months of April, November and December are crucial for us as this is when most of the weddings take place. If the restrictions continue, I am not sure how our families will survive.”One of his employees, Gulshan, says, “Each mare service provider employs at least 15-20 people. Most of us do not have any other skill. How will we provide for our families if we don’t get work?”Naresh Kumar, a mare service provider on Noorwala road, says, “There are no buyers for mares. Otherwise we could have earned at least Rs 50,000-60,000 by selling one mare.”He added that the state government should ease the curbs on wedding gatherings or else they would die of starvation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mare-owners-lose-their-share-thanks-to-low-key-weddings/story-PwsdLOkIvVrLAcQpbzuOVJ.html

Members of the market association said that as many people visit the market on a daily basis, the parking lots have been abandoned by the civic body and contractor for three weeks now. Due to this, visitors park on roadsides, leading to traffic snarls.This has also forced the market association to deploy two of their staff members at the parking lot. The members said that the two staffers are unable to manage the entire parking lot. The market association president, PS Gill, said, “The indifferent behavior of the MC authorities is taking a toll on the shopkeepers and the visitors in the market. If the contractor has failed to take possession, then the MC should continue managing it to avoid chaos. Visitors park their vehicles haphazardly which results in heated arguments.”A trader Amanjot Singh said, “Due to the ongoing pandemic, the market is witnessing minimal footfall. But the visitors still face trouble in finding space to park their vehicles. The MC should manage lots till the time the contractor takes over as it becomes the duty of the civic body.” The Finance and Contracts Committee (F and CC) of MC had approved the resolution to allot parking contracts for the Feroze Gandhi market and Sarabha Nagar block-I market on June 9 for ₹1.10 crore and ₹4.5 lakh respectively. Following this, the contractor was asked to take possession of the lot. MC to cancel firm’s contractMC Secretary, Neeraj Jain said, “The contractor has failed to take possession of the parking lots despite repeated reminders. Now a proposal has been forwarded to the F and CC of the MC to terminate the parking contracts and forfeit the earnest money submitted by the contractor.

He added that government has taken 955 acre land of animal husbandry, horticulture department and gram panchayat. The acquired land does not include even an inch of the 2,300 acre Mattewara forest, he said.He allayed apprehensions that waste from the industrial park will be discharged into Sutlej river and said a common effluent treatment plant will be set up as per latest central government norms.The aim behind developing the industrial park here is to create a vibrant industrial estate where residents of Ludhiana and nearby areas can get jobs, he added.On covid, the CM urgd everyone to take precautions, wear mask and adhere to other safety norms to check further spread of the disease in Punjab.Responding to concerns of Amit Kumar of Rajpura, who said people in his town are not wearing masks even in crowded markets and police are only checking a few spot, the CM assured that strict action will be taken against the violators.

This was stated by MLA Sanjay Talwar who visited the site situated opposite the Vardhman Mill on the Chandigarh Road here on Saturday. Talwar along with Dharam Singh Sandhu, principal of Satish Chander Dhawan (SCD) Government College, inspected the site and asked the executive engineer of the public works department to complete the pending work by December.“The construction work on the administrative block will be completed in the next four months, while that of arts and science block has completed. The contractor has been asked to complete the flooring, landscaping and proper leveling of the ground of the college,” said Talwar.On being asked why the contractor hasn’t been paid, he said that the finance department will transfer the funds soon. The construction of the building on the five-acre land started on November 3, 2018, and the construction of the project suffered owing to the unprecedented outbreak of Covid-19.“As new staff has to be appointed, I will take up the matter with the higher education minister,” said Talwar.In June, the construction work on the new building of the government college (east), came to a halt due to the paucity of funds.The foundation stone of the building was laid at the site on January 28, 2018. On April 11, 2018, a team comprising the director, public instructions (colleges), former deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal and other officers inspected a community centre at Jamalpur to start BA part 1 and part 2 classes temporarily from there. Students of these classes were supposed to be later shifted to the new college. However, the higher education department permitted SCD Government College authorities to conduct an online admission process in 2018. The college admitted 80 students each of first and second years of Bachelor of Arts (BA) and classes have been conducted in the SCD Government College for the past two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/about-67-construction-work-on-govt-college-building-completed/story-h2lRkVdlD5I9ylVMYuYgjP.html

Such honours can be delayed for a few months. It is a sombre time rather than one to congratulate each other,” a member of the Chandigarh Resident Associations Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) said.GMCH SECURITY GUARDS CONTRIBUTE FOR COLLEAGUE’S KINColleagues of Shyam Sundar Pandey, a security guard at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh, who succumbed to injuries after he was beaten up for preventing crowding at the emergency as part of the Covid-19 guidelines last week, have come forward to contribute money for the family.

The trainers organised a statewide rally and got support from around three dozen khaps. Not only did people not mainatain social distancing, they also did not wear face masks. Independent MLA from Dadri, Sombir Sangwan, who is also head of Sangwan Khap said chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar should use his legislative powers and reinstate the services of the sacked PTIs.“ If our demands are not met. I will not hesitate to protest against the chief minister and his government for the sake of our brotherhood and society”, he said.Sarv khap national president Nafe Singh Nain said the Khap bodies had extended their support to the protesting instructors and the government cannot ignore the voice of the teachers. “If the government does not reinstate the services of PTIs , the khap bodies will launch a stir against the BJP- JJP government across the state from July 25”, he added.Meham MLA Balraj Kundu urged the protesting teachers not to demand their rights, he asked them to snatch their rights by defeating BJP-JJP candidate in the upcoming Baroda byelection.“ I urge you all to defeat BJP-JJP candidate in the Baroda byelection, the chief minister himself will come to you and ask you to rejoin services,” Kundu added.PTI union vice-president Vazir Gangoli said they had violated the social distancing protocol by organising the rally as the government had snatched their job.“If we will not protest, we will die of hunger rather than the virus.

18-07-2020||City||Punjab local govt dept to lift ban on building independent floors on plots||Chandigarh To boost real estate sector in the state and earn more revenue, the Punjab local government department is all set to lift the ban on construction of independent floors on individual plots by builders. This has been a major demand of small builders in the state. The department had banned passing maps of these buildings categorised as ‘Ground plus two floors’ and ‘stilt plus three floors’ on July 2, 2019. Stilt plus three floors mean the ground floor will be meant for parking.“The builders/ developers get plans sanctioned for a row of contagious units by showing each as a separate unit, whereas in reality they are part of a larger project,” the then director local bodies, Karunesh Sharma had said. Small builders have been resentful over this move and had given numerous representations to local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, after which the department has now decided to review the decision. According to the department’s calculations, pending maps of these floors can earn the department Rs 40-50 crore in the form of various charges“By allowing this activity, the department aims to give a push to the depressed construction sector. A boom in construction can boost economy, especially in times of covid-19. I have directed officials to make sure all rules are followed while allowing such construction. I am also holding a meeting with big builders soon to sort out all issues,” said Mohindra.A senior department functionary said these constructions had been allowed only after taking legal opinion. “Interestingly, the department’s letter last year had no mention of ban on Ground plus two floors. Now, because other categories were banned, ULBs had also banned Ground plus two floors,” a senior official claimed.This officer claimed that now the department has decided to issue a clarification to the ULBs to allow construction and has defined few new rules, with the local bodies director to issue formal orders. MANDATORY RERA REGISTRATION AMONG NEW RULESAs per the draft of the clarification, while allowing this activity, the new rules say the ULBs must ensure that there is no violation of building bylaws and every such project should be registered with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). Another guideline is that builder must obtain Change of Land Use (CLU) and licence for the purpose and there should not be any violation of RERA and the layout plan must be approved by the Competent Authority before construction of such independent floors.The builder has to pay external development charges, CLU licence and processing fee charges as applicable to the Group Housing Projects and there should be no financial loss to the local bodies and the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-local-govt-dept-to-lift-ban-on-building-independent-floors-on-plots/story-EwEw4xbYDNW0kVoDKJey0J.html

Senior IAS officer N Manjunatha Prasad who was the principal secretary to the revenue department has been posted as the new Commissioner of BBMP while the incumbent B H Anil Kumar has been transferred as Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Public Enterprises.Opposition Congress party has been alleging corruption in hiring and purchase of equipment -- both medical and non-medical -- required to treat Covid patients and has repeatedly asked for the government to release a whitepaper on the whole issue.

Speaking to the media the new commissioner Prasad said “We will take steps to address any shortcomings or defects in the system which are there. We are contemplating using city transport bus drivers as ambulance drivers to ensure better availability of it.”Meanwhile Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa who met with Private Medical College Hospitals on Saturday regarding Covid management directed them to provide 50 percent of the beds for Covid care to the government as promised, with effect from Sunday itself.The CM asked the private medical college hospitals to cooperate with the government as there is a sharp rise in Covid cases in the city.

18-07-2020||Patna||‘Explosive’: Bihar’s Nitish govt gets flak from LJP, Jharkhand CM over Covid-19 situation in state||The Nitish Kumar-led government in Bihar is getting it from all sides, including Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and also its Jharkhand counterpart, for alleged mismanagement of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the state.LJP chief Chirag Paswan tweeted on Saturday, describing the Covid-19 outbreak in Bihar as “explosive”, taking a cue from Lalu Prasad, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief and a thorn in chief minister Kumar’s flesh. “The way Covid-19 is spreading its tentacles in Bihar and turning the situation explosive is a matter of serious concern for the people of the state,” tweeted Chirag, a Member of Parliament (MP) from Jamui and son of Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan.Chirag, however, lauded the Centre’s decision to dispatch a team of experts to bring the situation under control in Bihar.Bihar is in the grip of a Covid-19 crisis, as recent data showed.On Friday, 1,750 tested Covid-19 positive – the highest single-day spike to date – of the 10,273 swab samples tested. The state has reported over 23,500 Covid-19 positive cases to date.CM Kumar also got a mouthful from his Jharkhand counterpart, Hemant Soren, who blamed Bihar for the viral outbreak scourge in his home state.“The Bihar government should think as to how its residents are coming to Jharkhand, despite partial lockdown restrictions,” Soren said on the sidelines of an event at Ranchi on Saturday.Supiryo Bhattacharya, general secretary, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), too, alleged that Covid-19 positive cases were on an upswing in Ranchi and Jamshedpur that have rail connectivity with Bihar.Akhilesh Prasad Singh, a Rajya Sabha member of the Congress, also blamed the state government’s ineptness for Bihar’s Covid-19 crisis.The ruling coalition, including Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party, however, attributed the spike to aggressive testing.“Cases are rising, but nobody needs to worry much about it, as the state and the Central governments are working in tandem to control the situation,” said Rajiv Ranjan, spokesperson, JD (U).On Soren’s assertion, Ranjan said that those occupying the constitutional posts should not make any comment that could outrage sentiments of any sections of the society. “It would also be politically disastrous for the party (JMM) to disrespect the people of Bihar, where it wants to contest the polls,” said the JD(U) leader.The JMM is likely to contest the upcoming Bihar polls slated to be held in October-November.BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said that the “proxy” tweets of Prasad did not belong to him and was out of context in light of the serious effort that the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is making to rein in the pandemic.“The Centre is providing every possible help and also sending its team to Bihar, which is a welcome step. A pandemic like Covid-19 can be tackled with the collective effort of both the central and state governments,” he said while skirting any reference to the LJP chief’s tweet on the state’s “explosive” viral outbreak situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/explosive-bihar-s-nitish-govt-gets-flak-from-ljp-jharkhand-cm-over-covid-19-situation-in-state/story-TpESCOd96A0pWAGjRMhmMK.html

There is no need to panic,” said a statement issued by the state home department on Saturday.The department in its statement also said that the daily testing rate in West Bengal is 144 per million population, which is above the WHO threshold of 140.Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha, while addressing media persons at the state secretariat, also ruled out the possibility of clamping a total lockdown in Kolkata or across the state, asserting that the restrictions would be enforced strictly only in containment zones.The state has 676 containment zones at present where the government is enforcing strict lockdown along with four other towns.“The situation in Bengal is under control. The death rate which was earlier very high has now come down to 2.7 per cent, which is very close to the national average of 2.5 per cent,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/only-13-covid-19-patients-in-bengal-needs-hospitalization-state-health-ministry/story-LMFOdivn0r2q8BDfRgz8hO.html

He worked as a peon in the Accountant General’s office, Punjab, but remained absent from work due to his addiction and was under suspension.“On July 14 night, when Gurdev returned home intoxicated, the couple had a fight. She held him by the neck, which caused him to trip and fall down the stairs. As he collapsed, she went back to sleep, not realising he had died,” police said.When she found him dead the next morning, she sounded her neighbours and relatives, who suspected that he died after taking a fall off the stairs under the influence of intoxicants. However, strangulation marks were noticed on his neck before cremation and police were informed.On the complaint of Bahadur Singh, who lives on the second floor above the couple, a case of murder was registered against unidentified persons. Police have now named Harpreet in the FIR. She was produced in a court on Saturday and sent to judicial custody.This was Gurdev’s second marriage. His 14-year-old son from his first marriage had died a few days ago. The boy lived with his grandparents in Dinanagar, Gurdaspur district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-woman-strangles-drug-addict-husband-to-death-arrested/story-4g3CvxBt75wu9fdYP5BWML.html
18-07-2020||City||Two Afghan trucks enter India for 1st time after Pak allows transit||Amritsar Six days after Pakistan announced the resumption of Afghan exports to India through the Attari-Wagah border to facilitate transit trade, the first consignment of goods crossed over to India in two trucks on Saturday. All covid-19 related protocols were followed. “Two trucks of licorice (mulethi) entered the Integrated Check Post (ICP), Attari, on Saturday,” said a senior Customs official in Amritsar.“We had information that seven-eight trucks of Afghan goods would enter India, and we had made arrangements accordingly,” said a senior official of the Land Port Authority of India (LPAI), which oversees the ICP’s affairs.Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Association president Anil Mehra said, “Pakistan has deliberately been creating hurdles in Afghan export to India. After a two-month long hiatus, Indian authorities allowed Afghan exports in the last week of May. The Pakistan government has also not been allowing movement of goods from Pakistan’s Chaman and Torkham borders with Afghanistan. Trade is victim of cheap politics of Pakistan.” The ICP usually sees an annual trade of around Rs 7,000 crore and Rs 1,000 crore with Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively.Mehra added that besides allowing hurdle-free entry of Afghan exports to India, Pakistan should also consider the opening of trade with India from the Wagah border. Pakistan had shut trade with India and stopped operations of the Samjhauta Express after the abrogation of Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.India had suspended trade activities at the border on March 13 as a precautionary measure, against the covid-19 outbreak. Following this, Pakistan had also closed its border with India. Indian authorities had resumed suspended activities with covid-linked precautions on May 28, but Pakistan did not reciprocate. Two Afghan trucks, which had been stranded before the closure of the border, entered India on May 28. Truck drivers and porters hope for resumption of their livelihood. “We hear that 20-25 trucks a day will enter from Afghanistan once trade resumes fully. Thousands of porters and truck drivers hope to get back their jobs then. Trade with Pakistan must also open,” said Amarjit Singh Shinda, president, Truck Drivers’ Union, at Attari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-afghan-trucks-enter-india-for-1st-time-after-pak-allows-transit/story-2r3VGzM9KU7H6JqUtCf2ZM.html

18-07-2020||Mumbai||Inform victims about acquittal of accused, Bombay HC directs trial courts||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday directed all trial courts in Maharashtra to inform the victims of the outcome of the trials, whenever the accused are acquitted in a bid to ensure that the victim can effectively exercise h/his right to appeal against the verdict.“It is a common experience that in most of the cases the informants (victims of crimes) are not so well educated or come from a stratum of the society that lacks awareness and nuances involved in the legal proceedings,” said a two-member division bench, comprising Justices SS Shinde and VG Night, highlighting the importance to inform the victims in time about the acquittal of the accused.It has directed that the office of a district magistrate (DM) in Maharashtra shall ensure that a copy of the judgement is provided to the victim of crime, whenever criminal trials lead to acquittals in a bid to ensure that the victims can exercise their right to an appeal in time.The bench attached the liability on the state’s DMs.It cited Section 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) of trial courts, where magistrate and sessions courts are mandated to forthwith provide a copy of a judgement in a criminal trial to a DM within whose jurisdiction the trial is held.The bench said the DMs have the mechanism and manpower, which can be judiciously utilised to provide the copies of judgements to the victims.In order to ensure that the directive is scrupulously complied with, the bench has directed all trial courts across Maharashtra to maintain a register and to record in it all the relevant dates such as the delivery of the judgement, dispatch to the office of a DM, and the receipt of the copy by the victim. The directives were issued following a plea filed by Ranjana Suryavanshi (56), a Dharavi resident, seeking to condone the 717-day delay in filing an appeal against the acquittal of her son-in-law Jayprakash Gupta.Gupta was tried on charges of killing his wife and Suryavanshi’s daughter and was acquitted by a Mumbai city civil and sessions court on March 13, 2014.Last year, she belatedly moved court against the appeal.Her counsel, senior advocate Rajiv Chavan, pointed out that the 717-day delay occurred, as the applicant was illiterate and had very meagre means of sustenance. The HC accepted the submission and condoned the delay. The bench said the delay appears to be huge, but “we cannot be oblivious of applicant’s social status and financial condition”.The judges said the “cause” shown by the applicant for condoning the delay must be held to be sufficient under the circumstances of the case.The bench also accepted Chavan’s argument that no timeframe has been prescribed for the victim to prefer an appeal in terms of proviso to Section 372 of the CrPC against the acquittal of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/inform-victims-about-acquittal-of-accused-bombay-hc-directs-trial-courts/story-yVPk5lcWhFpGutAPUTOCvK.html
18-07-2020||Jaipur||Ex-CM Vasundhara Raje breaks silence on Rajasthan political crisis, targets Cong||Vasundhara Raje, former Rajasthan chief minister, on Saturday, broke her silence about the ongoing political turmoil regarding the fate of Ashok Gehlot-led government and said the people of the desert state were paying the price for discord within the ruling party’s ranks.In a signed statement shared on Twitter, Raje said the names of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders were being needlessly dragged into the controversy surrounding the ruling Congress’s factional feud and power struggle.“It is unfortunate that the people of Rajasthan are paying for the discord within the Congress.....at a time when coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has claimed more than 500 lives and over 28,000 people have tested positive, when locusts are attacking farmers’ fields, when crime against women is at an all-time high, when there is a problem of electricity across the state,” she tweeted“And I’m only naming a few of the problems being faced by our people. There is no point in trying to drag the BJP and the BJP leaders’ names through the mud,” she further tweeted.“It is the interest of our people that must remain paramount. Think of the people,” the statement added.Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said the Gehlot government is working for all sections of society and providing good governance.“Instead of making allegations, Raje should ask her party leaders to refrain from trying to pull down a democratically elected government,” she said.The ex-CM has been ensconced at her personal residence in Dholpur and her silence since the political turmoil erupted had triggered all kinds of speculations.Questions abounded, including from CM Gehlot, whether BJP in Rajasthan stood divided, as Raje neither defended her party nor attended any party meetings over the past few days since the political crisis unfolded.Nagaur Member of Parliament (MP) Hanuman Beniwal of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), whose three lawmakers support the BJP in the Rajasthan assembly, has alleged that Raje has thrown her lot behind Congress legislators, who owe their allegiance to CM Gehlot.In a series of tweets, Beniwal has alleged that Raje has been trying her best to save the minority government, headed by Gehlot, and has even called up some Congress members of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs), who are close to her, and has asked them to support the beleaguered CM.However, BJP leaders have been at pains to put to rest any speculation of friction between Raje and the leader of opposition in the Rajasthan assembly, Gulab Chand Kataria. They maintain that Kataria is in constant touch with Raje and she has expressed her willingness to come to Jaipur from Dholpur at any time.Narayan Bareth, a political analyst, said Raje, a two-time CM, and longstanding MP and MLA, still remains one of BJP’s most charismatic leaders in Rajasthan.“She still sees herself in the running for the CM’s post and would not want Pilot to join the BJP and emerge as a potential rival. She also commands the loyalty of around 40 BJP MLAs among the current strength of 72 in the 200-member Rajasthan assembly,” he said.Raje is among the few BJP leaders who have stood up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah and attempts have been made to sideline her in Rajasthan politics and project a younger leadership in the form of state party president Satish Poonia or Jodhpur MP and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, said Bareth.“But, she could still spring a surprise,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/ex-cm-vasundhara-raje-breaks-silence-on-rajasthan-political-crisis-targets-cong/story-NKyiNdHdiqjuC0PcshvlCI.html

18-07-2020||Lucknow||Mayawati demands President’s rule to be imposed in Rajasthan amid political row||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has demanded the imposition of President’s rule in the Congress-ruled Rajasthan, which has plunged into a political turmoil amid an internal power struggle between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and the sacked deputy CM and challenger Sachin Pilot, who enjoys the support of at least 19 rebel Congress lawmakers.While the main opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party, has demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the Gehlot-led government for ordering phone-tapping of lawmakers, Mayawati, too, described the move as illegal.“First, CM Gehlot misused the anti-defection law to get BSP lawmakers to join his party and now, by publicly ordering phone tapping, he has resorted to yet another unlawful and unconstitutional method,” Mayawati said in a series of tweets on Saturday.Last September, all six BSP MLAs in Rajasthan had joined the Gehlot government, which had infuriated Mayawati and she had accused the Rajasthan CM of indulging in horse-trading in his desperate bid to cling to power.In the three audiotapes, which had surfaced on Thursday evening and have since gone viral on social media, a Congress rebel member of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLA) can be heard purportedly speaking to some BJP leaders about toppling the Gehlot government. “The Rajasthan governor must take cognisance of the political stand-off, government instability, and the one-upmanship prevailing in the state and must recommend President’s rule there in a bid to ensure that democracy isn’t undermined any further,” she tweeted.The BSP chief has also urged the Yogi Adiyanath-led Uttar Pradesh government to look into the issue of a mother and daughter from Amethi, who had attempted to immolate themselves in front of the chief minister’s office (CMO) in Lucknow, over alleged police inaction in a property case. She has also demanded action against officials responsible for the women’s self-immolation bid.Both women have sustained burn injuries and are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Lucknow.“After failing to get justice from local (Amethi) administration in a property case, a mother and her daughter had to come to Lucknow to immolate themselves outside the CMO. The UP government must take up the issue with all seriousness,” Mayawati tweeted.“Along with ensuring justice to these women, the government must also act against officers responsible for it so that such things don’t happen again,” she further tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mayawati-demands-president-s-rule-to-be-imposed-in-rajasthan-amid-political-row/story-CPEQSOrEqD2x5dyi28oZiK.html

We have time and again said that he has been doing a good job as a leader of opposition,” it said.The Sena said that Fadnavis has been touring the state to monitor the Covid-19 relief work and the health facilities and has expressed satisfaction over the work being carried out by the state government against coronavirus.“His statement that he should be admitted to a government hospital cannot be called a stunt.

18-07-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots cases: L-G asks CM to decide on police’s request for lawyers in 7 days||Citing difference of opinion with the AAP dispensation, Lt Governor Anil Baijal has written to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal asking him to decide within a week on the Delhi Police’s proposal to appoint six senior advocates for arguing on its behalf in cases related to riots and anti-CAA protests. Baijal, in his letter to Kejriwal, said that acting home minister Manish Sisodia did not agree to the Delhi Police proposal despite the force providing detailed justification for it.The Delhi Police has proposed to appoint six senior advocates to argue on its behalf in 85 cases of riots in Northeast Delhi and assign 24 cases of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to special public prosecutors, sources said. The lieutenant governor said that he had called the file pertaining to the matter for perusal on July 14 under Rule of 19 (5) of the Transaction of Business Rules (TBR), the sources said. Baijal said that he had requested the home minister to reconsider his decision and agree to the proposal of the Delhi Police. Sources said that there was a meeting between Baijal and Sisodia through video conference on Friday to settle the difference of opinion, but the matter could not be resolved. “Since the difference of opinion still persists, I would request the chief minister to expeditiously refer the matter to the Council of Ministers under Rule 49 of TBR of GNCTD, 1992 with Section 45 (c) of the Government of NCT Act, 1991. “In view of urgency and sensitivity of matter, it is requested that the decision of Cabinet be communicated expeditiously, preferably within a week,” a source quoted Baijal as having said in the letter. Sources also said that if the Delhi Cabinet doesn’t agree with the Delhi Police’s request, the L-G will have an option to invoke his special powers under the provisions of Article 239 AA(4) of the Constitution. The first round of confrontation between the AAP dispensation and the L-G’s office had emerged in June over the appointment of 11 special public prosecutors to argue cases pertaining to the communal riots in northeast Delhi in February. When the Delhi government had rejected the police’s request on the issue, the L-G had invoked the power under Article 239 AA(4) of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-cases-l-g-asks-cm-to-decide-on-police-s-request-for-lawyers-in-7-days/story-mrfZfbCgek5YQ54JdZ1nkO.html
18-07-2020||Patna||Bihar: Family of three including a minor dies in train-car collision||Three members of a family, including a minor girl, died on Saturday morning, when their sports utility vehicle (SUV), while taking a short cut via an unauthorised railway level crossing was rammed by an oncoming express train between Pothi and Nadwan railway stations on the Patna-Gaya rail route.The accident, which occurred about 20 kilometres from Patna, once again underscored the lethal consequences of disregarding safety measures and the pitfalls of using unauthorised railway level crossings.The incident has prompted the Union Ministry of Railways authorities to seek a report from the Danapur rail division under whose jurisdiction the accident occurred.The authorities of the East Central Railway (ECR) zone, which controls the Danapur division, have blamed the accident victims for trespassing and ruled out any compensation from their end. The victims, who belonged to Patna’s Boring Road, were returning from Dharhara.Government rail police (GRP) personnel said that the deceased were identified as Surendra Bihari Singh (42), wife Nilima Bihari (35) and their minor daughter. The couple was software engineers and they were working at Noida in Uttar Pradesh’s Gautam Buddh Nagar district.Local villagers said that the accident occurred, when Singh was on his way to Boring Road from his in-laws’ place at Dharhara.The SUV’s rear wheel got stuck between the railway tracks and boulders.Unfortunately, the oncoming Patna-Ranchi Janshatabdi special train rammed the vehicle even before it could get off the track.The impact reduced SUV into a mass of mangled metal as the train dragged it for a kilometre, local eye-witnesses said.The accident held up rail traffic on the route for two and a half hours on Saturday morning.“The rail traffic resumed after the debris and bodies were cleared from the track around 11 am on Saturday,” said a rail official.GRP and railway officials, including Sunil Kumar, divisional railway manager (DRM), Danapur, were engaged in rescue work along with local villagers.Rajesh Kumar, chief public relations officer (CPRO), ECR, said the accident occurred because the local villagers have been turned the spot into an unauthorised level crossing and encouraged the public to use it as a short cut, but often leading to tragic consequences such as the accident on Saturday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-family-of-three-including-a-minor-dies-in-train-car-collision/story-6vodCnXQYEX3g9fUdq5WNI.html
18-07-2020||City||Covid-19 outbreak in Indore may reach its peak by early August||Health authorities have expressed fears that the Covid-19 outbreak in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore district, which has so far reported more than 5,900 cases, is likely to reach its peak by late July or early August.In view of this possibility, the authorities have started gearing up to reserve more than 10,000 beds for coronavirus patients in the district hospitals.According to officials, more than 125 Covid-19 cases were reported in the district for the last three consecutive days.Indore’s Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO), Praveen Jadia, on Saturday said that the total count of Covid-19 patients in the district has reached 5,906 after 136, 129 and 145 new cases were reported in the last three days respectively.Indore is the worst-affected district in the state.“We estimate that the coronavirus outbreak in the district may reach its peak in late July or early August. We are reviewing the medical arrangements,” he said.The CMHO said that 1,443 Covid-19 patients were being treated in the district, whereas a total of 7,000 beds were reserved for such patients in hospitals.“We are preparing to reserve more than 10,000 beds in hospitals for the coronavirus patients in hospitals considering the possibility that the outbreak may reach its peak in the coming days. We are holding discussions with the hospital management in this regard,” he said.Jadia said that in the last four months, 288 patients have succumbed to the coronavirus infection in the district, while 4,175 people have recovered after treatment.After the lifting of curbs as part of ‘Unlock 1’, people had started coming out on the streets, and started visiting public places and workplaces. However, in a bid to prevent the spread of the virus, the administration once again imposed some restrictions recently.District Collector Manish Singh said that a “left- right” system has been introduced for business establishments in Indore city as a new way to curb the spread.Under this, shops on the right side of the road will be allowed to open on one day, followed by those on the other side the next day.Singh said that the government personnel cannot be deployed everywhere to monitor the situation and people must take care to protect themselves from the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-outbreak-in-indore-may-reach-its-peak-by-early-august/story-rx66KdkL1Qt04SnRtjTuNK.html
18-07-2020||Kolkata||Bengal child rights body to set up new cell to rehabilitate rescued trafficking victims||The West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBCPCR) has decided to set up a new cell for better coordination with the administration to rehabilitate victims trafficked and rescued during the Covid- 19 outbreak, its chairperson said on Saturday.The new cell comprising representatives of non- governmental organisations (NGOs) will work towards alleviating mental agony of the rescued victims and rehabilitating them in the post-Covid world, WBCPCR chairperson Ananya Chakraborty said.“The cell will focus on addressing the problems faced by the victims during the present situation as they are much stressed now, besides thinking of their future,” she told PTI.It will work alongside the helpline number launched by the WBCPCR in June to register complaints and queries by victims of child trafficking and marriage, Chakraborty said.“We provide support to the administration by helping them identify vulnerable groups by networking with NGOs. We are a support group,” she said.Chakraborty, however, clarified the decision in this regard was not taken in the wake of the Centre issuing an advisory on July 6 asking states to evolve a coordination mechanism among departments to prevent child trafficking, besides conducting awareness drives on the issue of missing children and working with local bodies to trace and recover victims.She said the commission had constituted similar task forces earlier and those have achieved success in preventing trafficking.“We have achieved a high level of success in tracing and recovering trafficked women and children with the help of local bodies. WBCPCR has been conducting community awareness programmes on the issue of missing children during the pre- Covid days as well as now,” Chakraborty said.At least 22 cases of child marriage were registered at the commission’s help desk in June, another WBCPCR official said.The commission recorded 141 cases of child marriage in the state between March 20 and April 14 during the early stages of the lockdown, as per data shared by NGO Childline that works in synergy with WBCPCR to stop the practice, she said.Although 357 cases of attempted child marriage were reported between April 15 and May-end, almost 90 per cent of those could be prevented, the official said.The economic distress caused in the wake of Cyclone Amphan has given rise to attempts of trafficking girls to outside the state by promising them jobs or luring them with marriage proposals but most of those attempts were thwarted by the panel, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-child-rights-body-to-set-up-new-cell-to-rehabilitate-rescued-trafficking-victims/story-BME3kNll199GnoAVXXSrZJ.html

18-07-2020||Lucknow||Coronavirus silver lining: Road accidents, deaths decline in Uttar Pradesh||The coronavirus pandemic, which is forcing many people to largely stay home, appears to have come as a blessing in disguise for road safety in Uttar Pradesh.The latest road accident data from the transport department shows a steep fall in the number of road accidents and deaths during April, May and June in the state. The 70-day national Covid-19 lockdown was in force in April and May and was implemented from March 25.Dheeraj Sahu, the transport commissioner, said the lockdown in April and May and the fact that not many people were travelling even after the lockdown was lifted in June was obviously responsible for a lower number of road accidents and deaths. Better enforcement of rules also played a key role, Sahu claimed. April saw a fall in the number of road accidents and deaths, shows data.As per the available data, 765 road accidents took place in the state in April in which 438 people were killed against 3,512 accidents and 1,967 deaths in April 2019. The drop in the accidents and deaths was found to be by 21.78% and 22.26%, respectively.The data shows there was a bigger fall in May when there were travel restrictions due to the lockdown but the number of road accidents involving migrants returning home was also reported during this month.The number of road accidents and deaths was reported to be 1,964 and 1,185 in May this year vis-à-vis 4,223 mishaps and 2,314 deaths in the same month last year.The drop in the number of accidents and deaths was as high as 53.5% and 48.8%, respectively. Shravasti district recorded only two road accidents and no death during the month.Other districts like Shamli, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Pilibhit, Moradabad, Banda, Ambedkar Nagar, Mahoba, Agra, Bhadohi, Baghpat, Jhansi, Meerut and Gonda recorded the biggest decline both in the number of road accidents and deaths in May. Road accident deaths fell by over 70% in these districts in May compared with the corresponding month in the previous year.In June, the number of road accidents and resultant deaths fell by 32.8% and 27%, respectively compared to the corresponding month of 2019. The sharpest drop was recorded in the districts of Sultanpur (69.8%), Sambhal (65.4%), Ambedkar Nagar (64%), Sonbhadra (63%) and Mathura (60%). “The number of road accidents in June this year was reported to be only 2,786 against 4,143 in June last year, registering a significant decline of 32.8% while the number of deaths also fell from 2,284 in June to 1,667 in June this year, the decline being 27%,” Sahu said.He said the declining trend had started since the beginning of 2020 well before the lockdown. “The number of road accidents and deaths between January and March was reported to have fallen by 9.59% and 6.74% respectively compared to the same period in 2019,” he said.However, much of the decline between January and March was also because of the fact that there was a complete lockdown between March 25 and 31 after a one-day ‘Janata Curfew’ on March 24. “Thus, the movement of vehicles was largely restricted, especially on highways, for eight days in March reflecting in overall lower accidents and deaths in the first quarter of the calendar year,” an official in the know of things said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/coronavirus-silver-lining-road-accidents-deaths-decline-in-uttar-pradesh/story-xo65eID0J1zMWJeRQGL2XP.html

18-07-2020||Patna||Alleged gangrape victim granted bail by court in Bihar a week after arrest||An alleged gangrape victim in north Bihar, who was sent to jail last week following a ruckus before the magistrate during recording of her statement, was on Friday granted bail, according to the social organisation which has taken up her cause.Araria-based Jan Jagrati Shakti Sangathan, (JJSS), which had been looking after the 22-year-old woman ever since the sexual assault left her rattled, said the order was passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrates court there.“We were happy that a special hearing on our bail petition was conducted,” the JJSS said here in a statement, adding that an “exception” was made in the case amid state- wide lockdown, which has affected judicial work at lower courts.The development comes two days after close to 400 lawyers from across the country, including luminaries like Indira Jaisingh, Prashant Bhushan and Vrinda Grover had written a letter addressed to the Chief Justice and other judges of the Patna High Court, drawing their attention to the matter.The girl was allegedly raped in Araria by four persons on July 6 while she was out of her home, learning how to ride a motorcycle by an acquaintance who fled the spot when the perpetrators pounced on her.She was spotted by JJSS workers who first accompanied her home, but noticing the unsympathetic attitude of family members, decided to look after her while she fought for justice.An FIR was lodged at the Mahila Thana in Araria a day later and on July 10, and the woman appeared before the magistrate for recording of statements, chaperoned by JJSS workers Kalyani and Tanmay Nivedita.The victim, in a frazzled state of mind, threw a fit before the magistrate upon being asked to sign a transcript of her statement. Shortly afterwards, the JJSS workers approached the court staff requesting that they be shown a copy of the recorded statement, which was turned down and it led to an altercation.Upset over the ruckus, the magistrate is said to have directed a court staff to lodge an FIR against the trio for contempt of court and obstructing a public servant from discharge of duty.The three were remanded to judicial custody on July 11 and dispatched to Dalsinghsarai in Samastipur district, more than 200 kms from Araria since the local prison could not admit more number of inmates as per the guidelines in force due to COVID-19, JJSS secretary Ashish Ranjan Jha said.In the statement, the JJSS, however, expressed disappointment over denial of bail to the two of its workers who had assumed the role of caregivers to the woman.“After the bail plea of Kalyani and Tanmay was rejected, we immediately tried moving a fresh application but were told that no hearing would be taking place in view of a circular whereby functioning of district courts has been suspended amid the spurt in Covid-19 cases,” it said.The JJSS said it had “full faith” in the judiciary and will “continue to pursue all remedies” for securing the release of its two members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/alleged-gangrape-victim-granted-bail-by-court-in-bihar-a-week-after-arrest/story-iVxjLqyZxHIPk33tgnUx7J.html

The accused are allegedly involved in making the fake receipts to illegally transport stones and minerals from an Ulwe quarry.The forgery came to light after officials at the collector’s office discovered some the royalty receipts which had discrepancies from the original ones. Following an inquiry, the collector’s office on June 25 raided an apartment in Ulwe owned by Omprakash Upadhyay and also recorded his statement.According to the police, Upadhyay said he made the receipts allegedly at the behest of some people who sell stones and minerals and named six people who were involved in using the fake receipts.“All the seven accused made fake receipt booklet in the name of JM Mhatre Infrastructure – a stone quarry operator. The accused also used fake rubber stamps of the collector’s office on the receipts to pass them off as genuine ones. Using the fake receipts, the accused managed to evade ₹5.11 lakh towards royalty duties,” said an officer from NRI coastal police.As mandated by the Indian Bureau of Mines, quarry operators are required to pay a certain amount as royalty duty for carrying out operations at mines.“We have booked the accused for cheating and forgery. Our investigation is ongoing and no one has been arrested yet,” said senior inspector Tanveer Shaikh from NRI Coastal police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/7-booked-in-fake-receipt-fraud-worth-5-11-lakh-in-navi-mumbai/story-9hV1U8jk0fbsIyIBaFpEFP.html

18-07-2020||Mumbai||Fadnavis leads BJP delegation to Shah seeking sweet deal for Maha’s sugar industry||Former chief minister (CM) and leader of Opposition (LoP) Devendra Fadnavis led a party delegation to meet Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday in Delhi, to discuss various issues of the state’s sugar sector, including a better fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane farmers and a package for the sugar industry. Fadnavis was accompanied by six to seven party leaders – all sugar barons exported to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha polls. These included Harshvardhan Patil, Ranjeetsinha Naik-Nimbalkar, Dhananjay Mahadik, Vinay Kore (BJP ally), and Jay Kumar Gore. These leaders all come from Western Maharashtra, which is seen as the NCP’s bastion. NCP chief Sharad Pawar is considered the undisputed leader of the state’s co-operative and sugar lobby. Fadnavis’ meeting assumes importance as it is viewed as a bid to woo the sugar lobby and keep his promises to these former Congress-NCP leaders.“We met Union home minister Amit Shahji to discuss the various issues facing the sugar sector. There is likely to be bumper crop in Maharashtra and as such, farmers should get higher FRP and factories also should run. We also sought a package for the factories that are not doing well and an expansion of the Centre’s ethanol policy,” said Fadnavis, while speaking to reporters in Delhi after the meeting.The state delegation sought restructuring of existing loans from the National Co-operative Development Corporation (NCDC) and soft loans to sugar industry. The delegation also submitted detailed proposals regarding the same to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Union food and public distribution minister Ram Vilas Paswan after the meeting with Shah.“This year there will be excess production of sugar in Maharashtra as we had a very good monsoon so far. If all 225 sugar factories have to run, then they will need assistance. Many of the factories need their loans to be restructured with lower interest. We also proposed adding the sugar industry under the Centre’s ‘atmanirbhar’ policy, as the sugar sector is central to the state economy. This can help us get soft loans worth ₹12,000 crore-₹1,5000 crore,” said Patil.Ahead of the assembly polls in 2019, the Fadnavis government had taken a cabinet decision to provide a conditional government guarantee to the state’s co-operative sugar mills seeking to raise loans from NCDC. Many of the beneficiaries of this decision were leaders who had recently joined the BJP.The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, however, revoked the decision when it came to power in December 2019.The state’s sugar industry, led by political heavyweights, is in trouble, with several factories in the red due to mismanagement. Many of its leaders, including those who were poached from Congress and NCP to join BJP, chose to switch parties in the hope of keeping their factories afloat by getting loans from the government or NCDC. The sugar factories in several constituencies help political leaders to shore up their vote base. No Operation Lotus in Maharashtra, says FadnavisFadnavis reiterated that BJP did not have any political agenda in Maharashtra, and the party was focused on addressing the Covid-19 pandemic.“We are not making any attempt to bring this government down. There is no Operation Lotus or anything from our end. I have said earlier, too, that this government contradicts itself and will fall on its own,” said Fadnavis.He also said that besides the sugar industry’s issues, he also discussed the overall Covid-19 scenario in Maharashtra with the Union home minister.Fadnavis briefs PM on Covid-19 ground reality in MaharashtraLeader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday evening in Delhi and briefed him about the Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra. Fadnavis said that he presented the ground reality of the outbreak in the state to the PM, based on his travel across Maharashtra. He said that the meeting was not to make a state specific demand but to present the PM about his assessment. “PM asked me about the specific situation in Mumbai, Pune, Vidarbha and Marathwada. He also asked if I had any suggestions on the situation, which I shared with him. This was not a political meeting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fadnavis-leads-bjp-delegation-to-amit-shah-seeking-sweet-deal-for-maharashtra-s-sugar-industry/story-avEdDc4aiLDXYmHHpgHLVP.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra BJP transferred ₹500 crore to topple Rajasthan government: Congress||State Congress alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) Maharashtra unit transferred ₹500 crore through hawala for horse trading in Rajasthan to topple the Ashok Gehlot government. While the Maharashtra BJP rubbished the allegations, the Congress requested state home minister Anil Deshmukh to get the alleged hawala transfer probed by the police.Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that the party received specific information on the transfer of the funds.“There are leaked tapes of conversation between a BJP leader and the suspended Rajasthan MLAs [Members of Legislative Assembly] over the exchange of money to topple the Gehlot government. This proves that a huge amount was amassed for horse trading in Rajasthan. We received specific information from our internal sources in Maharashtra that leaders from the state unit of the BJP transferred ₹500 crore crore through hawala,” Sawant said.He also said that he spoke to state home minister Anil Deshmukh over the illegal transaction of money and demanded action.“Deshmukhsaheb told me that even he has similar information received by his department. He has agreed to conduct a probe in the transfer of the funds. The BJP masterminds in Maharashtra involved in such an unethical act need to be exposed,” said Sawant.According to Sawant, the money for the alleged hawala transaction was collected from builders and traders in Maharashtra.“The Centre is misusing central agencies such as the CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] and the Enforcement Directorate along with money power to topple the non-BJP governments in several states. Likewise, the Maharashtra unit also contributed in bringing down the Janata Dal (S)-Congress government in Karnataka last year. Rebel legislators from Karnataka were put up at a Mumbai hotel and meetings were held at the residence of state unit chief Chandrakant Patil,” Sawant alleged.Hitting back at the Congress, Maharashtra BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said if the allegations were true, why did the state government fail to stop the alleged transaction when one of the parties in the government was in know of it.“Congress is a part of the government which taps phones and keeps information of such transactions. If the party had specific information on such a money transfer, the government should have stopped it. The question that arises here is if Maharashtra Congress itself was interested in toppling the Gehlot government and thus did not intervene. It is Maharashtra Congress’s old habit to level allegations without any proof or substance,” said Bhandari.Party spokesperson Keshav Upadhye also termed the allegations as “baseless and false”. “Sachin Sawant is known for such meaningless accusations and has no credibility even in his own party,” said Upadhye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bjp-transferred-500-crore-to-topple-rajasthan-government-congress/story-z034WRvz1UBEsckpD51vfP.html

However, the document does not mention the period for which the amount is to be paid.The deal assumes significance as the real estate sector has been hit hard by the lockdown enforced to curb spread of Covid-19. A P Moller-Maersk is likely to move into the space with 1,100 employees in December 2020, when the project, Godrej Two, is expected to be ready. The Danish company will initially occupy 1.40 lakh square feet area, with an option to take additional space in future.“With our shift to Godrej Two, we are moving our office space closer to our employees and at the same time, offering them the premium and modern office space to work out of,” said Manish Bhasin, managing director, Maersk Procurement.Karan Bolaria, managing director and CEO, Godrej Fund Management, said, “We are confident that our product is future ready and caters to the ever changing needs of multinational corporations operating in India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/realty-boost-godrej-leases-2-lakh-sq-ft-space-in-mumbai-s-vikhroli-area-to-danish-logistics-firm/story-bs7nxx2xtWQMTCelUF4SyJ.html
18-07-2020||City||Maharashtra farm loan waiver fraud: ₹92 lakh given to 141 fake beneficiaries||Even though half the beneficiaries are yet to get the farm loan waiver, a fraud in loan waiver transfer to 141 fake bank accounts has come to light in Sangli district of western Maharashtra. The district administration has registered complaints against these accounts and the process of recovering ₹92.43 lakh has begun. After the state received complaints about the bogus beneficiaries of the farm loan waiver announced by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, Sangli district collector ordered a probe. The cooperation department scrutinised more than 3,100 accounts with a landholding of less than 10 gunthas and found the disbursement of the amount to 141 ineligible farmers. Police have registered a first information report (FIR) against 12 such fraudulent beneficiaries and arrested two of them two days ago. The cooperation department is conducting a probe into the role of the bank officials, as the department suspects their involvement for financial considerations. Officials suspect a major role of banking officers, who were part of the rackets operational at local level. Eyebrows are raised as many of these accounts are from nationalised and commercial banks.“During our scrutiny, we realised that the farm loans were given to farmers who do not own any land, while in some cases, the waiver was given to farmers against their loans taken to purchase livestock and other farm-related requirements. The documents related to the 7x12 extract were forged in some cases. Agriculture officers at the banks, be it nationalised, commercial or cooperative, are expected to scrutinise the veracity of the documents before disbursing the loans,” said Nilkanth Kare, district deputy registrar. While 60 of these beneficiaries had no landholding, 52 had taken loans for other purposes, seven farmers forged the 7x12 extract, seven had already sold their land against which the loans were taken, while in three cases, excess loan was disbursed than eligibility. The Corporation Bank in Karad in Sangli had disbursed loans to 30 farmers without valid documents.The scam came to light after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena’s general secretary Kirtikumar Shinde complained about instances from Gotkhindi village. “The government has scrutinised the loan account of the farmers with the holding of less than 10 guntha. If all accounts are verified, they may come across frauds of greater amounts. We are now demanding similar scrutiny in all districts,” Shinde said.Cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil said, “Taking a cue from the Sangli episode, we will put a mechanism in place in all districts to check such irregularities. We do not want the scheme and the government to be defamed due to such incidents.”Soon after taking over, the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government announced the loan waiver to more than 30 lakh farmers. After the beginning of disbursement in the last week of February, the state disbursed ₹12,000 crore in loan accounts of 19 lakh farmers. The scheme has been temporarily suspended due to pandemic, although 11.12 lakh more farmers are eligible for loan waiver worth ₹8,100 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-farm-loan-waiver-fraud-92-lakh-given-to-141-fake-beneficiaries/story-dktdS5Y4e8ZfV0vnG9auDM.html

18-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s Sector 48 govt hospital equipped with 15 ventilators for critical Covid patients||With the number of Covid-19 infections witnessing a spike, the extension building of the Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 48 has been put on a trial mode to admit critically-ill patients with the installation of 15 ventilators.Currently, two patients have been admitted here and authorities are making arrangements to plug any loopholes so that the 100-bed facility can be used once the resources at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) are nearly exhausted.Similarly, around 85 beds will be earmarked for high-risk Covid patients who might be suffering from other diseases (comorbidity). UT health secretary Arun Gupta said that they have received 20 ventilators from the central government, which have been equally distributed among the two tertiary care hospitals—PGIMER and GMCH, Sector 32.“Preparations are on for activating the facility, which shall be pressed into service if the need arises. The strategy of the health department is to utilise around 80 to 90% resources in PGIMER and then move to Sector 48 hospital. The workforce will be made available from the resources currently available with the department,” Arun Gupta said.According to the UT’s contingency plan on Covid-19, it is estimated that 10% of patients with confirmed diagnosis may develop severe symptoms and may, therefore, need utmost and specialised care. However, only a few such patients may require to be shifted to the intensive care units (ICU) or put on ventilator support. Nevertheless, the provision of adequate number of ICU beds and ventilators was mandatory, added Gupta.Around 360 such severe patients need to be accommodated in dedicated Covid hospitals on a peak day out of which 40 to 50 may need ventilator support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-sector-48-govt-hospital-equipped-with-15-ventilators-for-critical-covid-patients/story-pXrYGRQVNCfCEvX7rqWtsN.html

Twenty-seven people were safely rescued, while two people are being treated for serious injuries.Among the victims are Padmalal Gupta, 50, Jyotsna Gupta, 70, Kusum Gupta, 45, Kalpesh, 22, Rinku Chaurasiya, 25, Lalit Chaurasiya, 35, Manishaben Fareya, 65 and Shailesh Kanno, 17. Three of them are from one family. Two of the deceased have not been identified yet.On Thursday, a large portion of the rear corner of the ground-plus-six storey structure collapsed in Fort. There were 27 residential and 31 non-residential apartments in the building, with 30 people staying in the building at the time of the incident. The incident took place at 4.43pm. Termed “one of the riskiest operations” by the fire brigade, several people were feared to be trapped under the debris and some were stranded inside the building, as the staircase was blocked after the collapse.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had vacated the building before the monsoon. As it is a cessed building, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) had issued a no-objection certificate to the tenants for repairs at their own cost.In a press statement issued on Friday, Mhada said, “All necessary permissions required were given to the tenants by BMC in June 2019. The building was 100 years old and the tenants wanted to repair the building at their own cost without using the cess amount.”Tenants of the building said they were prepared to repair the building with the required permissions, however, the plan got delayed due to the pandemic. Rakesh Jain, one of the shop owners, said, “The building needed urgent repairs and we were very scared as it had rained in the past couple of days. We were going to start the repairs in March, as all tenants had collected money and deposited it in the bank. However, the work got delayed owing the lockdown and after that there were no labourers in the city.”Jain’s father nearly escaped death as he saw the building shake and rushed out. He said, “My father was closing our shop when he noticed that something had fallen inside the shop. When he went to check, locals asked him to rush out.”Mhada has now offered alternative accommodation to the residents. Vinod Ghosalkar, chairman, Mhada (repair board), said, “We expressed our readiness to provide them transit accommodation which are available in Borivli and Magathane. However, no one has come forward to claim the accommodation till now.”He said Mhada will investigate this case and decide the next step. The fire brigade said the search operation was still on.Bhanushali building (above) is opposite Kothari Mansion, a portion of which collapsed in June 2018 after a fire. The structure was then demolished as it was dilapidated. The locality has many such dilapidated buildings that are due for repairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-more-deaths-in-mumbai-s-fort-building-collapse/story-dwlYpEYoUxY0ETgJI0GmLI.html

18-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn to provide monthly aid; MC to lose another ₹10 crore in interest||With the UT administration deciding to release grant-in-aid to the municipal corporation on a monthly, rather than quarterly, basis, the financially struggling civic body is set to lose around Rs 10 crore in annual interest income.For the 2020-2021 fiscal, the UT administration had allocated ₹425 crore for the civic body. But, the aid was cut by 20% and revised to Rs 340 crore in June. The 20% cut was mandated by the central government in the wake of revenue loss on account of the Covid-19 lockdown.MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “The MC used to get a grant every three months. All of these funds were not spent in the month when these were received. Most of the aid would be deposited in the MC bank accounts, and we would earn an interest on it. In a year, MC earns around Rs 10 crore from such an interest.”Now, the MC will lose that option, too. “With monthly instalments, we will lose the opportunity to earn an interest on the deposited amount. Most of it will be spent on our monthly expenses,” Yadav said.UT finance department in a recent order levied cuts on the monthly spending of departments and corporations including the MC. It has also directed that amounts that remain unspent in a month/quarter will not be carried forward to the next month/quarter.The MC has been struggling with revenue generation, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. The civic body had even revised its revenue estimates and brought it down to Rs 321 crore, but effectively has only receipts of Rs 241 crore for this fiscal. Against the total committed liabilities of Rs 597 crore, the MC has only Rs 581 crore, a shortfall of Rs 16 crore. Even the routine maintenance works are going to suffer.The MC has to pay Rs 402 crore to its employees as salary and Rs 50 crore as employee pensions. In addition, around Rs 120 crore is reserved for the MC’s electricity bill and Rs 25 crore as payments for petrol/diesel. Consequently, the civic body is left with a shortfall of Rs 16 crore.In the latest monthly instalment of the aid, after the stipulated cuts in allocation, the MC has received Rs 30 crore instead of the Rs 35 crore it was supposed to get as per original allocations before the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-to-provide-monthly-aid-mc-to-lose-another-10-crore-in-interest/story-wcjQPxYXAVwB0xv2gWbTKM.html

All ordinary electricity meters in the city will be replaced with around 2.25 lakh smart meters; the existing grid sub-stations will be renovated and modernised with equipment compatible with the SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) centre; upgradation of power lines and transformers.The department on July 16 invited firms to provide consultancy for the project. The project design and management agency will be appointed for the implementation stage, and 24 months for post-implementation hand-holding, capacity-building and vendor management support.The project has been approved by the National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) and is part of the power sector reforms, funded by the central government. In march this year, the Centre had approved the UT’s proposal for the Rs 241-crore project.Currently, the UT electricity department is undertaking a pilot Smart Grid project covering 30 square km in the city. The department in October last year had allotted the work for installing 30,000 smart meters in four sectors (29, 31, 47 and 48), six villages (Faida, Ram Darbar, Hallo Majra, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra and Daria), and the Industrial Area.BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS, DEPTRight now, the city residents only have the option of post-paid electricity bills, but with the smart grid they will be able to opt for prepaid connections. “The prepaid electricity connection will work like a mobile phone prepaid connection. As per their consumption and requirement, they will pay to the department and get only that much supply,” said an official.“The project will allow the electricity department to monitor, gather and process real-time electricity data, directly interact with devices such as sensors, through human-machine interface software. It will help department employees sitting at the centre to access live information on power cuts, outages and manage emergent power needs of a locality. Billing will also be generated from this centre,” said a senior UT official privy to the development.Installation of smart meters is key to the project. “The smart meters will send tamper alerts immediately to the SCADA centre, and allow the department to keep a track of load, voltage, outages, peak demand and consumption across the city,” said the official. The SCADA building has already been constructed in Sector 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/expect-disruption-free-power-supply-prepaid-bills-by-2022-with-chandigarh-smart-grid-project/story-rI95cbFxP9JtARXG2VLlsL.html

He further argued that the two accused named in the FIR, Pankaj Kumar Arora and Rajesh Garg, have also been released on bail, and there was no direct complaint against Dandiwal for his involvement in the crime. Pertinently, Dandiwal and Durgesh had filed the bail application on Thursday through their counsels after they were sent to judicial custody. Durgesh allegedly supplied high-resolution cameras for live streaming of the matches of the fake Sri Lanka T-20 league. Dandiwal, who is on the radar of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), is facing charges of hosting a cricket match of the Uva T20 league on June 29 that was aired in Sri Lanka through YouTube. The BCCI team reached Mohali last week to question Dandiwal.The police have identified 22 players who had played in fake cricket league and questioned them. Earlier, the police had arrested Raju and Pankaj, who had booked the cricket ground of the Strokers Cricket Association for Rs 33,000 from June 29 to July 5 and had formed four teams for the league.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fake-sri-lankan-t20-league-kharar-court-grants-six-week-bail-to-kingpin/story-FpNIccxi5478ix8uDR3VZL.html

18-07-2020||City||‘Leave without pay’ scheme a win-win situation for employees and airline, says Air India||Defending its decision to send its employees on leave without pay (LWP) in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, national carrier Air India on Friday said that the policy is a “win-win situation” for the airline as well as its staffers.The airline stated that the while the scheme gives “freedom” to its employees to engage themselves with another employer for a stipulated period, the airline also gets to save its cash flow.“The LWP scheme is a win-win situation for the management as well as the employees as it provides flexibility to employees and simultaneously reduces the wage bill for the company. Covid-19 outbreak has severely impacted the airline sector, and currently, the airline operations of the company are a small fraction of the operations that used to take place before pandemic,” said a senior official from the airline.The airline’s clarification comes after the national carrier was flooded with letters of criticism from employees across all sections.Air India said that in a challenging financial situation, it is taking recourse to several initiatives to ensure that its operations continue.The LWP scheme, which was introduced on Tuesday, enables employees to avail the benefits of proceeding on leave without pay on voluntary basis, said the airline.“It has been introduced for grant of leave without pay and allowances for permanent employees for a period of six months/two years, which is extendable upto five years,” the airline said.Air India said its employees had previously, too, availed the LWP scheme in September 1998, June and August 2009. However, unlike on the previous occasions, this time the airline management can pass an order requiring employees to go on compulsory leave for a period of six months to two years, that is extendable upto five years.“In the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, there may be employees who are unable to attend their office duties in person on account of personal reasons. The LWP scheme enables employees to take a break from their office responsibility for a defined period of time with the approval of the management, while retaining their employment with the company. They will continue to avail facilities such as passage, medical and housing at specified rates,” an airline spokesperson said.However, a senior employee of the airline, disagreeing with the management, said, “LWP scheme is to save money for the company and not a weapon to settle scores with employees. This scheme will affect the livelihood of many. Why doesn’t the airline make every employee take LWP for a few days every month? This way the burden can be shared. The motive of the top management is to save their own salaries by snatching money from the lower-level employees.”The airline, however, assured to use the scheme sparingly and with complete fairness, and said that the names of employees for the LWP scheme will be decided after assessing their performances.As on April, Air India had over 14,000 employees, including 1,800 pilots and around 4,000 cabin crew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/leave-without-pay-scheme-a-win-win-situation-for-employees-and-airline-says-air-india/story-RvpoZyvbo80Car0vqR15hN.html

They said that the matter was in the high court and the school management was unduly harassing parents by threatening to remove their wards from the school rolls.The school management had asked protestors to send a delegation of four members so that talks can be held in this regard but protestors refused. The school management had also informed the police who arrived at the spot.One of the parents, Gagandeep Singh, said the school principal had sent them a notice to either deposit the fee or their children would be removed from the school rolls. He added they are already stressed due to not receiving salaries during the lockdown period while some parents had even lost their jobs.Principal Veena Malhotra said the Punjab and Haryana high court has already made the decision that schools can charge fees.

18-07-2020||City||44 extremely dangerous structures still occupied in Thane||The death of seven people in three different building collapses in Mumbai has brought the issue of dangerous buildings in Thane to the fore. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has vacated only 35 of the 79 extremely dangerous buildings in the city while 44 buildings are still partly or completely occupied.Naupada-Kopri ward has the maximum of 37 dangerous buildings of which only 13 have been evacuated. As most of the transit camps and civic properties have been converted to quarantine centres in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the civic body is also facing dearth of shelter homes for those residing in dangerous buildings.A civic official said, “There are 79 buildings in the extremely dangerous category, of which we have evacuated 35 buildings. While 44 buildings are yet to be evacuated, only 10 to 15 buildings are completely occupied and the remaining are partially occupied with merely two to three families residing here. The process of evacuation is in progress to ensure none of the extremely dangerous buildings are occupied.”According to the survey of dangerous buildings conducted by TMC, there are total 4,300 dangerous buildings in the city, of which 79 are in extremely dangerous category (C1) and 113 are in C2-A category which means dangerous parts of the said buildings need to be demolished, for which the residents need to be evacuated. These C-1 and C2-A buildings currently have more than 150 families residing in them.The official said, “We have sent notices to all these families residing in dangerous structures. However, most people are not vacating the buildings due to the Covid-19 situation in the city. We are trying to provide accommodation in rental buildings to as many as possible. We are also looking at alternative accommodations for these families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/44-extremely-dangerous-structures-still-occupied-in-thane/story-1RlCjZKQUAXFwISitieBhM.html
18-07-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh residents can now pay traffic challans online||City residents can finally pay their traffic challans online, as the e-challan system, which was being developed and tested out by the traffic police, was launched by Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore at a virtual conference on Friday.E-challaning will include compoundable traffic offences for which traffic police are authorised to collect the payment. Challans for which fines are collected by the court, including drunken driving, dangerous driving or juvenile driving, won’t be covered in this. Besides, challans where the driving licence is seized are also not included. The payment can be made on-the-spot through one of the 200 handheld devices provided by Axis bank to the UT traffic police for free or online through the central government’s e-challan portal. On-the-spot payment can be made through debit or credit card, while online payment offers multiple channels and involves no additional costs.“The UT traffic police have modified the central e-challaning system. Rather than risk their lives by stopping vehicles, cops have been asked to take down the registration numbers of offending vehicles, based on which warning letters are sent to their registered addresses. The driving licence of habitual offenders can also be suspended online, and the e-challaning system will be digitally linked to courts,” said Shashank Anand, deputy inspector general of police (DIG, traffic).The traffic police have sent a bulk SMS to over 60,000 offenders with traffic violation information slip (TVIS), informing them how to pay their challans. Speaking about the benefits of e-challaning, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic east) Charanjit Singh Virk said the process will be more transparent and will allow the authorities to take action against habitual offenders. DSP Kewal Krishan said for some offences like not wearing helmet, where the driving licence was suspended, spot payment can be made, but the traffic police will seize the driving licence of the offender and forward it to the Registering and Licensing authority. The offender will be given a form on the spot.New traffic police website goes liveTo aid the payment of e-challans, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore also inaugurated traffic police’s new website https://chandigarhtrafficpolice.gov.in. This is the first official website to be hosted on National Informatics Center (NIC)’s Chandigarh State Cloud.Along with being able to pay their challans, residents can also use the website for getting their driving record history (useful for those migrating out of India) and no-entry permission (permission for heavy vehicles to enter the city outside permitted hours). The website also provides details of how to check pending challans against your vehicle and how to use the police’s towed vehicle app. The governor also released the annual Road Safety Report. As earlier covered by the Hindustan Times, there have been 104 fatalities in 100 fatal accidents in 2019, a slight increase over 98 fatalities in 97 fatal accidents in 2018. This report also presents various traffic management initiatives taken by the traffic police to manage traffic congestion in the city. E-challaning available for:Violation of lane drivingUsing mobile while drivingDriving without seat beltWrong parkingParking on zebra crossing at red lightDangerous U-turnDriving without documentsUse of black film.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-residents-can-now-pay-traffic-challans-online/story-ZJuvWkKdgN1pyARur1qibO.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||‘Give report on Varavara Rao’s health in 2 weeks’||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Friday issued a notice to the chief secretary and director general of prisons of Maharashtra, seeking a report on the health of 81-year-old Telugu poet and Elgar Parishad case accused P Varavara Rao, who tested positive for Covid-19, within two weeks. SN Pandey, director general of prisons (Maharashtra), denied receiving any notice from NHRC.Rao was first taken to Sir JJ Hospital on May 28 after he fell unconscious, but was discharged on June 1. His family had alleged that Rao was discharged in a hurried manner to obstruct his bail plea. “He was not normal at the time of discharge. While sodium normal range was 134-145, he attained only 133 and potassium normal range was 3.5 to 5.0, he attained only 3.55, according to the hospital’s own discharge summary. But, later on June 2, it was proved that all this – admission in hospital, getting a normal report, getting him discharged – was part of conspiracy by police. June 2 was the date of hearing on his bail application on health grounds in NIA special sessions court and police argued against his bail showing this hospital’s “normal” report. The judge accepted that and refused bail on June 26,” read a statement from the family.Later, Rao continued to show signs of delirium and after voices were raised from various quarters, Rao was admitted to Sir JJ Hospital on July 13. On Thursday, Rao tested positive for Covid-19 and was shifted to St George Hospital. Rao’s bail plea in the Bombay high court will be heard on Friday.NHRC acted on a complaint from the special monitor of the commission, Maja Daruwala, who said Rao was suffering from many ailments due to which his health condition was deteriorating.Taking cognisance of the matter, the commission observed the right to life and medical care is one of the basic human rights and the state is duty-bound to provide a prisoner who is in its custody, appropriate medical care, so there should be no danger to his life. The commission has also directed the state to constitute a medical board to examine the health condition of Rao, and to see whether the treatment being provided to him is appropriate. The commission has mentioned the board is expected to decide on which hospital, government or private, will be best for Rao’s treatment.BAIL PLEA NOT HEARD OWING TO PAUCITY OF TIMEThe bail plea moved by Rao was not heard by the Bombay high court due to paucity of time. His lawyer, R Sathyanarayanan, said they will be moving a praecipe for an urgent hearing to be scheduled on Monday. Rao had appealed against a special NIA court rejecting his application for interim bail. Rao was admitted to the neurological ward of Sir JJ Hospital on Monday after his health deteriorated and was shifted to St George Hospital on Thursday. Hours later, Rao’s family issued a statement, alleging criminal negligence on part of the jail authorities. “The Covid finding highlights the criminal negligence of the state jail authorities, who have been repeatedly warned about the danger of Covid in Taloja Jail, and the fragile condition of the Hyderabad-based poet-writer,” the statement added.The statement had said that his wife, Hemlata, his two daughters and nephew Venugopal had met Rao at Sir JJ Hospital on Wednesday and “came to see him in pathetic condition with the patient having to lie in urine-soaked clothes for hours, and with very little nursing aid available at the hospital”.“The only way Rao stands a good chance is if the Bombay high court gives him medical bail, and is shifted to decent private speciality hospital,” read the statement.The statement had said the neglect had put the life of another accused in the case, Vernon Gonsalves, who was looking after Rao in jail, at grave risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/give-report-on-varavara-rao-s-health-in-2-weeks/story-g4VYZk88ZklJNZ497abDPP.html
18-07-2020||City||Mohali municipal corporation to take over maintenance of Industrial Area Phase 8A, B||Finally, after two decades, the Mohali municipal corporation will be undertaking maintenance work of Industrialist Area Phase-8A and B, which has around 400 industrial units. Under the Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) till now, the area requires urgent attention because of its damaged roads and poor upkeep, in spite of the fact that MC collects property tax of around Rs 16 crore but has so far only released Rs 1 crore for development work.The decision to let MC take charge of the area was taken at a recent meeting chaired by additional chief secretary, local bodies department, Punjab, which was attended by PSIEC officials and Mohali MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg.Though PSIEC has already undertaken patchwork of roads, laying paver blocks and building boundary walls at a cost of Rs 1.83 crore, it will now deposit the balance of Rs 2.20 crore with MC for work on water supply, sewerage, storm, drainage and waste disposal.Since the past four years, industrialists and workers have been complaining about badly maintained infrastructure here, because of which even crossing waterlogged roads is a feat during the monsoon. Garg said the MC was starting maintenance work in both the areas and it would be completed in a week’s time.It was high time things improved, said Vivek Kapoor, vice president, Mohali Industries Association (MIA). “Every year Rs 4 crore is collected as property tax from industrial units, but the MC has spent only Rs 1 crore on development in the past four years. Even the Central government scheme of depositing all funds under a special purpose vehicle to be used for improving infrastructure remains on paper. The tragic part is that it has been almost two decades now and we are still asking for basic amenities.”Expecting the “bone jolting experience” of driving on the roads to end soon, Yogesh Sagar, president, MIA, said“heavy trucks carrying raw material and finished products have to manoeuvre potholes. Only a few street lights work, while inadequate parking spaces make traffic management a horror story. Choked drains cause waterlogging at the merest excuse of rain,” he added.Heaps of garbage, due to lack of a regular clearing system in place, dot the landscape, attracting stray dogs and cattle in the area, Kapoor and Sagar added.More about industrial area Industry in Mohali began in 1978 with just 10 units, but today, it boasts about 10,000 units, including the manufacturing and IT/ service industry. These industrial units fall under three heads – Phase 1 to 4 are under Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA), Phase 7, 8-A and 8-B are under PSIEC and Phase 9 industrial area falls under Punjab Infotech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-mc-to-take-over-maintenance-of-industrialarea-phase-8a-b/story-pyLSoS4LJENATeHYOU8p3L.html

The petition was prompted after another activist P Varavara Rao, also arrested in the same case and lodged at Taloja jail, tested positive on Thursday.According to the petition, since Rao was discharged from Sir JJ Hospital in May, his health was fragile and Gonsalves acted as his aid. Teltumbde was in the same jail hospital facility where Rao was kept. The plea said Gonsalves suffers from hypertension, blood pressure and has bleeding piles, while Teltumbde suffers from chronic bronchitis asthma, chronic cervical spondylitis, postrtomegaly and supraspinatus tendinosis, and both are on oral drugs and medication.The petition said the court should decide on whether the two should be shifted to a hospital and tested for Covid-19 and kept in isolation for safety of the public and whether they should be physically isolated to ensure social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-test-us-for-covid-19-say-gonsalves-teltumbde/story-NAjZtEiUsy3zAsheqd4aSP.html

A petition has also been filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking cancellation of the bail granted by a Mohali court in May to former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini. The case was registered in Mohali on May 6 this year.Also, Palwinder Singh Multani, brother of Balwant Multani, filed an application in Mohali court seeking transfer of the case against Jagir and Anokh Singh from the court of additional district and session judge Monika Goyal. The Mohali courts have issued notices to the parties concerned on the different petitions. But the case in the high court involving the former DGP is yet to be taken up. Multani was allegedly picked up by two officers in 1991 after a terrorist attack on Saini, who then was Chandigarh senior superintendent of police (SSP), in which four policemen in his security were killed. The police later claimed that Multani escaped from the custody of the Qadian police. Former DSP Baldev Singh Saini, inspector Satvir Singh, sub-inspectors Har Sahai Sharma, Jagir Singh and Anokh Singh and ASI Kuldip Singh were also named in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/multani-disappearance-case-punjab-moves-courts-seeking-cancellation-of-bail-of-accused-cops/story-iL2sX3K2DZHm9LeJHiqusJ.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank fraud: Wadhawans move special CBI court for bail||Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, accused in the Yes Bank fraud case, have approached the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court for bail, claiming the agency has not filed the charge sheet in the case. The court has transferred the case to magistrate court for further proceedings under charges of cheating and conspiracy of the Indian Penal Code and refused to accept the case under Prevention of Corruption Act as the CBI had failed to initiate the process to obtain sanction to prosecute Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor.The CBI had filed a charge sheet on June 25 against Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL), its promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, Belief Realtors Pvt. Ltd, RKW Developers Pvt. Ltd, DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt. Ltd, Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor and his daughter Roshni Kapoor.When the court questioned the agency about the sanction order, the CBI prosecutor admitted that the agency is yet to initiate the process with the government for the sanction order to the prosecution of Rana Kapoor under Prevention of Corruption act. As per the act, the sanction order to prosecute a public servant under the Prevention of Corruption Act is a must.The court held that in absence of sanction order, the case cannot be put on hold, and the charges applicable are of cheating and conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code. The court held that these charges will be tried by the magistrate court.As per the CBI case, Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures of DHFL between April and June 2018. In return, Kapoor was allegedly paid “kickbacks” amounting to ₹600 crore by DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan. DHFL sanctioned a loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises, in which Kapoor’s wife Bindu is a director and 100% shareholder, alleged the CBI. Kapoor’s daughters, Rakhee Kapoor Tandon, Roshni Kapoor and Radha Kapoor, are also 100% shareholders in DoIT Urban Ventures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-wadhawans-move-special-cbi-court-for-bail/story-tVZefyscVoODRi0IeXmHMK.html

Jakhar had said, “If minorities are insecure in the Modi regime, then the Akal Takht jathedar should ask the Shriromani Akali Dal (SAD) to quit the Union government”.In a press statement, SGPC senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta said, “If any feeling of alienation is prevailing among the Sikhs, the Congress is guilty of it. Ever since the country attained independence, the Congress worked against the interests of Punjab and the Sikhs.”“No Congress leader has the moral right to talk about the Panth or the Akal Takht. They should look into what their party did. For a decade, your party played Holi with the blood of the Sikhs in Punjab,” he said.Mehta said, “It was your party which carried out carnage of Sikhs in Delhi, Kanpur, Bokaro, etc and attacked the Golden Temple and the Akal Takht in June 1984. The Akal Takht jathedar knows well how to lead the community and give a befitting reply to the attacks launched by anti-Panthic forces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/secessionist-feelings-among-sikhs-result-of-cong-s-wrongs-sgpc-to-jakhar/story-G1EDI44QAbolgOjtivDwSI.html

The six flew from Dubai in two Air Arabia flights under the Vande Bharat mission. In a press statement, customs commissioner (Amritsar) Deepak Kumar Gupta said, “Our team of officers at the airport intercepted five passengers on Thursday and one passenger on Friday. The passengers adopted a unique modus operandi by trying to smuggle gold worth Rs 5 crore in home appliances like iron, drill machines and mixer grinder etc.” “The five arrived in the flight IX–192 while one came onboard the flight G9275 of Air Arabia,” he added. He, however, did not divulge details of the accused. “The officers noticed something suspicious in their baggage during the targeted search and examination that also involves the use of X-Ray. During the further checking, the gold was found concealed in the appliances. All the passengers used the same modus operandi. The gold is of 24 carat purity,” the customs commissioner added. “We have heightened vigil in the wake of recent seizures of gold at different international airports across India. We also had some specific inputs about the smuggling bid,” Gupta said. The items were seized under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962, and further investigation is under progress, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/6-passengers-smuggling-10kg-gold-in-appliances-held-at-amritsar-airport/story-rsdaXGfRUY5S776R98c18K.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||No need to conduct CBI probe into Rajput’s suicide: Deshmukh||A day after actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s friend-actor Rhea Chakraborty demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into his suicide, state home minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday said there was no need for a probe by any central agency as the Mumbai Police’s investigation is going in the right direction and no foul play was found. Deshmukh said the police are also investigating the angle of professional rivalry.Chakraborty had on Thursday posted a tweet tagging Union home minister Amit Shah, requesting him for a CBI probe in the case.“Respected @AmitShah sir, I’m Sushant Singh Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty. It is now over a month since his sudden demise. I have complete faith in the government, however, in the interest of justice, I request you with folded hands to initiate a CBI enquiry,” she tweeted. Reacting to the tweet, Deshmukh on Friday said, “Mumbai Police are capable of conducting the probe and are doing it in the right way. They are probing every possible angle related to the case and have not come across any foul play. All details will be shared once the probe is completed.”After Rajput’s death, Deshmukh had tweeted that the police were investigating the alleged cause of “clinical depression owing to the professional rivalry” behind the death.“While the post-mortem report says actor @itsSSR committed suicide by hanging himself, there are media reports that he allegedly suffered from clinical depression because of professional rivalry. @MumbaiPolice will probe this angle too,” Deshmukh tweeted on June 15, a day after Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-need-to-conduct-cbi-probe-into-rajput-s-suicide-deshmukh/story-pvBvFedNSnd1tnGYIx9MoI.html

18-07-2020||Mumbai||No final-year tests, have urged apex bodies to give degrees, state government informs HC||The Maharashtra government on Friday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that it has appealed to the apex bodies of professional or non-professional courses to overlook the conduction of final-year exams in the state and permit degrees to be issued by the respective universities.The government reiterated that it would not allow final-year examinations to be conducted in light of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state. The state’s submission was made to the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Anuja Prabhudessai, which was hearing multiple petitions seeking cancellation as well as conduction of exams.One of the petitioners, represented by advocate Dr Uday Warunjikar, submitted that as the future of many students was compromised by the cancellation of exams, appropriate directions should be issued to ensure that the interests of the students are safeguarded. Advocate Rajshekhar Govilkar for Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS), on the other hand, submitted that post-graduate examinations had to be conducted as students required to be assessed physically to ascertain their skills and comprehension. He said that MUHS planned to conduct the exams from August 25. Govilkar submitted that a decision regarding undergraduate exams was yet to be taken.Advocate Kuldeep Nikam, appearing for one of the petitioners, sought interim reliefs with regards to dental exams scheduled to start on August 3. Nikam submitted that as per the directions by the concerned authority, students had to reach the exam centres and also undergo quarantine. However, as Bombay Dental College had conveyed that it did not have sufficient facilities to provide quarantine to the students, the exams should be cancelled. In light of this, Nikam sought that the exams be held online rather than making students appear in person.As there were multiple petitions, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted that to avoid confusion, a compilation of all petitions, public interest litigations (PIL), and intervention applications pertaining to the final-year exams should be submitted so that the hearings could be expedited. After hearing the submissions, the court accepted the suggestion of the state, and directed all parties to submit their affidavits and replies by July 21, and posted all matters for hearing on July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-final-year-tests-have-urged-apex-bodies-to-give-degrees-state-government-informs-hc/story-q1frvoVQ4XmQ27wothU32I.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||After Vistara, IndiGo allows single passenger to book two seats||Starting July 24, low-cost airline IndiGo, through its newly introduced ‘6E double booking’ scheme, will allow fliers to book air tickets for twin seats from the airline’s website. With this, IndiGo became the second airline to provide the facility to passengers.Earlier this month, full-service carrier Vistara had announced the same scheme without any extra charges other than the ticket cost of the second seat.The facility is meant to target passengers who are worried about their safety during air travel owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and would prefer to have additional space between themselves and other fliers.IndiGo clarified that the scheme will not be available through travel portals, IndiGo call centre, airport counters, or as an option after booking a single seat.The budget airline will charge an airline component and Goods and Service Tax with no additional airport charges. According to airline officials, the second seat will be priced at a lower rate than the total fare paid for the primary seat.“The charges for the extra seat will be effective up to 25% of the original booking cost,” IndiGo stated. Seat selection charges under this scheme will be applicable for both seats.Sanjay Kumar, chief strategy and revenue officer, IndiGo, said, “Even though air travel is the safest mode of travel at this point, we understand the customers’ emotional need for safety. We had been receiving such requests and are happy to introduce the option to book two seats for a single passenger, to ensure additional safety. 6E double seat will provide a stress-free flying experience to our customers.” The airline said that any changes and cancellation charges (based on the type of fare) will apply to the extra seat.“The extra seat booking will not entitle customers to additional baggage allowance. The extra seat can also be used by passengers travelling with a large musical instrument, a child’s car seat, or for special seating needs due to personal comfort, size or disability,” stated the airline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-vistara-indigo-allows-single-passenger-to-book-two-seats/story-EKl4RkWGaTb5OutnnDL10N.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||8,308 fresh cases as Maha tally nears 3L||Maharashtra recorded more than 8,000 fresh Covid-19 cases for the second consecutive day on Friday, as the state’s coronavirus tally neared the three-lakh mark. The state reported 8,308 infections, pushing up its count to 292,589, according to the state health department bulletin, which said active cases stood at 120,480. On Thursday, the state had recorded its sharpest single-day spike of 8,641 cases. The state’s toll rose to 11,452, after 258 deaths were reported in 24 hours.Maharashtra is likely to cross the three-lakh cases mark over the weekend, which would mean the state has reported its last one lakh cases in 14 or 15 days. The virus tally crossed the two-lakh mark on July 4, 22 days after the state had breached the one-lakh mark on June 12. The first lakh cases were reported in 96 days. Mumbai, meanwhile, inched closer to the one-lakh cases mark, with a rise of 1,214 cases on Friday. The city’s tally stands at 99,164, of which 23,948 are active cases. Mumbai’s death toll rose by 62 to 5,585.A study published in Lancet, a global health journal, has placed Maharashtra, among the nine states that have high vulnerability to the Covid-19 pandemic. The study has found Maharashtra as the seventh-most vulnerable state across India in the vulnerability index. Madhya Pradesh tops the list, followed by Bihar and Telangana.The study has rated the vulnerabilities of the states to the pandemic on a scale of zero to one, measured using 15 indicators across five domains — socio-economic vulnerability, demographic vulnerability, housing and hygiene conditions, availability of health care and epidemiological factors.Although social, demographic, economic, health, and epidemiological data is available in India, district-level data is not available yet. So the researchers have used National Family Health Survey 2015-16, Census of India 2011, Rural Health Statistics 2018 and National Health Profile 2019 data.“Our index aims to help planners and policy makers effectively prioritise regions for resource allocation and adopt risk mitigation strategies for better preparedness and responses to the Covid-19 epidemic,” Rajib Acharya and Akash Porwal from Population Council, New Delhi, have said in the study.Meanwhile, state health minister Rajesh Tope said the health infrastructure needs to be augmented only in cities of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), as in the rest of the state there is no shortage of beds. “We have built field hospitals in Mumbai and are building more in MMR cities as there is a shortage of ICU beds. Thane city has been taken care of, but the situation is different in Kalyan-Dombivli, Ambernath, Badlapur and Bhiwandi as the health infrastructure there is still not sufficient,” he said. “A multi-speciality hospital is needed in these areas. I have been speaking about this to the chief minister [Uddhav Thackeray] and in the cabinet. We are planning a jumbo facility with 1,000 beds with oxygen supply and 350 ICU beds. It will be completed in a months’ time.”Nine cities of MMR, including Mumbai, have recorded 174,715 cases, which contribute to 59.71% of the state’s tally. In Mumbai, however, the rise of cases has plateaued. The highest single-day spike this month has been 1,552 on July 2. Mumbai had reported its sharpest 24-hour spike of 2,077 cases on June 27.“Everybody agrees that Mumbai is on a plateau. Cases are not coming down, but they are not rising either… We have kept our finger crossed,” said a senior BMC official, requesting anonymity.The rise in cases in the other cities of MMR is massive, with most civic bodies re-imposing lockdown restrictions in a bid to flatten the case curve. Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Bhiwandi-Nizampur and Navi Mumbai have extended lockdown restrictions until July 19, while Ulhasnagar and Panvel have curbs till July 22 and July 24 respectively. Along with spike in cases, the state is also recording rise in fatalities on a daily basis. In the past 17 days, the state has recorded 3,446 Covid-19 deaths.With 11,452 deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state stands at 3.91%. It is the second highest in India after Gujarat, where the CFR is 4.59% with 2089 deaths (45,481 cases) till Thursday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.Maharashtra, however, has highest number of deaths in the country.To bring down Covid deaths, the government has started conducting rapid antigen tests in containment zones. These tests provide report in around 30 minutes. “If test report comes negative and the patient has Covid symptoms, then we also conduct RT-PCR test to confirm whether the patient is free from Covid. This helps in providing early treatment to patients, ultimately reducing Covid deaths,” said Tope.The number of recovered patients in Maharashtra has also risen to 160,357, after 2,217 recovered and discharged from various hospitals across the state on Friday. The recovery rate of the state has improved to 54.81%. The national recovery rate stands at 63.33%.The state has so far tested 1,484,630 people and has a positive rate of 19.7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/8-308-fresh-cases-as-maha-tally-nears-3l/story-Nc7A456srCCl0YpVgImF6M.html

The accused posed as a doctor. The incident took place on Thursday evening and is the first instance of rape reported from a quarantine facility in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).The accused, a resident of Panvel, used to work at a mall but has been unemployed since the lockdown. The homemaker lives in Kharghar with her husband and two children.The woman was admitted to the Indiabulls quarantine facility in Kongaon on Wednesday and the accused was admitted on Thursday. “On Thursday evening, hours after arriving, he [the accused] went to the woman’s room. During their conversation, she told her she was having leg pain. He claimed he is a doctor and offered to give her a leg massage. He then sexually assaulted her and left,” said an officer from Panvel rural police station.The woman later reported the assault to a staff member and the police was informed.“We have booked the accused under sections 376 (rape) and 354 (assault or criminal force to woman) of the Indian Penal Code. He is currently not under arrest as he has tested positive and is getting treatment for Covid-19,” said Ashok Rajput, senior inspector, Panvel rural police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-rapes-woman-at-quarantine-facility/story-jsZbbzlV3CaTkrHwLpiyMJ.html
18-07-2020||City||Woman alleges report mix-up, KDMC says she tested positive||A 27-year-old Kalyan resident has alleged that the civic body took her along with her two children to a quarantine centre, only to release them the next day citing mix-up with her Covid-19 test report. The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), however, denied the claims of mix-up and said she had tested positive according to the test report. Akshata Patil, a resident of Ambivli, Kalyan (West), is now worried that she and her children might have contracted the virus while at the quarantine facility.“Last month, my husband had fever and got tested for Covid-19 on June 13. His report came positive on June 17, following which he was taken to Tata Amantra quarantine centre. A day later, I decided to test myself and went to Bai Rukminibai Hospital. The hospital had said I would get the report by June 21, so I sent my children to my uncle’s place to keep them safe. Eight days after the test, I received a call from the primary health centre of KDMC saying my report was negative.”“However, on July 9, I got a call from the primary health care centre saying my test report was positive. They also said they were sending ambulance to take me to the quarantine centre. When I told them I had tested negative according to the civic body, they didn’t pay any heed,” Patil said.Patil and her two children, six-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son, were then taken to a quarantine centre in an ambulance, which was also carrying three other positive patients, she claimed. She also said they had to wait for four hours before beds were arranged for them.The next day she was asked to get her children tested at the centre. However, later she got another call from KDMC saying that her report was negative and that there was a mistake from the civic body’s part, she claimed. The three were then discharged. However, KDMC epidemic officer Pratibha Panpatil said, “The woman’s name was in the daily list that we receive from the Indian Council of Medical Research, so she was positive as per the report. She got tested in a private laboratory set up at the civic hospital, so they might have delayed updating her report online. The woman was sent home after the concerned medical officer came to know she was tested 21 days ago and that she did not have any symptoms. The claim that she was informed her report was negative is false.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-alleges-report-mix-up-kdmc-says-she-tested-positive/story-r8HzT4G19NYR3NaevcrWaO.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||State’s longest leopard cub reunion attempt fails, 4 cubs relocated to Nagpur centre||The Maharashtra forest department’s longest ever reunion attempt of four leopard cubs with their mother over 16 days failed at Akola. The department on Thursday relocated the abandoned 45-day-old cubs to Gorewada rescue centre in Nagpur.On June 30, local villagers at the Pastul village adjacent to the Patur forest reserve in Akola district came across three cubs abandoned at a forest patch and immediately informed the forest department. A day later, another cub was found at the same spot.“Since all four cubs were identified from the same area, we were sure that the mother would return, and commenced efforts for the reunion,” said Vijay Mane, divisional forest officer, Akola. With camera traps already in place to document the movement of the mother, the forest department installed a CCTV camera atop an electric pole near the forest patch where the cubs were found. The cubs were placed in a crate as the forest officers awaited the mother’s return on the night of July 1.“The CCTV camera does not give out a flash when there is movement close to it as opposed to the camera trap which could have scared the mother away,” said Mane, adding that he was glad the mother returned the same night. “We thought this could be the fastest reunion carried out by the department.”However, after sniffing her cubs for a while, the mother leaped back into the forest without collecting any of her cubs. This pattern continued for the next eight days, with forest officers keeping the four cubs around 8pm and waited through the night monitoring the area. “After the first attempt, we spotted the mother moving in this zone but did not come close to the crate even after loud cries made by her cub,” said one of the forest guards.Mane added that the team decided to dispatch a surveillance drone in the area to follow the mother’s movements. “We wanted to check whether she was tending to other cubs or there was another male leopard in the area. Though we identified a male leopard approximately 2 km, it seemed the mother was disinterested in taking back her cubs,” he said.The department waited another few days. “While there is no written rule or directives that the reunion should happen within a specific time frame, it needs to be done as early as possible. Generally, reunion attempts are made for a maximum of eight to 10 days. After that, cubs are relocated to captivity,” said Bilal Habib, scientist, Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. “We lost all hope when a mating call of one of the male leopard’s in the area was answered by the mother,” said Mane adding, “A decision, based on the approval from the chief wildlife warden, was taken to transport the cubs to the rescue centre in Nagpur, putting an end to our efforts.”Nandkishore Kale, divisional manager, Gorewada project said, “A health examination of all four cubs showed they were healthy and had no external injuries. All efforts are being made to ensure they have a stress-free environment and no separation anxiety from the mother.”A female leopard refusing to respond to persistent reunion attempts could have multiple reasons, said senior veterinarian Dr Shailesh Pethe from the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai. “A primary reason could be early age pregnancy where she is not ready to accept the cubs. Another reason could be the mother realising that the cubs would not survive in the wild, and in such cases the cubs die within a couple of days. Lastly, the mother avoids taking her cubs back if she senses the presence of humans in the area or human scent off the cubs,” he said. “Nurturing abandoned leopard cubs from the wild in captivity alters the natural course of life that these cats would have lived. However, what is important is to save the animal when there is no other alternative,” said Dr KD Batwe, former veterinarian, SGNP.Why is reuniting them important?A variety of factors including deforestation, habitat encroachment and poaching, leopards are continuously forced to leave their forested homes and move out into buffer areas. “The reunion plays a significant role in avoiding man-animal conflict cases within the forest division. When leopards are unable to locate their cubs, it is natural for them to turn hostile, aggressive and defensive on seeing humans in close proximity to that area and this poses an immediate threat to farmers in the area. The harvest season witnesses highest instances of conflict because the farmers move into the fields to cut down the long sugarcane stalks,” said Dr Ajay Deshmukh, wildlife veterinarian, who had successfully reunited 50 leopard cubs with their mothers over 10 years in Junnar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-s-longest-leopard-cub-reunion-attempt-fails-4-cubs-relocated-to-nagpur-centre/story-tfQfzSSqJdiH6COp7fdTUM.html

The meeting with MPs comes after Thackeray held similar meetings with party ministers, Mumbai MLAs, and vibhag pramukh (division heads) last week.Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut said that there was no political discussion during the meeting, which was held at the CM’s official residence Varsha bungalow. Former Union minister and south Mumbai MP Arvind Sawant said, “The party chief regularly meets his MPs, but due to the coronavirus, the meeting could not be held in the last three months. Measures to be adopted to fight Covid-19 were discussed.”Raut said, “Several MPs spoke about issues [from their region], and the CM and minister Aaditya Thackeray heard them. What stand to take on the celebration of the Ganpati festival in Konkan was also discussed.” Senior party leaders said that there is a lot of opposition from locals in Sindhudurg district on allowing people from Mumbai, Thane, and Pune to visit their villages for Ganeshotsav this year, fearing the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-meets-shiv-sena-mps-to-discuss-covid-strategy/story-AsdPd7B8G1r2v15DgsLvqM.html
18-07-2020||City||Lockdown after June surge helps Bhiwandi control cases||After its newly appointed civic commissioner ramped up contact tracing, testing and institutional quarantine, Bhiwandi has slowed down the spread of Covid-19. Since July, the city in Thane district has been reporting less than 100 cases daily. The fatality rate has come down to 5.7% from 10.22% recorded on June 21. On Friday, Bhiwandi reported 39 new cases and five deaths. The total number of Covid-19 cases in the city is now 3,006, of which 644 are active. The death toll is at 173.On June 18, the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) imposed a 15-day lockdown as the number of Covid-positive cases reported daily was consistently above 100. On June 20, when Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer Pankaj Ashiya was appointed commissioner of BNCMC, 170 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded. A doctor by training, Ashiya had previously been in charge of the Malegaon Emergency Operation Centre set up to tackle Covid-19.Under Ashiya, BNCMC is following a four-step model of house-to-house surveys, contact tracing, containment and facility management. Ashiya has 414 teams conducting surveys in Bhiwandi and tracing 150 suspected cases daily. The number of contacts traced for each Covid patient has gone up to 16 from 1.5.“Close contacts are compulsorily in institutional quarantine and only well-to-do families in the city are allowed home quarantine. Earlier, institutional quarantine was just 10%, which we have increased to 50%,” said Ashiya. Swab tests (which have to be sent to Mumbai since there is no testing facility in Bhiwandi) have increased from 50 to at least 400 daily. Ashiya said Bhiwandi was the first to start antigen tests in MMR (from July 1).BNCMC has also started mohalla clinics across the city. Khan Fakhre Alam, 55, who runs a gift shop at Gulzar Nagar, volunteered his shop to set up a mohalla clinic. “We want the city to be safe and decided to help the civic body,” said Alam.Bhiwandi-based activist Javed Ashfaq Farooqi, 42, said, “We could see lot of activities in the city since the new commissioner joined... The cases have reduced which is a good sign and people are feeling positive.”At present, there are three dedicated Covid hospitals (two of them privately-run) with approximately 2,500 beds in Bhiwandi. At the state-run Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital, BNCMC has increased the number of beds from 27 to 100. The civic body has organised 270 beds in two community halls. BNCMC aims to add another 600 beds soon.Bhiwandi mayor Pratibha Patil said, “In the coming days, the cases will reduce more and we are focusing on zero deaths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-after-june-surge-helps-bhiwandi-control-cases/story-RxeaxcVchcMQz7mWCqB8tM.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||South Mumbai’s rise in Covid cases a cause for worry||D ward, which covers some of the city’s most affluent areas such as Malabar Hill, Peddar Road, Breach Candy, Cumballa Hill, Kemps Corner, Tardeo and Girgaum, is emerging the new cause for concern for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in the fight against Covid-19. Reason: the growth rate of cases in these areas is 2%, higher than the city’s average of 1.34%, and doubling rate is 35 days, lower than the city’s average of 52 days, according to the figures as of July 16.The total number of cases in the ward is 3,464, with a recovery rate of 28% and a fatality rate of 4.3%. Its active cases are 2,341, mostly from high-rises, 288 of which are sealed. Mumbai’s recovery rate stands at 69.9%, and fatality rate at 5.6%.The city on Friday added 1,214 new cases, and 62 deaths, taking the count to 99,164 and toll to 5,585. There are 23,948 active cases in the city.Prashant Gaikwad, assistant commissioner of D ward, said, “During the lockdown, residents of these high-rises did not venture out. Now that restrictions have eased, some residents have started going to work. Most importantly, house helps have returned to work in these high-rises. The rate of infection in house helps and other staff is very high.”Gaikwad said, “In other areas, if a person or a house help tests positive, the entire family does not test immediately, until BMC recommends it. In D ward, entire families get tested right away. This is why many cases have emerged among high-risk contacts. In a family of five, at least three members test positive if a house help is discovered to have the virus.”D ward is among the three wards with a growth rate exceeding 2%, and is the only ward from south Mumbai on the list. The other two wards with a similar growth rate are R Central ward covering Borivli West, with the highest growth rate of 2.7%, and T ward of Mulund, with a growth rate of 2.1%. C ward, comprising Marine Lines, Kalbadevi, Chandanwadi and Chira Bazar, which is adjoining the D ward, has a growth rate of 1.4%. G-South ward comprising areas of Mahalaxmi, Worli, Prabhadevi, which were former Covid-19 hot spots, have a growth rate of 1.2%. A ward, which is yet another affluent south Mumbai locality comprising Marine Drive, Churchgate, Nariman Point, has a growth rate of 1.7%.R Central ward has a doubling rate of 27 days, T ward 33 days, A ward 41 days, C ward 49 days, and G South ward 71 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/south-mumbai-s-rise-in-covid-cases-a-cause-for-worry/story-Dz3Z7QuuK28gJT7dWbXk1J.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||HC questions delay in investigation into death of a 22-year-old because of alleged police brutality||The Bombay high court on Friday questioned the inordinate delay in the investigation into the death of a 22-year-old, who according to police was lynched by a mob when he went to commit robbery.However, the family members of the deceased Raju Velu Devendra have alleged that he was beaten to death by the police.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Anuja Prabhudessai questioned as to why the investigation remained pending so long when it commenced on March 31, a day after the incident. The judges also questioned as to why the culprits were not identified when police claimed to have collected the CCTV footage of the lynching.The bench has now sought a report disclosing the status of the investigation into the death of Devendra.Human rights activist, advocate Firdous Irani has brought two lockdown deaths, including that of Devendra, to the notice of the court through his public interest litigation highlighting police brutality during enforcement of the lockdown imposed for containing the spread of Covid-19.Irani has pointed out that he too was a victim of police brutality, as he along with his family were beaten up by a few policemen and civic officials on April 16, 2020, for no apparent reason. He submitted that several individuals in Mumbai have faced police high-handedness during the ensuing lockdown. He also pointed out a report of a human rights organisation disclosing that at least 15 persons have died across the country due to police brutality during the lockdown, and two of them are from Mumbai.One of them, according to the report, is Devendra, whose kin allege that on March 30, 2020, when they were headed to visit a relative, a police team chased them and caught the deceased. The policemen, according to the report, informed the relatives that they were taking Devendra to Juhu police station. In the morning, police informed the family that Raju was lying at Nehru Nagar Chowk and when they took him to a hospital, he was declared dead.While the family alleged that he died due police brutalities, police maintain that 22-year-old Raju was badly beaten by locals when went to commit robbery and succumbed to the injuries, and a case has been registered against eight persons.The second case pertained to the death of a porter, Sagir Jamal Khan, who was allegedly caught by police on April 18, when he was driving a handcart to deliver a refrigerator in Null Bazaar locality. Policemen hit him on head, hand and back. Later in the day, Khan suddenly collapsed while having dinner, and was declared dead by the hospital.His post-mortem report has, however, revealed that he died due to enlargement of the heart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-questions-delay-in-investigation-into-death-of-a-22-year-old-because-of-alleged-police-brutality/story-P4QLsjErzoRDLh55RulxpK.html

A nodal officer will be in charge of the passes and authorise them.A link to download the QR-based e-pass will be sent to the employee’s phone through SMS along with a password.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-directs-essential-workers-to-apply-for-qr-coded-e-passes-for-local-train-travel/story-ssMqKaxQaYZU4NbqaO24uN.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||‘14-year-old was mature enough’: HC grants bail to Pocso accused||The concept of consent is irrelevant under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012, but the high court is empowered to pass orders necessary to secure the ends of justice, the Bombay high court (HC) said on Monday while granting bail to a city resident arrested for raping a minor.Justice Sandeep Shinde granted bail to the rape accused primarily on the grounds that apparently the 14-year-old survivor was mature enough and the acts were consensual. “Looking into the case of the prosecution, prima facie I am of the view that the victim possessed the mental capacity to actively understand the nature, circumstances and consequences of the act to which she had consented,” said justice Shinde.The accused was arrested by Nehru Nagar police in Kurla on July 10, 2019, following statement given by the survivor to police that she was raped by the married man and three others. The survivor’s stepmother had lodged a missing complaint on June 14, 2019 after the minor left her house as she was purportedly fed up of the harassment meted out by the complainant. After leaving home, she travelled to Chennai and then returned to Mumbai. She was raped by the four accused separately at different places during this time.Justice Shinde noted that the 14-year-old left her house voluntarily and accompanied more than one person to different places. She met a stranger in Chennai and returned to Mumbai with him and his friend.Her statement further revealed that after returning to Mumbai she met one Hussain and had consensual relationship with him. Thereafter, somebody handed her over to Mulund police station, but she introduced a stranger as her family member and went with him.In addition, the minor, born to a Muslim couple, had changed both her name and religion and got it declared by Gazette publication. All these revelations prompted HC to believe that the 14-year-old was capable of understanding the nature and consequences of the acts that she consented to.HC has, thus, ordered Navghare to be released on submitting personal bond of ₹30,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/14-year-old-was-mature-enough-hc-grants-bail-to-pocso-accused/story-bYDcJQjOztlZiT29MWUSoO.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||State expands ESZ to protect 10.59sqkm more forests around Thane sanctuary||The state forest department has revised its proposal for a buffer zone around the Thane creek flamingo sanctuary (TCFS) in Mumbai suburban and Thane districts. To declare an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around the 16.90 sq km sanctuary, the forest officials have revised the originally proposed buffer area from 0 to 3.5km to 3.89km thereby offering protection towards the eastern end of the sanctuary covering the strip of mangrove forests towards Navi Mumbai.If the revised ESZ proposal is accepted, TCFS will span across 44.64 sq km - including 0.3 sq. km mangroves belonging to government agencies - which is an addition of 10.59 sq. km from the previous draft. The additional area is one-tenth the size of 105 sq kms Sanjay Gandhi National Park. HT had reported on May 16, 2019, that the originally designated ESZ did not protect mangroves, mudflats and salt pans towards certain portions of the sanctuary.An ESZ is a buffer area to reduce developmental pressures around a wildlife sanctuary or national park. TCFS is home to 12 true mangrove species, 39 mangrove associates, 167 species of birds including flamingos, 45 fish species, 59 species of butterflies, 67 insect species among other mammals like jackals.The revised proposal was recently approved by the principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF wildlife). Once approved by the state government, it will be sent to the Centre’s ESZ committee and the union environment ministry. Based on their approval, a draft proposal will be published again for suggestions and objections over the next two months.“The expanded area was an already notified reserved forest, which garnered protection under the Forest Conservation (FC) Act, 1980. Now, these areas will have an added advantage of attracting provisions under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 as well,” said Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF wildlife.The decision was taken after the Centre’s ESZ committee in February directed the state to include adjoining reserved forests, home to mangroves and mudflats, towards Airoli and Vashi for ‘better protection and fortification from a legal standpoint’, as per the minutes of the meeting reviewed by HT.“Since it is a creek, we found that mangroves on only one side were marked in the buffer zone. The intent was to safeguard the creek from all sides,” said a senior Union environment ministry official part of the ESZ committee. “We have called for the early submission of the proposal as per the Supreme Court (SC) directives. It is likely to be cleared by the Centre during our next meeting.” Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove cell) said, “As advised by the Centre, we have included mangrove areas on the eastern side of TCFS. It was left out as they were already protected under coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms, a Bombay high court order, and FC Act. The entire process for the ESZ declaration will take five to six months.”The original ESZ extended on the eastern and western boundaries of the sanctuary and included nine villages. Inclusion of mangrove forests in the buffer zone (in the latest proposal) will cover an additional nine villages towards Navi Mumbai.The total ESZ area, as per the revised draft, comprises 18.48 sq. km reserved forest area, 9.13 sq. km private mangrove forests, and 17.02sq.km includes private land and creek area.In May 2018, the Maharashtra government had declared 1690.5 hectares in Mumbai suburban district as the flamingo sanctuary stretching across Mulund, Vikhroli, Bhandup and Kanjur and parts of Mandale village.Environmentalists said the decision should be taken with caution. “We must ensure that regulated activities in the ESZ that include construction, small scale industries, and establishment of hotels and resorts are monitored carefully but enhanced protection for Navi Mumbai mangroves is welcome,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-expands-esz-to-protect-10-59sqkm-more-forests-around-thane-sanctuary/story-RrX4R6cJDzoaZOc7y5lbQO.html

Both had tested positive for Covid last Sunday. They were in home quarantine as they were asymptomatic.Aishwarya’s husband, actor Abhishek, and father-in-law, Amitabh, too, are admitted to the same hospital and are getting treated for Covid-19. “They [Aishwarya and Aaradhya] were kept under observation at home quarantine. But on Friday, both started showing mild symptoms like breathlessness. So, around 9pm, they were taken to the hospital,” said a senior health department official, on condition of anonymity. Dr Abdul Ansari, head of the critical care at Nanavati hospital, didn’t respond to calls and text messages from HT for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aishwarya-rai-bachchan-daughter-taken-to-nanavati-hospital/story-2V898QdyavozzomgUkupNI.html
18-07-2020||Mumbai||Rapid antigen testing reveals 90% of Covid-positive patients as asymptomatic||After testing 6,000 people at Covid care centres (CCC) with rapid antigen kits, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has found that of the 600 people who tested positive for Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, close to 90% were asymptomatic, making them silent carriers of the infection. The 6,000 people tested had earlier been identified as high-risk contacts and were brought to CCCs. They were primarily from parts of north Mumbai like Andheri, Goregaon, Malad, Kandivli, Borivli, and Dahisar, “We have found that 10% of those who tested positive are symptomatic and they are getting treated at CCC in their respective civic wards,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.The civic body started testing high-risk contacts and suspected patients with rapid antigen kits, which, unlike the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, that takes almost eight hours to provide results, gives reports within 30 minutes.According to ICMR protocol, every positive report from the testing group will be treated as a ‘true positive’, while negative samples will have to be mandatorily re-tested by the RT-PCR process.BMC’s findings have led organisations like Jan Aarogya Abhiyan (JAA) to reiterate their claim that the civic body should have been using the kit much earlier, to control the spread of the virus. Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor, JAA, said, “This is the reason why we have been demanding for more number of Covid-19 tests which could have helped us in faster diagnosis and to control its spread.”Dr Ravikant Singh, a health activist said that the antigen test should have been used while sending migrants back to their home states. “These kits give results in 30 minutes. So, before allowing migrants to board the trains, the government should have tested them and quarantined the infected ones. This could have stopped the spread of the virus to other parts of the state,” he said.On July 2, BMC procured 1 lakh rapid testing kits from South Korean firm SD Biosensors – the only company approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to supply the kits.Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert, said, “Asymptomatic patients are silent carriers of the virus. Though their chances of spreading the infection are less, they are still infectious. So, in a pandemic, identifying such patients is essential, to break the chain of reaction. Thus, the civic body should have started with the rapid antigen tests earlier.”Sero survey completed, second comparative survey to be conducted in AugAfter much delay due to the ongoing monsoon, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has finally concluded the national serological survey by collecting 10,000 samples on Thursday. Next month again, the corporation will run a consecutive survey of the same wards for a comparative study.The survey is being conducted by BMC, along with NITI-Aayog, and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.“Data collection was completed on Thursday. On Friday, we retook samples of some individuals due to technical errors,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “A comparative study with a month’s gap will help us to know how many are exposed to the virus and its pattern of infection.”On June 29, the civic body under the direction of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), started taking blood samples in Tilaknagar, Chembur, Matunga, Sion, Wadala, Dahisar, and Mandapeshwar. In a serological survey, a group of individuals undergoes blood tests to detect the presence of IgG antibodies that the body produces against the novel coronavirus. The tests aim to identify individuals who were previously infected with the virus and have now recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rapid-antigen-testing-reveals-90-of-covid-positive-patients-as-asymptomatic/story-8Aw7nsXHg2wnGVsuG2pthN.html
18-07-2020||Chandigarh||Readers’ take: Lessons from Covid, chart a new course for students with care||With uncertainty prevailing over the Covid-19 crisis, one does not know when the colleges will reopen, authorities need to cut down the syllabus to more than 30% and make efforts to open the institutes by September this year when sufficient time will be left to complete the syllabus till the end of the academic year. Safety and social distancing measures should of course be in place. If that does not happen then the government has to take a decision to promote the students without any examination.SK KhoslaIn order to help the students study effectively without pressure, emphasis should be laid on the methodology of teaching, content being taught and also the accessibility to education. Efforts should be made to ensure that children don’t strain their eyes because of hours spent before computers for online classes. The government should provide free internet access and study oriented devices (ideally tablets) to poor children (most of them studying in government schools) so that every child has access to education at this time. Some unimportant topics in the curriculum can be skipped for this year to reduce the workload on students. Parents, who are ideally the child’s first teachers, should take command. They should be in regular touch with their ward and their teachers, and should try to devote some time to their children’s studies to help them. We need to be optimistic and believe that the day will come when we will have lived past this nightmare, when everything will finally come back on track.Krrish Madaan, Ambala‘One child, one teacher, one pen and one laptop with high speed internet can certainly change the world’, is the new quote of our era. Taking online classes is the only way forward for students in these turbulent times and for this, the schools must impart due training to their teachers. Avik Seth, Zirakpur, MohaliTeachers should make their best efforts to ensure their students take as much advantage of online classes as they can, even if the syllabus is reduced. Teachers should also be in touch with parents, be approachable to children, and be as innovative and interesting as they can be. The schools must also help poor parents whose children are handicapped as they cannot afford smart phones or internet costs. The mental and physical health of children should be factored in when lesson plans are made. They should not be exposed to too much screen time and be fruitfully employed in creative activities to avert anxiety.Madhu R D Singh, AmbalaLessons should be made fun and short so that the curriculum can be completed quickly and children enjoy the learning. Students should be promoted automatically though regular assignments should be given to them using various methods. This will ward off stress and tensions students are likely to be feeling at this time. Creativity in education is the need of the hour. Besides, skill development training should be given and students taught different household tasks that will enable them to take care of themselves and their families in emergent situations. We also need to adapt to online methods in pandemic times as we should make the best use of technology. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhThe purpose of school classes and tests is to add to and assess the grasp a student has on studies. Promoting students automatically to the next class is tantamount to a reward given for no effort made by a student. CBSE should frame question papers involving comprehensive coverage of course contents on quarterly basis and students should submit the answers after open-book self-study and consultation of peers and teachers directly/physically and virtually. Annual results can be compiled by the school concerned. This will encourage self-study and keep students busy .Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaGive us our provisional degree, we expect nothing from our college, which has the worst placement scenario. I am a student of mechanical engineering. What about my expectations and my parents’ hopes if our institutes cannot help us get a job? I don’t know how institutes such as University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET), Panjab University, have reported no impact on placements this year. If we don’t get jobs what other benefit can we expect from universities or colleges?Rohit Singh RathorePromoting the students automatically will set an unhealthy precedent. One option is to grade students on the basis of internal tests. Pruning of syllabus is not a permanent solution as it may lead to complacency among all the stakeholders.Usha Verma, ChandigarhParents will not want to send their children to schools when the Covid-19 pandemic rages. If this academic year is cancelled students should utilise the time in polishing their skills and developing their knowledge with the help of digital platforms such as YouTube or other online apps for easier passage through the next class and year. Ishita NaraThe students have to be promoted to the next classes as there is no other alternative. However, they should be made to clear an online test such as general awareness on health and wellness apart from other subjects. Parents can also help in grading them on the basis of how efficiently they are handling their life during the lockdown at home and helping out with household chores etc.Suman Kansal, PanchkulaAs we all are going through the Covid-19 pandemic and things aren’t looking good yet, many students are worried about their future. The government should allow promotion of students without exams and colleges immediately start classes for the next semester. It will be good for students to make a timetable and start studying for the next academic session.Sam Randhawa, LudhianaLife has been disrupted across India and the world because of the Covid-led lockdowns. Even if some institutes in urban India manage online classes, India doesn’t have the technology for interactive learning across the country, especially in rural India where resources are limited. Every student doesn’t possess a smartphone or a laptop for online studies. The Indian government should be more generous this year and promote all students to the next class without any examination. No one should be unfair towards students and should not initiate any such step which will ruin an entire year for them.Gurpreet S Malhotra, KansalIn these unprecedented times neither the students nor teachers feel comfortable about attending classes. However, online coaching for students can hardly substitute for classroom teaching, more so when practicals are an integral part of the prescribed course. Wisdom therefore lies in giving a go by to the session instead of putting the safety of children in jeopardy. The education departments must take a bold and firm stand.SC Luthra, ChandigarhEveryone knows that India is a poor and developing country. Students/ children are the future of the nation. A majority of poor students cannot spend money on digital gadgets. Secondly, primary school students can’t get the benefit of online education without support or help from parents and teachers. So, this method of online teaching is not suitable for the poor, especially those in rural and slum areas. The students cannot attend the schools due to Covid-19 and neither are their parents willing to send them. Prevention is better than cure. Long-term breaks can be declared for primary school students. Examinations should be based on the syllabus covered through online classes and other assessments. Senior students should be made to come in shifts and only one-third students should attend classes for two days a week after observing social distancing and wearing face masks. Online education should be provided to them alongside regular classes. The syllabus should be reduced. In the end, the annual examination should be held in two shifts (morning and evening ) in small groups with rules and regulations. All the extra activities and sports should be banned as long as the threat of Covid-19 remains. The UT administration should ensure that special attention is given by schools and teachers to the care of students.Sumesh Kumar BadhwarStudents have been the worst sufferers during the Covid-19 pandemic as they haven’t attended classes in the last four months. Syllabus should be reduced and exams must be taken to judge the students’ grasping power. In case exams are held by any chance, the pattern of question papers has to be changed. There should be more emphasis on multiple choice questions, one line questions and very short questions to quickly assess their grasp on a subject. Questions requiring long answers should not be included in exams . In order to keep students engaged, they should be made to do different interesting activities . Competitions can be held online. Storytelling, recitation sessions can be held for pre-primary classes. Students should also be given projects which enable them to apply practical as well as theoretical knowledge to what they have learnt. Marks based on such assignments and co-curricular activities should be included for assessment.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliThe decision of the CBSE to reduce syllabus by up to 30% clearly illustrates that policymaking around education in India is taking retrograde steps. The trivialisation of knowledge is symptomatic of an outlook that regards textbooks as assemblages of facts, which need to be memorised and regurgitated in examinations. The curriculum is designed only to enable students to pass examinations to be elevated to a higher class. This thinking has led to mushrooming of coaching institutes and the brisk business of sale of guidebooks, past year examination questions and their model answers. No attention is paid to the creativity of the student. CBSE desires that students should graduate without learning about citizenship, nationalism, secularism, algebra basics, binomial theorems, democracy and diversity, magnetic effects of electric currents and mathematical reasonings. The curriculum rationalisation will lead to knocking down of the building blocks of knowledge. The ideal way should have been to have condensed versions on critical themes, to ensure that students pick up the basics, without getting overburdened and stressed.Rajiv Boolchand Jain, Zirakpur||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/readers-take-lessons-from-covid-chart-a-new-course-for-students-with-care/story-Hvg3hpofQtLvMMCkvdP4PN.html
18-07-2020||Delhi||Man held for posing as secretary of Union minister to seek favour||The Delhi Police on Friday said they had arrested a 27-year-old man from Madhya Pradesh’s Indore for allegedly impersonating the private secretary (PS) of Union home minister Amit Shah, and calling a personal staff of Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, seeking cancellation of the transfer of a transport department official in Gwalior.The alleged impersonator, identified as Abhishek Dwivedi, was arrested on Thursday by a crime branch team, which had been trailing him and camping in Mumbai, Bangalore, Rewa and Indore for his arrest after case of impersonation and cheating was registered on July 5.A statement issued by Delhi Police said a complaint was received on July 3 from the Union Home Minister’s office, alleging that someone misused the minister’s personal secretary’s name and position to seek favour from the personal staff of the Union transport minister regarding cancellation of the transfer of a motor licensing officer. A case was registered and investigation was taken up by the crime branch, the statement read.The MLO had been transferred, an officer related to the case said, requesting anonymity. “Gadkari’s office received three calls on July 3. The officials became doubtful because the job was not so important that it required the intervention of a senior bureaucrat in the home minister’s office. The matter was communicated to the HM’s PS, who denied making such calls and filed a police complaint,” said the officer.The ministries of home affairs as well as transport and highways did not comment despite separate queries sent regarding the incident, case and arrest of the impersonator.During the probe, the police statement read, it was learnt that the suspect, Abhishek Dwivedi, is a resident of Madhya Pradesh’s Rewa, and is involved in criminal activities. Through technical investigation, the investigating team tracked the suspect’s location to Navi Mumbai and raided the rented flat, where he had been living with his wife. However, Dwivedi managed to give the police a slip by the time they reached his flat, said another crime branch officer, who asked not to be named.“Dwivedi’s next location was traced to Bangalore but he fled from there as well before the raiding team could reach. He later moved to Indore and was caught from a hotel with the help of the local police. The mobile phone and SIM card used in making calls has been recovered. Dwivedi is found to be previously involved in 13 cases of cheating, robbery and dacoity. He was also wanted by the Rewa police,” the officer added.The investigating team produced Dwivedi before a court in Indore and secured his transit remand custody. He is being brought to Delhi via road and is expected to reach the city by Saturday morning. Dwivedi’s father is employed in the electricity department in Rewa..“His wife told us that he holds a Bachelor in Civil Engineering degree . We are verifying it. Dwivedi’s association with Gwalior’s transport department officials will be probed. If needed, the official will be asked to join the investigation. So far, we have learnt that he committed the crime on the directions of his friend Vinay Singh Baghel, who is yet to be caught,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-held-for-posing-as-secretary-of-union-minister-to-seek-favour/story-9ispCHO4LCbgc9catJzVvK.html

18-07-2020||Delhi||Rework Metrolite line in phase 4 to suit new housing areas, DDA tells DMRC||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has written to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to rework the alignment for its Phase 4’s Rithala-Narela line—one of the two Metrolite projects in Delhi—to sync it with the development proposed under the ambitious land pooling policy. The land pooling policy, which was re-notified in 2018, is aimed at meeting the growing housing requirement by providing 17 lakh dwelling units through planned developed on the outskirts of the city.A senior DDA official said that the current alignment either does not touch or just passes by the periphery of the existing crucial development areas and the ones that are yet to be developed under the land pooling policy.A sizable portion of the population where large-scale development is proposed will not benefit from the ₹2,900 crore Metrolite project as per the current alignment, a senior DDA official said, requesting anonymity.DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, “We have requested DMRC to rework the alignment for the Rithala-Narela line so that planned development can take place. It is crossing areas where the land pooling policy will be implemented. We have given our suggestions to DMRC regarding the alignment. Through a coordinated approach, the alignment can be reworked to optimise its benefits to citizens and the city.”Under the policy, individuals or groups of owners will pool their land for planned development. DDA will prepare a development plan under which, 60% of the pooled land in each sector will be returned to the land-owners for the development of residential, commercial and semi-public facilities while using the remaining to provide basic infrastructure roads, sewer, hospitals, schools, etc. When contacted, Anuj Dayal, the executive director of corporate communications, DMRC, said, “We decided the alignment for this section in consultation with all stakeholders concerned, including DDA. However, we have received this letter, and the same is being examined and reviewed.”The Rithala-Narela line—the other Metrolite project is between Kirti Nagar and Bamnoli—is one of six corridors proposed as part of the Metro’s Phase-4 network expansion. The Metro network is currently spread over 389km in the Delhi-National Capital Region. The proposed 21.7km-long Metrolite line will have 19 stations—five at grade and the rest elevated—and will pass through sectors 25, 26, 31, 32 and 36 in Rohini, Barwala, Poothkalan, Bawana industrial areas 1 and 2, Narela, etc.These areas are part of DDA’s ‘N zone’, which is the first of the five zones to be developed under the land pooling policy. Re-notified in 2018, the policy—it was initially notified in 2013—is aimed at meeting the growing housing requirement in the Capital by providing 17 lakh dwelling units on the outskirts of the city. The fresh development will come up on vacant land in 95 urbanised villages.DMRC had sent the alignment proposal to DDA last year. Last month, DDA wrote to DMRC asking for the alignment to be reworked. According to a senior DDA official, the current proposed alignment will disturb the sector-wise planning in land pooling areas, as it cuts across sectors such as Sector 20 in the N zone.“The current Metro alignment is cutting across a sector. In each sector, we have to return 60% of the land to the original owners. The alignment will disturb the development planned under this policy. The line should pass between two sectors so that a large population can benefit from it,” a senior DDA official said. The DDA official said the alignment is passing through one end of the Bawana industrial area. “If the alignment crosses the middle, then it will benefit many people because those working there can use the Metro. In Narela, the line crosses the green belt and does not touch the areas where residential and commercial development is planned,” an official said.Urban planning expert Sabyasachi Das, the former commissioner of planning at DDA, said that the lack of public transport has been one of the major reasons for the slow-paced development of Narela and the large number of housing units constructed by DDA lying vacant.Das said, “Transport infrastructure should be developed along with other infrastructure. This is greenfield development—which is planned development on large parcels of vacant land—therefore there is scope for better planning. In Dwarka, for instance, development in commercial and residential areas picked up only after Metro started its operations. Even today, Narela is not well-connected to the rest of the city. There is no proper public transport system. This is one reason DDA is facing problems in selling its housing project in Narela.”A senior DDA official said, “DDA and DMRC officials are to hold a meeting to discuss the issue, but it is yet to be planned. The DDA has not referred the issue to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rework-metrolite-line-in-phase-4-to-suit-new-housing-areas-dda-tells-dmrc/story-TWSvxDoFUV3IqbvWD3Ro5L.html

The diaphragm walls will be used during the tunnelling of a 1.4 kilometre stretch between Janakpuri West and Keshopur with tunnel boring machines.“We will secure the excavated area with these walls and then commence the construction of the underground station. This technology has been used for Delhi Metro’s underground stations since we constructed Phase 1,” Anuj Dayal, the executive director of corporate communications, DMRC, said.Of the 28.92 km-long Janakpuri West-RK Ashram Marg corridor, the underground segment between Janakpuri West and Keshopur is 7.74km-long. The corridor is an extension of Magenta Line and will comprise 22 stations. Construction work on this particular section had started in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dmrc-begins-constructing-underground-section-of-krishna-park-extension-station/story-I8ZMIaqwa6FXLbeU5pQqXO.html
18-07-2020||Delhi||Residents of two south Delhi localities on a mission to bring back native trees to parks||Native trees may soon populate the avenues and parks of the national capital with more and more people taking up the planting of indigenous plant species, the latest being the efforts of residents from the south Delhi neighbourhoods of Sarvodaya Enclave and Vasant Vihar, who are planting these saplings in public parks with the help from civic bodies. Monsoon is the season for plantation when millions of saplings are planted across the city by various agencies. The Delhi government targets the plantation of 31 lakh saplings this year. It has been encouraging citizens to plant more trees through free distribution of saplings to increase the overall green cover of the city.The residents, along with environmentalists, have taken it upon themselves to enrich the biodiversity of Delhi-NCR and have tied up with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The civic body, which is the custodian of parks, will help with the watering of all saplings while residents will engage their own labour and resources for the plantation drive. The saplings are being sourced from different organisations, including the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Gurugram, and various NGOs, said Padmavati Dwivedi, a resident of Sarvodaya Enclave, who is leading the initiative. The residents in Vasant Vihar have planted nearly 100 native trees, such as such as bel, arjun, dhak, doodhi, khejri, and bargad, among others, in a 1.8 acre park along the Munirka Marg last week. “We took permission from the civic body and they were happy to help us. We have planted around 100 native saplings at the Murika Marg park. The park mostly has kikar (an invasive species), which we are trying to replace with native varieties. Also, we have roped in an agency to help set up a mini forest inside the park. We also plan to have a herbal and native plants nursery, a bamboo grove and a butterfly garden,” said Keshav Garg, president, Vasant Vihar, Block D RWA.A chartered accountant by profession, Garg is a nature enthusiast and has been working on this project for almost a year. “We have been making manure using kitchen waste from 200 households at one of the parks here. The manure is used in the plantation. Also, I have taken permission from the Delhi Jal Board and have installed a sewage treatment plant for the park. We are yet to get approval from the SDMC to operate the STP, “ Garg said. A senior SDMC official, who did not wish to be named, said, “We had received a request from residents for the plantation drive. The horticulture department decides where the pits will be dug for plantation while residents will carry out the plantation.” Sohail Madan, an ecologist and centre manager of the Conservation Education Centre at Asola Bhati sanctuary, who is helping residents with the butterfly garden said it is crucial for public parks to have a rich biodiversity to support local organisms. “I will hold a webinar to educate residents on the basics of how to make a habitat for butterflies and what plants are required. I will also assist them with the plantation. Wild and native varieties such as peela vajradanti, citrus plants and patharchatta, among others, are required for butterflies to lay eggs on. The life cycle of a butterfly will go on, which will attract other predators such as lizards, spiders and bees, adding to the biodiversity of the area. Mostly, public parks only have trees that do not have any biodiversity value, which is why this initiative is so heartening,” Madan said. Mona Jugran, a resident of Sarvodaya Enclave, has helped plant around 30 native shrubs in two corporation parks in her neighbourhood. “I have my own kitchen garden and have been participating in tree walks. I hope that the plants grow well,” she said. The native varieties being grown by residents include dhau, goya khair, goondi, bistendu, gangeti, jhinjeri, khejri, dhak, doodhi, kaim, Harbor, peela vajradanti,chamrod, papdi and vallaris, among others. “The interest is catching on. Residents from neighbourhoods such as Gulmohar Park have asked me for native plants to grow in pots. We hope that this trend becomes a full-fledged movement to support the city’s green cover,” Dwivedi said. She added that native plants are best for biodiversity and require less maintenance, making them a perfect choice for a dry and hot capital. A senior forest department official said every year, they keep saplings for free distribution, all of which are of native varieties. “This year, we have kept around five lakh saplings for free distribution, and 99% of them are natives. Besides, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have also got medicinal plants such as giloy, tulsi and amla, among others.” Vijay Dhasmana, curator, Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Gurugram, said they have a huge citizen volunteering programme and they distribute plants for such community initiatives(as otherwise they do take monetary contributions) free of cost. “Mostly public parks have exotic or ornamental trees, which doesn’t support the biodiversity. Through such initiatives, people become aware of native plants and what is important for a natural habitat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/residents-of-two-south-delhi-localities-on-a-mission-to-bring-back-native-trees-to-parks/story-bglJ0064e8ehf8dEixzF5H.html
18-07-2020||Delhi||Woman, minor girl found dead at home, daughter-in-law found hanging the next day||A 40-year-old woman and her minor daughter were found dead at their house in outer Delhi’s Shahbad Dairy on Wednesday evening, while the woman’s daughter-in-law was found hanging at her parent’s house nearby on Thursday morning, the police said.The series of deaths, all within the span of a few hours, prompted some of their relatives to claim that this was a case of double murder and suicide, but the police neither confirmed nor denied this. Police said they would await the autopsy report to determine how each of them had died.On Wednesday, the 40-year-old woman and her 14-year-old daughter were found dead by her 23-year-old son when he returned home from work around 4.30pm, said Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north). Police did not identify the deceased as they are yet to determine the cause of death and one of the deceased was a minor. Police, however, said the family dealt in scrap and lived in Shahbad Daulatpur village. A relative later told HT, on condition of anonymity, that the son of the 40-year-old woman got married to the 22-year-old woman in April, during the lockdown period. “His mother and wife would frequently quarrel over domestic issues,” the relative alleged, even as the police said that they were still investigating whether there were any relationship issues.The relative said on Wednesday afternoon, the woman’s son returned home from work and found his mother and sister lying dead. “His wife told him that both of them had died of an electric shock from the air-cooler,” the relative claimed.He alerted neighbours and relatives who lived nearby and they, in turn, called the police.“When a few neighbours and family looked around the house, they found a bloodstained steam iron lying near the bodies. There were blunt injuries to the elder woman while the 14-year-old had strangulation marks,” the relative quoted above said, adding that the family suspected that the mother and daughter were killed by the daughter-in-law.But DCP Sharma said there were no visible injuries on the bodies and that it was too early to say how they died. He also did not comment on whether any steam iron was found near the bodies. “We would know how they died only when the autopsy report arrives early next week,” Sharma said.Sharma said inquest proceedings were initiated in the two deaths, but more were to follow over the next few hours.Around 11pm Wednesday, a massive fire engulfed the neighbourhood, gutting around 70 houses. The house where the two bodies were found was also gutted. While the DCP said that this was a mere coincidence, a lot of the evidence at the scene of the deaths was destroyed in the fire.A fire department officer, on condition of anonymity, said it took 32 fire tenders nearly three hours to douse the flames. “A total of 67 jhuggis were gutted in the blaze,” the officer said. He said while the trigger for the fire is yet to be known, it is suspected to have begun at the scrapyard in the area.Meanwhile, after police questioning, the daughter-in-law had returned to her parents’ home nearby, while her husband stayed with his relatives. “Around 9am Thursday, her parents found her hanging from the ceiling fan in her room,” DCP Sharma said.The police have initiated inquest proceedings in her death as well even though no FIR has been registered in the three deaths as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-minor-girl-found-dead-at-home-daughter-in-law-found-hanging-the-next-day/story-G5OBHD92sCSHh90QR7sJ7K.html
18-07-2020||Delhi||BJP protests power bills, AAP says petty politics||The Bharatiya Janata party’s Delhi unit on Friday launched demonstrations in the capital against the Aam Aadmi Party government over “inflated” electricity bills, prompting the ruling party to accuse it of indulging in petty politics.Senior party leaders and MPs protested in different parts of Delhi as part of its ‘Bijli Jan Andolan’. Accusing the state government of colluding with discoms, they said they would not allow electricity connections of consumers to be disconnected over unpaid bills.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and senior party leaders and MPs, including Meenakshi Lekhi, held a demonstration at the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) headquarters. Other leaders held a similar protest in 70 assembly constituencies. Demanding relief for people, the BJP submitted a memorandum to the DERC chairman about the problems faced by people.AAP spokesperson and MLA from Greater Kailash, Saurabh Bharadwaj, said BJP leaders were living up to their reputation of indulging in petty politics when the city has come together to fight Corona under the “Delhi Model”.“As for the issue of electricity bills for commercial establishments in lockdown period, the Delhi government stands with traders and businesses of Delhi. We have already ensured a three-month moratorium on payment of fixed charges without any penalty so that businesses get time to recover from the impact of lockdown. We ensured that the annual review of sanctioned load is deferred and we have also ensured provisional electricity bills that show energy consumption as NIL until manual reading of metering is resumed. What has the BJP done for the traders of Delhi in this lockdown period?” Bharadwaj said.Training his guns at the BJP, which rules all three municipal corporations, Bharadwaj said, “The Delhi government has singularly focused on ensuring adequate health care facilities are in place to fight corona, while BJP refuses to even pay salaries of doctors and nurses in MCD hospitals. This shows how much they care for the people of Delhi.” Targeting chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who had in 2013 criticised the then Congress government over high electricity bills, Gupta said, “He used to protest against the Sheila Dikshit government for high electricity bills. But today when he is in power in Delhi, he is letting the discoms send exorbitantly high bills by imposing surcharges such as power purchase charge, pension surcharge, fixed charge, etc. These are being sent to commercial establishments that were closed during lockdown.”“Even domestic consumers are being sent bills without subsidy,” Gupta said. A few resident and traders’ associations joined the protest.The principal opposition party in the Delhi assembly alleged the AAP-led Delhi government had allowed discoms to send disconnection notices to people.Leader of the opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said AAP had promised it would recover Rs8,000 crore from the power companies and use it for Delhi’s development. “But to date, not even eight paisa have been recovered. Instead, the government and power companies are collectively charging arbitrary electricity bills,” Bidhuri said.Demanding an immediate waiver of fixed charges, Bidhuri said, “Other state governments provided relief to residents in electricity bills but the Kejriwal government is adding to people’s problems. Fixed charges should be waived.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-protests-power-bills-aap-says-petty-politics/story-X3QBkCet7jJPy1Y7zIvj5O.html
18-07-2020||Noida||After Supreme Court’s relief for builders, homebuyers say they want their share||With the Supreme Court’s July 10 order directing the Noida and Greater Noida authorities to reduce interest rates on land dues levied on developers to 8.5% from 20% (or even higher, on case to case basis) will benefit developers, homebuyers are now demanding that they too be given a slice of the pie.On July 10, 2020 the Supreme Court, while hearing petitions in a matter regarding the Amrapali Group, directed the two authorities to only charge an interest rate of 8.5%, as per the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) on land cost, fixed by the reserve bank of India, on land dues of developers.The Amrapali Group, a realty major with projects in Noida and Greater Noida, has failed to finish and deliver around 42,000 units. Its buyers petitioned the apex court in September 2017. In its July 10 order, the apex court clubbed the plea in the Amrapali case as a plea regarding the ACE Group, on high rates of interest in Noida.According to the two authorities, the move would benefit around 500 developers.A homebuyers’ association has now demanded that the financial benefit the developers would receive should be passed onto them as well.“If developers are going to benefit and they need not pay penal interest on financial dues in a group housing project, then we, the homebuyers, should also get a part of that financial gain. The developers have imposed a penalty calculated on 18% interest on buyers if they fail to make payments on time. Thousands of homebuyers have paid the penalty to developers in the past,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension flat owners’ welfare association (NEFOWA), which is also a petitioner in the Amrapali case in the apex court.The Supreme Court has said that developers should immediately start making payments to the authorities as per the new reduced rates, and deposit 25% of total dues in three months. Also, total land dues are to be paid within one year, from the date of the order, if they want to avail benefits of the apex court’s order. If they fail to pay the 25% in three months and total dues in one year from July 10, then they will not be able to avail of the benefits, as per SC order delivered on July 10.“We are planning to approach the Supreme Court for justice and if need be, we will stage protests in Delhi in the future,” Kumar added.The order is effective on dues from January 1, 2010.The order came after Noida-based developer ACE Group, through a plea, demanded that the “unreasonable” interest rate on group housing land should be looked into. ACE Group’s plea was clubbed with the Amrapali case.The two authorities have a policy to charge 11% interest rate from developers, who pay for housing land in instalments. On defaulting on instalments, the authorities impose a penal interest.The interest keeps increasing with each non-payment, depending upon the number of times the payment was not made. The Noida authority has around Rs 25,000 crore land dues to recover while the Greater Noida authority has around Rs 7,000 crore land dues to recover from developers, as per the old interest rates. However, now these amounts will be reduced as the interest is reduced, said officials.“We have formed a committee consisting of additional CEO, financial controller, legal officer and officer on special duty to study the court order and furnish a report so that we can take an appropriate decision. We may also need guidance from the UP government on this,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.The Noida authority’s CEO Ritu Maheshwari said, “We are examining the Supreme court order to take appropriate action. We may adjust the amount of a developer if the dues are reduced due to the new interest.”The developers, meanwhile, said they hoped the move will benefit homebuyers as well.“The two authorities were charging unreasonable interest rates. As a result, housing projects had become economically unviable. This was also affecting the homebuyers’ interests as many developers were not able to deliver flats. Now many developers will be able to exit the ‘defaulter’ list, arrange funds and deliver flats to buyers, thus benefiting them. Buyers should welcome this order because it will bring positivity in the sector and the projects will be delivered,” said Prashant Tiwari, president of the west UP chapter of the confederation of real estate developers association of India (CREDAI), a developers’ body.On homebuyers’ demand, Tiwari said: “Homebuyers will indirectly be benefited from this July 10 order as developers will be able to deliver housing projects with reduced financial dues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-supreme-court-s-relief-for-builders-homebuyers-say-they-want-their-share/story-C1PGR9wAMZm2hkRiHKqgZO.html

According to the police, a passerby spotted the foetus and informed them following which a criminal case has been registered at the Phase 2 police station.According to police officers, on Wednesday evening a passerby called the police helpline (112) informing them about a foetus lying in an empty plot in Bhangel following which a team was rushed to the spot. “The female foetus was sent for DNA sampling. Meanwhile, a case has also been registered at the Phase 2 police station under section 318 (concealment of the birth of an identified newborn child) of the Indian Penal Code,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.The police said they are working on identifying the parents of the foetus. So far, there aren’t any leads, however, locals are being questioned to find out if anyone saw anything suspicious in the area, they added.Experts feel that such cases may be hiding a more serious problem in Gautam Budh Nagar.“The abandonment of a female foetus may suggest that a sex determination centre might be operating in the district. The focus of the authorities should be on identifying such establishments if they are running in the district. There is also a possibility of some negligence on the behalf of primary health service centres or those responsible for prenatal care of pregnant women. If these issues are persistent here then they need to be addressed,” said Satya Prakash, programme manager, FXB India Suraksha, the NGO that manages the district childline.When contacted, a senior health department official denied any knowledge about the incident.On May 17, the body of a newborn baby boy, who was just a few days old, was found floating in Barola drain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/six-month-old-female-foetus-found-in-bhangel/story-xZ4HYKD5rwmuld4M59b5kO.html

18-07-2020||Pune||YCMH counselling centre provides a healing touch to mental health during pandemic||The Covid-19 infection comes packaged with fear and myth that often puts the immediate family, relatives of a positive patient at a high risk of mental stress.The Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH) has established a counselling centre for the relatives of positive patients to help them recover from the fear of the infection. The YCMH counsels 50 to 60 people every day, the centre is run by Real Life Real People – an NGO which has been associated with the hospital for the past 10 years.According to Dr Manjeet Santre, head of the department of psychiatry at YCMH, a lot of people believe in misconceptions.“Covid is equal to death, this is the mentality of most people when their family member is hospitalised. This is a totally wrong assumption of Covid and with our interaction, we try to change this assumption,” Santre said.Santre informed that more than motivational counselling, people are in need of proper guidance.“In the current scenario people don’t need motivation, they require guidance as there are several myths about the Covid disease,” he added.A team of 25 people is tasked with counselling people every day at the hospital.“Most of the people started to fear coronavirus after their family member is admitted to the hospital. Giving them confidence that the patient will recover and nothing will happen is the duty of the counselling centre,” said MA Hussain, administrator of the counselling centre.According to Hussain, the NGO also provides updates about patients’ health over the phone.“Since a large number of people are not allowed at the hospital, the health status of patients is explained to family members over the phone,” added Hussain.One of the important aspects of the counselling centre is safeguarding the mental health of its patients. “First I thought, it will be waste of time to get in contact with the patient’s relative counselling centre but consultation with one of the psychiatrist is keeping me mentally strong and developing confidence about my relative’s recovery,” said Bismil Shaikh whose uncle is getting treated for Covid at YCMH. Real Life Real People also works in other departments at YCMH to help patients who don’t have immediate family to take care of them.BoxWarriors on DutyDr Mahadev Bhotre, Dr Kundlik Amle, Dr Prakash Junkatwar, Dr Ravindra Dhawle, Dr Kisan Gaikwad, Dr Lata Sonkar – Three of them are always present at the patient’s relative counselling centre.

Strict action should be taken against such hospitals.”Ramesh Krishnamurthy Iyer, general secretary, Congress, said, “There are cases reported where the hospitals are overcharging and delaying medical treatment leading to patient’s death. Strict action should be taken against such hospitals.”Iyer also demanded clarity on the billing process and said, “All necessary guidelines including notice boards must be put up on the notice boards in the hospitals to make the patients and their relatives aware of the billing process before they get admitted into any hospital.”“The order must be properly implemented as it would provide relief to the patients,” he said.Mehta has also directed the district administration to commission the facility of oxygen tanks wherein industrial oxygen cylinders can be converted into oxygen cylinders for medical usage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/principal-secretary-orders-audit-of-covid-19-treatment-charges-at-pune-hospitals/story-xXR6nYhL2zI3C185VkkdJJ.html

The suspects, identified as Rajiv Kumar, 30, a resident of Kaithal in Haryana, and Ravi Kumar, 25, a native of Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, were nabbed from the dumping ground in Industrial Area, Phase 8-B, on Thursday evening.Police have recovered a country made .32-bore revolver, along with three live cartridges, from their possession.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Avtar Singh, in-charge of the Industrial Area Police Post, said, “The duo was arrested following a tip-off. During preliminary investigation, it was established that Rajiv has a criminal background.”He said Rajiv was facing nine cases, including two of murder, at various police stations of Haryana. He was also involved in kidnapping and extorting Rs 10 lakh from a doctor in Kaithal in the past. The suspects were produced in a local court, which sent them to two-day police remand.Phase 1 station house officer (SHO) inspector Manphul Singh said the duo will be interrogated for more details.A case under Sections 393 (attempt to commit robbery) and 401 (punishment for belonging to gang of thieves) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25-54-59 of the Arms Act was registered at the Phase 1 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/history-sheeter-aide-nabbed-with-arms-in-mohali/story-5jXZC6LHBtitZjDkMLvoBP.html
18-07-2020||Lifestyle||Is that sanitiser bottle safe for you to carry?||Sanitiser is a necessity today. But, how safe is it to have a sanitiser in say a car that’s parked in a high temperature zone or in a luggage that will be checked in during air travel? Isn’t the alcohol content in sanitisers high enough to be a cause of accidents such as fire hazards? So then, can that little bottle of liquid, which you believe is potent to save you from coronavirus, can be dangerous to carry? “It’s a recent habit to hoard sanitisers because of the on-going pandemic. I have bought four sanitisers and put them in various places, among which one is my car. The initial thought behind that was the convenience to use it as soon as I enter the car. However, recently when I had parked my car under the sun to go for grocery shopping, I came back and upon touching the sanitiser bottle realised that it was super hot! It then struck me that had I left it in for a few more minutes under the scorching sun, it might have even inflated or bursted... after all there’s alcohol in it,” says Vaishwi Khanna, a resident of DLF Phase 2, Gurugram.Confirming that it isn’t a safe practice to keep sanitisers in car, Joginder Singh, professor at a Haryana-based engineering college, Head Research and Development Gateway Institute of Engineering and Technology says, “Sanitising chemicals consist of 70% isopropyl alcohol. The temperature needed to reach the flash point of this chemical (the point at which a substance ignites) is 21 degree Celsius. When the car is locked, with the bottle kept inside it for long, the temperature of the car increases and the chemical in the sanitiser forms vapour upon coming in contact with heat. In such a situation if anyone happens to light a cigarette, it can lead to an explosion! It’s therefore advisable to refrain from keeping sanitisers in cars.The safety of carrying sanitisers on aircraft is also a concern. “According to the rules, passengers can carry only 100 ml sanitiser on-board. They are allowed to use it only on their skin, and not on any surface inside the aircraft. The quantity of the sanitisers is limited because of security reasons, as they can lead to a fire hazard because of the alcohol content in them,” informs Pretty Loryn, a flight attendant with a private airline. All said and agreed, but in times like these when sanitiser is a necessity, is there an alternative to alcohol-based sanitisers that can be kept in cars without inviting any danger? Indeed there is. Vidit Arora, who is working with a company that is manufacturing non-alcoholic virus disinfectant spray, says, “We have provided an Antivirus Disinfectant Spray to a cab aggregator. This spray creates an ultra thin layer over the surface on which it is used, and it stays there for an entire day thereby helping to avoid any further settlement of virus. At present, it’s being used in cabs to sanitise the seats and surfaces between taking in passengers. This spray can be used for disinfecting multiple surfaces, and can also be used on the skin as an alternative to alcohol based sanitisers. In fact, it’s also pet-friendly! Since it’s alcohol-free, so there’s no harm to store it in the car.” Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/is-that-sanitiser-bottle-safe-for-you-to-carry/story-1prYSDs7mmZsqxRxNFkXZP.html

Of the 808 children admitted to the hospital till date, 798 have been cured and discharged, and 10 are undergoing treatment.The hospital has made two wards for children — one for infants and another for children aged 1-12 years.“We allow breastfeeding mothers to stay with children at the ward as along with medicines, breast milk plays a very important role in helping the baby develop immunity,” said Deepali Ambike, head of paediatrics department, YCMH.“Providing quick medical diagnosis and treatment is one of the reasons we have been successful in curing children,” said Dr Pavan Salve, additional health and medical officer, PCMC.The mother of a recovered 2-year-old child said, “Staying in the ward with my baby helped me to remain calm and observe the treatment. In the beginning I was worried, but was sure that my baby will recover.” The Pimpri resident said that her child contracted the virus from his aunt who was tested Covid-19 positive. Later, the mother also underwent test and was declared negative. The recovery period for the child was 10 days.PCMC tweeted: “Pimpri-Chinchwad is the only city in the state with a ‘zero percent’ infant mortality rate among the COVID19 affected cities. Expert doctors and excellent healthcare facilities have made it possible to successfully treat COVID19 positive children admitted since April 2020.”The mortality rate recorded at YCMH is 1.42 per cent as compared to Pune (3.52%) and Maharashtra (3.96%).As of Friday, PCMC reported a total 9,790 Covid positive cases, 162 deaths and 5,900 patients have been cured.Saving young livesIn Pune: 4 deaths recorded in age group 0-20 yearsIn Maharashtra: 67 deaths recorded in age group 0-20Numbers of cured children (serious cases)April: 13May: 17June: 102July: 4310 patients undergoing treatment at YCMH||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ycmh-child-care-corona-ward-cures-175-serious-cases/story-JNElRaMxS6aJFwHbJjntKI.html
18-07-2020||World||World ‘at the breaking point’ due to inequalities, says UN chief||Saying “we are at the breaking point,” the U.N. secretary-general made a sweeping call Saturday to end the global inequalities that sparked this year’s massive anti-racism protests and have been further exposed by the coronavirus pandemic.“Covid-19 has been likened to an X-ray, revealing fractures in the fragile skeleton of the societies we have built,” Antonio Guterres said as he delivered the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture.“It is exposing fallacies and falsehoods everywhere: The lie that free markets can deliver health care for all, the fiction that unpaid care work is not work, the delusion that we live in a post-racist world, the myth that we are all in the same boat.”He said developed countries are strongly invested in their own survival and have “failed to deliver the support needed to help the developing world through these dangerous times.”The U.N. chief’s address marked what would have been the birthday of former South African president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mandela.South Africa, the world’s most unequal country a quarter-century after the end of the racist system of apartheid, is quickly becoming one of the world’s hardest-hit nations in the pandemic and now makes up roughly half of Africa’s confirmed coronavirus cases. Already its public hospitals are nearly overwhelmed.The speech by the U.N. chief took aim at the vast inequality of wealth — “The 26 richest people in the world hold as much wealth as half the global population,” Guterres said — and other inequalities involving race, gender, class and place of birth.These, he said, are seen in the world’s fragmented response to the pandemic as governments, businesses and even individuals are accused of hoarding badly needed testing, medical and other supplies for themselves.The legacy of colonialism still reverberates, Guterres added, and it shows in global power relations.Developing countries, and especially African nations, are under-represented at the levels of power including at financial institutions like the World Bank and political ones like the U.N. Security Council, whose five most powerful members — the U.S., Britain, France, Russia and China — date from the 1940s when the world body was created.“Inequality starts at the top: in global institutions. Addressing inequality must start by reforming them,” Guterres said, offering some solutions.A new generation of social protection is needed, including universal health coverage and perhaps maybe even a universal basic income he said, adding “individuals and corporations must pay their fair share.”Education spending in low and middle-income countries should more than double by 2030 to $3 trillion a year, he said. And in the face of enormous shifts due to climate change, governments should tax carbon instead of people.Answering questions after his speech, Guterres called for “massive support” for the developing world including debt write-offs. He said the suspension of debt payments until the end of this year, which was agreed upon by the G-20, the world’s 20 major economic powers, “is clearly not enough.”And he noted, without naming names, that “leadership and power are not always aligned.”“Let’s face facts,” Guterres said in his address. “The global political and economic system is not delivering on critical global public goods: public health, climate action, sustainable development, peace.”The U.N. chief called for a new model of global governance with inclusive and equal participation.“We see the beginnings of a new movement,” he said, adding it’s time to right the wrongs of the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-at-the-breaking-point-due-to-inequalities-says-un-chief/story-J39RgXi0cbsKCO7gUXaCxJ.html
18-07-2020||World||Russia is trying to beat the west to a Covid-19 vaccine||A top Russian official said his country could roll out a vaccine against Covid-19 as soon as September, while denying accusations that hackers working for the country’s intelligence agency tried to steal sensitive data from rival researchers in the U.K., U.S. and Canada.“Russia may be one of the first to produce a vaccine against the backdrop of the billions that are being invested in the U.S. and all the pharma companies working on it,” said Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of the government-backed Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is financing one of the the country’s efforts to devise a vaccine. “It’s a little bit of a shocking story.”President Vladimir Putin has made finding a vaccine a top priority. Russia has recorded more than 750,000 Covid-19 cases, making it the fourth most-affected country in the world. In Russia’s race to be the first to find a vaccine against Covid-19, it’s taking an approach that would be shunned in other countries, claiming it will know in just three months of trials whether its leading candidate works. If Russia proclaims success in the hunt for a vaccine before other candidates, it could create a world of duelling vaccines and geopolitical battles over who gets supplies. Dmitriev’s comments came after the U.K., U.S. and Canada said hackers working with the group APT29, part of Russian military intelligence, had used malware to try to seize vaccine research. Dmitriev said Russia had no need to steal information from rival vaccine developers because it had already signed a deal with AstraZeneca Plc to manufacture the University of Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine at R-Pharm, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Russia. He said AstraZeneca is transferring the entire technological process and all ingredients for the full reproduction of the vaccine in Russia.“Everything that is needed to produce the British vaccine has already been transferred to R-Pharm,” he said. “AstraZeneca has already signed commitments to transfer all production of the British vaccine to R-Pharm.’AstraZeneca didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. It isn’t clear whether AstraZeneca would transfer all the technology needed for Russia to produce the vaccine or if the agreement involves the British pharma giant sending the vaccine seed stock to manufacturers needed to begin production.Some Western experts remain skeptical that Russia has the expertise to produce its own vaccine by September. “We don’t think that’s realistic,” said Peter Shapiro, a pharmaceutical analyst at the research firm GlobalData, cautioning that Russia, like other countries, could approve the vaccine for political reasons. “The regulatory hurdles in Russia are low.”Nor is it likely that such a vaccine, if indeed approved in Russia, would find favor in the West, Shaprio said. “We don’t see a history of innovative vaccines being developed in Russia that win approval” in major markets like the U.S., Japan and Western Europe, he said. “Russia is not a major producer of export quality drugs or biologics.”Global BattleThe U.S., Western Europe and China have all set up research programs and supply chains for Covid-19 vaccine production. While the negotiations with AstraZeneca offer Russia the chance for doses of the Oxford vaccine if it proves successful, the global battle to secure supplies could leave Russia struggling to access other potentially successful vaccines, increasing pressure to advance its own program.Dmitriev said he’s so confident in Russia’s leading vaccine candidate that he’s taken it himself and had his whole family vaccinated, including his parents,  who are in their seventies. The vaccine, financed by RDIF and developed by the state-backed Gamaleya Institute in Moscow, has completed a phase 1 trial in 50 people, all of whom are members of the Russian military. The institute hasn’t published results.The vaccine is one of 26 experimental shots in development in Russia, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said on July 15.  Gamaleya’s candidate is a viral vector vaccine based on a human adenovirus — a common cold virus — fused with the spike protein of SARS CoV-2 to stimulate an immune response. It is similar to a vaccine China’s CanSino Biologics intends to move into trials in Canada, one of the countries targeted by Russian hackers. Initial results from CanSino’s trial showed the vaccine had a diminished effect in some people who had a pre-existing immunity to the adenovirus. Dmitriev said researchers in Russia are testing two different types of adenovirus vectors in order to reduce the chances of pre-existing immunity reducing the vaccine’s effectiveness. That vaccine will start phase 3 trials in thousands of people on Aug. 3 in Russia as well as in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Dmitriev said. Russia could make 30 million doses domestically in 2020, and 170 million abroad, with five countries expressing interest in producing the vaccine and others willing to produce it, he said.Besides manufacturing vaccines for AstraZeneca, R-Pharm will make the country’s own vaccine at its production sites in Russia. Alium Pharmaceutical Holding, based in Moscow and owned by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s Sistema PJFSC, has also agreed to manufacture doses of Russia’s leading vaccine candidate, Dmitriev said.Unusual MoveRussia’s rapid approach to vaccine development differs from Western Europe and the U.S., where researchers typically run phase 3 trials for months to show safety and effectiveness. In another unusual move, Dmitriev said the vaccine has been given to “a significant” number of volunteers, both as part of and outside the formal trial. The director of the Gamaleya Institute said he and some of his staff tried the vaccine on themselves before the official trials started, RIA Novosti reported in May. Analysts have questioned Russia’s rushed unorthodox approach.“The current situation with the vaccine looks like a race and sufficient clinic testing hasn’t been done,” said Sergey Shulyak, chief executive officer at Moscow-based consulting company DSM Group.Russia, however, does have a track record developing vaccines using adenoviruses. It devised an Ebola vaccine using similar technology which is licensed in Russia for emergency use and which is expected to be deployes soon in the Congo. And Russia has been increasingly active in promoting its vaccine-making expertise in Africa. The Russian government together with United Company RUSAL opened the Russian-Guinean Research Center for Epidemiology and Prevention of Infectious Diseases in 2014 in Guinea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-is-trying-to-beat-the-west-to-a-covid-19-vaccine/story-9FlO5eWXpZl3HJJQxAjfxJ.html
18-07-2020||World||Breathtaking coronavirus numbers show normal life still far away||South Africa was poised Saturday to join the top five countries most affected by the coronavirus pandemic, while breathtaking infection numbers around the world were a reminder that a return to normal life is still far from sight.The country’s 337,000 cases make up roughly half of all confirmed infections on the African continent and its struggles are a sign of trouble to come for nations with fewer health care resources. South Africa was on track to join the U.S., Brazil, India and Russia as current trends show it will surpass Peru.“The simple fact is that many South Africans are sitting ducks because they cannot comply with World Health Organization protocols on improved hygiene and social distancing,” the foundation of former South African archbishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu and his wife, Leah, warned in a statement.The development comes a day after the World Health Organization reported a single-day record of new infections at over 237,000. Daily death tolls have been reaching new highs in several U.S. states and India’s infections are over 1 million. Experts believe the true numbers around the world are higher because of testing shortages and data collection issues in some nations.The world on Saturday marked Mandela Day, remembering Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first Black president — another Nobel Peace Prize winner — and his legacy of fighting inequality. The country, however, remains the world’s most unequal, and health officials have warned that the pandemic will lay that bare.South Africa’s new coronavirus epicenter, Gauteng province, hosts the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria and one-quarter of the country’s population, with many poor people living in crowded conditions in the middle of a frosty Southern Hemisphere winter.Mandela’s message is “more relevant than ever,” WHO Africa chief Matshidiso Moeti said, calling for equitable access to care.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who delivered the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, said “Covid-19 has been likened to an X-ray, revealing fractures in the fragile skeleton of the societies we have built,” adding that developed countries have “failed to deliver the support needed to help the developing world through these dangerous times.”Confirmed virus cases worldwide have topped 14.1 million and deaths are nearing 600,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Infections are soaring in U.S. states like Florida, Texas, Arizona, fueled by the haphazard lifting of coronavirus lockdowns and the resistance of some Americans to wearing masks.In the U.S., teams of military medics have been deployed in Texas and California to help hospitals deluged by patients. The two most populous states each reported roughly 10,000 new cases a day and some of their highest death counts. The surge of infections means that millions of American children are unlikely to return to classrooms full time in the fall.In India, a surge of 34,884 new cases was reported as local governments continue to re-impose focused lockdowns in several parts of the country.In Iran, the president made the startling announcement that as many as 25 million Iranians could have been infected, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Hassan Rouhani cited a new Health Ministry study that has not been made public. Iran has the Middle East’s worst outbreak with more than 270,000 confirmed cases.In Bangladesh, confirmed cases surpassed 200,000 but experts say the number is much higher as the country lacks adequate labs for testing. Most people in rural areas have stopped wearing masks and are thronging shopping centers ahead of the Islamic festival Eid al-Adha this month.Scientists, meanwhile, poured cold water on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s hope that the country may return to normal by Christmas.A world where people can “go to work normally, travel on the buses and trains, go on holiday without restrictions, meet friends, shake hands, hug each other and so on -- that’s a long way off, unfortunately,” without a vaccine, said epidemiologist John Edmunds, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.Britain has registered more than 45,300 Covid-19 deaths, the highest toll in Europe. But the government said it will halt issuing daily updates to that toll while authorities investigate the way the statistics are compiled.Academics said England’s tally includes anyone who has tested positive for Covid-19 and later died, meaning some may have died of other causes. Other areas in the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — all have cutoff dates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/breathtaking-coronavirus-numbers-show-normal-life-still-far-away/story-rCqzRnyY2LbZ2io6P54v0I.html
18-07-2020||World||Coronavirus patients swamp emergency rooms in some US states||A fast-rising rising tide of new coronavirus cases is flooding emergency rooms in parts of the United States, with some patients moved into hallways and nurses working extra shifts to keep up with the surge.Patients struggling to breathe are being placed on ventilators in emergency wards since intensive care units are full, officials say, and the near-constant care they require is overtaxing workers who also are treating more typical ER cases like chest pains, infections, and fractures.In Texas, Dr. Alison Haddock of the Baylor College of Medicine said the current situation is worse than after Hurricane Harvey, which swamped Houston with floodwaters in 2017. The state reported a new daily record for virus deaths Friday and more than 10,000 confirmed cases for the fourth consecutive day.“I’ve never seen anything like this COVID surge,” said Haddock, who has worked in emergency rooms since 2007. “We’re doing our best, but we’re not an ICU.”Patients are waiting “hours and hours” to get admitted, she said, and the least sick people are lying in beds in halls to make room for most seriously ill.Around Seattle, which was the nation’s first hot spot for the virus that causes Covid-19, a new wave of patients is showing up at emergency departments, said nurse Mike Hastings.“What’s really frustrating from my side of it is when a patient comes into the emergency department, and is not really having symptoms of COVID, but they feel like they need that testing,” said Hastings, who works at an area hospital and is president of the Emergency Nurses Association. “Sometimes we’re not able to test them because we don’t have enough test supplies, so we’re only testing a certain set of patients.”Confirmed coronavirus cases around the world have surpassed 14 million, and deaths neared 600,000, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. On Friday, the World Health Organization reported a single-day record of new infections at over 237,000. The true toll of the pandemic is thought to be higher, in part because of shortages in testing and shortcomings in data collection.The United States, Brazil and India top the list of cases. South Africa — with 337,000 cases, roughly half of all confirmed infections in Africa — was poised to join the top five countries most affected by the pandemic.In the United States, where infections are soaring in many Sunbelt states, Megan Jehn, associate professor of epidemiology at Arizona State Universtiy in Tempe, said it’s important to monitor emergency room visits since increases there can signal that the virus is spreading more rapidly.But it’s difficult to get a complete picture of how emergency rooms are faring in many places. In Arizona, one of the few states that reports data on visits to the emergency room by people with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 symptoms, numbers started to spike in early June and peaked earlier this month. More than 2,000 people went to an ER with coronavirus symptoms on a single day, July 7.Dr. Robert Hancock, who works at multiple hospitals in Texas and Oklahoma and serves as president of the Texas College of Emergency Physicians, said some Texas emergency rooms are facing backups of patients awaiting ICU beds. And many of them are on ventilators, meaning they require more attention than other patients.“Unfortunately, because of the increased demand for personnel, there typically isn’t anybody free to come down to the ER to help a lot of times from a nursing standpoint,” he said.Burnout could await these health workers, as it did some in New York City, when it was the epicenter of the nation’s outbreak in the spring.Emergency rooms doctors and nurses were caught off guard by the relentless stream of severely sick patients during shifts that often lasted 12 hours, said Dr. Bernard P. Chang of New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center.“You were on high alert the whole shift,” Chang said. “It was a brutal, sustained battle.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-patients-swamp-emergency-rooms-in-some-us-states/story-1vizOca8koIHLGwZQqj45O.html
18-07-2020||World||‘People think Covid-19 is political scheme or conspiracy theory’: Doctor who survived virus bewildered by public disregard||Dr. Michael Saag spends much of his time treating patients fighting for their lives and working with colleagues who are overwhelmed and exhausted by the relentless battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.But he enters a different world when he walks out the door of his Alabama clinic: one where many don’t wear masks, keep their distance from others or even seem aware of the intense struggle being waged against a virus that has cost about 140,000 lives nationwide and made so many — including the doctor — seriously ill.The disconnect is devastating.“It’s a mixture of emotions, from anger to being demoralized to bewilderment to frustration,” Saag said.Confirmed cases of Covid-19 have increased an average of more than 1,500 a day over the past week in Alabama, bringing the total to more than 62,100 since the pandemic began in March. At least 1,230 people have died and health officials say fewer than 15% of the state’s intensive care beds are available for new patients. Some hospitals are completely out of room.It’s not just an Alabama problem. About 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Birmingham, Dr. Chad Dowell warns that his hospital in tiny Indianola, Mississippi, is filling up and so are others, making it difficult to locate beds for the sickest patients even as people debate on social media whether the pandemic is real.Inside the hospital at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, doctors and nurses in protective gear rush from one emergency to another. They struggle to comfort heartbroken visitors forced to say goodbye to dying relatives long distance via cellphone, Saag said, all while coping with the stress of whether they’ll be infected next.The sharp increase in confirmed virus cases in Alabama has coincided with the reopening of restaurants, bars, theaters, gyms, sports leagues and churches that were all closed down when the virus first hit. Although most have opened at a diminished capacity and with restrictions in place, many patrons haven’t been following recommended precautions.In metro Birmingham, where Saag lives, it has been common to see fewer than half the people inside stores wearing masks. The doctor said he got particularly dispirited recently after stopping by a restaurant on the way home from work to pick up a takeout order of sushi. There were as many as 60 people inside, he said.“Myself and one other person were the only two people wearing masks. And everybody else, not only were they not wearing masks, they were congregating together,” he said. “And they look at me like I’m some sort of pariah wearing a mask.”In response, Gov. Kay Ivey this week ordered all Alabama residents 6 and older to wear masks when in public and within 6 feet (2 meters) of someone who is not a relative. Cast against a pandemic that has become increasingly political, the move drew both praise as a potentially life-saving step and harsh criticism from those who called it an unnecessary affront to freedom.Saag said he hopes the order helps, but it all depends on compliance. Ivey herself said the rule will be hard to enforce, and some police and sheriff’s offices have said they won’t even try.During the initial outbreak, doctors and nurses were hailed as heroes in the fight against Covid-19. Some say they now feel more like cannon fodder in a war that has become increasingly divisive.“People continue to regard the virus as a political scheme or conspiracy theory. People continue to ignore recommended guidelines on how to help slow the virus’ spread. People continue to complain about wearing a mask. We’ve got to do better as a community,” Dowell, the Mississippi doctor, wrote in a Facebook message released by South Sunflower County hospital.For Saag, the fight is personal. In early March, both he and his adult son came down with the virus after a trip to Manhattan when the epidemic was raging there. First came a cough, followed by fever, a headache, body aches and what Saag called “fuzzy thinking,” or an inability to concentrate.“The mornings I’d feel fine, thought I was done with it. And then every night it would come right back as if it was just starting all over again,” he said. “The hardest part of the night was that feeling of shortness of breath and not knowing if it’s going to get worse.”During eight suffocating nights, Saag wasn’t sure whether he’d survive without a ventilator. It never came to that. He is now fully recovered and feels closer than ever to the people he treats.“When I talk to a patient and I say, ‘Hey, I’ve had it too,’ it’s like we’re connected in a way that I really, honestly haven’t felt with patients ever before — and I’ve been doing this 40 years,” Saag said.Outside the examination room, Saag has participated in news conferences and done media interviews to encourage basic public health practices, but he knows many people just aren’t listening.He said it is disheartening to see a widespread disregard for safety measures and worries about Alabama’s future at a time when the virus is posing more of a threat than ever.“I’m just thinking, `Oh, my goodness. We’re going to be in trouble very soon,’” Saag said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-think-covid-19-is-political-scheme-or-conspiracy-theory-doctor-who-survived-virus-bewildered-by-public-disregard/story-Nv6CyUSuFIMrYu5pRmN9aO.html
18-07-2020||World||Back to the wall, Nepal PM Oli goes for broke. Now wants a party convention||A four-hour-long meeting of the Nepal Communist Party secretariat ended inconclusively on Saturday evening after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli tried to block attempts to get him to step down, demanding that NCP convene a party convention to decide the next steps for the ruling NCP.Saturday’s marathon meeting came against the backdrop of PM Oli’s rivals in the party stepping up pressure on the prime minister to quit the himalayan nation’s top executive post. The meeting was wrapped up late on Saturday evening after PM Oli abruptly called it a day and went to meet President Bidhya Devi Bhandari.Pushpa Kumar Dahal, better known by nom de guerre Prachanda, left the meeting soon after and also headed to meet President Bhandari at her official residence Shital Niwas, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.An NCP leader said PM Oli came up with a counter-offer to sabotage the push for an early decision on the prime minister’s future. PM Oli suggested that this decision should be left to a convention of party workers that could be convened later this year.“This would be a non-starter,” the NCP leader said.Also Read: Nepal PM Oli changes tack after pressure to quit, asks who will replace meThe ruling NCP was formally set up in February 2018 with the merger of the CPN (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and CPN (Maoist Centre) that had contested the election in an alliance and received overwhelming support from the people.“But the assimilation of the cadre of the two parties that merged in 2018 never took place on the ground,” he said, pointing that PM Oli’s new tactic appeared to be designed to keep the leadership issue hanging in balance for months.The only thing that the nine-member NCP secretariat appeared to have agreed on is that the next steps for the party and government’s leadership should be decided on the basis of consensus.The senior leaders agreed to resolve the issues through consensus, party spokesperson Narayankaji Shrestha told media persons after the meeting.A tweet by PM Oli’s press adviser Surya Thapa did not claim that there was any consensus or agreement at the meeting either.Saturday’s NCP secretariat meeting - a smaller body than the 44-member standing committee that is scheduled to meet on Sunday - was expected to arrive at a decision on PM Oli’s future that could be put before the standing committee. This plan could have been upended by PM Oli with his push for a party convention.There have already been demands that the party convene the meeting of a 445-member central committee, an exercise that would also take some time to organise.PM Oli has been able to hold on to the prime minister’s chair - he is also the co-chairman of the party - with some intervention from China that made it clear that it did not want the merged communist party to split. PM Oli leveraged Beijing’s interest in a united communist party in Nepal to his advantage, putting out a word that the party would fall apart if he is forced to step down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/back-to-the-wall-nepal-pm-oli-goes-for-broke-now-wants-a-party-convention/story-ZLzzxbNXk45pGXPwVHrYgJ.html

It’s trying to dominate world communications networks, including those right here in places like Iowa.”The secretary of state was referring to the Chinese telecommunications firms Huawei and ZTE that have designated national security threats by the US and telecom companies are barred from receiving federal subsidies for buying their equipment, popular in rural America including Iowa.The Trump administration has also pushed other countries to bar these Chinese companies. And it welcomed this week the decision of the United Kingdom to bar Huawei from participating in the roll out of the 5G network.India, which banned 56 Chinese apps in retaliation for the Galwan clashes, could also bar Huawei from its 5G network, according to reports.The United States has escalated attacks on China in recent weeks, followed by punitive measures in many instances, over an entire range of issues — including the new national security law for Hong Kong, mistreatment of Uighur muslims.President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this week a legislations that empowers his administration to announce sanctions against China for the Hong Kong security law. He also signed an executive order the same day that preferential treatment for Hong Kong, which, though an earlier directive, will be denied high-tech exports.The administration is also reported to be considering visa bans on officials of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and their relatives, and throw out those already in the US. The ban could extend to officials of the People’s Liberation Army, according t reports. Or could be narrowed and just pick the 25 member so the politburo.The Trump administration announced sanctions against several Chinese officials last week for human rights abuses against Uighur muslims, including a member of the CCP — Chen Quanguo, who is a member of China’s 25-member ruling politburo and party secretary of the Xinjiang region.“A few weeks back I read a report about the Chinese Communist Party forcing mass abortions and sterilization on Chinese Muslims in Western China.,” Pompeo said Friday about the mistreatment of Uighurs. “These are some of the most gross human rights violations we have seen and I’ve referred to it as the stain of the century.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-crushing-hong-kong-wants-to-control-global-communications-says-us/story-nCBUEjuyU9NgfXSjLR1HmL.html
18-07-2020||World||UN chief to world leaders: ‘Inequality starts at the top’||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday accused world powers of ignoring inequality in global institutions, but said the coronavirus pandemic has created a “generational opportunity” to build a more equal, sustainable world.Delivering the annual lecture for the Nelson Mandela Foundation via internet, Guterres pushed for a so-called New Global Deal to ensure power, wealth and opportunity are shared more broadly and fairly at the international level.“The nations that came out on top more than seven decades ago have refused to contemplate the reforms needed to change power relations in international institutions,” Guterres said. “The composition and voting rights in the United Nations Security Council and the boards of the Bretton Woods system are a case in point.”“Inequality starts at the top: in global institutions. Addressing inequality must start by reforming them,” he added. The Bretton Woods system includes the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.  He said the pandemic has revealed, like an x-ray, “fractures in the fragile skeleton of the societies we have built.” “It is exposing fallacies and falsehoods everywhere: the lie that free markets can deliver healthcare for all; the fiction that unpaid care work is not work; the delusion that we live in a post-racist world; the myth that we are all in the same boat,” said Guterres during the virtual lecture. “Because while we are all floating on the same sea, it’s clear that some are in superyachts while others are clinging to the floating debris,” said Guterres, a former Socialist prime minister of Portugal.  The coronavirus has infected more than 14 million people and there have been nearly 600,000 known deaths worldwide, according to a Reuters tally. The UN has appealed for $10.3 billion to help poor states, but has received only $1.7 billion. Guterres said rich countries have “failed to deliver the support needed to help the developing world” and that the pandemic has “brought home the tragic disconnect between self-interest and the common interest; and the huge gaps in governance structures and ethical frameworks.”He said a changing world needs new social protection policies with safety nets including universal health coverage and the possibility of a universal basic income.Guterres concluded: “Now is the time for global leaders to decide: Will we succumb to chaos, division and inequality? Or will we right the wrongs of the past and move forward together, for the good of all?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-to-world-leaders-inequality-starts-at-the-top/story-yTgDmsbd06SlpcVoEcsn6O.html
18-07-2020||World||Nepal’s communist party’s key meeting ends with no breakthrough to end Oli-Prachanda infighting||Nepal’s ruling communist party’s top decision-making body on Saturday failed to achieve a breakthrough to end the tussle for power between Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and former premier Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ despite four hours of marathon discussions. No conclusion was reached during the meeting of the Nepal Communist Party’s (NCP) nine-member Central Secretariat though the party leaders discussed agenda to be presented during Sunday’s Standing Committee meeting, according to senior party leader Ganesh Shah. During the meeting, senior leaders of the party agreed to resolve the issues through consensus, party spokesperson Narayankaji Shrestha told media persons after the meeting. The NCP called a secretariat meeting after the two top leaders agreed to call a conclave of the highest body of the party ahead of the 45-member Standing Committee meeting on Sunday in a bid to strike a power-sharing deal by sorting out their differences. The Standing Committee meeting of the party is scheduled to take place at 3 pm on Sunday. The Standing Committee meeting was postponed until Sunday to give more time to Oli and the rival faction led by Prachanda, the executive chairman of the NCP to have more talks to end the intra-party infighting. During previous meetings, Oli has refused to resign or give up his position as chairman of the NCP as demanded by the faction led by Prachanda. Sunday’s Standing Committee meeting is expected to fix the date for the CWC meeting, which will ultimately decide the future of Prime Minister Oli, Ganesh Shah, a Standing Committee member, said. Oli and Prachanda have held at least eight meetings in recent weeks to sort out the differences between them. But, as the Prime Minister did not accept the condition of a one-man-one-post, the talks failed, party sources said. Top NCP leaders, including ‘Prachanda’, have been demanding Prime Minister Oli’s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate.” They are also against Oli’s autocratic style of functioning. The differences grew further after Oli alleged that some of the ruling party leaders are aligning with the southern neighbour to remove him from power after his government issued a new political map incorporating three Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura. The differences between the two factions of the NCP, one led by Oli and the other led by Prachanda on the issue of power-sharing, intensified after the prime minister unilaterally decided to prorogue the budget session of Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-communist-party-s-key-meeting-ends-with-no-breakthrough-to-end-oli-prachanda-infighting/story-qvOEvIpVq18CeupThwPkVO.html

The monument was cordoned off with signs reading: “No entry without permission. Maintenance in progress.”Public opposition to Prayuth’s rule has been growing in recent months.Since last year’s election, a court has dissolved the second-largest opposition party, giving Prayuth’s ruling coalition firmer control in parliament.Prayuth also saw several cabinet members resign https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-thailand-economy/thai-finance-minister-resigns-amid-economic-team-shake-up-idUKKCN24H0J9 on Thursday over internal disputes.Prayuth’s Palang Pracharat Party campaigned on a vision of traditional Thai culture and loyalty to King Maha Vajiralongkorn.Thailand is officially a constitutional monarchy, but insulting the king is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, and many conservatives view the monarchy as sacrosanct.Some signs at Saturday’s protest made reference to the monarchy, including one banner reading “The People’s Party isn’t Dead” - a reference to the political party whose revolution ended absolute royal rule in 1932.Democracy Monument is the most prominent memorial to that revolution, but others have been removed or renamed since King Vajiralongkorn assumed the throne after the 2016 death of his father, who had reigned for 70 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-protesters-take-to-streets-in-bangkok-demand-thai-govt-s-resignation/story-1y0w4YQf8qEj4JK9qE951J.html
18-07-2020||World||‘I don’t agree’: Trump says he won’t order Americans to wear masks||President Donald Trump has said he would not order Americans to wear masks to contain the spread of the coronavirus, saying people should have a “certain freedom.” His comments came after Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, appealed to state and local leaders to be “as forceful as possible” in getting people to wear masks in public places.In a ‘Fox News Sunday’ interview, Trump said, “I don’t agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask, everything disappears.” Commenting on the initial comments from top health officials, Trump said: “Hey, Dr Fauci said don’t wear a mask. Our Surgeon General – terrific guy – said don’t wear a mask. Everybody who is saying don’t wear a mask – all of sudden everybody’s got to wear a mask, and as you know masks cause problems, too.” Trump, who has been seen wearing a face mask only once, said, I’m a believer in masks. I think masks are good.” But Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said social distancing, an important factor in blunting the spread of the coronavirus, can be difficult with more people going out.“When you’re living your life and trying to open up the country, you are going to come into contact with people. And for that reason, we know that masks are really important, and we should be using them everywhere,” he said during a US Chamber of Commerce virtual event.Americans are actually slowing down the re-opening the country by not wearing a mask, CNN quoted Fauci as saying during a US Chamber of Commerce event.“If we could get more people to understand that, hopefully we’ll get more people who’d be willing to wear masks,” he said.He said he would “urge the leaders -- the local political and other leaders -- in states and cities and towns to be as forceful as possible in getting your citizenry to wear masks.” The country needs to concentrate on the problems at hand and not worry about a second wave, he said.“When you’re having up to 70,000 new infections ... that’s something you need to focus on right now, as opposed to looking at what’s going to happen in September or October,” he said.There were 77,255 new cases reported on Thursday, crossing a previous record set two days ago, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-don-t-agree-trump-says-he-won-t-order-americans-to-wear-masks/story-j5u9KukMvJ1mBLkMWIi3sM.html

Excavated in 1836 for the first time, archaeologists have dug out hundreds of relics made of clay, stucco, and terracotta in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unislamic-buddha-statue-discovered-in-pakistan-s-mardan-vandalised-by-workers/story-ZEW9aiZlFZg2anU2K59PXJ.html

More than 20,000 people had been evacuated and 1,031 homes destroyed.Three landslides in Dunhao town in a mountainous part of Chongqing left six dead, the city’s Emergency Management Bureau said. The bodies had been found by Friday evening after more than 200 people were dispatched for a search and rescue operation. Rainfall in the town of Dunhao totaled 39 centimeters (15 inches), the bureau said.Three more people died in neighboring Hubei province, the emergency management department said in a social media post.State broadcaster CCTV showed people cleaning up still wet, muddy streets and shops in the city of Enshi after severe flooding Friday. Rescue workers used inflatable rafts to rescue more than 1,900 people trapped in their homes and other buildings.Downriver, firefighters and others finished filling in a 188-meter (620-foot) break in a dike on Poyang Lake, China’s largest freshwater lake, Xinhua said.The dike gave way nine days ago, flooding 15 villages and agricultural fields in Jiangxi province, the news agency said. More than 14,000 people were evacuated.The incoming waters were expected to peak Saturday behind the Three Gorges Dam, but more water is forecast to arrive around Tuesday, Xinhua said. The hydropower dam is used to mitigate catastrophic flooding.Seasonal flooding strikes large parts of China annually, especially in its central and southern regions, but the rainfall has been unusually high this year.About 1.8 million people have been evacuated and direct losses attributed to flooding are estimated at more than 49 billion yuan ($7 billion), according to the Ministry of Emergency Management.Major cities have been spared so far, but concern has risen over Wuhan and other downstream metropolises that are home to tens of millions of people.China’s worst floods in recent years were in 1998, when more than 2,000 people died and almost 3 million homes were destroyed, mostly along the Yangtze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floods-kill-14-in-china-as-water-peaks-at-three-gorges-dam/story-ce5QbvNHd8sskXGGBfjbZM.html

18-07-2020||World||China’s restive Xinjiang province reports Covid-19 cluster with 16 new cases||China’s Xinjiang reported 16 new locally-transmitted Covid-19 cases on Friday, health authorities said Saturday as the country readies to battle a new front against the outbreak in the remote northwestern region.The jump in cases on Friday followed one new case, and eight more asymptomatic ones, which were reported on Thursday.All the cases have been reported from the regional capital Urumqi, and at least 269 people in the city have been put under medical observation.Authorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) have reacted to the new outbreak by cancelling nearly all domestic flights from the capital, limiting city transport systems, closing off a handful of residential communities and restricting people from leaving the city.The new restrictions will add to the existing ones imposed by Beijing on the province to tackle, what it calls, Islamic radicalisation. Rights group say Beijing has implemented harsh policies in the region to gradually wipe out the distinct culture of the Muslim Uyghur community.Local media reports said a 24-year-old woman tested positive on Thursday after displaying symptoms – the first such case to be reported from the province in months.State-run Global Times reported that since Friday, Xinjiang “conducted intense screening to identify infected and asymptomatic people and their close contacts. Nearly 90 percent of Urumqi flights were cancelled on Friday after new Covid-19 cases were reported.”The Xinjiang outbreak comes weeks after Beijing saw a localised spike in Covid-19 cases in June after not reporting a single case for nearly two months. It indicates the difficulty in fully eradicating the coronavirus despite China having brought the pandemic under control even as it rages globally.Chinese epidemic prevention expert Tao Lina told state media that it was necessary to compare the genetic sequencing results of the novel coronavirus from Beijing and Urumqi to determine whether the cases were related.“But because Xinjiang has a much smaller population density than Beijing, it should be relatively easy to control,” Tao told state media.The new Covid-19 cases in Xinjiang are likely to be tracked and monitored closely by rights groups in the backdrop of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uyghurs being interred in controversial camps to be de-radicalised.Earlier this year, China had said that all inmates of what it calls “vocational training institutes” had “graduated” but did not offer any evidence to support the claim.International rights groups had earlier expressed fear of the virus getting into one of the camps – as it has done in prisons in China – and triggering widespread infections among the inmates.Until Friday, China’s confirmed infections stand at 83,622, with deaths at 4,634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-restive-xinjiang-province-reports-covid-19-cluster-with-16-new-cases/story-bFcUurca0qeaCEu5AGZaNN.html
18-07-2020||World||European Union leaders resume ‘grumpy’ summit on budget, coronavirus fund||European Union leaders were hunting for compromises Saturday as a summit to reach a deal on an unprecedented 1.85 trillion euro ($2.1 trillion) EU budget and coronavirus recovery fund entered its second day with tensions running high.A full day and night of discussions by the 27 leaders on Friday only added to the irritations over how the huge sums should be spent and what strings should be attached.The atmosphere “was grumpier this evening than this afternoon,” Dutch Prime Minister Rutte told Dutch reporters after Friday’s marathon talks. “This is going to take a while, I think.” The EU executive has proposed a 750-billion euro fund, partly based on common borrowing, to be sent as loans and grants to the most needy countries. That comes on top of the seven-year 1-trillion-euro EU budget that leaders were fighting over when Covid-19 slammed their continent.A European diplomat said overnight that the talks had hit a “difficult moment” and were blocked on the issue of how to monitor the recovery funds, and that it was unclear whether there would be a way out. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the content of the closed-door negotiations.Rutte is seen as a leader of “frugal” nations that want conditions such as economic reforms attached to EU handouts to help countries recover from the hammer blow of the coronavirus.The pandemic sent the EU into a tailspin with 27-nation bloc’s economy contracting by 8.3% this year, according to the latest predictions. Around 135,000 of its citizens have died from Covid-19.As leaders met in person for the first time since February, they wore face masks, bumped elbows and sat in a cavernous meeting hall so they could maintain social distancing. Many of their negotiating positions were further apart than their chairs.After two fruitless sessions Friday, summit host and European Council President Charles Michel met key players - Rutte, French President Emmanuel Macron and Hungary’s Viktor Orban - in an attempt to narrow the gaps between them.Orban does not want strings attached to EU funds, Rutte does and Macron is arguing that Europe must show solidarity to claw its way out of the crisis.Macron and Rutte were among early arrivals at the summit venue on Saturday morning.Michel is expected to present leaders with possible compromises when the summit resumes, though it remains to be seen if they can reach agreement or will have to schedule another meeting.Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis was pessimistic after the first day.“I don’t have the impression that we are getting close to an agreement,” he said.Rutte, however, said that despite the mounting acrimony, the talks were creeping forward.“You make a bit of progress during the day,” he said. “For a start, it helps if you better understand each other’s positions, then you can search for possible compromises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-leaders-resume-grumpy-summit-on-budget-coronavirus-fund/story-KlF0YlMUVHFQ5fRqYGSLFM.html
18-07-2020||World||Beijing’s nationalist push to build support for CCP has stoked tensions with Washington||Beijing’s nationalist push to shore up support for the ruling Chinese Communist Party has stoked tensions with Washington, Jessica Chen Weiss has said.In an article in Foreign Affairs, Weiss said: “Although the main objective of Beijing’s nationalist push has been to build domestic support for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), it has also stoked tensions with Washington, as each side tries to outdo the other in shifting blame and avoiding accountability for its handling of Covid-19.”“The tit-for-tat rhetoric has already accelerated a race to the bottom in US-Chinese relations and hindered cooperation in fighting the pandemic. For the United States, this more nationalistic Chinese approach will present even greater challenges going forward, hindering US leverage and deterrence in ways that will constrain US policy options,” she added.Relations between the US and China have worsened in recent times over a range of issues including the handling of coronavirus pandemic.But over the long term, she stated that nationalism will prove even more of a hindrance to Beijing’s ambitions since it undermines Chinese efforts to attract international support and show global leadership.“Wolf warrior diplomacy might appease Chinese nationalists at home, but it will limit China’s appeal abroad. And xenophobia and repression in the name of national stability--whether toward African migrants in Guangzhou, Central Asian minorities in Xinjiang, or ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong--have given the lie to Chinese efforts to project a benevolent and magnanimous image,” she said.China has faced criticism for massive abuse of human rights of Uighurs in Xinjiang province.“Even if Beijing recognizes these problems, it will be costly--although not impossible--for the Chinese leadership to constrain the nationalism it has unleashed,” said Weiss.She noted that to some extent, Beijing has already tempered its most aggressive nationalist rhetoric in the face of domestic and international pushback in recent weeks.“Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian has denied that China is trying to export its coronavirus response model. Leading military hawks have cautioned Chinese nationalists against using force to reunify with Taiwan,” she said.“Censors have shuttered social media accounts promoting “fabricated and misleading” claims about India, Kazakhstan, and Vietnam. But despite this modest tamping down of nationalist rhetoric, even China’s internal reporting suggests that global anti-Chinese sentiment is at its highest point since the 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square,” she added.In recent times, China has tried to bully smaller neighbouring countries, aggravating tensions in the region.Still, she said, more assertive nationalism is likely to remain a feature of Beijing’s rhetoric and diplomacy, with significant implications for US policy.“The more the CCP prioritizes nationalism and public stability relative to economic growth as sources of domestic legitimacy, the less leverage the United States and other outside powers have, particularly on issues of central importance to China’s leaders, such as territorial integrity,” the article read.Citing the example of Hong Kong where China has imposed draconian national security law to crush dissent, she said: “Take Hong Kong, where Beijing has feared both democratic contagion and a separatist threat to national sovereignty. Threats of economic sanctions have been ineffective at deterring Beijing from pushing through new national security legislation that effectively ends Hong Kong’s autonomy.”She highlighted that once mobilized, nationalism creates pressure for the government to talk tough and placate domestic audiences, increasing the costs of restraint.Cautioning that US policymakers aiming to shape the trajectory of China’s behaviour and influence must consider both the short- and long-term effects of nationalism on Chinese politics and policy, she said policies to force near-term Chinese restraint may also make medium- or long-term belligerence more likely by hardening the overall opinion climate inside China.“In crafting strategies to deter or punish Beijing, policymakers may end up increasing domestic Chinese demands for tough retaliation, including countermeasures against the range of foreign interests that benefit from access to China--whether scientific, journalistic, or corporate,” she said while adding that the more the CCP leans on nationalism, the less worried the United States should be about China as a rival for global leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-s-nationalist-push-to-build-support-for-ccp-has-stoked-tensions-with-washington/story-4WgTov372DDEAlBkn3XV7O.html

Speaking to reporters about the arrest, Harrison would not say when police believe Saleh was killed, nor would he discuss other details about the case or take questions.Investigators initially believed that the cousin who went to check on Saleh may have interrupted the attack and that the assailant fled out a back exit. The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide after an autopsy found the cause of death was multiple stab wounds to the body.Saleh was the chief executive officer of ride-hailing motorcycle startup Gokada that started operating in Nigeria in 2018.Saleh’s LinkedIn biography described him as a self-taught businessman who founded Gokada, building on his experience of first “seeing an opportunity in his parent’s native country of Bangladesh” and starting that country’s largest ride-sharing company. It said he also invested in a similar venture in Colombia.“The headlines talk about a crime we still cannot fathom,” Saleh’s family said in a statement after his death. “Fahim is more than what you are reading. He is so much more. His brilliant and innovative mind took everyone who was a part of his world on a journey and he made sure never to leave anyone behind.”Apartments in the 10-story building where Saleh’s remains were found sell for more than $2 million. The building was completed in 2017 as part of a wave of gentrification in the neighborhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/personal-assistant-charged-in-dismembered-tech-ceo-s-killing-in-luxury-ny-condo/story-TTTngTvtoVodXZa8M9reaJ.html

Its roof took more than 13 years to repair.Another religious building in Nantes -- the Basilica of St Donatian and St Rogatian -- was struck by a fire in 2015 that destroyed three-quarters of its roof.In April last year, a fire engulfed Paris’s 13th century Notre-Dame Cathedral, causing its steeple to collapse and sending billowing fumes containing toxic molten lead into the air. The structure will take years to repair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-fire-at-cathedral-in-french-city-of-nantes/story-PVnIwnou1o58iGBeloiJXM.html

But, in the process, he confirmed receiving classified briefings after saying as recently as late last month that he wasn’t getting them but might request one about reports of Russian bounties being offered on US troops in Afghanistan.“We know from before, and I guarantee you I know now because now I get briefings again. The Russians are still engaged, trying to de-legitimize our electoral process. Fact,” Biden said Friday. “China and others are engaged as well in activities designed for us to lose confidence in the outcome.”The White House and National Security Council didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Biden’s statement. Reached by phone, a Biden spokesperson did not immediately provide further details.US intelligence agencies say Russia meddled in the 2016 election with the goal of swaying the contest toward Donald Trump, and officials have warned that there remains a threat of foreign interference in the 2020 contest.Throughout his presidency, Trump has questioned the intelligence community’s findings about the 2016 Russian interference and called investigations into whether his campaign had any connection to the meddling a “hoax.”Biden received intelligence briefings while vice president but told reporters he wasn’t getting them as of June 30. He said then that President Donald Trump’s administration had not offered classified briefings, even though they are traditionally provided to major-party nominees once they win the primary. Biden won’t formally become the Democratic presidential nominee until the party’s convention next month.Biden has previously suggested that President Donald Trump could hold up emergency funding to help the Postal Service continue normal operations during the coronavirus, which has devastated the agency’s finances and contributed to a huge drop in mail volumes.Trump has repeatedly said he opposes expanding mail-in balloting during the pandemic, suggesting without evidence that doing so could lead to widespread fraud — even though there is equally no evidence the president or White House will use Postal Service funding to do what Biden is suggesting.Biden lobbed similar charges on Friday, saying Trump may try to “defund the post office so they can’t deliver mail-in ballots.”“Frankly, this is the thing that keeps me up most at night,” Biden added. “Making sure everyone who wants to vote can vote, making sure that the vote is counted, making sure we’re all trusting in the integrity of the results of the election.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-intel-briefings-biden-warns-of-election-interference/story-kivVK24UxGKz5qs7XJAAGP.html
18-07-2020||World||How coronavirus evades host cell defense decoded||Scientists have determined how the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, inhibits the synthesis of proteins in infected cells, and have shown that it effectively disarms a part of the immune system, findings that may aid in the development of novel therapeutics against the deadly disease. The study, published in the journal Science, demonstrated that nonstructural Protein 1 (Nsp1) made by the novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 can have a devastating effect on host cells. According to the researchers, including those from the University of Munich in Germany, Nsp1 is one of the central weapons used by the virus to ensure its own replication and propagation in human hosts. They said Nsp1 was identified as a disease contributing factor following the outbreak of the related 2002-03 SARS pandemic virus. Scientists who studied the SARS virus had shown that it inhibited protein synthesis in infected cells. “Although SARS-CoV-2 features additional inhibitors of host innate immune defenses, targeting the interaction of this protein, Nsp1, with the host may be an important therapeutic strategy,” the researchers noted. Upon infection, they said SARS-CoV-2 suppressed protein production in the host, including that of proteins active in cellular anti-viral defense mechanisms. The virus did this by binding to the cell’s protein production machinery, the ribosome, the study noted. According to the scientists, targeting the specific part of the ribosome that Nsp1 binds to could be an important potential therapeutic strategy. In the research, the scientists structurally characterised the Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 bound to the ribosome. They tested the ability of a modified version form of Nsp1, known as mt-Nsp1, to affect protein production related to host immune response. According to the study, the mutant version did not bind in the same way and did not shut down host cell protein production. The scientists also demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 almost completely prevented production of various immune molecules that fight viral infection, such as interferons. “Our data establish that one of the major immune evasion factors of SARS-CoV-2, Nsp1, efficiently interferes with the cellular translation machinery resulting in a shut-down of host protein production,” the study noted.  According to the scientists, the findings may provide a starting point for rational structure-based drug design, targeting the interaction between Nsp1 and the ribosome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-coronavirus-evades-host-cell-defense-decoded/story-2DFk7Wqox2UyQnKP23nGJK.html

18-07-2020||World||China takes over companies linked to disappeared financier||Chinese regulators will assume control of nine financial firms that are linked to a financier who was taken from a hotel in Hong Kong by Chinese authorities in 2017 and hasn’t been seen in public since.Among the companies being taken over are Huaxia Life Insurance Co., Tianan Life Insurance Co., Tianan Property Insurance Co., New Times Trust Co., Yi’An Property Insurance Co., and New China Trust Co., the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a statement on its website Friday.The takeover won’t change the firms’ debt obligations or creditor rights, and business operations will continue as normal. Also going into state custody will be Guosheng Securities Co., New Times Securities Co. and Guosheng Futures Co., the securities regulator said in a separate statement.All nine are linked to Tomorrow Group, the investment conglomerate owned by Xiao Jianhua. The firms are among more than 40 financial institutions identified by New Fortune Magazine in a 2017 article as being part of Xiao’s network.Chinese authorities are stepping up their bid to maintain financial stability as Covid-19 proves ruinous for economic growth and soured loans pile up. Beijing seized control of Baoshang Bank Co. -- another company linked to Xiao -- in May last year citing its “serious” credit risks.Last month, regulators were said to be mulling increased oversight of Huaxia Life, including sending a group of executives from state-owned China Life Insurance Group Co. to assist. Insurers’ earnings have been under pressure, and the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated that.Bad Apples“This is certainly a move in the right direction” in terms of containing financial risk and warning peers of wrongdoing, said Steven Lam, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “The authorities are also being more transparent by telling the market, ‘We know there are bad apples, and we’re taking care of them’.”Tomorrow Group questioned regulators’ decision in a statement Saturday on its official social media account. The company said its subsidiaries haven’t seen any defaults and don’t have much liquidity risk. It added that requests from units to use around 2 billion yuan ($286 million) on Tomorrow’s balance sheet to repay wealth management products were denied.Tomorrow’s online statement was later deleted after several hundred thousand views.The CBIRC said in its statement on Friday that authorities will seek market-oriented restructurings for the six insurance and trust firms and the bottom line is to avoid any systematic financial risks.The three broking and futures entities were seized for hiding the identity of their ultimate owner or their real holdings, as well as poor corporate governance, the securities regulator said.The moves echo the treatment of Anbang Insurance Group Co. Authorities are in the process of finding strategic investors for Dajia Insurance Group Co., the company that took over the operations of once-acquisitive Anbang after a two-year period of state custody.Anbang’s former Chairman Wu Xiaohui was convicted of fraud and the CBIRC was tasked with selling many of the assets Anbang had accumulated during an overseas buying binge.Four SeasonsXiao has been missing since early 2017 when he was taken from his room at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong. Xiao had been staying there for several years after fleeing China, where he is still pending trial. It’s as yet unclear what charges may be laid against him.Tomorrow Group invested primarily in financial services and used shell companies to control many of its assets. Before his disappearance, the Hurun Report of China’s richest people said Xiao, a student leader at the time of 1989 pro-democracy protests, is part of a fortune estimated at almost $6 billion.In 2018, China’s central bank identified Tomorrow as one of several “financial holding companies” that need to be scrutinized in their ownership structure, related transactions and source of funding.“Some financial holding companies, mainly those formed by investments of non-financial enterprises, have been expanding blindly into the financial industry,” the People’s Bank of China said at the time. “There has been a regulatory vacuum, and risks are accumulating and being exposed continuously.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-takes-over-companies-linked-to-disappeared-financier/story-siplTuoi7dYwqekdjHlFkM.html

All are required to wear face masks at all times.The gazette notification came days after the election commission urged the government to legalise the health guidelines, saying that the political leaders were not adhering to the health measures while campaigning, jeopardising the lives of the people attending the campaign.“It will be extremely difficult to conduct the election unless the legal effect is given to the health guidelines,” Mahinda Deshapriya, the chief of Sri Lanka’s Election Commission, said on Wednesday.The guidelines for conducting the elections were announced on June 2 but they were not been legalised through a gazette notification.However, sources in the opposition accused the ruling party of watering down the guidelines to make way for a more relaxed campaigning despite a spike in the cases. Campaigning for the elections, which will continue till August 2, has been low key due to the pandemic and the sudden spike of over 500 cases reported from the north central region last week has led to fears of the spread of the virus.According to Johns Hopkins university data, the country has 2,697 coronavirus cases with 11 deaths.The role of the public health inspectors (PHI) has been excluded from the guidelines.The PHIs had on Friday said they were withdrawing from Covid-19 related activities due to the government’s reluctance to provide them with legal cover for their work.The parliamentary polls were initially to be held on April 25, but had to be postponed due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic which prompted the authorities to announce a nationwide lockdown from March 20.Later, the election commission shifted the date to June 20. It was again deemed not suitable in view of the raging pandemic. Finally, August 5 has been selected for the poll process.With the latest spike, it was feared that the election would be further put off and the country might return to the lockdown phase. The country was earlier under lockdown from March 20-June 13.The election commission has declined the opposition’s call to postpone the elections amid a surge in the number of cases.Over 16 million voters are eligible to vote to elect a 225-member parliament for a five-year term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-sri-lanka-issues-strict-health-guidelines-for-election-campaigning/story-tqsjzUqbciK8u4LZebApGO.html

This despite the fact that the Chinese ambassador to Nepal seems to be the master puppeteer of the Himalayan kingdom.The political situation in Nepal seems to be fluid as none of the three principal contenders—Oli, Dahal or Madhav Nepal—want to be seen as the breakers of the NCP’s unity. This works to the advantage of Oli as this ensures that neither Dahal nor Nepal will precipitate the matters and hence the change in the power structure of Nepal will be slow.However, as numbers count in political parties more than words or slogans, Oli is a minority in the secretariat, standing committee and the central committee as of now.It is widely expected that the secretariat will make a decision on Oli’s continuation as the prime minister or co-chair of the NCP or both but the final decision will come through elaborate party processes.The China model of Nepal is that the NCP remains united and individuals can be dealt with pelf and power at a later stage. The Indian model for Nepal is the people-to-people relationship with a working relationship with whosoever is in power. Oli has done his best to break the working relationship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/political-options-run-out-for-oli-in-nepal-cliff-hanger/story-uRe6KisUV7tV2EWKm3bFNO.html
18-07-2020||World||John Lewis’ legacy shaped in 1965 on ‘Bloody Sunday’||John Lewis saw the line of Alabama state troopers a few hundred yards away as he led hundreds of marchers to the apex of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on March 7, 1965. Armed with gas canisters and nightsticks, the troopers were flanked by horse-riding members of the sheriff’s posse. A crowd of whites milled around nearby.Lewis, who died Friday at age 80, was just 25 at the time. He had been leading voting rights demonstrations for months in the notoriously racist town, and he and the others were trying to take a message of freedom to segregationist Gov. George C. Wallace in Montgomery.So, rather than stopping, Lewis put another foot forward.That seminal step propelled him on to a global stage as a hero of the U.S. civil rights movement. The ensuing confrontation helped lead to the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act.With fellow civil rights activist Hosea Williams at his side, Lewis finally stopped a few feet away from the phalanx of troopers commanded by Maj. John Cloud of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. Other marchers stopped behind them, shifting their feet uncomfortably on the bridge shoulder.Williams asked Cloud whether they could talk. There would be none of that, said Cloud. Acting on Wallace’s order, he said the march was illegal and gave the group two minutes to leave. Seconds later, Cloud unleashed a spasm of state-sanctioned violence that shocked the nation for its sheer brutality.“Troopers, here, advance toward the group. See that they disperse,” he said through a bullhorn. Lewis stood motionless with his hands in the pockets of his raincoat, a knapsack on his back.Archival film footage and photos show a line of roughly two dozen troopers wearing gas masks as they approach the long, peaceful line led by Lewis. A trooper jabbed the butt of a nightstick toward Lewis and officers quickly pushed into the group. Feet became tangled and bodies hit both the grass roadside and the asphalt road. Screams rang out.Lewis, in sworn court testimony five days later before U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., recalled being knocked to the ground. A state trooper standing upright hit him once in the head with a nightstick; Lewis shielded his head with a hand. The trooper hit Lewis again as he tried to get up. The officer was never publicly identified; Lewis testified he didn’t know who it was, and a gas mask shielded the man’s identity.Others were beaten even worse as whites cheered from nearby. Amelia Boynton Robinson, who was in the line behind Lewis, was tear-gassed and beaten so badly she had to be carried away unconscious. Others were clubbed by the sheriff’s posse members on horseback.Lewis testified he never lost consciousness, but he also didn’t remember how he got back to a church where he was taken before being admitted to a hospital. He got out in time for a hearing before Johnson, who overturned Wallace’s order and ruled demonstrators could march to Montgomery.Lewis was just a few feet away from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the front of more than 3,000 marchers when they left Selma on March 21, 1965, for the epic 52-mile walk to Montgomery. Wallace, who had vowed “segregation forever” during his 1963 inaugural and served four terms as governor, refused to meet with them.Lewis outlived other key players in what came to be known as Bloody Sunday by many years. He addressed a throng atop the bridge in March, after his cancer diagnosis, to mark the 55th commemoration of the day.“Speak up, speak out, get in the way,” said Lewis, who appeared frail but spoke in a strong voice. “Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.”Wallace died in 1998, five years after Cloud, and Judge Johnson died in 1999. Hosea Williams, the other march leader who was beside Lewis that day on the bridge, died in 2000.Robinson, who recovered from her injuries and crossed the Selma bridge with Lewis and then-President Barack Obama during the 50th anniversary commemoration, died in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/john-lewis-legacy-shaped-in-1965-on-bloody-sunday/story-U42dkGzljn5vvuKm13IFkO.html

It added that the hackers manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials to access Twitter’s internal systems through two-factor protections. Twitter said the hackers seem to have targetted some 130 accounts and were able to log in, send tweets and reset the password on some of them. “As of now, we know that they accessed tools only available to our internal support teams to target 130 Twitter accounts. For 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send tweets,” it stated. “For up to eight of the Twitter accounts involved, the attackers took the additional step of downloading the account’s information through our “Your Twitter Data” tool. We are reaching out directly to any account owner where we know this to be true,” a post tweeted by Twitter Support read. As of now, we know that they accessed tools only available to our internal support teams to target 130 Twitter accounts. For 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send Tweets.The company added that there exists a lot speculation about the identity of these 8 accounts and said it will “only disclose this to the impacted accounts, however to address some of the speculation: none of the eight were Verified accounts”.The New York Times, in a report, stated that the hackers were young pals with no links to state or organized crime, news agency AFP reported. The attack started with a playful message between hackers on the platform Discord, a chat service popular with gamers, according to the Times.The massive hack involved high-profile users from Elon Musk to Joe Biden. Posts trying to dupe people into sending hackers the virtual currency bitcoin were tweeted by the official accounts of Apple, Uber, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Barack Obama and many others on Wednesday.Fraudulent posts, which were largely deleted, said people had 30 minutes to send $1,000 in cryptocurrency bitcoin, promising they would receive twice as much in return.More than $100,000 worth of bitcoin was sent to email addresses mentioned in the tweets, according to Blockchain.com, which monitors crypto transactions.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-hack-company-says-attackers-manipulated-employees-credentials-to-access-internal-systems/story-G3Pwm92EswatdW97oUzw5N.html

Now is not the time to do that,” he said.The United States marked a record number of coronavirus cases for the third consecutive day Friday, notching more than 77,600 new infections in 24 hours, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.Lockdowns have been imposed on millions of people in India, where more than 600 are dying every day. India’s hotspots had previously been the megacities of Mumbai and New Delhi, but smaller cities and rural areas -- where 70 percent of Indians live -- have recently begun to raise the alarm.With per capita spending on health care among the lowest in the world, India’s hospitals are reeling.“It’s not going to go away till a vaccine comes... I have to keep fighting and trying to save every single life,” Showkat Nazir Wani, a doctor in an intensive care unit outside the capital New Delhi, told AFP.New restrictions Despite fears of a second wave, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country could expect to return to “significant normality” by Christmas, as a study revealed that Europe’s hardest-hit nation may be overestimating its death toll.However, Israel said stores, markets and other public spaces would be closed on weekends as its number of cases surges.In China -- where Covid-19 first emerged late last year -- flights were curtailed and public transport shut down in Urumqi, the capital of the far-western Xinjiang region, after new infections were detected.Authorities in Australia’s second-biggest city Melbourne meanwhile warned that its lockdown could become even tougher after a record 423 new cases were registered there on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-tells-millions-stay-home-as-eu-meets-on-covid-19-cases-rise/story-WDTJSlOJT2BSaHiilvXeaM.html

18-07-2020||World||US passenger flights to India can resume July 23||The government of India has agreed to allow US air carriers to resume passenger services in the US-India market starting July 23, the US Transportation Department said on Friday.The Indian government, citing the coronavirus, had banned all scheduled services, prompting the US Transportation Department in June to accuse India of engaging in “unfair and discriminatory practices” on charter air carriers serving India.The Transportation Department said it was withdrawing an order it had issued requiring Indian air carriers to apply for authorization prior to conducting charter flights, and said it had approved an Air India application for passenger charter flights between the United States and India. A group representing major US airlines and the Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment on Friday.India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation said on Twitter it was moving to “further expand our international civil aviation operations” and arrangements from some flights “with US, UAE, France & Germany are being put in place while similar arrangements are also being worked out with several other countries.”“Under this arrangement,” it added, “airlines from the concerned countries will be able to operate flights from & to India along with Indian carriers.”The US Transportation Department order was set to take effect next week. The Trump administration said in June it wanted “to restore a level playing field for US airlines” under the US-India Air Transport Agreement. The Indian government had banned all scheduled services and failed to approve US carriers for charter operations, it added.The US government said in June that Air India had been operating “repatriation” charter flights between India and the United States in both directions since May 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-passenger-flights-to-india-can-resume-july-23/story-qrsUPUJIKLW34wnWdAEyVO.html
18-07-2020||World||United States carries out third federal execution in four days||The US Justice Department on Friday (local time) carried out its third federal execution in four days after the punishment was revived by the Trump administration following a 17-year hiatus.Officials executed Dustin Lee Honken at a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, on Friday afternoon. He was pronounced dead at 4:36 p.m. (local time), prison officials informed The Washington Post.Honken was convicted of killing five people, including two young children, and sentenced to death. In 1993, Honken was indicted on federal drug-trafficking charges, after which he and his girlfriend kidnapped and murdered a federal witness, the witness’s girlfriend and the girlfriend’s daughters, a 6-year-old and a 10-year-old, as per court records. Months later, they also murdered another potential witness.Before the execution began, Honken briefly spoke, according to a pool report from a media witness. He did not address the victims’ relatives bearing witness. His last words were, “Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for me.”Honken’s lethal injection came on the heels of federal officials carrying out two other executions in Indiana.On Tuesday morning, the federal government executed Daniel Lewis Lee, convicted for his role in killing a family of three. Two days later, it executed Wesley Purkey, convicted of raping and murdering 16-year-old Jennifer Long.The death penalty has declined significantly in recent years, with fewer death sentences and executions. There were 22 executions in 2019, down from 98 in 1999.Since the last federal execution, several states have moved away from the death penalty, including New Hampshire, which last year became the 21st state to abolish capital punishment.The Justice Department had initially planned to restart executions last year along a similarly busy timeline. Attorney General William P Barr announced last summer that it would begin carrying out executions again with a new lethal-injection protocol -- using only the drug pentobarbital -- and scheduled three executions over five days in December.But those plans were scuttled by legal challenges to the protocol, which was eventually upheld in court. Then this week, with the scheduled executions looming, they were repeatedly put on hold, then given the green light through numerous legal battles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-carries-out-third-federal-execution-in-four-days/story-QsTkzGK77PB78ae4PooaHM.html
18-07-2020||World||For first time, world records 1 million coronavirus cases in 100 hours||Global coronavirus infections passed 14 million on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, marking the first time there has been a surge of 1 million cases in under 100 hours.The first case was reported in China in early January and it took three months to reach 1 million cases. It has taken just four days to climb to 14 million cases from 13 million recorded on July 13.The United States, with more than 3.6 million confirmed cases, is still seeing huge daily jumps in its first wave of Covid-19 infections. The United States reported a daily global record of more than 77,000 new infections on Thursday, while Sweden has reported 77,281 total cases since the pandemic began.Despite the surging cases, a cultural divide is growing in the country over wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus, a precaution routinely taken in many other nations. US President Donald Trump and his followers have resisted a full-throated endorsement of masks and have been calling for a return to normal economic activity and reopening schools despite the surging cases.Other hard-hit countries have “flattened the curve” and are easing lockdowns put in place to slow the spread of the novel virus while others, such as the cities of Barcelona and Melbourne, are implementing a second round of local shutdowns.The number of cases globally is around triple that of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to the World Health Organization.The pandemic has now killed more than 590,000 people in almost seven months, edging towards the upper range of yearly influenza deaths reported worldwide. The first death was reported on Jan. 10 in Wuhan, China before infections and fatalities then surged in Europe and later in the United States.The Reuters tally, which is based on government reports, shows the disease is accelerating the fastest in the Americas, which account for more than half the world’s infections and half its deaths.In Brazil, more than 2 million people have tested positive including President Jair Bolsonaro, and more than 76,000 people have died.India, the only other country with more than 1 million cases, has been grappling with an average of almost 30,000 new infections each day for the last week.Those countries were the main drivers behind the World Health Organization on Friday reporting a record one-day increase in global coronavirus cases of 237,743.In countries with limited testing capacity, case numbers reflect only a proportion of total infections. Experts say official data likely under-represents both infections and deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-first-time-world-records-1-million-coronavirus-cases-in-100-hours/story-w6OA8DwFy4E5ZSsNTSaPyK.html

We would need to call on Indian sides to resolve on the problem created on by the dams constructed on their side by calling on the meeting of JCIFM. Start preparations for it,” the Minister said.Nepal and India have been holding on the meeting of JCIFM annually on November but the Ministry has started on preparations to inform the Indian side with immediate effect after receiving a direct order from the Minister.“Annual meeting is held in the month of November but this time we have got the direct order from Minister so we will be informing the Indian side with immediate effect,” said Rabindrathan Shrestha, Secretary at the ministry.The Joint Commission formed by India and Nepal to discuss on the issue will be led by Director General of Nepal’s Irrigation Department Madhukar Prasad Rajbhandari.Earlier this week, Nepal’s Minister for Home Affairs had blamed India for the inundation of Terai region during the annual monsoon season.Earlier this week, Nepal Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa blamed India for constructing structures along the border, which he claimed blocked the flow of water and resulted in inundation of various places of the country.Bihar Water Resources Minister had said last month that Nepal had stopped all repair work of river embankments in Bihar on the India-Nepal border by erecting barriers and effectively putting a stop to work done by India to prevent flooding of its low-lying areas.Thapa had said some diplomatic steps undertaken by the Nepal government in order to solve but said it did not work out well.“Agreements over it were signed at the time of Indian Prime Minister’s visit to Nepal but all of them are yet to be implemented,” he saidAt least 60 people have died while 41 have gone missing in floods and landslides in the last four days in various parts of Nepal.Myagdi district of Western Nepal is the worst affected with 27 deaths.

It is threatening a free Taiwan and trying to dominate the world communications networks,” Pompeo said during a visit to Iowa on Friday (local time).“A few weeks back, I read a report about the Chinese Communist Party forcing mass abortions and sterilisation on Chinese Muslims in Western China. These are some of the most gross human rights violations we have seen and I have referred to it as the stain of the century,” he added.On Friday, Washington booked five Chinese foreign nationals and two Chinese entities under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. It also imposed visa sanctions on certain employees of Chinese technology companies including Huawei that provide material support to regimes engaging in human rights abuses globally.In a statement on Wednesday, Pompeo had announced the restrictions and said: “Telecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice: If they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers.”Pompeo had said that Huawei is an arm of the CCP’s surveillance state that censors political dissidents and enables mass internment camps in Xinjiang and the indentured servitude of its population shipped all over China.The US action comes a day after the UK announced its decision to ban British companies from buying Huawei-produced equipment for 5G networks from the end of the year.US President Donald Trump called Chinese technology “untrustworthy”.“We confronted untrustworthy Chinese technology and telecom providers. We convinced many countries not to use Huawei because it’s a big security risk. Just today, the UK announced that they are not going to be using it,” Trump had said on Wednesday.The United States had designated Chinese telecom companies Huawei and ZTE Corp as national security threats, saying they have close ties with the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military apparatus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-communist-party-trying-to-dominate-global-communication-networks-pompeo/story-bP3p50bRQz4Le2IdZgnM1J.html

18-07-2020||World||In Cochabamba, people buy fake - and toxic - virus cure||Long lines form every morning in one of the Bolivian cities hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic as desperate people wait to buy small bottles of chlorine dioxide, a toxic bleaching agent that has been falsely touted as a cure for Covid-19 and myriad other diseases. The rush in the city of Cochabamba to buy a disinfectant known to cause harm to those who ingest it comes even after the Bolivian Health Ministry warned of its dangers and said at least five people were poisoned after taking chlorine dioxide in La Paz, the capital. Dr. Antonio Viruez, who is treating the five at a hospital, said one incorrectly believed he had Covid-19 and developed pneumonitis, an inflammation of lung tissue, after taking chlorine dioxide and a medication used to treat parasite infestations. The other patients are improving, he said. “The Health Ministry cannot risk recommending something that doesn’t have a scientific basis,” said Miguel Ángel Delgado, a senior ministry official. However, Bolivia’s opposition-controlled congress is promoting the use of chlorine dioxide. Last week, the Senate approved a bill authorizing the emergency “manufacture, marketing, supply and use of chlorine dioxide solution for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus.” The bill would require the approval of interim President Jeanine Áñez, who is in quarantine after testing positive for the new coronavirus. She has sparred with opposition lawmakers loyal to Evo Morales, the former leader who was forced to resign last year after an election marred by irregularities. Many fearful residents in Cochabamba, where opposition support is strong, are giving chlorine dioxide a try. Cochabamba has reported about 440 deaths from Covid-19, or one-quarter of the total number of reported deaths in Bolivia. The real toll is believed to be higher. “I am afraid. I have to try it,” said Andrés Poma, a 34-year-old teacher who is skeptical that beleaguered health services can help him if he gets sick. “What am I going to do? Wait to die at the door of the hospital or at the door of my house?” Federico Anza, who sells chlorine dioxide at his Cochabamba store, said thousands of people have bought it, consuming it in drops. “My wife and I took it and nothing happened to us,” he said. He said his clients had not fallen ill after taking the agent, though provincial health authorities reported 10 cases of poisoning from chlorine dioxide in the past week. The governor of Cochabamba state, Esther Soria, said she supports a plan for a state law authorizing the use of chlorine dioxide and traditional medicine to treat Covid-19. Cochabamba’s mayor, José María Leyes, said he favors the free distribution of the bleaching agent to treat patients. But Fernando Rengel, president of the Cochabamba’s scientific association, said there are old beliefs that the toxic substance is “miraculous” and cures cancer, AIDS, malaria and other diseases, “but there is no scientific study that proves that it cures any disease.” Chlorine dioxide is one of a number of fake cures that have been promoted, often by fringe groups online, since the pandemic began. In April, a federal judge in South Florida ordered a Colombia-based group, the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, to stop selling a related product, Miracle Mineral Solution, in the US Prosecutors said Genesis marketed the solution as a treatment for Covid-19, autism and other ailments. The US Food and Drug Administration has previously issued public warnings that MMS can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and severe dehydration. In April, US President Donald Trump mused about whether disinfectants could be injected or ingested to fight Covid-19, prompting intense blowback from doctors and other health officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-bolivian-city-people-buy-fake-and-toxic-virus-cure/story-GL7RSbmYd6UDgwbuXQLtGO.html

Speaking in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, MPA Ravi Kumar said the minorities were enjoying equal rights and living in peaceful coexistence with the majority community in Pakistan. The Pakistan government has approved Rs 10 crore for the Krishna temple, the first temple in Islamabad which will come upon a 20,000-square feet plot in the H-9 administrative division. “We would welcome the decision of the government as it would be according to law and the Constitution of the country. The minorities are enjoying equal rights and living in peaceful coexistence with the majority in Pakistan,” he said. He said action should be taken against those who are trying to wedge differences between Muslims and Hindus. Kumar submitted a resolution in the provincial assembly secretariat this week condemning the alleged derogatory remarks against the Hindu deities on social media on the issue of the construction of the temple. “This negative propaganda against Hindu religion has hurt the feelings of the Hindu community not only in Pakistan but all over the world,” the resolution stated. Anti-state elements were damaging inter-faith harmony and promoting hatred among the various sects, it said. On July 8, a Pakistani court dismissed three identical petitions challenging the construction of the first Hindu temple in Islamabad. A single bench of the Islamabad High Court delivered the judgment, making it clear that there was no bar on the Institute of Hindu Panchayat from building the temple on the land allotted to it by using its own funds. Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan. According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country. The majority of Pakistan’s Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions, and language with Muslims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hindu-community-will-welcome-construction-of-temple-in-islamabad-lawmaker/story-ksAZLviSKB24XOgewyu0aM.html

The Chinese military also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. Welcoming the White House statement, Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, said that unlike his predecessor, President Trump has come out openly in support of India.“Most of the Indian-Americans have observed that every earlier president - be it a Democrat or Republican, like Bill Clinton or Bush Senior or Bush Jr or Barack Obama have been very scared to side with India openly, for fear of hurting China.“Only President Trump has had the courage to say that… I love India, America respects India… US stands with India - and that also, to over one billion Indians in India at the Namaste Trump rally held in India… and that too… near India’s neighbour China,” Mason said in a statement. “And he is consistent in his love for India and Indian-Americans,” he added. Earlier on Thursday, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow described India as a great ally, saying President Trump is a great friend of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-offers-all-possible-help-to-india-china/story-MWJ6Ke7UrZMbLTFmK6ZAiK.html

A high court judge will decide whether to grant permission for a judicial review. The legal papers also include a witness statement by Bapio president Ramesh Mehta.Over 300 health and social care workers have died due to the virus. The review is sought to challenge the lawfulness of the PPE guidance published by the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England, which the petitioners say exposed the workers to the virus.Mehta said: “This case by Joshi and Viz is vital in establishing the obligation of government and its official bodies in the protection of health and social care workers against a second wave of Covid-19 and future pandemics”.Bapio said that as the largest organisation representing doctors, nurses and other care workers from the non-white communities, who have suffered disproportionately in terms of infections and fatalities, it commissioned and published several surveys on their experience.Mehta said it was the first medical organisation to write to the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, expressing concern about the disproportionate deaths of non-white doctors. Fatalities include several doctors and nurses of Indian heritage.Joshi and Viz, who have applied to the high court for permission to bring judicial review proceedings, have named Bapio as an interested party.

It, however, capped the expenditure to a maximum of Rs 4,000 per day in hotels of Patna, Rs 3,000 for hotels in districts, which were divisional headquarters, and Rs 2,500 for other districts.It also authorized district magistrates to negotiate with the management of respective hotels and get rooms at cheaper rates.The order said that doctors and healthcare workers, who test positive or show symptoms of the virus, would be given priority in admission at medical college hospitals, depending on the severity of the case.The department has already decided to earmark 100 beds for Covid-19 patients in each of its nine medical colleges and hospitals across the state.The department had on June 23 allowed home isolation facility, with certain riders, for Covid-19 asymptomatic doctors and healthcare workers. However, Saturday’s order said that many frontline workers stayed in rented accommodation and may face difficulty in self isolation besides quarantining other family members. The facility of paid isolation at hotels was for such frontline workers, said the order issued by Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Uday Singh Kumawat. The department had also issued an order on June 24, allowing paid isolation facility at select hotels to Covid-19 patients who wanted to avail it.Though the government order did not specify the number of healthcare workers who have so far been infected by the virus, it, however, acknowledged the fact that many employees at government hospitals and district health offices had tested Covid-19 positive of late.The Bihar chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has claimed that over 200 healthcare workers, including doctors, had so far tested positive for the virus in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-paid-isolation-facility-at-hotels-for-covid-19-positive-healthcare-workers/story-d5LkdVt0pgMmXWKzSxO5HJ.html

18-07-2020||India||Opposition slams Odisha govt’s move of sending doctors from tribal areas to Ganjam||At a time when Covid-19 cases are spiralling out of control, opposition Congress and BJP have slammed the Odisha government’s move of sending doctors from tribal districts of the state to the Covid-19 epicentre of Ganjam calling it a huge mismanagement of the health crisis.A few days ago Odisha had posted 130 doctors from tribal districts such as Malkangiri, Koraput, Kandhamal, Nabarangpur, Bolangir and Kalahandi to Ganjam that has reported over 5,280 Covid-19 cases, around 30 per cent of the total coronavirus cases of Odisha. Ganjam, also the home district of chief minister Naveen Patnaik, has failed to get a grip on the Covid-19 situation with 80-90 per cent of the cases now being reported from all over the district, triggering fears of community transmission.However, the government’s move of sending doctors from the tribal districts, already reeling under shortage of doctors has come in for sharp criticism. Malkangiri district Congress committee president Govind Patra said the transfer of 10 doctors from the district to Ganjam was unfortunate. “Malkangiri has now 122 active Covid-19 cases and cases are being reported from the urban areas. The situation in Malkangiri is very critical and we have acute shortage of doctors. The government should not have sent doctors from here,” Patra said.He said the district has 93 doctors as against total sanctioned posts of 197. “Similarly, 20 percent of the total health workers appointed in the district are yet to be appointed. In such a situation, the doctors and health workers are somehow managing the scene. If the government wanted more doctors in Ganjam, it could have requisitioned private doctors,” Patra elaborated.Similarly, in Kalahandi where 73 of the sanctioned posts of 107 specialist doctors in government hospitals are lying vacant, former union minister Bhakta Charan Das slammed the government move. “The government simply escalated the Ganjam crisis by getting migrant workers from other states without testing them. Now that the government has mismanaged the health crisis, it is triggering another crisis in backward districts like Kalahandi by getting doctors from there,” said Das.BJP leader Bhrigu Buxipatra too criticised the government move of sending doctors from tribal districts to Ganjam. “The government never had a strategy in place to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Now with the rise in cases in Ganjam, it has started taking whimsical decisions. This would lead to major health crisis in districts like Koraput,” he said.In Nabarangpur district, which has 106 doctors from sanctioned posts of 256, the decision to send 19 doctors from there to Ganjam was criticized by former Congress MP Pradip Majhi. “Tribal dominated districts have several health issues including malaria, Japanese Encephalitis and other diseases. If the government does not withdraw its order, we will be forced to resort to a strike and agitation in the coming days,” said Majhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-slams-odisha-govt-s-move-of-sending-doctors-from-tribal-areas-to-ganjam/story-XgaBvkHYicZ9WsXvHRbRqI.html

Targeting and persecution of minority community members by terrorists at the behest of their external supporters, remains a matter of grave concern,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava tweeted, without explicitly naming Pakistan.Nedan Singh, a helper at a local gurdwara, was kidnapped by unidentified persons in Paktia province in eastern Afghanistan last month leading to a strong condemnation from the Indian government.The government had since been in touch with authorities in Afghanistan for his release and also to ensure the safety, security and well-being of the minority community in Afghanistan.The abduction followed the killing of around 30 members of the Sikh community in a terror attack on a place of worship in Kabul on March 25. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State, though Indian officials pointed out the role of Haqqani Network and Lashkar-e-Taiba.Afghanistan’s Sikh minority has dwindled to a few hundred families after being targeted by the Taliban and other groups in recent decades. Most of the Sikh minorities in Afghanistan live in Kabul, Jalalabad and GhazniPost his abduction, the Afghan Sikh community in the United States had also urged for his release and requested the Indian government to grant them legal entry with long-term residency multiple-entry visa.In a letter on May 4, Congressman John Garamendi, co-chair of the Sikh Caucus, and 25 others stated that the Sikh community continues to be under “grave” threat from Islamic State terrorist attacks directed at Sikhs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikh-community-leader-nidan-singh-sachdeva-released-from-captivity-in-afghanistan/story-Bi54Y6yDzPTRngp2SbC3eJ.html

Only essential services and health workers will be allowed to function,” CM said, adding that one oxygen cylinder will be kept in all police stations for people to use it in emergency situations.

18-07-2020||India||In Bihar, 14,000 migrants seek counselling to overcome lockdown blues||Nearly 14,000 migrant labourers who returned to their natives places in Bihar from other states during the Covid-19 lockdown have sought counselling and psychological help from mental health professionals in the last three and a half months, shows the data of the Bihar State Health Society (BSHS).Most of them were reported to have been suffering from depression, anxiety, apprehensions and sleeplessness.Among 38 districts of the state, Banka had the maximum number of such cases. Altogether 1,847 migrants in Banka have sought counselling facility between April and first fortnight of July this year.Muzaffarpur was next where 1,744 migrants consulted counsellors during this period, followed by Gopalganj (1,539) and Arwal (1,348).Araria reported the minimum number of such cases (15) while the capital Patna reported a modest 253 cases.The BSHS has been running a mental health programme for the migrants affected by Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. In April this year, it had started ‘Ummeed’, a counselling and medical treatment facility for mental health problems among migrant labourers, people in health quarantine and isolation centres. All district hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres and quarantine centres and isolation centres were asked to provide necessary counselling and psychiatrist support services to Covid-19 affected people. “Since April 5 to July 16, 2020, we have 13,930 mental health cases. But the actual number must be much higher. We all know that a large number of people don’t understand they need counselling and mental support services. Many migrant labourers may not be aware of this,” Preeti Bajpai, state consultant, mental health programme of the BSHS, said.“We also involved ASHAs (accredited social health activists) or the community workers and ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwives) who are the village level female health workers, the first contact person between the community and health services. They intimate us about the cases,” she said.Nipurnh Gupta, communication officer, Unicef, said these ASHAs and ANMs were given online orientation training. “They are also making migrants aware about mental health treatment facilities created for them by the government,” she said.Dr Rajesh, the monitoring and evaluation officer, mental health programme at the BSHS, said the effort has been to reach migrants located even in remote areas “We knew the loss of income and jobs among them, insecurities and isolation would affect their mental health,” he said. To mitigate all this, there was the need of mental health services, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-14-000-migrants-seek-counselling-to-overcome-lockdown-blues/story-jxQmhahb6CU0gpqKN5jjkL.html

Dubey’s escape was aided by a crowd that outnumbered the policemen, who were taking him to the police station, reveals an old FIR, a copy of which is in HT’s possession.The police had arrested him in two cases of attempt to murder and violence from Bikru village, which then fell under Shivli police station.According to the FIR filed by senior sub inspector Brijendra Singh on May 9, 1998, the crowd surrounded the police jeep and freed accused Vikas Dubey and Deepu Dubey. The two accused also assaulted the policemen with the assistance of the crowd before escaping, it claimed.The FIR noted that policemen suffered injuries and their uniforms were torn. Singh had commented that Vikas Dubey was pradhan (head) of the village and people feared him so much that no one could muster courage to testify against him. The FIR was found during the ongoing investigation into the past of the now slain gangster, who, it seems, had a history of murderous assaults on the police. IG Kanpur range Mohit Agarwal said the current status of this case in the court was being looked into.Vikas Dubey was killed on the morning of July 10, while he allegedly tried to escape from police custody, while being brought back to Kanpur from Ujjain. The dreaded gangster was nabbed while on the run after plotting a deadly ambush of eight policemen on July 3 near his house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vikas-dubey-escaped-from-police-custody-22-yrs-ago-old-fir-traces-gangster-s-past/story-LZIjeJhLxrzv3U8Y52hjzO.html

Every day the number of cases is increasing by more than around 30,000. This is really a bad situation for the country. There are so many factors connected with it but overall this is now spreading to rural areas. This is a bad sign. It now shows a community spread.”Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAccording to the latest update by the Union Health Ministry, the total confirmed cases reached 10,38,716. There are 3,58,629 active cases and 6,53,751 cured/discharged/migrated. A total of 26,273 deaths have been registered to date.Dr Monga further said, “Cases are penetrating down into towns and villages where it will be very difficult to control the situation. In Delhi, we were able to contain it, but what about interior parts of the country in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Goa, Madhya Pradesh (which may be the new hotspots)?”“All these issues are very important and the state governments should take full care and seek help of the Central government to control the situation,” Monga said.As many as 1,34,33,742 samples have been tested for Covid-19 till July 17. Of these 3,61,024 samples were tested on Friday, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said.ICMR is ramping up testing facilities regularly. At present, 885 government laboratories and 368 private laboratory chains are conducting Covid-19 tests across the country.“This is a viral disease that spreads very fast. To contain the disease there are only two options. Firstly, 70 per cent population contracts the disease and gets immune, and other is getting an immunisation,” stated Monga.Vaccination, being the greatest hope to contain Covid-19, India’s two indigenous vaccine makers would be starting human trials soon.“There has to be phases of trials then human trial, then efficacy and side effects. Also, importantly it has to be seen how long this immunity will last because most of the patients are unable to go beyond three months of immunity,” said Dr Monga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-spread-has-started-and-the-situation-is-bad-observes-ima/story-I85IQfOvsUhdV9prHsrGbI.html
18-07-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling case: Congress, BJP sharpen attack on CM Vijayan||The multi-agency team probing the Kerala gold smuggling case on Saturday carried out several raids in the state and detained many for questioning, a senior officer familiar with the developments said, adding the scope of inquiry will be widened by probing political and bureaucratic patronage to smuggling syndicates.“Without strong patronage such a thriving syndicate can’t function in the state. Our inquiry will cover terror angle, hawala and political and bureaucratic patronage also. This time we will get to the bottom of the racket,” said the official.The National Investigation Agency-led probe in the matter is generating enough political heat in the state. “We have nothing to fear. Let the guilty be punished. Some people are in a race to arrive at a conclusion but their designs will be short-lived,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, adding there was a concerted bid to tarnish the image of the government. Those who are cheering will have to repent in the end, he said criticising the opposition.The BJP and the Congress were unsparing in their criticism .“Role of two high-ranking officials in the CM’s office, his former secretary M Sivasankar and former IT fellow Arun Balachandran, are out. Now the CM can’t wash off his hands,” said BJP state president K Surendran.“Since powerful aides have gone it is time for him to follow,” said state Congress chief Mullapally Ramachandran.The customs had seized 30 kg gold from a baggage addressed to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. Later, the probe was handed over to the NIA.Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Enforcement Directorate, Intelligence Bureau and Income Tax are part of the ongoing investigation.Meanwhile, a gunman of the Kerala police posted at the United Arab Emirate consulate allegedly tried to end his life on Friday, a day after he was reported missing by his family. But the customs suspect that this accident was aimed at covering up his alleged link with the gold smuggling racket. A senior official of the customs said the gunman will be questioned after his release from the hospital.The man was working at the consular office for the last three years and before this he was posted at the immigration department at the Thiruvananthapuram airport. In the leaked call details of Swapna Suresh, second accused in the case, there were many calls to him and customs suspect he knew about the racket and accepted a share in return. The CM has denied reports that the consulting agency PricewaterHouseCoopers (PHC) was dropped from the state ‘e Mobility Hub’ project. Earlier there were reports the CPI(M) central leadership was not happy with the way the state government engaged many international consultants and contract agencies. But he denied this report saying it was sheer imagination of some newsmen.The state police had filed a cheating case against Suresh, PHC and a placement agency Vision Technology on July 13. During investigation it was found that Suresh had produced a fake degree certificate to secure a job at the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited, a state government undertaking. PHC and Vision Technology were authorised agencies responsible for verifying her educational documents, said the police. The case was registered under IPC sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) 465 forgery and 471 (using as genuine a forged document).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-congress-bjp-sharpen-attack-on-cm-vijayan/story-VJZEsjodODcsJUTl6zQ2ML.html
18-07-2020||India||Security forces kill three militants in J-K’s Shopian district||Three militants were killed in an encounter in South Kashmir’s Shopian district on Saturday morning, the army said. The shootout began after the army, police and the CRPF launched a joint operation at Amshipora village in Shopian district. “As the search and cordon operation was underway, it turned into an encounter in which three unidentified militants were killed. The militants fired from a cowshed of the lone house located in an orchard,’’ the army spokesman said.Police said that identification of the militants is underway and the DNA samples were taken from bodies of the slain militants.This was the second encounter in south Kashmir in the last 24 hours. On Friday, three Jaish-e-Mohammad militants were killed in Kulgam district including a Pakistani commander, who was identified as Waleed by the police and was believed to be an IED expert. Police said that Waleed was active in the area for the past 18 months and had escaped four cordon and search operations in the recent past.The bodies of militants are not being handed over to their family members due to the Covid-19 pandemic for the last three month.. They are instead buried in Baramulla, Kupwara and Ganderbal districts, at times in the presence of the family members.In June, security forces had killed 48 militants in various encounters in the Valley. It was the highest number of casualties that the militants had suffered in a month this year. Most of them were killed in four districts of south Kashmir. Since January this year, 136 militants have been killed in different encounters across Kashmir. Among them were top commanders of different militant outfits including Hizbul Mujahideen, operational commander, Riyaz Naikoo.The police and army has now compiled another list of the top militant commanders who are active in the Valley and according to the IG Kashmir, Vijay Kumar the militants will be neutralized.Top police officials recently said that fresh militant recruitment has come down in the first six months. However, reports from the ground suggest that despite the killing of militants in the encounters, new recruitment is still taking place, especially in south Kashmir.

The decision was taken by the Chief Minister during a special cabinet meeting at the chief minister’s office in view of rising Covid-19 cases in the state.Agriculture minister Ravindra Chaubey briefing the media after the meeting said that Covid-19 testing will be doubled by the health department in the next few days and the number of Covid-19 beds will also be increased.“The Chief Minister has decided to increase manpower like technicians, lab attendants doctors, ANMs in the health department to contain the virus,” he said. The minister further said that depending upon the situation in a district the District Collector has been authorized to impose full lockdown or curfew like closure to check the spread of the virus.“However, the collector has to inform people of the district three days prior to the curfew,” Chaubey said.“The collectors are authorized to impose complete curbs (lockdown), with the following things in mind. Firstly, it will be under Section 144 & the Epidemic Act, and shall not be called ‘lockdown’ officially but prohibitory orders. Secondly, it will be for large urban areas only, not for rural areas and thirdly the containment zones must be strictly enforced in the area where the infection has been found and not just by putting up a couple of barricades,” said a senior IAS officer present in the meeting.Earlier this week, Chhattisgarh health department issued a fresh list of red, orange, green zones, spanning 112 blocks in 25 districts, amid a spike in coronavirus (Covid-19) positive cases in the state.

It is also significant since the regional party had on Monday issued a whip directing its MLAs to take a neutral position during the present political turmoil. “We had supported the Congress in the Rajya Sabha elections on the condition that our demands related to the development of our areas will be met. We have again held discussions with the chief minister on those demands and we have been assured that the demands will be fulfilled,” BTP MLA Roat said.Earlier in the day, Gehlot received a list of demands from the BTP MLAs and their party functionaries. Gehlot later tweeted to say that BTP had announced its support to the government.Dotasara confirmed the meeting.Also Read: ‘Rajasthan paying for discord in Congress’: BJP’s Vasundhara Raje“BTP MLAs and their party leaders held discussions with the chief minister.

In a tweet, he said India will pay a huge price because of the government’s “cowardly actions”.“China has taken our land and GOI is behaving like Chamberlain. This will further embolden China. India is going to pay a huge price because of GOI’s cowardly actions,” he said in his tweet.The former Congress president tagged Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s speech in Lukung near the Pangong Tso lake in eastern Ladakh on Friday during which he said progress has been made in talks with China for a solution to the border standoff but he cannot guarantee to what extent it would be resolved.Singh went on to say that no power in the world could grab even an inch of Indian territory.On July 3, in a thinly-veiled reference to China’s attempt to intrude into Ladakh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the “age of expansionism is over” and applauded the troops posted in the Galwan Valley for showing “fire and fury” to the enemies.Rahul Gandhi has been targeting the government ever since the clash of June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese troopers dead in Galwan valley.Gandhi and the Congress party have also asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi several times to specify where the clash had occurred and if the Chinese did not intrude into Indian territory then where did the Indian soldiers die? The Congress has also accused the government of being economical with the truth about the ground situation in Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-pay-huge-price-for-govt-s-cowardice-in-ladakh-says-rahul-gandhi/story-rPzVXWazRwciYIbbnBOSTM.html

He said the accused wanted to highlight the matter to gain political mileage.Congress spokesman Patel, one of the accused in the case, said: “Two women had met me to highlight their problem some time ago. That day I had helped them connect with media persons in a bid to make them narrate their ordeal. I had not been in any touch with them since then. The accusations levelled at me by UP Police are baseless and concocted. I didn’t invite any media person to cover the unfortunate incident on Friday. The government and the state administration are trying to hide their incompetence by blaming the opposition.” “For over a year, several Congress leaders and cadres have been framed. The law and order situation in UP is in shambles. Congress leaders are being tortured for questioning the government. They are being framed and imprisoned,” he said in a press statement.“I am a soldier of Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra and state chief (Ajay Kumar) Lalluji. Truth and honesty are my virtues. All charges against me are fake and fabricated. I pray for the speedy recovery of the victims,” he said.Congress MLC (member of legislative council), Deepak Singh said: “The government is attempting to frame a Congress spokesman to hide its sins amid the worsening law and order situation in the state.”Khyati Garg, superintendent of police (SP), Amethi, also told media persons that four policemen were suspended for dereliction of their duties.The station house officer (SHO) of Jaamo police station, a beat in-charge sub-inspector (S-I) and two constables have been suspended for negligence in the case related to the victims.The SP said a departmental probe has been initiated against the four suspended police personnel in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amethi-self-immolation-case-congress-aimim-leaders-among-4-named-in-conspiracy/story-OXzdvVW63fnuIJjuiikImL.html
18-07-2020||India||Kerala unveils dual strategy to neutralise community transmissions||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan reiterated on Saturday that community transmission of Covid 19 infection had begun at two places in the state capital while adding that 60 percent of all coronavirus cases in the state could be traced to local transmissions.Vijayan’s statement comes on a day when Kerala reported 593 new Covid-19 cases and two deaths over the last 24 hours, taking the tally to 11,659 including 6,416 active cases under treatment. 173 fresh cases were reported in Thiruvananthapuram in the last 24 hours.“Community spread of coronavirus has been confirmed at two places in Thiruvananthapuram. Everyone should strictly adhere to Covid-19 guidelines to break the chain,” Vijayan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.On Friday, CM had named Poonthura and Pulluvila in Thiruvananthapuram as areas where community transmission of the disease had begun. He added that areas in the immediate neighbourhood of these places had also seen a rapid increase in the number of contact cases.In the backdrop of community transmissions, State health minister K K Shailaja announced the implementation of “cluster care” method to bring the situation under control, according to PTI. The method essentially involves strengthening of testing, treatment and quarantining inside the identified hotbeds or clusters to prevent the disease from spreading beyond a particular area.“We must keep in mind that the clusters are formed just before the community transmission,” Shailaja said in a release. A cluster is defined as an area that has witnessed an “unexpected surge in Covid-19 cases” The disease may be reported en masse in people who work or live in that particular area.According to the health minister, there are 87 clusters including 70 active clusters in Kerala. The remaining 17 are contained clusters.“Two of such clusters have reported community transmission and the people there need to cooperate with the health department,” she said.Community transmission phase of the contagion is considered dangerous since it marks a stage, when tracing the source of a new infection becomes nearly impossible, leading to a very rapid increase in positive cases.She also added that the strategy was to “break the chain” of transmission from one cluster to another by “thoroughly locking the clusters.” The minister called for more attention to containment efforts in coastal areas.Thiruvananthapuram district’s coastal areas have been divided into three critical containment zones. According to an order released by the district administration, the zones will be kept under complete lockdown from 12 midnight of July 18 to midnight of July 28 for a period of ten days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-goes-for-cluster-care-and-coastal-lockdown-to-block-community-transmissions/story-HptzBWXtnaKwvh0Px6jjCL.html
18-07-2020||India||Kerala to go in for ‘cluster care’ method to contain Covid-19 spread||As the number of Covid-19 cases in Kerala are on the rise, the state government has decided to implementa “cluster care” method to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, state health minister K K Shailaja said on Saturday. The minister said testing, treatment and quarantining will be strengthened inside the “clusters” in order to stop the spread of the virus beyond a particular area. “Those in the clusters must strictlyfollow the health protocol including wearing of masks, social distancing, handwash, use of sanitisers etc. We must keep in mind that the clusters are formed just before the community transmission,” Shailaja said in a release. A cluster is formed when there is an “unexpected surge in Covid-19 cases” at a particular area or a region. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had on Friday said that community spread had occurred in Poonthura and Pulluvila in Thiruvananthapuram and its nearby places have seen a rapid increase in the number of contact cases. The health minister said that there are 87 clusters in the state of which 70 are active clusters and 17 contained clusters. “Two of such clusters havereported community transmission and the people there need to cooperate with the health department to bringthose regions from the cluster classification,” she said. Contact tracing of the cluster is started based on the fact that there is at least one case where the source is unknown and more than two unrelated cases in an area. “It can be a market, hospital, coastal area, an institution, a ward, panchayat or a tribal area. The disease may be reported en masse in people who work or live in that particular area,” she said. She also said the state government and the health department was trying to “break the chain” of transmission from one cluster to another by “thoroughly locking the clusters.” “We need to give more attention to coastal areas.Inside the clusters, local transmission is more than 50 per cent, but outside the clusters it is below 10 per cent. We should prevent clusters forming and the community spread of the infection,” Shailaja said. She was speaking to reporters after inspecting the over 700-bed Covid-19 first line treatment centre set up at the International Convention Centre inside the Greenfield stadium here. The health department said that when a cluster is formed, a rapid response team will be set up which will engage in contact tracing and conduct testing on the basis of primary, secondary contacts. A region will be declassified as a cluster only if it is confirmed that there is no new case within 7 days after the last positive case in that area was detected. Kerala on Saturday reported 593 fresh Covid-19, of which 364 cases were through contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-go-in-for-cluster-care-method-to-contain-covid-19-spread/story-H4azaLXiZn57803bGUVh8L.html

18-07-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot claims support from regional party MLAs amid Rajasthan crisis||A regional party with two MLAs that withdrew support from the Congress government in Rajasthan has announced that it will now back chief minister Ashok Gehlot. The CM received letters of support from the Bharatiya Tribal Party this evening.“Both the Bharatiya Tribal Party of India (BTP) MLAs announced their support to the government by meeting with their state executive officials and discussing their demand,” Ashok Gehlot tweeted after the party called on him.  भारतीय ट्राइबल पार्टी (बीटीपी) के दोनों विधायकों ने उनकी प्रदेश कार्यकारिणी के पदाधिकारियों के साथ मुलाक़ात कर और अपने मांगपत्र के साथ चर्चा कर सरकार को समर्थन देने की घोषणा की। pic.twitter.com/a2783tQYDoVelaram Goghra, BTP’s Rajasthan chief, had said earlier that the party has been giving issue-based support to the Congress and if the government meets their demands, they will consider supporting it in case it comes to a floor test. He added the BTP voted for the Congress in the Rajya Sabha elections last month after the government promised to meet its demands.The two BTP members were among 101 lawmakers that attended the Congress legislature party meeting at a Jaipur hotel on Tuesday. They later left the hotel saying they would take a call on supporting the party at an “appropriate” time.BTP legislator Rajkumar Roat on Tuesday said police snatched keys to his car and that he was under detention and several people were asking him to go with them. The video soon went viral. Pilot’s social media team circulated Roat’s video to highlight how the government was harassing lawmakers. The BJP, too, cited the video to claim the government was intimidating the lawmakers.On Wednesday, Roat said he was not harassed. “...I had put out the videos, the incident was true but it was a case of mistaken identity by police. They did not recognise me,” he said.Claiming the support of over 100 MLAs, Gehlot has alleged that his former deputy Sachin Pilot has been conspiring to dislodge the government from the day of its formation in December 2018. The CM, in an interview to a TV channel, said Pilot had only 12-15 MLAs with him. With the addition of two more MLA, Gehlot, it appears, has further improved his numbers. In the 200-member house, the majority mark is 101. The BJP has 72 MLAs and has been watching the developments in the state. The Congress has accused the BJP of trying to dislodge the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-claims-support-from-regional-party-mlas-amid-rajasthan-crisis/story-bNOJZV0Vf29hRqJv0dPq4O.html

The construction will begin on the date he deems fit,” ANI quoted Kameshwar Chaupal of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust as saying.The trust met in Ayodhya earlier today especially to decide the date for beginning of the construction. It also announced that soil testing has begun for the laying of Ram Temple’s foundation.“Larsen & Toubro is collecting samples for soil testing. Drawings of the temple’s foundation will be made on the basis of the strength of soil 60 m below. Work to lay down the foundation will begin on the basis of the drawing,” news agency ANI quoted Champat Rai, General Secretary, Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirth Kshetra Trust as saying.In another important decision, the trust decided the nitty-gritty of procuring marbles and bricks for the construction.“Today it was decided that bricks will be provided by Sompura Marbles bricks. Larsen & Toubro will carry out their work and the work related to bricks will be carried out by Sompura Marbles. Together, they’ll build a grand temple,” Rai was quoted as saying by the agency.On the front of raising money for temple construction, Rai added that the trust was planning an outreach to 10 crore families across 4 lakh localities in the country after the Monsoon season gets over.Fixing a date in August for the “bhoomi poojan” for starting the construction of the temple, delayed due to the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic, was on the agenda of the meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soil-testing-for-laying-ram-mandir-s-foundation-begins-and-other-important-updates/story-ZIKQ9b66fO59wV39A26vZK.html
18-07-2020||India||Bengal govt to start measuring oxygen levels of home-quarantined Covid-19 patients||The West Bengal government will be procuring more than 10,000 oximeters to start measuring oxygen levels of home-quarantined people so that citizens could be discouraged from occupying hospital beds.The ground level health workers, including ASHA workers and civic health workers will be equipped with these oximeters along with thermal guns. They will move from door-to-door and measure the oxygen level and body temperature of people quarantined at homes and safe houses.“We have already procured around 2000 oximetres. Another 10,000 would be procured. This is a new initiative we are taking on the advice of the chief minister to discourage people from occupying hospital beds. The ASHA workers have been doing house-to-house surveys to detect ILI and SARI cases. Now they will also check oxygen levels,” said a senior official of the state health department.Current guidelines say that Covid-19 patients have to be admitted to hospitals if their oxygen saturation drops to 90% or below (normal is 95 to 100%). Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms or with critical co-morbidities are advised to get admitted in hospitals. Patients with mild symptoms are treated at home. A series of steps, starting from setting up of ‘safe houses’ and launching ‘satellite health centres’ in hospitals, have been taken to keep hospital beds free for critically ill patients.“But the demand for hospital beds is rising as the disease is spreading. Everyone wants to be admitted in a hospital even if the person is asymptomatic or having mild symptoms. We are getting calls almost every day,” said a senior bureaucrat of the state government.The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) too will purchase oximeters to randomly check the oxygen levels of residents through its ground level health workers.“While some councillors in their individual capacity have already purchased the machines and have started checking the oxygen level of quarantined people, the civic body would be purchasing oximeters to start checking the oxygen level of residents,” said Atin Ghosh, former deputy mayor and presently a member of the board of administrators that run the KMC.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has also asked housing societies to purchase oximeters so that residents can regularly check the oxygen level in their blood.“The housing societies may keep two to three oximeters in their offices so that anyone can check the level of oxygen in the blood. The number of Covid-19 cases in housing societies is rising and this would discourage people from going to hospital if their oxygen level is above the required limit,” she said earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-to-start-measuring-oxygen-levels-of-home-quarantined-covid-19-patients/story-99f9Lt1JQ9eUoRZOa3KBuO.html

Form 26AS is an auto-generated financial statement that includes taxation-related information, including details of high-value transactions. The form earlier used to give limited information related to tax deducted at source (TDS) and tax collected at source (TCS) besides certain additional information including details of other taxes paid, refunds and TDS defaults.The CBDT explained that the income tax department already receives information such as cash deposit and withdrawal from saving bank accounts, sale and purchase of immovable property, time deposits, credit card payments, purchase of shares, debentures, foreign currency, mutual funds, buy back of shares, cash payment for goods and services as per the Income-Tax Act since 2016.“Now all such information under different SFTs [Statement of Financial Transactions] will be shown in the Form 26AS,” the statement said.A finance ministry official requesting anonymity said, the faceless system aims to handhold taxpayers for ease of filing returns. It will also reduce litigations as genuine taxpayers will not miss filing any transaction in their ITRs. Besides, it will nudge such taxpayers who tend to conceal these details to make full disclosures. Archit Gupta, founder and CEO at ClearTax said the move will provide access to both filers as well as the government to the taxpayer’s complete list of financial transactions. “In the near future, details of financial transactions related to the stock markets may also be included,” he said. ClearTax is a financial technology platform providing tax and investment-related solutions.According to Gupta, ‘Form 26AS’ earlier had an Annual Information Report (AIR) of transactions. Now, it will have details of Significant Financial Transaction (SFT). “Taxpayers will have access to details of all SFT filed by specified entities against their PAN (permanent account number),” he said.CBDT said that the ‘Form 26AS’ for any taxpayer will now display fields such as type of transaction, name of SFT filer, date of transaction, single or joint party transaction, number of parties, amount, mode of payment and remarks.Gopal Bohra, partner at tax consultancy firm NA Shah Associates LLP said, “The new form will enable the taxpayer to have all important information available while preparing the tax return so that the chances of committing any error will reduce significantly.”According to Pranjal Kamra, the CEO of legal and financial service firm Finology, the new form has enlarged the scope of reporting to include financial transactions such as sale of shares, redemption of mutual funds and sale of property. “This would not only facilitate reportings but would also desist those taxpayers who inadvertently conceal financial transactions while filing their IT returns.”“The government is putting all its effort to make the economy transparent and to curb all the illegitimate financial transactions. The introduction of new form 26AS is a massive step forward in this direction,” said Kapil Rana, chartered accountant and founder of HostBooks Ltd, a cloud-based accounting platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbdt-s-new-form-26as-will-remind-taxpayers-to-file-major-financial-transactions/story-1Ud04wHZdBFVQTBAYZKq3L.html
18-07-2020||India||‘Covid-19 cases went up last week, but no community spread’: Bihar minister||With the number of Covid-19 cases witnessing a sharp hike in Bihar in the last 7-8 days, the state health system is under stress and the Nitish government is facing attack from the Opposition for allegedly fudging figures. The government is accused of not being able to ramp up testing and improve facilities. A Central team, under joint secretary Lav Agarwal, has been dispatched to take stock of the situation and work out ways to prevent further spread.In an interview with HT, Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey on Saturday said the state government was constantly increasing testing and facilities in hospitals.Here are edited excerpts from the interview: Q. A recent incident of an undersecretary in the health department breathing his last at AIIMS Patna has gone viral. There are allegations that he could not get a bed on time. Is the Bihar health system under stress?I have asked for a probe into the matter and gave clear instruction that such incidents should never recur. It is a fact that the number of Covid cases has gone up fast in the last 7-8 days, but the number of serious cases is not that high. There are around 2800-2900 beds in four dedicated Covid hospitals at AIIMS, NMCH, medical college & hospital at Bhagalpur and Gaya to deal with serious cases. Besides, there are other facilities. At present, the number of serious cases is not that high, but we are augmenting facilities.Q. The government has now allowed home quarantine for asymptomatic patients. But how would they be monitored?Various telephone numbers have been publicised through which people can seek medical advice. In case of any emergency, people can dial 102 for an ambulance, which will take the patient to the nearest hospital. There is no need to panic. The government is constantly working to upgrade facilities.Q. Opposition has been raising the issue of low testing and growing positive cases in Bihar? Is there fear of community spread?Now, we are testing over 10,000 samples every day and it will be further increased. We have also developed facilities for rapid antigen testing. Soon, more RT-PCR machines and TruNat machines will also come to add pace to testing. More testing will lead to more detection and more positive cases. But our recovery rate continues to be good. In the last 7-8 days, the number of cases has gone up, but there is nothing like community spread.Q. But many a time testing has to be closed if a couple of persons at the testing centres get infected?Yes, that is as per the protocol of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). If anyone is infected, the entire centre has to be sanitised before going ahead with further testing, else one may get faulty results.Q. Why private hospitals are not coming forward, as in other states, to supplement government efforts? Is the government planning to issue any directive?It is a matter of service. Stern directives will not solve the problem. We have again requested all the private hospitals to earmark 20% of the beds for isolation wards for Covid patients. We can only request them. We are ramping up our own facilities. All medical colleges have been asked to earmark 100 beds for Covid patients. Asymptomatic patients will also be kept at isolation centres at sadar hospitals, sub-divisional hospitals and covid care centres.Q. There is growing concern due to the increasing number of doctors, healthcare staff, officials and political leaders getting infected. Why it is happening.It is because the doctors and healthcare staff are the front-rank Corona warriors and they have higher chances of contracting infection. Politicians and officials are also coming in contact with people and so are exposing themselves.Q. What does Bihar expect from the Centre now that a team is coming?The Centre has been extending help. There are many states which are facing higher number of Covid cases than Bihar at present. The team under joint secretary will help us learn for the experiences in other states so that we will incorporate best practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-went-up-last-week-but-no-community-spread-bihar-minister/story-5ef7c89AdX36u9Hn3fsQ8N.html

He said one single super spreader, a domestic worker, was responsible for infecting at least 49 people. “There were 3 super spreaders in Udham Singh Nagar which caused a rise in Covid 19 cases there.

18-07-2020||India||74-wheel truck with 70 tonnes of cargo covers 1,700 km to reach Kerala in 10 months||A juggernaut, carrying 70 tonnes of autoclave on 74 wheels, rolled on for 10 months, covering 1,700 kilometres from Nashik, Maharashtra, and finally reached its destination on Saturday -- Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), the country’s premier space research institute, in Thiruvananthapuram.Usually, a truck, covering a similar distance spanning five states, takes a maximum of seven days to reach its destination.But the giant-on-wheel was a mean machine, which kept other vehicles off the roads when it was on the move and in every district of the five states that the heavy-duty truck covered it was escorted by police vehicles in a bid to guard the state-of-the-art machinery.The mammoth journey that had started on September 1, 2019, had its share of spin-offs. The vehicle’s arduous trek ensured pot-holed roads were repaired, overgrown branches of trees were pruned and electric poles were removed to make way for the gargantuan vehicle.While at two places, iron girders had to be installed to ensure its smooth passage across rickety bridges.The tenure of the journey also got extended because of the unprecedented raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, which led to the imposition of nationwide lockdown restrictions from March 25 in a bid to contain the pandemic.“Lockdown made our movement miserable. In Andhra Pradesh, our vehicle was held up for a month due to lockdown. Later, our agency had to intervene. But, still, it was a challenging task. Fortunately, engineers and mechanics were at hand in our team of 30 that accompanied the Volvo FM heavy-duty truck,” said Subhash Yadav, an employee of a private agency that was assigned to shift the autoclave from Nashik to VSSC.The machinery took up the bulk of the vehicle’s space because it measured 7.5 metres in height and 7 metres in width, he added.“The aftershocks of the viral outbreak were felt during the momentous journey. For instance, in Kerala, an old lady urged us to make Covid-19 vaccine rather than send rockets to space. Many of us made the entire journey on foot. It was a challenging experience for us,” said another team member.A VSSC official said the heavy machinery would not be dismantled. The autoclave would be used to manufacture large aerospace products for various programmes and it is expected to be commissioned in July after making necessary modifications, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/74-wheel-truck-with-70-tonnes-of-cargo-covers-1-700-km-to-reach-kerala-in-10-months/story-WZQe8zwFPDKavfxPoqbu0N.html

Beyond which, if students still feel the need to appear for an examination, they voluntarily may do so post-Covid,” he said.Varun Desai, Yuva Sena’s secretary, in a video released on Saturday said that despite writing letters to the UGC and the ministry of human resource development, they have not received any replies. Desai said, “Maharashtra government has already cancelled the final year examinations and we want that decision to be taken for the entire country. In the last 10-15 days, we have received messages from lakhs of students seeking our support in this.” The Congress, a coalition partner in the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra also supported the decision. Satyajeet Tambe, president of the Maharashtra State Youth Congress said that they support the decision.

The developments in the past 24 hours have put the limelight on the clips, played out by the Ashok Gehlot camp claiming it to be the evidence of the involvement of some MLAs supporting Sachin Pilot, in a plot to bring down the Gehlot government.“FIR has been registered under Sections 7 and 7A of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The audio clips will be sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for verification. After the report comes and it is verified, we will make the alleged people undergo a voice test,” Alok Tripathi, director general (DG) of Rajasthan’s anti corruption bureau (ACB) was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Read: ‘Not on speaking terms with Sachin Pilot for last 18 months’: Ashok GehlotThe senior ACB official said Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi, on Friday, handed over the audio tapes to the ACB along with names of three individuals--Bhanwar Lal, Sanjay Jain and Gajendra Singh—alleging their involvement in horse-trading attempts.The attempts by the state’s special operation group (SOG) to question Sachin Pilot and 18 of his loyalist MLAs camping at a hotel in Haryana’s Manesar town, failed yesterday since the MLAs had reportedly left the hotel by the time SOG was permitted by Haryana police to enter the premises.The SOG wanted to take voice samples of a few MLAs in Sachin Pilot’s camp.Earlier today, Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra suggested that the police in BJP-ruled Haryana had blocked Rajasthan police helping MLAs to move out.“Rajasthan SOG team was made to wait by BJP government’s Haryana police until the MLAs inside the resort in Manesar were moved out through a secret door,” he said while addressing a press conference in Jaipur today.Also Read: Even Rajiv Gandhi was handsome, spoke good English: Rebel Cong MLA takes jibe at Ashok GehlotThe party had earlier demanded the arrest of Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat, alleging that he is heard in one of the audio clips discussing the plot to bring down the Congress government in the state.Shekhawat has denied any involvement and said that the voice on the clip is not his. The BJP has sought a CBI probe to find out if phones of politicians and MLA were tapped illegally. Former Rajasthan chief minister and senior BJP leader Vasundhra Raje, too, hit out at the Congress and said that the people of Rajasthan were made to bear the brunt of the infighting in Congress. She added that the Congress was attempting to put the blame on BJP for failure to keep its own house in order.The battle on the legal front between the two factions will resume on Monday, with continuation of arguments in the Rajasthan High Court on a petition filed by Sachin Pilot seeking dismissal of disqualification notice served on him and 18 of his supporter MLAs.

A five-member squad led by Maoist party Telangana committee member Mailarepu Adellu alias Bhaskar, who carries a cash reward of Rs 25 lakh, managed to escape from the spot.On Friday, CPI (Maoist) Telangana state committee spokesperson Jagan issued a statement, accusing the Telangana police of attempting wipe out the party by targeting innocent Adivasis and arresting sympathisers.“While our party has been observing self-restraint by not indulging in assaults in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic, the security forces of the state and central government have been unleashing a reign of terror in the tribal areas,” Jagan alleged.He warned that if the police did not stop attacks on the Adivasis and Maoist party activists, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders would be punished severely in the people’s court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-step-up-combing-operation-in-north-telangana-after-maoist-activity-intensifies/story-zA7b8dgG25qFKjxSnBZvZL.html
18-07-2020||India||Sanjay Jain, linked to alleged horse trading in Rajasthan, arrested||The special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan police said Saturday that it has arrested Sanjay Jain alias Sanjay Bardia whose name purportedly figured in audio tapes linked to alleged horse trading to dislodge the Ashok Gehlot government.Jain was called for questioning on Friday on the basis of the Rajasthan chief whip Mahesh Joshi’s complaint to SOG that he was one of the three persons, whose names figured in three audio tapes that had surfaced the previous evening and was purportedly involved in horse trading. He was arrested late on Friday night charges of conspiring to topple the Congress government.“Jain was arrested on Friday night,” said Ashok Rathore, additional director general of police ATS-SOG.The SOG had booked him and two others on Friday on charges of destabilizing the government under section 124A (sedition) and 120b (criminal conspiracy of the Inidan Penal Code.Jain, who belongs to Loonkaransar town in Rajasthan’s Bikaner district, has been described as a power broker and is perceived to be close to both Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders. The BJP has called for a CBI probe into the audio tapes.Jain, whom the Congress accused of being a BJP leader, is a former block president of the Indian Youth Congress. The BJP claims Jain is still a Congress member.His father, too, was a local Congress leader and his family has been a supporter of the party for almost a decade, said a Congress supporter from Bikaner, requesting anonymity.“Jain was also appointed as the secretary of the district Congress in Bikaner (rural). He came in contact with Congress leadership in 1993 when Balram Jakhar was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) from Bikaner and he became a close aide to the veteran Congress leader. Jakhar would stay in his house in Loonkaransar while on a campaign trail, as his house was the only place in town that had an air-conditioner,” said the supporter quoted above.He said Jain was often seen at Raj Bhavan in Bhopal, when Jakhar was the Madhya Pradesh governor.A close friend of Jain said that after coming in touch with the former chief minister and BJP leader Vasundhra Raje during the 2003 assembly elections, Jain moved to Jaipur, which helped him expand his network in political circles -- cutting across party lines and bureaucracy.“Jain has developed enormous contacts in both the Congress and the BJP using his immense networking skills. He owns a beverage factory in Dubai and was planning a similar venture on his plot along the Bikarner-Jaipur highway near Sikar. His primary focus is to become rich,” his friend said.Jain had uploaded several pictures on social media flaunting his proximity with BJP top brass.Laxman Kadwasara, the former district president of Congress, Bikaner (rural), said Jain is more interested in expanding his business than politics.“Though I haven’t met him in the last few years, I have heard a lot about him,” said Kadwasara.State BJP president Satish Poonia alleged that Jain is a Congress leader. “He has been a block president of Congress in Bikaner,” he said.An SOG official said that Jain had come to Jaipur on Thursday amid the high political drama over the fate of the Gehlot government before he was called for questioning on Friday and arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanjay-jain-linked-to-alleged-horse-trading-in-rajasthan-arrested/story-Ym8Ba8eXO1A5Ie2naqaGtK.html
18-07-2020||India||Eye on China, Modi-Abe Summit could be held in October; Philippines next||India and Japan have restarted discussions to firm up dates for the annual summit between prime ministers Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe, possibly around October. The summit is expected to focus on an expansionist China that has been attempting to change the status quo on its borders with India, and in the East China Sea around the Senkaku Islands, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.The Modi-Abe summit, initially scheduled to be held last December in Guwahati, was put off due to protests in Assam over the passage of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) law. Discussions on the next date were paused after the virus that originated in China spread across the world soon after, killing over 600,000 people and grounding the world economy.But as the world suffered, China’s Xi Jinping went on an overdrive to expand its territory in the South China Sea and its land border with India. It has lately initiated the process to get its army to disengage along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh but the troop withdrawal process has been a slow and deliberate process.A defence white paper by the Shinzo Abe government released this week counted China’s aggressive moves in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and its “relentless attempts” to alter status quo by coercion as a key concern.The Abe government, which had taken a lead role in crafting the quadrilateral security dialogue process in the Indo-Pacific region, also noted that a regional cooperation framework “had not been sufficiently institutionalised” in the Indo-Pacific region. The Quad comprises the United States, Japan, India and Australia with the door open for others to join in.During the summit, India and Japan are also expected to formalise a logistics sharing pact, Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement, that would give militaries of the two countries access to each other’s bases.Japan would get access to major Indian naval bases including the Andaman and Nicobar islands, which lie near the Malacca Straits through which a large amount of Japan’s but also China’s trade and fuel supplies is shipped. It would also help India’s naval ships to send ships further to counter China’s expanding presence in the Indian Ocean. India had signed a similar agreement with the US, and has firmed up the pact with Australia, the other members of the Quad.A government official said the summit could be held in October, not earlier. It is not certain yet if PM Abe would travel to India for the summit as had been planned earlier or hold the summit meetings over video conference.India is expected to also deepen strategic ties with other ASEAN countries that have also been at the receiving end from Beijing. “We expect a meeting between PM Modi and Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte shortly,” the official said, adding that it could also be held in October. President Duterte was supposed to travel to India in March but the bilateral meeting was postponed due to the global pandemic. Apart from growing defence cooperation, India and Philippines are expected to join hands to ensure free navigation and over-flights in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-china-modi-abe-summit-could-be-held-in-october-philippines-next/story-540zSW1OKaqGjTIxTJ141O.html

The recovery rate is now 63 per cent.” Timely, proactive, and graded strategy initiatives for effective coronavirus infection management in the country, led by the Centre and implemented by the states and Union Territories, have ensured that the actual Covid-19 caseload remains manageable, it said, adding that expansion of hospital infrastructure continuously has aided in increased recoveries.Cumulatively, 1,34,33,742 swab samples have been tested till now, of which 3,61,024 were carried out on Friday raising the number of tests per million to 9734.6, the ministry said.The Centre continues to support and supplement the efforts of the state governments by sending teams of experts to areas witnessing increase in caseload, it said. With a surge in daily fresh Covid-19 cases in Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Odisha, the Union health ministry has asked these states to make renewed efforts to suppress the transmission as well as to keep case fatality rate below one per cent.With these states imposing lockdowns anew, the health ministry emphasised that the curbs should be utilised to focus on containment, surveillance and testing in the containment and buffer zones for early detection of cases and fatality management.A central team has been deployed in Bihar to assist the state in assessment of Covid-19 management and to provide all necessary support.The team comprising Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal, Dr S K Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control and Dr Neeraj Nischal, Associate Professor of medicine at AIIMS, New Delhi, will reach Bihar tomorrow.“The focus of the containment strategy remains on house-to-house survey, perimeter control activities, timely contact tracing, surveillance of containment and buffer zones, aided by effective clinical management of severe cases through a standard of care approach,” the ministry said.The latest testing strategy of the Indian Council of Medical Research allows all registered medical practitioners to recommend testing. RT-PCR tests and rapid-antigen point of care tests, boosted by TruNat and CBNAAT have contributed to a surge in the number of samples tested, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-recoveries-exceed-active-cases-by-2-95-lakh-says-health-ministry/story-DBQCV9IpP2kqOjEOCCFZGM.html
18-07-2020||India||‘Rajasthan paying for discord in Congress’: BJP’s Vasundhara Raje||It is unfortunate that the people of Rajasthan have to pay for the infighting in Congress, former BJP chief minister Vasundhara Raje tweeted on Saturday, commenting on the crisis that has seen two top leaders from the ruling party in the state squabbling in public. #RajasthanFirst pic.twitter.com/tkOKWCi2SzThe former CM spotlighted the coronavirus situation in the state, the locusts attack, crime against women that she said are few among many that have been plaguing the state and its people, drawing a sharp distinction with the present concerns of the state government.Raje urged the leaders from the ruling party to “not drag BJP” and its leaders’ names in this political churning in the state. The former CM also told the ruling government that the “interests of people must remain paramount”. She ended her tweet with #RajasthanFirst. BJP ally Hanuman Beniwal, who heads the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), on Thursday accused Vasundhara Raje of rallying Congress lawmakers in support of Ashok Gehlot, whose government is battling a rebellion from his former deputy, Sachin Pilot.Adding further drama to the political turmoil in the state, the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the state police registered two criminal cases after audio tapes were made public in which a rebel Congress MLA is purportedly talking to Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and a middleman about toppling the Ashok Gehlot government.The Congress alleged today that rebel Rajasthan lawmakers of the Sachin Pilot team currently camping in the BJP-ruled Haryana are now being moved to Karnataka, another BJP state. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that when the special team of the police reached the Haryana hotel to collect the voice samples of the legislators in the case of audio tapes, the police was stopped at the gates first. Then by the time the state police was allowed to enter the premises, said Khera, the lawmakers had escaped. On its part, the BJP has demanded an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the allegations made by the Congress in Rajasthan that it has audio tapes to prove that the BJP was in collusion with rebel Congress leaders to bring down the Gehlot government.CM Gehlot has been insistent that his former deputy, who ruled out that he is joining the BJP, has been working in collusion with the opposition party to bring down his government.The feud between the two leaders reached its apogee when Pilot, 42, was asked to record his statement with the police probing the case of an alleged attempt to bring down the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-paying-for-discord-in-congress-bjp-s-vasundhara-raje/story-V03tmrcJLvQVOvLLUAM1gK.html
18-07-2020||India||Twitter sent notice to reveal if any Indians were targeted in global VIP accounts hack||Indian government has issued notice to social media giant Twitter asking the microblogging website to share full details of the recent unprecedented hacking of global high-profile users accounts including information on Indian users affected by the hack and the data impacted, according to news agency PTI.The agency quoted its sources to claim that the Indian government’s cyber security agency CERT or Computer Emergency Response Team has contacted Twitter for information on the sensational incident that has raised serious questions on the security of data on extremely popular social media platform and triggered investigations by the federal police of the United States.CERT is the nodal national agency for responding to computer security incidents.In a massive hacking incident, around 130 high-profile accounts including those of democrat leader and US presidential nominee Joe Biden, former US President Barack Obama, entrepreneur Elon Musk, philanthropist and business magnate Bill Gates and rapper Kanye West were compromised earlier this week.The New York Times has, however, reported that the hackers were young men and had no links to state or organized crime. The paper’s claim is based on interviews conducted with four hackers, involved in the incident, who shared logs and screenshots to back up their accounts of the sensational security breach.The paper claimed the attacks were not the handiwork of a single country like Russia or a sophisticated group.Twitter, which is conducting a parallel investigation into the incident, had earlier tweeted to say that approximately 130 accounts were targeted and for around 45 of these accounts, the hackers were able to gain control and then send Tweets.Fake posts were sent from several of these accounts including those belonging to Apple, Uber, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Barack Obama on Wednesday asking people to send virtual currency bitcoin into email accounts mentioned by the hackers.These fraudulent posts gave 30 minutes for people to send $1,000 in cryptocurrency bitcoin, promising they would receive twice as much in return.More than $100,000 worth of bitcoin was sent to email addresses mentioned in the tweets, according to Blockchain.com, which monitors crypto transactions.Twitter said it appeared to be a “coordinated social engineering attack” by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.The NY Times report claims a hacker with the name Kirk initiated the scheme with and he was the one with access to Twitter accounts.The young hackers told the paper that they stopped serving as middlemen for Kirk when he started targeting high-profile accounts.Twitter said that a small number of its employees’ credentials were hacked to gain access to the company’s internal systems through two-factor protections enabling them to log in, send tweets and reset the password for some accounts.It also confirmed that the hackers downloaded account information for eight accounts using “Your Twitter Data” tool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-sent-notice-to-reveal-if-any-indians-were-targeted-in-global-vip-accounts-hack/story-jtIrtiT57eL9QFoC7pfLbK.html

The state has seen over 200 deaths while the number of recoveries in the state is over 14,000. Coronavirus cases in Bihar are on a rise with the Centre expressing concern over the surge. The Union Health Ministry has directed the government of Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Assam to take necessary steps to suppress Covid-19 transmission and keep the fatality rate below 1 percent.The move came after a virtual meeting was held by Union Health Secretary on July 15 to review the Covid-19 situation in these states, news agency ANI reported.Also read: Community transmission at over 50% in Covid-19 clusters, says Kerala health minister“Renewed efforts are needed to suppress the transmission as well as to keep case fatality rate below 1 percent.

Singh had tagged Sachin Pilot in his tweet. हैंडसम तो पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री राजीव गांधी जी भी थे... और अंग्रेजी भी अच्छी बोलते थे...!!#BusKehRahaHu @SachinPilotThis tweet came following Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s remark on July 15, when without naming Pilot, he said leaders from new generation have become Union ministers and state chiefs without much toil.He said speaking good English, giving good bytes and being handsome is not everything.“Speaking good English, giving good bytes and being handsome isn’t everything. What is inside your heart for the country, your ideology, policies, and commitment, everything is considered,” he added.Rajasthan Congress continues to remain in turmoil after simmering differences between Sachin Pilot and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot came out in the open.On July 14, Pilot was sacked from the posts of Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister and state PCC president.Gehlot has blamed the BJP for attempting to destabilise the state government by poaching MLAs.A controversy had broken out in Rajasthan after Special Operation Group (SOG) sent a notice to Pilot to record his statement in the case of alleged poaching of Congress MLAs in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/even-rajiv-gandhi-was-handsome-spoke-good-english-rebel-cong-mla-takes-jibe-at-sachin-pilot/story-I6sOYSF1L7VOCvCKaml6LL.html
18-07-2020||India||‘Not on speaking terms with Sachin Pilot for last 18 months’: Ashok Gehlot||In a big reveal, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has said he has not been on talking terms with his former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot since the past 18 months and that Pilot was plotting to topple his government from the first day. However, the CM also added that if the rebel Congress leader, who insists he is not joining the BJP, were to come back to the party, “he will welcome him with a hug”.In an interview to a TV channel, Gehlot said, “There was no dialogue between us since the last one and a half years. A minister who doesn’t talk to the chief minister, doesn’t take his advice, keeps no dialogue with him... There can be opposition but dialogue is necessary in a democracy,” he said.Claiming the support of over 100 MLAs, Gehlot said Pilot has been conspiring to dislodge the government from the day of its formation in December 2018. The CM said Pilot had only 12-15 MLAs with him.“My government is sitting with over 100 MLAs but you want to topple that and form a government with support of the BJP. People will never forgive you,” Gehlot said.The CM said the entire matter was very unfortunate and the internal quarrel should have been resolved internally. “If you do politics in connivance with your rivals then what is left in democracy,” he said.On the notice issued by the Special Operations Group of the Rajasthan police over alleged attempts to bribe the MLAs before the Rajya Sabha elections to topple the state government, Gehlot said notices have been served, even one to him, but an environment is being created that poor Pilot has got a notice.“Our party is the complainant and 10-12 notices have been served. We have not named him. We have said there was a conspiracy by the BJP to topple the government, why is he going around giving clarifications?” said Gehlot.The CM said Pilot and his MLAs had planned to flee on June 10 but Gehlot learnt of their plan and thwarted it and had to keep all MLAs under lockdown in a resort.“They were planning to leave at 2 am. I had to save the government. I woke up all the collectors at 1 am and I asked all party leaders to reach Jaipur the next day and almost all of them reached. Then these people realised the truth and started saying there was no conspiracy and there was no need for placing MLAs under lockdown. But I had proof then and I have proof now,” he said.Gehlot said Pilot initially wanted to join the BJP but his MLAs were not willing so he thought of forming a third front, a new party to finish the Congress in Rajasthan.Referring to Pilot and BJP MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, who quit the Congress three months back, Gehlot said the younger leaders should show patience and trust the leaders.“You should not betray the party, the party has given you so much. I have been a three time central minister, three time PCC chief, three time AICC general secretary and three time CM because I went through the grind in the NSUI and Youth Congress. Leaders from our generation worked hard and stayed loyal to the party and its ideology and so we are where we are today,” said Gehlot.The Congress veteran underlined that he had become chief minister because people wanted it and it was eventually decided by the high command. “If I felt that the public and MLAs were not with me, I would have myself told the high command,” he said.“People say we are seniors now and we should sit at home. But this talk is irrelevant. We too were juniors when we joined and we are still active today. Now people say they should sit at home. If we leave politics, what will we do?” he said.Asked what would happen if Sachin Pilot were to return to the Congress, Gehlot said he would welcome him with open arms. “He was three years old when I became MP for the first time. I have ties with his family going back decades. I will welcome him with a hug.”Asked if there was a question mark on the leadership of Rahul Gandhi as leaders perceived close to him were leaving the party, Gehlot said: “There’s no question mark on his leadership but on the thought process of these leaders.”He said these younger leaders have not learnt to rough it out in politics but have got a chance due to the untimely demise of their fathers.On Rahul Gandhi’s statement that those who want to leave are welcome to go, Gehlot said he supported it. “Those who want to leave, should leave. Those who do not have commitment towards the party... they are liabilities who are just waiting to grab posts... those who are committed don’t get a chance. Those who are opportunists and traitors, if they leave then a new form of the party will come forth,” said Gehlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-on-speaking-terms-with-sachin-pilot-for-last-18-months-ashok-gehlot/story-39B8u59XTh6m3rRIlvEZkO.html
18-07-2020||India||Covid took ‘gigantic form’ in UP as govt didn’t pay attention to testing, contact tracing: Priyanka Gandhi||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday attacked the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over the rapid rise in coronavirus cases, alleging that the disease has taken a “gigantic form” as the Yogi Adityanath dispensation did not pay attention to key containment measures such as testing and contact tracing. The Congress general secretary has been criticising the state government’s response to the Covid-19 crisis, alleging that it is indulging in propaganda, instead of dealing with the pandemic. “Despite almost three months of lockdown and all claims of the UP government, coronavirus cases have increased sharply in 25 districts of UP in July,” she said in a tweet in Hindi. There has been a jump of 200 per cent in Covid-19 cases in three districts of UP, 400 per cent in three districts and above 1,000 per cent in one district, Priyanka Gandhi said. “According to media reports, 70 per cent of the Covid-infected people in Prayagraj died within 48 hours of testing positive,” she said. “We were afraid of this and therefore, at the beginning itself, we had written a letter to the Chief Minister of UP and gave constructive suggestions in this context and also raised the issue of maximum testing,” she said. The disease has taken this “gigantic form” because of the lack of attention to testing, delay in giving reports, juggling of data and not doing contact tracing properly, Priyanka Gandhi alleged. The UP government has no answers on these issues, she added. Uttar Pradesh on Friday reported 38 deaths, its highest single-day spike in coronavirus fatalities, raising the toll to 1,084 while 1,919 fresh cases pushed the infection tally to 45,363, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-took-gigantic-form-in-up-as-govt-didn-t-pay-attention-to-testing-contact-tracing-priyanka-gandhi/story-0q5gjRuZ3Aafy8X5RnA7uN.html

We are thoroughly locking the clusters. We need to give more attention to coastal areas,” she said.Kerala had seemed to get a hold on the spread Covid-19 and brought down the number of active cases to below 100 in the first week of May before fresh cases began to rise as expatriates and people working in other states began returning home. In the last couple of weeks, new cases of Covid-19 have risen exponentially taking the state’s tally to over 11,000 and the number of active cases to more than 6,000.On Friday, Kerala reported the highest single-day spike so far with 791 new cases of Covid-19.

We are extremely proud of these brave and courageous soldiers who are defending our country in every situation,” the defence minister tweeted.Singh also tweeted several photographs and a video interacting with Indian Army soldiers. जो बोले सो निहाल... pic.twitter.com/PK578l7MonBefore that, he visited the holy cave of Amarnath, considered to be one of the holiest shrines in Hinduism, and spent about an hour at the temple complex.“Feeling extremely blessed after praying at Shri Amarnathji Holy Cave in Jammu and Kashmir,” he tweeted later along with a video which showed him praying with several army officials.His trip to the holy cave comes on the second day of his visit to Jammu and Kashmir.

18-07-2020||India||Rajasthan crisis: Accused held by SOG shared proximities with BJP, Congress||The special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan Police arrested Sanjay Jain alias Sanjay Bardia late at night on Friday on charges of toppling the Congress-led government.Earlier in the day, Jain was called for questioning on the basis of the Rajasthan chief whip Mahesh Joshi’s complaint that he was one of the three persons, whose names figured in three audiotapes that had surfaced the previous evening and were purportedly involved in horse-trading to dislodge the Ashok Gehlot-led government.Jain, who belongs to Loonkaransar town in Rajasthan’s Bikaner district, is a power broker and is perceived to be close to both Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders.Jain, whom the Congress has accused of being a BJP leader, is a former block president of Indian Youth Congress.Also read| Rebel Rajasthan lawmakers being moved to BJP’s Karnataka: CongressHis father, too, was a local Congress leader and his family have been a supporter of the party for almost a decade, said a Congress supporter from Bikaner, requesting anonymity.“Jain was also appointed as the secretary of the district rural Congress in Bikaner. He came in contact with Congress leadership in 1993, when Balram Jakhar was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) from Bikaner and he became a close aide to the veteran Congress leader. Jakhar would stay in his house, whenever he visited Loonkaransar, as his home was the only place in town that had an air-conditioner,” said the supporter quoted above.He said Jain was often spotted at Raj Bhavan in Bhopal, when Jakhar became the governor of Madhya Pradesh (MP).A close friend of Jain said that after coming in touch with the former chief minister and BJP leader Vasundhra Raje during the 2003 assembly elections, Jain moved to Jaipur, which helped him to expand his network in political circles -- cutting across party lines -- and also bureaucracy.Also read: BJP demands CBI probe into audio tapes released by Congress amid Rajasthan crisis“Jain has developed enormous contacts in both the Congress and the BJP using his immense network skills. He owns a beverage factory in Dubai and was planning a similar venture on his plot along the Bikaner-Jaipur highway near Sikar. His primary focus is to become rich,” his friend said.Jain has uploaded several pictures on social media flaunting his proximity with BJP leaders.Laxman Kadwasara, the former district president of Congress, Bikaner (rural), said Jain is more interested in expanding his business than politics.“Though I haven’t met him in the last few years, but I keep hearing a lot about him,” said Kadwasara.State BJP president Satish Poonia alleged that Jain is a Congress leader. “He has been a block president of Congress in Bikaner,” he said.A SOG official said that Jain had come to Jaipur from Bikaner on Thursday amid the high political drama over the fate of the Gehlot government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-crisis-accused-held-by-sog-shared-proximities-with-bjp-congress/story-mvFXxzn0ISvJN7D0ToZpGL.html

The government rates export houses on the basis of their performance and accord them one to five stars.The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has instructed its officials to verify the correct refund of input tax credit (ITC) by such risky exporters on the basis of pre-defined risk parameters, he added.According to the official, while CBIC is focusing on quick disbursal of pending refunds to exporters, it also uses data analytics to identify “risky” exporter entities that take input tax credit fraudulently and monetise it by paying Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) and claiming a refund on that. Imports of goods and services are treated as inter-state supplies and attract IGST.“The verification exercise is aimed at preventing unscrupulous exporters from defrauding the state exchequer and bringing a bad name to the exporting community at large,” he said.CBIC has, however, assured all genuine exporters that they would continue to get their refunds in a timely manner in a fully automated environment, he said.The official said a total of 7,516 exporters figure in the risky exporters’ list to date. “IGST refund worth Rs 1,363 crore is suspended in respect of 2,830 risky exporters. Adverse reports have been received in respect of 2,197 risky exporters,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-blocks-fraudulent-gst-refund-claims-worth-rs-1-875-crore/story-ROVXRgu0dDv8N3wi6S8EAM.html

18-07-2020||India||BJP MLA files FIR against Surjewala, Dotasra for allegations against Gajendra Singh Shekhawat||Laxmikant Bhardwaj, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader from Rajasthan, has filed a police complaint against Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala and new state Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra for naming Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in an alleged bid to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led government.On Friday, Surjewala at a press conference had alleged that three audiotapes, which had surfaced the previous evening and quickly went viral on social media, had unmasked the BJP’s bid to unseat the democratically elected government.He said in the audiotapes revealed that the rebel Congress member of legislative assembly (MLA) Bhanwarlal Sharma, who has since been suspended, BJP leader Sanjay Jain and Union minister Shekhawat were making deals to topple the Gehlot government.Also read: BJP demands CBI probe into audio tapes released by Congress amid Rajasthan crisisHT could not independently verify the authenticity of the three audiotapes.The special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan Police filed two first information reports (FIRs) against Shekhawat and the other two leaders, who have been accused by the Congress and on the basis of a complaint filed by the chip whip of Rajasthan assembly Mahesh Joshi, shortly after Surjewala’s allegations.The BJP has consistently denied any role in the horse-trading or a bid to overthrow the Gehlot government and has maintained that it’s the Congress’s internal power struggle for which the opposition party has needlessly been dragged into. Shekhawat, too, has denied that it was his voice caught on the audiotape and offered to co-operate for any probe.On Friday night, Bhardwaj, along with BJP leaders Surendra Singh Naruka and Ashok Shekhawat, filed a complaint in the Ashok Nagar police station in Jaipur against Surjewala, Dotasra, and Joshi, alleging that they were making provocative and insulting statements against BJP leaders on the basis of which the SOG had filed fake cases under section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Shreemohan Meena, station house officer (SHO), Ashok Nagar police station, said that the complaint was received on Friday night and it is being looked into.Bhardwaj has demanded that the Congress leaders’ arrest under Sections 469 (forgery for the purpose of harming reputation), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 195 (giving or fabricating false evidence), 500 (punishment for defamation), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 505 (statements conducting to public mischief), 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) and 166A (public servant disobeying law) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Also read: Mayawati wades into phone tapping row in Rajasthan, seeks President’s ruleIn the complaint, Bhardwaj said Surjewala, Dotasra, and Joshi have been making baseless and provocative statements to tarnish the BJP’s reputation.He alleged that the Congress is deliberately blaming the BJP to divert the people’s attention from the party’s ongoing internal power struggle.He further alleged that a conspiracy was hatched by Lokesh Sharma, officer on special duty (OSD) to Gehlot with the intent to tarnish BJP’s reputation and fake audiotapes were made, depicting that his party leaders were enticing rebel Congress lawmakers with crores of rupees to switch sides.Bhardwaj said MLA Sharma had shared the three audiotapes with media persons through WhatsApp at around 8:25 pm on Thursday.A report in a local daily had also reported that the audiotapes were released by Sharma, said Bhardwaj.Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said: “The BJP was conspiring to overthrow the Gehlot government. Now, it has resorted to making all kinds of allegations against us because it has been exposed.”The Gehlot government has plunged into a political turmoil following a revolt by Sachin Pilot, who has since been sacked from the dual posts of deputy chief minister, Rajasthan, and state Congress president.Pilot and 19 rebel Congress lawmakers, who owe allegiance to him, have been camping at ITC Grand Bharat Hotel in Manesar, Haryana that has emerged as a playground for political parleys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mla-files-fir-against-surjewala-dotasra-for-allegations-against-gajendra-singh-shekhawat/story-DTTBGFKdWj6hQffoXilYyK.html

18-07-2020||India||Rebel Rajasthan lawmakers being moved to BJP’s Karnataka: Congress||The Congress on Saturday alleged that rebel Rajasthan lawmakers of the Sachin Pilot team currently camping in the BJP-ruled Haryana are now being moved to Karnataka, another BJP state.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that when the Special Operations Group of the Rajasthan police reached the Haryana hotel to question the legislators in the case of audio tapes - where BJP leaders, including Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, can be heard conspiring with MLAs from the Pilot camp to topple the state government - the lawmakers gave the police a go-by. The state police has registered two FIRs in the matter involving audiotapes. Govind Singh Dotasra, the new Rajasthan Congress unit chief, also alleged that the special team of the Rajasthan police was made to wait by BJP’s Haryana police unit until the MLAs inside the resort were moved out. The police arrived at the hotel on Friday evening to collect voice samples of the leaders heard scheming in the offending tapes about bringing down the Gehlot government.The Congress spokesperson once again reached out to rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot, who has maintained that he is not joining the BJP, and underscored that the party doors are not closed on him. At the same time, he questioned why are celebrated BJP lawyers representing him and the dissident MLAs camping in the BJP-ruled state.A short while earlier, the BJP demanded an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the allegations made by the Congress in Rajasthan that it has audio tapes to prove that the BJP was in collusion with rebel Congress leaders to bring down the Gehlot government.In another development, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati weighed in on the alleged phone tapping row in Rajasthan and accused chief minister Ashok Gehlot of having acted illegally and called for President’s rule in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebel-rajasthan-lawmakers-being-moved-to-bjp-s-karnataka-congress/story-nLCn4uHjq2bLyxGlxyRc5K.html
18-07-2020||India||Rajasthan political crisis: ACB files case against another rebel Cong lawmaker||The Anti-corruption Bureau (ACB) on Saturday registered a case against rebel Congress lawmaker from Sardarshahr Bhanwarlal Sharma, one Gajendra Singh and power broker Sanjay Jain under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988. Sharma, who has since been suspended by the Congress, belongs to sacked Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s camp and is allegedly one of the kingpins to make a concerted bid to dislodge the Ashok Gehlot-led government.A day earlier these three persons were booked by the special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan Police on the basis of a complaint filed by the chief whip of Rajasthan assembly Mahesh Joshi.“A case has been registered against Sardarshahr MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma, Gajendra Singh and Sanjay Jain under Section 7 (public servant accepts or attempts to take bribe) and 7A (public servant obtaining undue advantage) of the PC Act, 1988, on the basis of a complaint filed by chief whip of Rajasthan assembly, Mahesh Joshi,” said an ACB official.The basis of the complaint is the surfacing of three incriminating audiotapes on Thursday evening, which quickly went viral on social media amid the uncertain fate of the Ashok Gehlot-led government following a protracted power tussle with Congress rebel Pilot’s faction.In one of the audiotapes, a rebel Congress lawmaker, who Joshi claims to be Sharma, is purportedly talking to a middleman and a person named Gajendra Singh about toppling the Gehlot government.The ACB official said Joshi has identified Sharma because he has been familiar with his voice, as he has been associated with the party for many years. However, he has been unable to identify the two accused. “His complaint was based on the three audiotapes of purported conversations that elaborate the bid to destabilise the Gehlot government,” the official added.HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the three audiotapes.While lawmaker Sharma, who is the eye of the raging political controversy, is incommunicado, as his mobile phone is switched off.The SOG arrested Sanjay Jain alias Sanjay Bardia late at night on Friday on charges of toppling the Congress-led government.“Jain was arrested under section 124A (sedition) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code (IPC),” said a SOG official.While in another audiotape, Vishvendra Singh, who is also a Pilot supporter and a member of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLA), can be heard purportedly speaking to another agent in his bid to topple the Gehlot government.It could be heard that one person is talking about more legislators are needed to dislodge the Gehlot government and another person exuded confidence that the current dispensation would not last long.Another conversation estimated that the Gehlot government’s longevity is not more than 10-15 days.The SOG is also investigating another case related to sedition against two persons, who have been arrested, on the basis of intercepts of two mobile phones that pertain to an alleged bid to oust the Gehlot government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-political-crisis-acb-files-case-against-another-rebel-cong-lawmaker/story-nDEAfItVSCkxtCBHH3Qw3N.html

18-07-2020||India||‘Fits the bill’: How Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has emerged in Rajasthan politics||From being at the frontline of the BJP’s offensive against the Ashok Gehlot government to being accused of playing a key role in the alleged conspiracy to dislodge the Congress dispensation, Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has come to the fore as the central figure in Rajasthan’s political space.Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala accused Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the member of Parliament from Jodhpur, during a media address on Friday of being caught on tape conspiring with rebel Congress legislators to bring down the Gehlot government.Shekhawat, the Union water minister, has denied the charge and sought a probe against, asserting that it was not his voice on the tapes.The 52-year-old’s presence as the key player in the political events unfolding in Rajasthan is being read as an indication of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s high command’s decision to give new leadership a chance to make its presence felt in the state. Lending weight to this perception is the comparison being drawn between Shekhawat’s all-out offensive and the telling silence of former chief minister and BJP heavyweight Vasundhara Raje.The former chief minister has been conspicuous by her silence on the political controversy that has erupted in the state.A BJP functionary speaking on the condition of anonymity said the process of cultivating a new and younger set of leaders has already been set in motion and Shekhawat’s “prominence” in the state’s politics is in line with the party’s decision to encourage younger leaders.“There are leaders who have had several terms in positions of authority and it is only natural that a newer line of leaders is allowed to take the place going forward. But it does not mean that the senior leaders are being dispensed with. Otherwise, a Shivraj Singh Chouhan would not have been given a fourth term as CM,” the functionary cited above said.Raje’s silence notwithstanding, her clout in the state has been crucial to the party’s fate at the hustings. It was Raje’s support base that helped her have her way in deciding the party’s state unit president, even as the central leadership had preferred Shekhawat.However, there have been questions whether the tape controversy put a dent in the minister’s graph that seemed to be on the incline.A party colleague, who did not want to be named, said allegations and counter-allegations are part of the political process and Shekhawat has created a space for himself in the state as well as at the national level.“He was picked to head a ministry that has some critical work cut out for it, considering how water for all is a priority of the central government. He is also well versed in the RSS ideology and with the guidance of the central leadership, we will overcome the challenges,” the second functionary said.Rajasthan-based political commentator Narayan Bareth said the BJP leadership has been trying to infuse fresh blood in the state’s political unit and Shekhawat fits the bill. “He is an ideal candidate, he has roots in the RSS and is courteous to senior leadership and his caste also works in his favour,” Bareth said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fits-the-bill-how-gajendra-singh-shekhawat-has-emerged-in-rajasthan-politics/story-dSqoOlQzQSHVJqBG50ZBEK.html

He had sought parole to attend to his critically ill sister, but the jail authorities rejected the plea on the ground that he had not submitted any proof that substantiated her illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-impediment-in-granting-temporary-parole-to-pocso-convicts-says-bombay-hc/story-pa3iKW2ORVL1VcVYWOgBfK.html

This is the formal beginning of the temple construction for which invites have been sent out,” ANI quoted another source as saying.Ved Prakash Gupta, the BJP legislator in Ayodhya, said efforts are on to bring the Prime Minister to Ayodhya to inaugurate the construction of Ram Mandir.Gupta said if the Prime Minister comes to Ayodhya, its destiny will change and the dream of making Ayodhya like the Vatican City will come true.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-s-construction-date-plan-on-agenda-as-trust-members-meet-today/story-PZ7FAKQMjxpxE6XLhoS5yO.html
18-07-2020||India||Bombay HC to hear PIL challenging clearances for highway, railway expansion||The Bombay high court (HC) at Goa has taken cognisance of a public interest litigation (PIL), challenging the approvals granted by the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) and its state counterpart for three major infrastructure projects that are likely to cause adverse environmental impact, and directed the Chief Wildlife Warden, Goa and other state government authorities to respond to the petition by July 24, the next date of hearing.The three infrastructure projects are the double-tracking of South Western Railways, the expansion of national highway (NH) 4-A and a 400 kilo-volt power transmission line, whose 3.5-kilometre stretch will pass through the protected areas of Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary in a bid to augment power supply between Goa and Karnataka.The projects will cut across the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and the Mollem National Park, an integral part of Goa’s nature and hinterland tourism, and are set to claim 170 hectares (ha) of pristine forestland in the ecologically fragile Western Ghats.Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and the Mollem National Park are Goa’s oldest and largest bio-diverse reserve and are home to many tourist attractions such as the 12th Century Tambdi Surla temple carved out of basalt rock, gurgling Devil’s Canyon, and Dudhsagar Falls.The PIL, filed by the Goa Foundation, has alleged that the approvals are in violation of the mandate given by Article 48A of the Constitution and the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and are also contrary to public policy and the recommendations made by NBWL, which comes under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).“The mandatory prior approval of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has also not been obtained,” the plea stated.“The approvals have been granted without proper consideration and examination of the proposals and studies submitted. The environmental impact assessments of the projects, wherever done, have been shoddily carried out, with little or no proper evaluation on the impact on the wildlife habitat, including its biodiversity. No cumulative impact assessment of the three projects collectively has been carried out,” it added.The petition prayed for quashing the approvals that have been granted by the authorities concerned.The railway project is the biggest of the three infrastructure ventures, whose impact is likely to be felt in 113.857 ha of forestland in the protected area and felling of 18,541 trees.The second project -- the four-laning of the existing two-lane highway (NH—4A) -- that was constructed by the Portuguese colonial government between Panaji in Goa and Belgavi in Karnataka will cost another 31.015 ha of forestland and the felling of 12,097 trees.Lastly, the power project, which proposes to provide additional electricity feed to Goa from the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL).The projects, which have been in limbo for the past six years for pending mandatory clearances, were approved during the 57th meeting of the standing committee of the NBWL on April 20. The meeting was held via video-link amid the nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The South Western Railway authorities have submitted an undertaking and have made provisions for eight underpasses for the crossing of wild animals in consultation with the state forest department, but these concessions have failed to impress the environmentalists and activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-to-hear-pil-challenging-clearances-for-highway-railway-expansion/story-2VkfVxDTfAy4RLXhtjeCpK.html

The party also demanded an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the allegations made by the Congress in Rajasthan it has audio tapes to prove that the BJP was in collusion with rebel Congress leaders to bring down the Gehlot government. “Is phone tapping not a legal issue? Were the standard procedures laid down followed for phone tapping? The chief minister should answer if the state machinery was misused and if there is a veiled emergency in the state,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said during a press conference. Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala had briefed the media on Friday about the existence of tapes where BJP leaders including Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat can be heard conspiring with rebel MLAs from the Sachin Pilot camp to topple the state government. Surjewala’s allegations were refuted by the BJP as well as Shekhawat, who asserted that the voice on the purported tapes was not his.Patra alleged that there is a conspiracy within the Congress party and the blame is being pinned on the BJP. “Our morality is crystal clear and we work as per the Constitution. Which is why we want a CBI probe,” Patra said.“These are serious questions that we want to ask the Rajasthan Congress and Ashok Gehlot,” the BJP tweeted as well.“1. Was phone taping done? The Congress govt in Rajasthan must answer. 2. Is it not a sensitive and legal issue, if phone taping has been done? 3. Assuming that you’ve taped phones, was the SOP followed? The people of Rajasthan want to know whether their privacy has been compromised. 4. Did the Congress govt in Rajasthan use unconstitutional ways to save themselves when they found themselves cornered? 5. Is phone of any person who is related to politics is being tapped?” it asked.Rajasthan police’s Special Operations Group (SOG) on Friday registered two first information reports (FIRs) alleging a conspiracy to topple the Congress government in the state.The FIRs came the party’s chief whip Mahesh Joshi lodged a complaint on Thursday night citing three audio tapes, purportedly of conversations detailing the plot.Soon after the FIRs were registered -- with several charges including “sedition” -- the Congress demanded the arrest of Union water minister Shekhawat, rebel Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma, and alleged middleman Sanjay Jain. The Congress also suspended Sharma and former tourism minister Vishvendra Singh from the party and sought an explanation about the tapes.HT could not independently verify the veracity of the tapes. The tapes were shared with media persons over WhatsApp from unverified numbers.The FIR and the charges come in the middle of a raging political battle in the state between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-demands-cbi-probe-into-audio-tapes-released-by-congress-amid-rajasthan-crisis/story-5UCDSalfbdcGn9tPJM0cUJ.html

After municipal workers refused to conduct the last rites, we requested the Pratirodhi Bondhus, and the five youths volunteered,” Bhaskar Pegu, Tinsukia’s district deputy commissioner, said.The five men, all college students, are now under quarantine and awaiting their swab test results for Covid-19. Once that comes, they want to return to helping others during the coronavirus pandemic as well as the floods ravaging most districts of the state.“I’ve never done last rites. But the moment I heard no one was coming forward to perform the last rites of the deceased doctor, I volunteered. It felt nice to be associated with the task,” a 19-year-old, one of the five volunteers, said on condition of anonymity.The need for a dedicated group of volunteers engaged in non-medical activities related to Covid-19 who can support the local administration and the frontline workers was felt a few months ago when the pandemic first struck Assam.Since the state is ravaged by floods each year, the volunteers were also expected to help the disaster management authorities in the districts in managing Covid-19 vis-à-vis floods—without any remuneration.“We came up with the idea and issued an appeal in April seeking volunteers for Covid-19 related work. There was an overwhelming response and 16,000 people came forward within 4 days,” Pankaj Chakraborty, state project coordinator of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), said.While most of the volunteers were students above 18 years of age or unemployed youths, ASDMA also received applications from doctors involved in private practice, other professionals and even popular Olympic boxer from the state, Shiva Thapa.“Besides advocacy and awareness as well as helping in Covid and flood work the aim of engaging the volunteers was to provide emotional and psychological support to senior citizens and children in these trying times and act as bridges between community and administration,” said Chakraborty.The volunteers are being engaged for a minimum of 10 days to maximum 60 days till September and were provided online training on basics of Covid-19 and hygiene, mental health and counselling and risk communication and community engagement before they started performing their assigned tasks.“While frontline workers like doctors, healthcare personnel and police are leading the Covid-19 battle, the role of these volunteers is also very commendable. In our district they are engaged in flood relief, helping police in enforcing social distancing and now even assisting with performing last rites,” Ruby Gogoi, district project officer of the disaster management authority in Tinsukia, said.Though it was not part of their assigned tasks, some volunteers also got involved in evacuating people and maintaining order when Oil India Limited’s natural gas well in Baghjan witnessed a blow out on May 27 and caught fire on June 9.Till Friday, Assam had recorded 21,864 Covid-19 cases with 14,105 recoveries and 51 deaths. Floods in the state since May have claimed over 100 lives—76 due to drowning and 26 due to landslides.According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, at present more than 35 lakh people in 28 districts are still affected by the floods and over 51,000 uprooted are taking shelter in relief camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-assam-battles-covid-19-and-floods-thousands-of-volunteers-play-crucial-role/story-fzAbUii9BKpw4QO6BmZTKL.html

The Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company has jointly developed the vaccine with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV). Twelve hospitals in different parts of the country are carrying out this test.The vaccine manufacturer has said that these are randomised double-blind clinical trials, Hindustan reported. Some of the people who have volunteered will be vaccinated and some will be given a placebo.However, neither the volunteers nor the researcher knows who has been given the vaccine. They come to know who was injected with the vaccine only after the test period is over.During the first phase of the trial, it is checked whether the people who have been vaccinated develop any adverse effect in their body.Whether the vaccine works against the coronavirus disease will not be known at this stage, which is assessed in the second stage.The hospitals where the vaccine trials have started include All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi, AIIMS Patna, King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak, Jeevan Rekha Hospital in Belgaum, Gillurkar Multispeciality Hospital in Nagpur, Rana Hospital in Gorakhpur, SRM Hospital in Chennai, Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad, Kalinga Hospital in Bhubaneswar, Prakhar Hospital in Kanpur and a hospital in Goa.ICMR had written to 12 institutes where human trials are to be held for the vaccine, Covaxin, ordering them to secure necessary approvals from internal committees and recruit people for clinical tests by July 7.Bharat Biotech is among the seven Indian firms working on Covid-19 vaccines.

While some of the top affected states in the country are showing signs of the virus slowing down, new hotspots are emerging from states like Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh where Covid-19 infections are cases on the rise.Some of the states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala, which reported a spurt in coronavirus infections initially, have now fallen further low on the tally with states like Telangana, Karnataka jumping higher. Karnataka recently overtook Gujarat as the fourth worst-hit state in the country.Besides metropolis like Mumbai and the national capital, newer hotspots are emerging in the country in cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad.A massive chunk of India’s coronavirus load comes from the top affected cities - most in Maharashtra. At least half the 330,725 active cases in the country, as of Wednesday night, were reported from just 10 cities, with a third of all such cases coming from Maharashtra.Also read: Coronavirus crisis - A million that changed India in countless waysA district- and state-wise analysis of active coronavirus infections by HT showed that urban centres, or city districts, are significantly more affected by the virus and account for a majority of the active cases; just the 10 cities account for more than 50 percent of all active cases in the country.Among the top 10 cities based on active cases, Delhi has the lowest proportion of active cases – 15.2 percent.Here’s a list of top affected cities in the country:DelhiThe national capital is among the worst hit in the country. Although the total Covid-19 cases here run in lakhs, over 1.1 lakh, the active cases in Delhi are fewer than many other badly-hit cities - over 17,000.MumbaiIndia’s financial capital and entertainment hub has been among the top Covid-19 hotspots ever since the virus first broke out in the country. It has reported nearly a lakh total cases while the active number of cases here stand at 23,948. ThaneThis is Maharashtra second worst affected city with has reported over 71,000 positive cases of coronavirus till date. The active number of coronavirus infections here 36,468.PuneWith nearly 50,000 cumulative coronavirus cases, Pune is the third worst-hit city in Maharashtra. The city has reported 29,583 active cases of coronavirus so far.BengaluruKarnataka has witnessed a dramatic surge in its Covid-19 number and is now the fourth top affected state in the country after Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu. A major chunk of its Covid-19 cases come from Bengaluru which, so far, has reported over 27,000 cases of coronavirus. The active cases in Bengaluru stands at over 20,000.Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad are among other cities across the country with a heavy of coronavirus cases. In Hyderabad, nearly 99 percent of cases reported, which over 30,000, are currently active. Tamil Nadu’s capital city Chennai has reported over 83,377 coronavirus cases till date of which over 15,000 are active in nature. Gujarat’s Ahmedabad, which has reported nearly 24,000 Covid-19 cases till date has over 15 percent of its total cases as active patients. Nearly 40 percent of Kolkata’s coronavirus cases are active. The Bengal capital has reported over 10,000 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-active-covid-19-cases-among-lowest-in-top-affected-cities-covid-19-city-tally/story-iVPsyrKCHCP6dBAwhgyfJO.html

18-07-2020||India||Goa CM Sawant on sticky wicket as pressure mounts from governor, critics over Covid-19 handling||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant faced flak for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic as the state began its first of a three-day lockdown on Friday. Besides opposition parties and civil society, which have been his regular critics, the chief minister has to now contend with Goa’s Governor Satyapal Malik, who has called on the government to plug “shortfalls” in its Covid-19 response as well as members of his own party who have begun to question the handling. Malik said late on Thursday that the “synergy” between ministers in the government was lacking and that the Covid-19 response was being held back “due to political reasons”.“I have now told them to come together and work and not criticise each other... There needs to be synergy among the ministers and among the officers. It’s not there (to the extent it should be), there needs to be more especially during a crisis,” Malik said. “Even though I am raising issues, I do not have any vested interest. I have no elections to fight. When I raise the issues, do not make it a prestige issue saying that the governor has asked questions. The governor can definitely ask. Because the one seated above the governor will ask me. And if I give wrong information, you (the chief minister) will not like it. So I ask, in order that I can have the right information and where I can make corrections, I will and the reporting that I do to those at the top, will be right,” he said.“If I mislead the PM, home minister—these days I also need to keep the president informed—it will be wrong. So what’s the hassle? This is my duty, don’t make an issue out of it. The press should also not make an issue that I have called this meeting to give them schooling,” the governor added. The comments, which came immediately after a meeting he had summoned of the chief minister, health minister and some officials, upped the pressure on Sawant who had been insisting that the state’s response to Covid-19 is more than adequate. Sawant, who for long was insisting that another lockdown would do the state no good, made an about-turn and announced Goa would undergo a three-day weekend lockdown.Insiders say the move was to placate the governor who expressed his worry about the fast surging Covid-19 cases and deaths on account of the coronavirus pandemic in the state. The lockdown, despite being announced more than 24-hours before it comes into effect, prompted panic buying by local residents, who are still scarred by Sawant’s extension of the Janata Curfew in March with his own abrupt and severe lockdown that left people no time to even buy the necessities and prompted the hashtag #Goastarves. “Today’s mad rush in markets across Goa can definitely be a corona booster, effects of which will be seen in the next eight days. People had to be informed properly in advance that grocery stores and milk will not be shut,” Dattaprasad Naik, a BJP spokesperson, said. Prompted by the governor’s remarks, the opposition stepped up its attacks on the chief minister. “It is now clear that the defective government headed by Dr Pramod Sawant has lost even the faith and trust of the constitutional head of the state. The local BJP government has lost it completely on all fronts and don’t deserve even a minute to continue in power which they grabbed by using unfair means,” Girish Chodankar, Congress’ Goa unit chief, said. Goa, which had through much of April and May recorded only seven cases all among those who were entering from outside, saw a surge in July which has only grown with the number of Covid-19 cases standing at over 3,000 and 20 deaths.The containment and micro containment zones in the state, which were only one six weeks ago, are now nearly a dozen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-sawant-on-sticky-wicket-as-pressure-mounts-from-governor-critics-over-covid-19-handling/story-dyQbyDjp7xlCC1tRqDao4J.html
18-07-2020||India||Delhiwale: A windowless poet’s pandemic poem||Hers is an extraordinary room. It is without a window. “I miss the day light... miss seeing the world outside,” admits Tanisha Saxena, talking on WhatsApp video. A Master’s student in English literature, Ms Saxena, 22, is sitting in the said room this afternoon. It is her study. Here, she often writes poems. “The absence of windows does save me from distraction, and I’m really able to concentrate on my reading and writing,” asserts the young woman.The windowless chamber, however, is not hers alone. Ms Saxena lives with parents in a three-room flat in south Delhi’s Ambedkar Nagar, and is obliged to share the room’s utility with her father, who runs a business of greeting cards. In fact, the desk in the corner is crammed with her books as well as father’s printing stuff. She rarely sits on that table. Her favoured place is the bed—a mattress laid down on the floor—with the pillow doubling up as “my true table.”Looking about herself, the woman talks of how tough it is to stay at home. She feels that people these days, on social media, are constantly talking about doing productive things while confined to home. As if there was a competition of how productive one can be while indoors. It has taken a toll on her. But she has a coping mechanism—poetry. “I feel an unbearable pressure of doing things when I actually don’t feel like doing them at all. It is then that the poems I have written help me regain my confidence.”Ms Saxena is also fast learning the fragility of things. “Earlier I would have ambitious ideas for my future; now I try to make only short-term plans.” For a long time, she was looking forward to that faraway day when she would have a job, that would enable her to make savings to fund a dream world trip. “But now it’s like... what do I have to do tomorrow.”Ms Saxena wrote a poem in the early days of the pandemic, even as she was learning to live with the “constant fear of contracting the virus.” She agreed to share it with us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-a-windowless-poet-s-pandemic-poem/story-QkpPY1e8SWErZQL6bWAxFP.html
18-07-2020||India||Eyeing national security, Uttarakhand, ITBP to improve border infrastructure||The Uttarakhand government and Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP) on Friday decided to improve critical infrastructure, promote tourism and civilian settlements in the border areas of the state keeping in mind the national security.In a meeting with chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, ITBP chief S S Deswal raised issues pertaining to reverse migration, road, mobile and power connectivity, approvals for acquiring land for ITBP infrastructures and promotion of tourism including water sports in remote areas in the backdrop of the recent border clashes with China following PLA’s incursions. Uttarakhand’s border with China extends to 350 km. The ITBP has its presence on 42 BoPs (border outposts) in Badahoti and Mana Pass.People familiar with development said Rawat has committed to work in coordination with ITBP for realisation of the objectives. Officials in Uttarakhand CM’s office, who did not wish to be named, said Rawat announced ~10 crore under chief minister border areas development project and instructed officials to ensure that the state complemented the national developmental schemes for the region.“The CM told officials that creation of infrastructure and facilities will help in stopping migration from border areas. He added that stopping this migration was important from the point of view of the country’s security,” the officials quoted above said.Several defence and strategic experts recently spoke about the need for increasing human settlements and tourism activities in border areas which could act as the second line of defence.The chief minister also instructed officials to urgently outline a project to provide power connection to ITBP posts in remote border areas in the state. He said the Central government will be requested to help set up mobile towers in these regions for uninterrupted communication. He also instructed the Dehradun district magistrate to make available 15 acre land for the setting up of ITBP’s frontier headquarter, added officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eyeing-national-security-uttarakhand-itbp-to-improve-border-infrastructure/story-UKZOI5g5xzJ5KDnCCM8V7K.html
18-07-2020||India||Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone gets green nod||The union environment ministry has approved the zonal master plan for the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone notification that stretches from Gaumukh to Uttarkashi covering an area of 4179.59 sqkm, the ministry said in a statement on Friday.In a review meeting on the chaardhaam road project chaired by Nitin Gadkari, minister of road transport and highways where he called for quick disposal of pending issues like land acquisition and environmental clearances, environment minister, Prakash Javadekar said that the ministry has approved the ZMP which will help expedite the chaardhaam road project.Uttarakhand CM, Trivendra Singh Rawat; Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Gen (Retd) V K Singh also attended the meeting.“The ZMP is based on watershed approach and includes governance in the area of forest and wildlife, watershed management, irrigation, energy, tourism, public health and sanitation, road infrastructure, etc. The approval of ZMP will give a boost to conservation and ecology of the area and also to undertake developmental activities as permitted under ZMP. The approval will also pave way for faster execution of the Chaardhaam Project,” environment ministry’s statement said.But approval of the ZMP could make the entire Bhagirathi region extremely vulnerable to natural disasters, activists and experts said.The Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone notification was first issued by the environment ministry on December 18, 2012. After years of protests by local environmentalists, the notification sought to protect the entire fragile Himalayan region by restricting hydropower projects of over 2 MW, riverbed mining and change of land use. The notification was however amended on April 16, 2018 following Uttarakhand government’s objections that the notification was ‘anti-development.’The 2018 amendment said: “a number of representations have been received from various stakeholders to allow activities that promote sustainable development while ensuring environmental protection in the Bhagirathi Eco-sensitive Zone,” and hence it approved land use change to meet the local needs including civic amenities and” other infrastructure development in larger public interest and national security with the prior approval of State Government with due study of Environmental Impacts.” It also allowed cutting of hills in eco-sensitive areas with proper study and construction on steep slopes in exceptional cases for the benefit of the community. The ministry has approved the ZMP in line with the 2016 amendments.“Haven’t we learnt anything from the 2015 Kedarnath tragedy? The Himalayas are extremely fragile mountains. The rocks still haven’t consolidated completely. Hill cutting will definitely destabilise hills, if there is forest loss debris would flow into the river affecting the river and making the entire region extremely vulnerable to landslides. Also, beyond 1800 to 2000 metres altitude its mostly moraines (unconsolidated glacial debris). If there is a cloudburst these will add to landslides. Plus, the Himalayas are in seismic zone V a major earthquake can happen anytime. What is the purpose of the chaardhaam road? If it’s entirely strategic then a single lane road will suffice,” said Shashi Shekhar, former secretary, union ministry of water resources who has dealt with various legal matters on the Bhagirathi Eco Sensitive Zone during his tenure in the ministry.“This is the last pristine stretch of Ganga - which is why for the conservation of Bhagirathi, an ESZ in the entire watershed was announced. I hope that the government of Uttarakhand will not bulldoze its own agenda of so-called development and maintain the sanctity of the ESZ through the ZMP. GoU’s response to ESZ so far has not been positive so far - the ESZ monitoring committee has virtually been made non-functional,” said Mallika Bhanot of Uttarakhand based Ganga Ahvaan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhagirathi-eco-sensitive-zone-gets-green-nod/story-WLHZU0KqfjnshkZnsh82ZL.html
18-07-2020||India||Coronavirus reaching hinterland real challenge for health care||When Santosh Kumar developed a cough and mild fever on July 6, he knew what to do. His village of Chakai, a collection of 200-odd residents in Bihar’s impoverished Araria district, was buzzing with news of the coronavirus and the 35-year-old shopkeeper suspected he contracted the infection.But when he reached the local hospital in Jokihat, he was told there were no facilities to test for the virus. The next day, he took a bus to Araria, and spent five hours at the district hospital before a nurse came to take his swab. “It was not easy for me to undergo a test as there was no one in the district hospital to take notice,” said Kumar, who runs a small hardware shop.On July 9, a phone call from the administration told him the test was positive, and he was admitted to an isolation centre at Forbesganj the next morning. At the centre, he met Mithu Kumar, Rinki Devi and Suraj Kumar – all residents of Araria district – who narrated similar tales of difficulty in getting tested. “When you are infected with the coronavirus, you better rely on god,” said Mithu Kumar. Across the largely rural district where manual and agricultural labour are the main sources of employment, quacks — who have long capitalised on the poor health care system in the region — have come up with “corona cures” overnight. “We don’t know where to go for a test if I catch a cold or I am sick with fever,” said Munna, 40, who goes by one name. “We still take medicines from quacks.” The district has 213 infections but even in villages with patients, there is little awareness of distancing protocols or the need to wear masks. The 100-bed district hospital has 11 regular doctors on roster against a sanctioned strength is 46. There are 15 nurses out of sanctioned 60. The government says it has ramped up facilities to battle the infection. “We are doing our best for the patients infected with coronavirus,” said Araria civil surgeon Madan Mohan Prasad Singh. Officer in charge of Araria, Shambhu Kumar, said the administration will start testing at the block level in two days. “We are just waiting for kits,” he said.Araria is not alone. Four months into the pandemic in India, the virus has travelled from urban centres into the hinterland, where a fractured health care system, low awareness and abject poverty are emerging as major impediments in the battle against Covid. Of India’s over one million cases, nearly a third are from 658 districts where the share of rural population is more than 40%, and a quarter of the cases is in the 584 districts that have more than 60% rural population. This means that while the majority of the infections are being reported from urban centres rural India is dealing with a significant caseload. This is a heavy burden because some of the states with the largest rural populations such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, also have the lowest per capita hospital bed or doctor availability. In Bihar, which has the largest share of rural population — only 0.11 beds and 0.39 doctors are available per thousand people — as opposed to 0.46 and 1.54 for Maharashtra, the worst-hit state. “Of course, there is an increase in cases in rural areas and that was to be expected. After the lockdown lifted, and jobs remained elusive, millions travelled home without facilities for testing, contact tracing and isolation,” said Dr Vivekananda Jha, executive director of The George Institute for Global Health, Delhi.Testing is another problem. Compared to 38,188 tests per million in Delhi and a national average of 9,908 tests per million, Bihar conducted 2,907 tests, Uttar Pradesh, 5,891 tests and Odisha 8,287 tests per million. “In cities, however crowded, migrants live and work with others who are relatively young, but when they go back to their multi-generational families and communities, they infect the old and vulnerable who have very often poor or no access to health systems,” said Dr Ambarish Dutta, associate professor, Indian Institute of Public Health, Bhubaneswar.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which are the two biggest sources of migrants, also have daunting health care challenges. The health infrastructure of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, for example, is 2.5 times lower than Kerala’s, according to Niti Aayog’s State Health Index 2019. In many of these regions, decades of chronic underfunding of health care has brought the crisis to a head. For people living in rural areas, where private facilities are usually few, the government allopathic doctor-patient ratio is 1:10,926, shows the National Health Profile 2019 data. In the past two months, states have attempted to scale up facilities. In Bihar, for example, health minister Mangal Pandey said there are now 441 Covid Care Centres. “All six medical college and hospitals have been asked to arrange 100 beds for Covid patients and 40,000 rapid testing kits have been sent to districts,” he added.Experts agree there has been a degree of improvement over the years. “Some progress has certainly been made in improving service delivery in rural areas, but the focus has been largely on maternal and child care, with some good work in malaria and TB control. But by and large, the infrastructure capacity to cope with infectious diseases in terms of trained personnel, laboratory support and good district and sub district level hospitals continue to be poor. A lot more focus and investment is needed,” said K Sujatha Rao, former Union health secretary. A survey done by the National Health Authority, which runs the government’s flagship Ayushman Bharat health assurance programme, found 22 of 101 accredited private hospitals had remained inactive and 81 declined to provide Covid-19 treatment.The bigger fear than rising cases in rural India, experts said, is the possibility of infections going unrecorded. “It’s clear that testing is low in these states, and transmission will remain high as people are not tested. We have experience, not from coronavirus infection but other disease, which people get ill and die in rural areas without going to a hospital and the cause of death is not recorded,” said Jha. “Unless we test, isolate and treat and strengthen primary health care more widely, coronavirus in rural areas will remain unrecorded,” he said.(additional reporting by Vijdan Mohammad Kawoosa)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-reaching-hinterland-real-challenge-for-health-care/story-Sri6eu0sddql0rFvPD7uxL.html
18-07-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: A million that changed India in countless ways||When India encountered its first case on January 30 in Kerala, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) seemed like an abstraction — an unknown infection in a corner of China that seemed to have created a scare of sorts. But it wasn’t “our problem”. When, in early March, a Delhi resident — who had returned from Europe; whose children studied in an elite school in Noida; and who went out for a meal to Hyatt — tested positive, that abstraction became a reality for urban middle class Indians. Suddenly, it was not someone else’s problem. Covid-19 had hit home.  Five-and-a-half months later, a million Indians have been infected by Sars-Cov-2. Over 25,000 Indians are dead due to the disease. And India has changed. India’s governance structure has confronted the most serious multi-dimensional crisis in its history. Its political life is on the verge of a potential transformation, both in form and substance. Its public health system has emerged as the most critical determinant of the nation’s ability to fight and revive. Its economy has gone through an unprecedented contraction. Its governing economic philosophy has shifted. Its companies have been forced to reconfigure their businesses.That’s not all. The country’s labour has gone through a humanitarian tragedy, more severe than it has ever experienced. India’s poor have got poorer, the rich have not got richer, and the middle class has seen opportunities shrink, jobs disappear, and incomes get depleted. Its professionals have had to reconfigure the very idea of what it means to work and how. Its children have been forced to adapt to a new education system, where going to school itself is an elusive prospect. Its young adults are graduating, but with nowhere to go. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageFinally, India’s rich social and family traditions have transformed. Its relations with the world have undergone a reset, driven by the imperatives of managing the pandemic while securing the country. And its citizens have changed the way they live, eat, travel, interact, and work, perhaps irreversibly. This then is a story of a virus, a million cases, and the creation of a new pattern of State-citizen and citizen-citizen engagement, a new political system, a new economic paradigm, a new social framework, a new citizenry, and, in many ways, a new national imagination. There is a caveat, however. This pandemic-induced rupture has not wiped away the past — but retained elements of it; there is, thus, continuity. A new post-pandemic India is taking roots, but old India has not gone away. The State’s centralityIn the new post-pandemic India, the State is more powerful and present in everyday life than it was in pre-pandemic India. From when people can leave their neighbourhood to when children can go to school, from where people can shop to where they can travel, from what they need to do if they are feeling unwell to the penalties they have to pay for flouting official directives, from when businesses can open in the day to where they can source supplies from or export, the State’s writ is larger than ever before in influencing the public and private sphere. Also read | Covid-19: A million and a manifestoTo be sure, this is not exclusively an Indian phenomenon; nor necessarily a negative one — the pandemic required the State to step in and regulate society in ways which would prevent the spread of the infection and ensure common good. In cases where the State did not fulfil this role — the United States is an obvious example — the situation is a lot worse. But to think that only three decades ago, a reform process which hinged on the retreat of the State in India’s political economy commenced, it is remarkable to see how powerful the State apparatus indeed is.The centrality of the State is most acutely reflected in the health care system. People may have seceded from the realm of state services by turning to private services for basic needs, but the pandemic has shown no one can truly secede from the larger public health system. It is the web of the health ministry, state governments, government hospitals in each district, government doctors and health care personnel which has provided the first line of response. The private sector has chipped in — but even the conditions under which it can do so have been determined by public health authorities. This expansive role of the State also required new ways of working. From the Prime Minister holding video conferences with chief ministers to the cabinet secretary convening a meeting of all chief secretaries digitally, from rolling out the Aarogya Setu app to track infections to the deployment of officials from a range of departments for contact tracing, the State has had to adapt, embrace technology, divert its resources for the most urgent tasks at hand, and realign priorities . But through all of this, it has also become clear that Indian State’s capacity is woefully inadequate. Its investment in key areas which are central to its mandate — such as health — is way too limited. Its coercive apparatus has a tendency to go overboard, as during the enforcement of the lockdown. It is slow to respond to immediate needs of the most vulnerable citizens (migrants being the most obvious example), and it lacks the required domain expertise needed for emergencies. The centrality of class Even as the pandemic has shown both the overwhelming presence of the State and its inadequacy, it has also led to tremendous suffering — and in the process, highlighted, and reinforced, the existing inequalities of Indian society. The pandemic affected every citizen, but it affected some more than others. If you were a migrant worker living in a Mumbai slum — with your factory shut, with no wages, with no accommodation, with your family hundreds of miles away in Bihar or eastern Uttar Pradesh, with no transport to go back home — you suffered. If you were a small roadside vendor in Delhi — with your tea stall closed, with your landlord in an unauthorised colony asking you to vacate your room immediately, and with the only way to get home being a long arduous walk back for hundreds of miles — you suffered.Also read | Covid-19: Appoint officials to monitor hospitals, Centre asks statesIf you were a small business owner — whose imports had collapsed, supply chains were disrupted, factory was closed, orders had dried up, and entire financial planning had collapsed — you suffered. If you were a child, born in a poor family, in a village, going to a government school which shut down, dependent on the mid-day meal which was no longer provided, and where the idea of online classes could barely be imagined, you suffered. If you were a salaried professional who just lost a job — and you struggled to pay back your monthly interest on that loan for a recent car, or fees for your school children, or rent for the house — you suffered. This tragedy of human suffering — caused both by the pandemic and the lockdown imposed to curb its spread — will remain entrenched in public memory and private stories for years to come. It has shown the importance of class. It has brought to light the vulnerabilities of millions of migrant workers. It has shown the essential nature of State welfare programmes, which have acted as the only, limited cushion in trying times. And it has shown that how, when decisions are taken at a policy-level, the human cost is not always adequately factored in.Contours of politics If the State has been central, and if the economic suffering has been tremendous across spheres, can politics be far behind?The pandemic has forced political parties to recognise that the old ways of engagement with citizens is gone, at least temporarily. Crowded mass rallies will only be a memory. But this does not mean that the engagement with citizens will end. Indeed, the pandemic had already forced a reset, with parties embracing digital technologies to interact with workers, mobilise citizens, and push out their messages. It is not a neat substitute. It cannot replace the human touch, essential in politics. But it will be the norm, and those who adapt it quicker will have the advantage.But the pandemic has the potential to change the substance of politics, too. Political parties recognise that the response to Covid-19 will be a defining element of their legacy if in power. And that is why the rush to claim credit, to show that the country — or a particular state — is doing better than others, is visible on part of ruling parties, and the rush to critique the response is apparent on part of the Opposition. But the key question is how the discourse on issues will now shape up. For citizens, public health, livelihoods, welfare, formal jobs with a degree of security, income support in difficult times is, now, a matter of life and death. If these become central themes of Indian politics, then the country may be on the verge of a reset, for the better. Life of a citizenWhat has changed in these six months is also the life of an ordinary citizen. If you are a young professional, you live and work differently. Online meeting platforms are central to your work life, as is the idea of working from home. Attending weddings online, or socialising with your friends on a web platform with a drink, is the new normal. If you are a student, online classes are central to your education, the nature of exams has changed, and the memory of playing with friends in your school ground is just that — a memory. If you are an old retired couple, going for a walk is suddenly a risk, and your children don’t visit you for the fear of exposing you to the disease. These fundamental shifts in the lives of citizens are changing society. The pandemic has restructured social interactions, and transformed the manner in which social bonds are sustained or individuals form groups. It has, at a micro level, allowed resident welfare associations to dictate your life. At a macro level, it has created new associations — of class for instance — but also reinforced old associations, of more parochial identities as people slide back into their own families, caste networks, and communities. All of this will alter social frameworks, in ways difficult to anticipate at the moment.In the post-pandemic India, Indians will have to be ready for a more uncertain and fragile future. All assumptions lie challenged, all old ways of living lie broken, and the security of the past lies shattered. What will emerge from this debris will depend on how, and when, the world, and India is able to fight off the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-million-that-changed-india-in-countless-ways/story-SVZjAdodFvXKDCfSsb97EO.html
18-07-2020||India||Four eastern states emerge as worries in anti-Covid battle||Four states in eastern India have emerged as the biggest concerns for the Narendra Modi government in tackling the Covid-19 crisis. West Bengal, Odisha, Assam and Bihar have shown high case positivity rates despite low levels of testing, and the emergence of new virus clusters and several new cases within containment zones have underlined gaps in containment strategy.According to senior government officials, West Bengal has recorded an average of 1,600 new cases a day in the last two weeks and the count for the last five days alone constitute 90% of all active cases in the state.In the same period, Bihar has recorded an average of 450 cases a day, and 80% of its total active cases have come over the past week. Patna, Nalanda, Bhalagpur, Begusarai, Munger and Gaya are among the districts reporting a large number of cases. In Assam, 80% of all active cases have been recorded in the last 14 days while Odisha has reported an average of 500 cases for the past four weeks now. The coastal state’s Ganjam district — home to chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s constituency Hinjili — accounts for 37% of all virus cases in Odisha.While all four states have a lower death rate than the national average, officials feel the four states need to do much more.These four states have been asked to plan better containment and surveillance strategy, among other things. “We asked them to check the source of such high numbers. If a substantial number of cases are recorded from containment areas, then you have to change containment strategy,” a government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-eastern-states-emerge-as-worries-in-anti-covid-battle/story-0G57GigZHElT1ETBIrdPoI.html
18-07-2020||India||Zydus looks to complete clinical trials of vaccine in seven months||Drug firm Zydus Cadila is looking to complete clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate ZyCoV-D in seven months, the company’s chairman said on Friday. The company had on Wednesday started clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate with the first human dosing. The firm is looking to complete phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials in the next three months and submit the data to the regulator, Zydus Cadila chairman Pankaj R Patel said in a statement. Depending on the study outcomes, and if the data is encouraging and the vaccine found effective during the trials, it could take a total of seven months for the trials to be completed and for the vaccine to be launched, he added. The aim would be to cater to the Indian market first, Patel said. “The company is open to exploring partnerships with pharma companies across geographies, however it may be too premature to comment on this at this point in time,” he added. Earlier this month, Zydus had received approval from the national drug regulator to initiate human trials for its Covid-19 vaccine contender.India hit a million Covid-19 infections on Thursday, after recording over 36,000 cases in a single day, becoming only the third nation to do so, after the United States and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-looks-to-complete-clinical-trials-of-vaccine-in-seven-months/story-Yg5DNxWbgCISjPqvSliceM.html
18-07-2020||India||Covid-19: A million and a manifesto||India crossed a million coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases on Thursday. I expected it to happen over the weekend; HT’s data person (for all things related to Covid-19) Jamie Mullick got it right, though. At the current rate of growth, India could cross the two million case mark sometime in early August, with many of the cases coming from populous states whose health care systems will find it difficult to cope with the challenge. Irrespective of the efficacy of its measures, the government was proactive in the early run of the pandemic in India. As the country enters a critical phase (the disease is beginning to spread fast in hitherto less affected regions), here is a 10-point manifesto for the government to consider.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTest more. I’ve previously suggested a target of 50 million by August 15. That may be difficult now, but I’m told a million tests a day are well within India’s reach. India has conducted around 13 million tests so far according to worldometers.infoAt a million a day, it will reach the 50-million mark in 37 days; by the middle of October, it would have conducted 100 million tests, covering a little over 7.5% of its population. That should do.Enforce the wearing of masks. And hand hygiene. And social distancing. After three-and-a-half months of wearing masks (perhaps even gloves), using sanitizers, washing hands, and social distancing, everyone is tired. It is beginning to show — but the results could be disastrous.Draft a vaccine plan. What is our vaccine plan? Have we invested in vaccine companies? Or have we struck deals with them the way the US has, doling out billions in return for dibs on a vaccine when it is developed? Have we placed advance orders? I think this is the best way to spend the money that has been collected by the PM Cares Fund.Appoint a chief scientist — or a Covid Commissioner. We desperately need one to orchestrate the scientific and health care response to the coronavirus disease and to ensure that science, and established scientific processes drive our response to the pandemic. (Some readers and the government may have a question about this. I have an answer: Do we?)Appoint a data czar. And make all data — testing, geographical spread of the disease, availability of hospital beds, results of clinical trials — public.Reintroduce daily briefings on how India is doing. Take questions. And share information openly and transparently on caseloads and deaths, gaps in the health care system, the policy response, and scientific and medical developments.Frame rules for focused lockdowns. As the virus rages through India, a new bunch of hot spots will emerge, showing clusters of infection. The only way to deal with these is to lock them down — but using a standard protocol that builds on learnings from the 68-day national lockdown.Give children enrolled in a school under the Right to Education scheme a device on which they can access classes (which have all gone online). Actually, why only them, give one to every school-going child who doesn’t have a device.Announce another stimulus — one that actually underwrites (or funds) businesses, and puts cash in the hands of people. Even fiscal hawks won’t protest too loudly at the use of helicopter money in this situation.Convene Parliament and parliamentary committees. The pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime crisis that has affected every sphere of life (and work). Parliament and its committees cannot afford to sit it out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-a-million-and-a-manifesto/story-mvVxcWQ8GwmSLUGhnlLecN.html
18-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand will retract controversial order on Ganga stretch, but can’t say when||Uttarakhand government has said it will retract the controversial order by the previous Congress government declaring a stretch of the Ganga river as an escape channel and not mainstream river. The decision was taken amid mounting pressure from seers and saints.Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and state government spokesperson, blamed the then Congress-led Harish Rawat government for the whole fiasco, saying it hurt religious sentiments of millions of Hindus.“Definitely we (BJP government) will scrap the previous government’s decision on Ganga stretch in Haridwar. Already, various legal aspects are being considered. But, exactly when it will be retracted, I can’t say as of now. But it will definitely be overturned and the ancient old status of Ganga stretch at Har-Ki-Pauri will be restored” said Kaushik.The Congress-led government had issued an order declaring Ganga stretch from Sarvanand Ghat, Bhoopatwala till Shri Daknesheswar Mahadev temple, passing through sanctum sanctorum of Brahama Kund, Har-Ki-Pauri as an escape channel on December 14, 2016.This meant Har-Ki-Pauri ghat was not on the main river Ganga course and thus did not come under NGT directive prohibiting construction activities within 100 metre of the Ganga river.Former chief minister Harish Rawat said the controversial order was passed to safeguard the interests of local traders and commercial activities but later he realized it was a “mistake”.The delay in scrapping the order has infuriated the priests, saints and Ganga Sabha –which manages the affairs of sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri.Last week former chief minister Harish Rawat sought an apology from the saint community and urged BJP-led state government to nullify the December, 2016 order.Despite the pressure, it’s not an easy task for the BJP government as interests of many politicians, businessmen, hoteliers, lodge, dharamshalas, ashram owners and traders will get affected due to this step.A large number of these stakeholders are either close to BJP or Congress office bearers, party workers or are in close touch with top party leaders and even with Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).Social-RTI activist JP Baduni, who has filed applications regarding Har-Ki-Pauri and Ganga pollution issues, pointed out that certain traders close to the political parties, who view Ganga through the commercial point of view, had earlier pressurised the Congress government to pass this order and are now lobbying with the BJP to ensure the order doesn’t get nullified.Notably, way back in 2011-12, Nainital High Court had given directives for the demolition of commercial buildings and establishments falling under the 200-metre periphery of Ganga riverbed.Later in 2015, National Green Tribunal (NGT) prohibited the construction of any commercial building within 100 metre of Ganga river bed, which led to the Congress-led state government issuing the order on December 14, 2016 to safeguard interests of the affected people.A senior official privy to the development said that for the past three years, the state government has been dwelling on ways to nullify the order but at the same time, interests of hotel owners, builders, traders and noted saints, who have numerous-dharamshalas at core Har-Ki-Pauri zone, also have to be taken care of.Aggrieved by the delay in retracting the order, several Akhadas have expressed their displeasure and warned of boycotting Mahakumbh if it is not nullified by this year.Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, the apex body of all the major Akhadas, has decided to raise this issue again with chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, when the next meeting on Mahakumbh affairs is held.To put pressure on the state government for time-bound invalidation of the previous Congress government order, the Ganga Sabha, which manages affairs of Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga ghats, has now decided to take the legal route.Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha said on past several occasions they have apprised the CM TS Rawat and cabinet minister Madan Kaushik in this regard but despite assurances, officially nothing concrete has been done.“If in the coming weeks this escape channel order is not repealed we will be moving the apex court as this is a matter related with sacred Ganga whom we regard as mother and deity,” said Jha||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-will-retract-controversial-order-on-ganga-stretch-but-can-t-say-when/story-HPmc4wBffTP3dtB6jxbKgJ.html
18-07-2020||India||Large parts of Assam’s Elephant Reserve mined without wildlife nod||Coal India Limited (CIL) had opened and mined 73.2 hectares (ha) of forest area in Assam’s Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve without wildlife or forest clearance, the minutes of the latest meeting of National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) have revealed.NBWL, which comes under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), is considering diversion of 98.59 ha of reserve forestland from Assam’s Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve for Tikok opencast coal mining project by North-Eastern Coal Field, a unit of CIL.Earlier, NBWL members had said that CIL had mined a part of the forestland, measuring 57.2 ha, years ago without seeking its clearance.NBWL had directed CIL and Assam government to submit a mine reclamation plan for the area, which had been broken up. It had also sought a feasibility report on underground mining for the remaining unbroken tract of land in a bid to ensure that the biodiversity of the rich biosphere is not affected.The minutes of NBWL’s 58th meeting on July 3, which were released on July 13, had noted that out of 41.39 ha unbroken area, 16 ha have also been broken up by CIL, and as a result, 25 ha remain unbroken.NBWL has recommended that the mining activity be stopped immediately and deferred the matter till further discussions with CIL.“Yes, they (CIL) have mined in more areas than earlier known. I had brought this to the notice of the government as soon as I had learned about it. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Assam, also confirmed this during the meeting,” said R Sukumar, an ecologist at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, and a member of NBWL.“CIL had broken up 57.2 ha years ago and mined it without any permission, in violation of laws. They have been directed to (pay) penalty for this and submit a mine reclamation plan. The plan they have submitted includes trees from central India, which is not even the native biodiversity of Assam. CIL has been asked to come back again with a proper plan,” Sukumar had said in April, when CIL’s application was first considered. “The rest of the area borders Arunachal Pradesh and it cannot be broken up. The standing committee has told them (CIL) that forests there cannot be opened up,” he had said.“We don’t have any response on this as of now,” said a CIL senior official.“There’s a huge problem in governance if expert bodies incharge of protecting the environment have to rely on illegally operating projects to reveal truths to them. But we all know this very well by now. The important question is what do we do with these institutions now that only serve as channels to legitimise and justify illegal projects?“Any project can circumambulate around these institutions and clean up its past deeds,” said Manju Menon, senior fellow, Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi.NBWL is also considering the diversion of 10.45 ha of forestland for doubling of Tinaighat–Castlerock– Caranzol passing through Karnataka’s Dandeli - Anshi Tiger Reserve, which will lead to clearing of forests in the eco-sensitive areas of the Western Ghats.NBWL is awaiting the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s (NTCA) site report to take a call.Among other significant proposals, the NBWL also heard five proposals for sand mining within a five-kilometre (km) radius of Rajaji National Park in Uttarakhand.NBWL asked the Uttarakhand government to resubmit the proposals after carrying out a study of the cumulative impact of sand mining around Rajaji National Park.It recommended diversion of 63.13 ha forestland for laying of 132-kilovolt (KV) transmission line from Rilo to Seijosa passing through the buffer zone of Pakke Tiger Reserve, which is located at three-10 km away from the critical tiger habitat in Pakke Kessang district of Arunachal Pradesh.Pakke is also a natural habitat for several species of hornbills in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/large-parts-of-assam-s-elephant-reserve-mined-without-wildlife-nod/story-NFh0yNncJ3PiUePrlUGJ7J.html
18-07-2020||India||Talks with China on but no guarantees: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that the progress in negotiations with China should help resolve the ongoing border dispute but he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved”, underling that progress in resolving the tensions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) between the two nuclear powers has been a challenging and arduous process.Addressing soldiers at Lukung on the western bank of Ladakh’s Pangong Tso, which has been at the centre of the current border tensions, Singh also said that no power could “touch or grab even an inch of Indian territory”. Lukung is 43km from Finger 4 on the northern bank of Pangong lake.The defence minister’s comments came a day after India said the complex disengagement process with China on the LAC is specifically aimed at preventing “face-off situations”, and any unilateral attempts to change the status quo on the disputed border won’t be accepted. Two days after senior military commanders from both sides met at Chushul, the Indian Army on Thursday said complete disengagement is an “intricate process” requiring “constant verification”.Singh, who landed in Leh on Friday morning, was briefed on the security situation in the sensitive sector including the actual position of troops on both sides of the contested border, people familiar with the developments said. He also witnessed a series of combat manoeuvres at nearby Stakna featuring C-130J special operations aircraft dropping paratroopers, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters, T-90 tanks, infantry combat vehicles and Mi-17 helicopters — with the military imagery meant to signal India’s resolve and readiness to deal with any eventuality in the region. The combat drills he saw in Stakna demonstrated “the application of integrated combined force in high altitude terrain”, said one of the officials cited above.Singh, who was accompanied by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, recalled the brutal clash in Galwan valley on June 15 and paid tribute to the 20 Indian soldiers killed in the skirmish. He added that India had neither attacked any country nor grabbed anyone’s territory or hurt their self-respect. “But if anyone attempts to hurt India’s self-respect, we will not tolerate it and will give a befitting reply,” he said. He said India’s leadership was strong and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was capable of taking decisions.While Singh said that nothing could be better than finding a solution to the dispute through dialogue, and that process was on at the military and political level, military affairs experts said the minister’s comments on not being able to guarantee the outcome of the talks pointed to the complexity of the dialogue process. “It clearly highlights the complications and difficulties in the negotiations between the two sides. The comments also indicate that India and China have not been able to narrow down their differences on Pangong Tso and Despsang,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General (retired) DS Hooda.“The minister has indicated that while disengagement has begun, the larger issue of de-escalation is the tough task ahead and contingent on Chinese behaviour now and in the future,” said Sameer Patil, member, international security at Gateway House, a Mumbai-based foreign policy think tank.Officials and experts indicated the army is preparing for the long haul as disengagement isn’t likely in the short term.India’s high-powered China Study Group (CSG) on Wednesday reviewed the latest developments in eastern Ladakh, with the focus on the next stage of disengagement following the 14-hour meeting between the corps commanders on July 14.The disengagement -- which began earlier this month after talks between the two Special Representatives -- national security adviser Ajit Doval and foreign minister Wang Yi on July 6 -- involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours.The focus of the current military talks is to reach consensus on easing tensions between the two armies in Finger Area near Pangong Tso and Depsang plains, as well as pulling back weapons and equipment from “friction points” in other sectors.A fifth meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, is expected to be held in two weeks to take things forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-with-china-on-but-no-guarantees-rajnath/story-tCcZvzpvI7AdOFeJNRkJPL.html

Rajya Sabha chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu has decided to proceed with the oath-taking ceremony keeping in view the resumption of meetings by the department related parliamentary standing committees of both the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha and the interest expressed by the new members to participate in such meetings, Naidu’s office said in a statement.An MP can participate in the meetings and other house proceedings only after being administered the oath of affirmation; even though they are eligible to draw salaries and other benefits.For the first time, the oath-taking ceremony will be carried out in the chamber of the House during inter-session. “Subscribing to oath or affirmation is usually done either during the session or in the chamber of the Chairman of Rajya Session, if the House is not in session,” the statement said.Among the MPs who will be administered the oath or affirmation are Dr. K. Keshava Rao and Shri Tiruchi Siva who chair parliamentary committees, and cannot convene the meetings of their respective committees unless they are administered the oath.Sixty one members from 20 states who have been elected to the Rajya Sabha will be administered oath in the chairman’s chamber after following the requirement of social distancing and only one family member or guest will be allowed to accompany the MP.The MPs were informed of the decision by the secretary general of Rajya Sabha and those who fail to turn up will be administered oath or affirmation during the ensuing monsoon session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-mps-to-take-oath-on-july-22/story-vaVnJ2WhnC7Ei9Oh28bqHI.html
18-07-2020||India||Rahul slams govt, Jaishankar hits back||New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Friday the country’s troubled economy, foreign policy and neighbourhood had emboldened China to take an aggressive stand against India, prompting external affairs minister S Jaishankar to question the foreign policy decisions of the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government.The former Congress president made the remarks in a video released on Twitter on the India-China border standoff, part of his efforts to share his thoughts on national issues through short videos.“The question is why have Chinese chosen this particular time to move? Why have Chinese chosen to violate the LAC [Line of Actual Control] with India at this point in time? What is it about India situation that has made China act in such an aggressive way? What is it about this moment in time that has allowed Chinese to have the confidence they can move against a country like India?” he asked.“To understand that you have to go into multiple spaces. Countries are protected not by one particular thing but by a confluence of forces, by a confluence of systems. A country is protected by its foreign relationships, it is protected by its neighbourhood, it is protected by its economy, it is protected by the feeling that its people have, the vision that its people have,” Gandhi said.“And what has happened over the last six years is that in all those areas India has been disturbed and disrupted,” he added.Jaishankar responded to Gandhi’s remarks in a string of 10 tweets, highlighting the foreign policy efforts of the government and its measures to improve India’s standing in the world community and the steps taken to improve infrastructure along the disputed border with China.The minister also questioned several foreign policy decisions by the Congress-led UPA government, such as the inclusion of the Balochistan issue in a joint statement issued after a summit meeting with Pakistan at Sharm el-Sheikh in 2009, and its handling of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.Gandhi has been critical of the government’s handling of the standoff with China, and asked it to come clean on alleged intrusions by Chinese forces in Ladakh and the disengagement process.He attacked the government’s foreign policy and the “soured” relationship with neighbours such as Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, saying ties had become transactional.“Our relationship with the outside world used to be with multiple countries. We had a...strategic partnership with America...That is very important. We had a relationship with Russia. We had a relationship with Europe. And these countries used to help us manoeuvre in the world,” he said.“Today our relationship has become transactional. We have a transactional relationship with the US. We have disturbed our relationship with the Russians. We have a transactional relationship with Europe,” added Gandhi.Earlier, other than Pakistan, the entire neighbourhood partnered with India, he said. “Today Nepal is angry with us. If you go to Nepal and you speak to the Nepali people they are furious with what has happened. Sri Lankans have given a port to the Chinese. Maldives is disturbed. Bhutan is disturbed. So we have disrupted our foreign partners, we’ve disrupted our neighbourhood,” Gandhi contended.However, Jaishankar said India’s major partnerships are stronger and its international standing higher, as reflected by regular summits informal meetings with the US, Russia, Europe and Japan. “India engages China on more equal terms politically,” he said.“We speak our mind more openly now. On #CPEC, on #BRI, on South China Sea, on UN-sanctioned terrorists, etc,” he tweeted. The government has also addressed the “border infrastructure imbalance legacy”, he said. “Compare 2014-20 with 2008-14. Budget up by 280%, road building by 32%, bridges by 99% and tunnels by 6 times,” he added.Turning to the neighbourhood, Jaishankar said the agreement on Hambantota port between Sri Lanka and China was concluded in 2008 and the issue should be taken up with “those who dealt with it”. India’s difficult ties with the Maldives, after New Delhi had “watched President [Mohamed] Nasheed being toppled in 2012, now stand transformed”, he added.The land boundary issue with Bangladesh had been settled in 2015 by the NDA government, opening the way to more development and transit, and terrorists no longer find safe haven there, he said. Nepal, he added, was getting prime ministerial visits after 17 years and a swathe of developmental projects in power, fuel, housing, hospital and roads.Bhutan finds India a “stronger security and development partner” and “unlike 2013, they don’t worry about their cooking gas”, Jaishankar said. In Afghanistan, India has completed projects such as Salma dam and the new Parliament building, expanded training and connectivity, he said.“And #Pakistan (that you skipped) surely notes the difference between Balakot & Uri on the one hand, and Sharm-el-Sheikh, Havana & 26/11 on the other. Ask yourself,” Jaishankar said in the last of the 10 tweets.The reference to Balakot and Uri pointed to the 2019 airstrike at a terrorist camp at Balakot in Pakistan after the Pulwama suicide bombing and the 2016 surgical strike at terrorist camps across the Line of Control after an attack on Indian soldiers in Uri. At the 2009 Sharm el-Sheikh summit, the Indian side had agreed to the inclusion of a reference to terrorism in Balochistan, which was later used by Pakistan to imply that India was fomenting unrest in the restive region.Gandhi also criticised the government on the economy and unemployment.“We have the worst economic growth in 50 years with no end in sight, absolute disaster. Unemployment is the highest in 40-50 years. So, our strengths have suddenly become our weaknesses,” he said.Gandhi said the Congress had repeatedly asked the government to inject money into the economy and announce a financial package for small and medium businesses, but it refused to do so.“We told them listen, for God’s sake inject money into the economy. Fire the economy and do it immediately, protect the small and medium businesses. They refused to do it,” he said.He added, “So, today you have a country which is economically in trouble; in trouble as far as foreign policy is concerned; in trouble with its neighbours; and that’s why the Chinese have decided that this is possibly the best time to act and that is why they have acted.”Later, Gandhi tweeted: “Since 2014, the PM’s constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened India and left us vulnerable. Empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-slams-govt-jaishankar-hits-back/story-JqVrVrcriK8zlUMYJSA45N.html
18-07-2020||India||Pakistan offers 3rd consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav||Pakistan on Friday again offered to provide consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav, a day after Indian officials walked out of a meeting saying they weren’t given unhindered contact with the former Indian Navy officer sentenced to death for alleged involvement in spying.The offer was made by foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi while speaking to a TV news channel. He said the consular access could be provided as early as Friday or Saturday and Pakistan would agree to the terms set by the Indian side.There was no immediate response from the Indian side to the offer.He also claimed the Indian side had engaged in a “drama” by walking out of Thursday’s meeting Jadhav. He contended the Indian officials were allowed to meet Jadhav without any glass partition between the two sides and without any recording of the meeting.“Today, you are making the excuse that you want to meet him without any security personnel being present. Even that will be done,” Qureshi said, speaking in Urdu.On Thursday, two Indian officials registered a protest and walked out of the planned meeting with Jadhav, and New Delhi accused Islamabad of breaching its assurance of providing unimpeded and unconditional access to the former naval officer.Pakistan offered consular access to Jadhav for only the second time since he was detained in March 2016. But when the Indian officials went to meet him, they found Pakistani officials with “an intimidating demeanour” near Jadhav and a camera being used to record the conversation.The Indian officials had gone to talk to Jadhav about filing a review petition in Islamabad high court against his death sentence by the deadline of July 20, but were prevented from obtaining his written consent for arranging his legal representation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.Qureshi, however, contended that despite being offering all concessions, the Indian officials left without hearing Jadhav. “India’s ill intentions have come to light. They didn’t want consular access. [Jhadav] kept asking the Indian diplomats to talk to him and they left,” he said.Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui reiterated Pakistan’s offer to India to file an appeal in the Islamabad high court against Jadhav’s death sentence. “It is hoped that India will cooperate with the Pakistan court in giving full effect to the [International Court of Justice’s] judgement,” she said.In a separate development, Qureshi said he had recovered from Covid-19 and resumed his duties. He paid tribute to healthcare and frontline workers for being Pakistan’s “backbone in the fight against this pandemic with unyielding commitment and dedication”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-offers-3rd-consular-access-to-kulbhushan/story-JIaQa3QalbkTsdr0ZO9ZPP.html

All-India MMR in 2016-18 stood at 113. India’s MMR was 130 and 122 in 2014-16 and 2015-17, respectively. Among states, Kerala has the lowest MMR at 43. This value was the highest in Assam at 215. The ‘Empowered Action Group’ (comprising of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand) and Assam had an MMR of 161.While regional divergences in MMR remain, a look at long-term trends in MMR shows that the situation has been improving in high MMR states.See Chart 1: MMR in different state groups The World Health Organization defines maternal deaths as “the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes”. MMR is number of maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births.To be sure, the headline numbers given in the latest SRS bulletin need to take read with a caveat. The MMR values have been predicted within a 95% confidence interval, and the range varies significantly for individual states. For example, Assam’s MMR range is from 133-297, while Kerala’s is from 10-77. Women between the ages of 20 and 29 account for 65% of maternal deaths in India. Women in this age-group had a share of 23% in non-maternal deaths, the SRS data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/southern-states-achieve-un-goals-on-maternal-mortality-ratio/story-3VTbg3VvRQxMrn7kT68ADM.html

The policeman had gone missing from his home on Thursday night, and a police complaint had been filed by his family, police said.“We found him lying in a pool of blood. He was conscious and muttered he didn’t do anything wrong,” a neighbour who did not wish to be named, said. The policeman’s last call was traced to somewhere near his house, which led the police to search for him in the vicinity, where they found him in a vacant plot.The policeman went missing from his home a day after gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh’s call records were leaked to the press.Suresh, who is currently in judicial custody, had reportedly made calls to the policeman at least three times on July 5, the same day that 30 kilograms of 24-carat gold was seized by the Customs department from a baggage addressed to the UAE consulate.The gold worth around Rs 15 crore was received at the airport here as a diplomatic cargo addressed to a consulate official, who has since left the country. Rashed Khamis Ali Musaiqri Alshemeli, the consulate attache, left the country mid-week, amid reports that he had been called back.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) which is in charge of the probe has filed a First Information Report against five persons, including UAE-based Fazil Fareed, whom they suspect forged the country’s seal and emblem to ensure diplomatic protection for the baggage. Four of the accused, including Suresh, have been arrested, under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act which is usually invoked to deal with terrorists and those who pose a threat to the integrity of the nation. The agency suspects that money from the smuggled gold was being used to fund terror operations.The policeman, who attempted suicide, was earlier posted in the airport and has been with the UAE consulate since 2017. Police suspect he feared being questioned or made an accused in the audacious gold smuggling case. The policeman’s brother said he was under tremendous pressure after he was reportedly threatened him. “He looked very tense after smuggling incident came to light. Two days ago, two motorcycle-borne people came to his house and threatened him. He was worried after this. He told some of his friends that the smuggling syndicate suspected his role for tipping off the authorities,” his brother said. A police officer said his statement will be recorded and handed over to the NIA, which is investigating the smuggling case. Indian Administrative Services officer M Sivasankar, the chief minister’s former prinicipal secretary, was suspended from service on Thursday after he was grilled by the NIA for his alleged links with Suresh. Opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front has said it will bring a no-confidence motion against CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s government over the smuggling. “The chief minister cannot get away by suspending his secretary. The needle of suspicion is on him now,” said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala.The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led alliance has a comfortable majority of 98 lawmakers in the 140-member Kerala assembly. “The governments’ popularity after its perfect virus management really worries the Opposition. So it is creating a smokescreen raising allegations,” said CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.The Customs separately carried out raids in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts and detained four more people in connection with the smuggling case. At least 12 people have already been arrested by the agency till now.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-smuggling-case-gunman-at-uae-consulate-tries-to-kill-himself-safe/story-7nBQlb4bRwGZwChYc46JGI.html
18-07-2020||India||Vikas Dubey’s killing, Telangana encounters different: Police||Gangster Vikas Dubey’s killing on July 10 cannot be likened to the 2019 killings of four men accused of raping and murdering a 26-year-old Hyderabad veterinarian, the Uttar Pradesh government said in an affidavit submitted in the Supreme Court on Friday. The submission came days after the court, in response to a plea demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the killings of Dubey and his accomplices, on Tuesday indicated that it may order a judicial probe into them since “we have done it in the other case pertaining to Telangana”. In that case, the court in December constituted a three-member commission to investigate the killing of the four days after they were arrested . The Telangana police have insisted the four accused were killed in an exchange of fire on December 6 after they allegedly broke free and snatched the weapons of the police when they were taken to the crime scene. The UP affidavit maintained that Dubey was killed in retaliatory firing when the state police’s Special Task Force (STF) was trying to recapture him when he fled after a car bringing him from Madhya Pradesh, where he was arrested for his alleged involvement in the July 3 killing of eight policemen in Kanpur, overturned following an accident. “The facts of the present [Dubey] case are completely and diametrically different from the facts emerging in the incident which took place in Hyderabad.”The affidavit argued that the four accused were not hardened criminals unlike Dubey, who faced 64 criminal cases including those related to murder, attempt to murder, and dacoity. It added that the Uttar Pradesh government on July 12 appointed a one-member judicial commission to probe the killing of eight policemen in Kanpur as well as that of Dubey . It added that there was no accident in the Hyderabad case. In this instance, there was an accident that led to Dubey’s escape that culminated “in the encounter”, it added. The affidavit said the accident was real and not sham, while insisting that the circumstances itself establish the truth. “A herd of cattle was passing through the road and heavy rain led to the accident which was beyond the control of anybody. There is clinching material evidence which establishes that the vehicle skid on the wet road. Policemen have also sustained injuries due to accident as well as firearm injuries inflicted by the criminal,” the affidavit said. “All four police persons in the vehicle got seriously injured and lost consciousness.”The affidavit said Dubey snatched a pistol from inspector Rama Kant Pichauri and escaped. It added that an STF team, which was part of the convoy taking Dubey to Kanpur, reached the spot under deputy superintendent TB Singh. The affidavit said the team chased Dubey, who fired nine rounds. TB Singh was hit on the chest but survived as he was wearing a bulletproof jacket, it added. The affidavit said Dubey was repeatedly asked to surrender but he ignored the warnings and kept firing and left two STF personnel wounded. “In defence, the STF fired six shots at Vikas Dubey. Three shots hit him. He was then rushed to the hospital where he was declared dead.” It rejected claims that Dubey surrendered in Madhya Pradesh (as video clips suggested) and added he was arrested.Politicians, former police officers, and rights groups have demanded a probe into Dubey’s killing, saying the police version of what happened does not add up. Five people linked to Dubey were killed between July 3 and July 9.“The only difference I can see between the UP encounter and the Hyderabad encounter is that the UP government has set up its own judicial commission to inquire into the Dubey killing. However, the commission has been asked to go into a lot of other issues as well related to Vikas Dubey and has been given a really wide ambit. The time frame given (of two months) and the fact that the report will be given only to the UP government does not give me too much confidence about whether truth will come out from this process”, said Alok Prasanna Kumar , Senior Resident Fellow at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy. “The table in the affidavit comparing the two encounters is amusing. It seems to suggest that the encounter killing of Dubey was more credible than the Hyderabad encounter and somehow seems to insinuate that the Hyderabad encounter was fake. The grounds cited in the affidavit to claim that UP encounter was different (from Hyderabad encounter) does not hold much water in the eyes of law”, said Supreme Court lawyer MF Philip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-t-gana-encounters-different-cops/story-l24xt8B3Ngq5TvMk5WgYvN.html
18-07-2020||India||Need human-centric globalisation: PM Modi at UN ECOSOC||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday pressed member states of the United Nations to use the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic to reform the global multilateral system in ways that enhances its relevance and effectiveness, and make it the basis for a “new type of human-centric globalisation”.The United Nations was born 75 years ago to deal with the “furies” of the Second World War, the Prime Minister said addressing a high-level meeting of the UN Economic and Social Council. “Today the fury of the pandemic provides the context for its rebirth and reform. Let us not lose this chance,” he said.As a soon-to-be member of the UN Security Council, India will play its role in full support of the UN agenda, “with our deep commitment to maintaining global harmony, to improving socio-economic equity, and to preserving nature’s balance”, said the Prime Minister in his virtual speech in English.This was the first time Modi addressed UN members after India’s thumping victory in the June 17 election to the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member for a two-year term starting in January, 2021. India will get into the UNSC loop for documents and papers starting August, purely as an observer to prepare it for its upcoming term.India has called for reforming the global multilateral system to reflect changed realities of the contemporary world. It has campaigned for reforms of the UN Security Council to expand its permanent membership with a seat for itself. And it has also sought reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global bodies to make them more contemporaneous.“Today, while celebrating 75 years of the United Nations, let us pledge to reform the global multilateral system to enhance its relevance, to improve its effectiveness to make it the basis for a new type of human-centric globalization,” Modi said.The theme of the high-level segment of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), on the 75th Anniversary of the founding of the UN, was ”Multilateralism after COVID19: What kind of UN do we need at the 75th anniversary”. India held the inaugural presidency of ECOSOC (Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, in 1946), and Prime Minister Modi delivered the keynote address virtually at the 70th anniversary of the collective in January 2016.In his Friday address, Modi recalled India’s support to the ECOSOC and UN’s developmental work, and how they are tied to India’s own domestic agenda. “Today, through our domestic efforts, we are again playing a salient role in achieving Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. India is also supporting other developing countries in meeting their Sustainable Development Goals,” he said.The Prime Minster went on to say, India’s motto of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwas” resonated, for instance, with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind. And he spoke at length about efforts made in India to expand access to sanitation, bring about gender parity in elementary and higher education, and empowering women through financial inclusion.Modi said it was India’s health care system that had helped it fight the Covid-19 epidemic. India had the best recovery rate in the world, as a result, he added.On fighting climate change, the Prime Minister spoke of India cutting 38 million tonnes of carbon emission annually and went on to highlight its role in the setting up of the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.Modi also spoke about India’s role in the region as a “first responder”. India has extended medical and other assistance to over 150 countries in the fight against COVID, and had set up a SAARC COVID emergency fund for the neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-human-centric-globalisation-pm/story-TDDbElYEhdrtCHYkBV3MyJ.html
18-07-2020||India||HT Salutes: Travelling for miles to feed the hungry||Dasari Durga Rao, a 34-year-old fish merchant, lives in the Ranigari Thota Colony on the banks of Krishna river in Vijayawada town of Andhra Pradesh.Affected by polio when he was two, Rao has been displaying a large heart in feeding the migrant workers and poor people, ever since the country has gone into lockdown nearly three months ago to contain the spread of Covid-19.His schedule is fixed. Each morning, Rao rises at 4 am, gets on his three-wheeler Scooty (specially designed as he was affected by polio at age two) and travels to Guntur town about 40 km away. There, he sets up shop at a footpath near the main market vegetable and sells the fish. “Since I bring good quality fish, I have dedicated customers who don’t go anywhere else,” he said.“Luckily, my business has been going on comfortably and I haven’t suffered any loss till now,” he said. Fish, like mutton and chicken was an essential item during the lockdown.On an average, Rao earns Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 a day during the weekdays and a little more on Sunday when the sales are higher. “On Sundays, I start my activity at 1 AM because of the demand,” he said. He’s usually done with the sales a little after noon time.Back home, he gives Rs 2500 – or one-fourth of his savings – to his wife, Nagalakshmi. The rest, he said, he spends on buying food and ration for the poor and hungry.“Every day I used to watch hundreds of migrant workers, along with their children, walking for miles on the Guntur-Vijayawada national highway (NH-16) and I felt bad about them. Similarly, I have come across several families who have been starving due to lack of work and any support from the government. So, I thought of doing whatever little I can to mitigate their hunger,” he said.Three times a week, after winding up his fish trade for the day, Rao returns home on his Scooty to pick up food packets. He then rides all along the Guntur-Vijayawada route to distribute these packets, which contain rice, lentils, curry and sambar. He ties these packets in plastic trays, and attaches them to his vehicle with rope.Earlier, Nagalakshmi would cook the food and pack it. “Soon, I started serving a lot more people. So I engaged a cook from a restaurant. On an average, I’d say we have been feeding 400-500 people a day. That comes to around Rs 16,000 a day,” he said.Rao has been doing this since the lockdown was first imposed in the last week of March.Rao has also distributed groceries and vegetables to the underprivileged. “I kept getting calls from far-off places like Machilipatnam, so I would make the trip to distribute groceries to the poor families there,” he said.Machilipatnam is at least 70 km from Vijayawada.Durga Rao, who studied up to Class 10, inherited the fish-selling business from his father, who died in 2010. “Earlier, I used to work with a prawns’ merchant, but after my father’s death, I got into this fish-selling which has become my livelihood now,” Rao, a father of three school-going daughters, said.Rao was inspired to do philanthropy three years ago after an incident that changed his life. Here’s what happened:“One day, I was having lunch after selling fish when an old woman came to me with a begging bowl. I gave her a ten-rupee note and I thought I had done a great favour to her. She quietly left the place and sat under a tree right in front of me. She stared at me for a long time. After I finished my lunch, I went up to her and found that she was dying right in front of my eyes. Then I realised that she died of hunger and I could have saved her life by parting with some food,” he recalled.“It was then I realised that feeding the hungry was the purpose of my life. Since then, I decided to earmark three-fourths of my earnings only to feed the poor,” he said.Durga Rao also gets a government pension as a person living with a disability which amounts to Rs 3,000 a month. He uses all of this for his philanthropy.He opened a Facebook page to request people to support his endeavour. “Ten people helped me during this lockdown period: some donated a couple of rice bags and others offered cash ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000,” he said.“If I can get at least 10 people around me to help the needy, I will feel fulfilled,” he said.Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you 15 stories of HT Salutes.

18-07-2020||India||Not enough MPs turn up, parliamentary external affairs panel meet called off||A two-day sitting of the parliamentary standing committee dealing with external affairs was cancelled because not enough members of parliament turned up for the meetings, according to MPs that Hindustan Times spoke to. The physical meeting was scheduled at the Parliament’s annexe.This comes just days after an official who attended last Tuesday’s public accounts committee meeting tested positive, leading to several MPs who attended the meeting having to quarantine themselves. Five MPs that Hindustan Times spoke to cited Covid-19 for their inability to attend the meeting.The 31-member panel is headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s PP Chaudhary was supposed to meet to discuss and adopt the draft report on “The Registration of Marriage of Non-Resident Indians Bill”. However, at the scheduled time, only five MPs turned up at the annexe . Apart from the chairman, there was Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta, BJP’s Manoj Tiwari and Meenakshi Lekhi and TDP’s Jaydev Galla who travelled all the way from Telangana for the meeting that didn’t happen.A Lok Sabha official said a panel meeting has to have at least a third of its members in attendance. “It was cancelled because it didn’t have the quorum which in this case was at least 10,’’ this person added on condition of anonymity. Ever since Parliament adjourned in March just before a lockdown was announced to fight the spread of the disease, parliamentary panel meetings were also suspended. They restarted last week.Four Congress MPs that head parliamentary panels, Shashi Tharoor, Anand Sharma, Jairam Ramesh and Adhir Chowdhury have all argued for these meetings to go online but there are security concerns stopping that from happening.”I thought it was very safe,’’ said Dasgupta, explaining his decision to attend the meeting. “There was social distancing and the room in the Annexe is big enough for everyone to be accommodated with these restrictions.’’But the BSP’s Ritesh Pandey disagreed: “I chose not to go,’’ he said speaking from Almora. “I told them that it was better to hold the meeting at a time when the (case) numbers were down.’’While Pandey chose not to come, the Revolutionary Socialist Party’s member NK Premachandran had no choice. He was caught in the new lockdown in the Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. “He cannot travel out of the state due to travel restrictions,’’ said an aide who answered his phone. Adilabad MP Soyam Babu Rao said that a Covid awareness event in his constituency prevented him from attending the meeting.It wasn’t immediately clear how many members had informed the secretariat or the chairman about their inability to attend the meeting.‘I was all set to come but my driver’s mother died of covid. I stayed back because we had to get him tested. Fortunately, he tested negative,’ said BJP MP Poonam Mahajan.‘‘I have children in my house,’ said RJD MP Misa Yadav, ‘I just didn’t think it was worth the risk. Maybe if they discussed something relevant like the India Nepal issue which is very important for me and my constituents but not some NRI marriage bill.’’”I think the second lockdown in many places has created problems,’’ said Tiwari, ``However, we cannot have online meetings. Standing committees are secret and we cannot guarantee that if we move it online.’’Jaydev Galla didn’t respond to HT’s queries, and a spokesperson for the Speaker Om Birla’s office said they would revert with a comment. While a monsoon session is expected before September, the demand for online attendance is only growing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parl-external-affairs-panel-meet-called-off/story-RcY93lYjh2PH4FB0p30dKJ.html
18-07-2020||India||ICMR tells states to scale up rapid antigen testing||The chief of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has asked states to scale up testing in districts, using the antigen-based method. The medical body also told states to identify centres that will conduct these tests, saying it had received requests from public sector undertakings (PSUs), government and private facilities, temples and others to initiate antigen-based testing for the diagnosis of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“With the use of antigen tests, more and more tests are being carried out. It is absolutely necessary that all such testing data is uploaded… all government hospitals/labs and all private NABH/ NABL hospitals and labs may initiate antigen testing… ICMR has been receiving multiple requests from various public sector units, small private/government facilities, temples etc. for initiating this testing,” Dr Balram Bhargava, director-general, ICMR wrote in his letter on Thursday. The research body has also created a set of common log-in credentials for each district, to avoid individual organisations, labs or hospitals having to enter data of all confirmed cases separately on the ICMR portal. The credentials will be shared with all approved government and private facilities.The states have also been directed to link each identified antigen testing facility with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) centre to conduct confirmatory tests.Rapid antigen detection is non-confirmatory. Those who test negative could be tested through an RT-PCR test for confirmation. RT-PCR tests are considered the gold standard of Covid-19 testing.The states have also been directed to appoint a nodal person to interact with the research body and ensure all testing criteria is fully adhered to by the state and the designated facilities.Dr Bhargava directed states that all facilities, both government and private, that are capable of performing antigen-based tests for Covid-19 should be assessed and approved.“… algorithm for interpreting the antigen test should be followed wherein all positives can be labeled as true positives and symptomatic negatives should be subjected to RT-PCR... all testing points should be appropriately linked.”Symptomatic patients who return negative results will be tested at the RT-PCR facility linked to the antigen test centre.“District-wise login credentials should be shared with all antigen testing sites (government and private) so that data can be entered into the ICMR portal on a real-time basis... ensure aforementioned steps to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, so that precious lives are saved, and livelihoods are protected, too,” wrote Dr Bhargava.ICMR had advised use of antigen-based testing for quick detection of Covid-19 patients in containment zones and hospitals. The first kit by a south Korean company, SD Biosensor, was validated jointly for use in India by ICMR and Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on June 14.Virologists say mass testing is the key to identify and isolate those infected so that the disease doesn’t spread.“The way ahead is to test as many people as possible, to be able to track and isolate those people who are infected so that the disease spread is contained. If you isolate them in time, the spread in the community will be curtailed,” said Jacob John, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-tells-states-to-scale-up-rapid-antigen-testing/story-XvWeylvJsWXxlOdMFBL3AP.html
18-07-2020||India||Covid-19: Appoint officials to monitor hospitals, Centre asks states||The Central government wants other states to follow the Mumbai and Delhi approach to dealing with issues related to difficulties in hospital admission for Covid-19 patients, grievances with how hospitals treat patients , and other such -- by appointing senior government officials to keep an eye on each large hospital treating Covid-19 patients, public and private.“In Delhi, the Kejriwal government even publicized the name and contact number of the nodal government officer of a hospital,” said a senior central government official who asked not to be named.Last week, in Pune, a 44-year-old security guard who tested Covid-19 positive died as his family couldn’t find an ICU bed for treatment for six days. In Kolkata, complaints were lodged with the local authorities after a private hospital deployed bouncers at the entrance.Also read| Covid-19: A million and a manifestoEarlier this month, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal warned private hospitals and accused some of them of lying about the number of beds they had for patients of the coronavirus disease.The need to monitor private hospitals was discussed at several levels of the union government including at a meeting chaired by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba this week and, subsequently, at meetings between experts and ministry officials and the states.“We are encouraging states to adopt a new hub and spoke model for the benefit of Covid patients. The model, implemented in Delhi and Mumbai, has seen less refusals and better bed management,” said a senior official involved in the process who spoke on condition of anonymity -- referring to a model popularised by the logistics and aviation industry where everything gets shipped or everyone gets flown to a hub from where the products or people are sent on to their eventual destination. In this case, the flow isn’t physical, though -- but of information.District magistrates are expected to act as hubs, and senior government officials, under them, as spokes. This system can also help in screening of patients and admitting only those who need hospital care, added the second official.Better hospital bed management or allotting beds to only those who actually require to be hospitalized and can’t manage from home is an integral part of India’s battle against Covid-19. As the focus of the government has shifted rapidly from containing Covid numbers to lowering death rates, the new model is likely to be actively pursued by many states.Also read: ICMR tells states to scale up rapid antigen testingThe centre is also asking states to monitor ambulance services including their refusal rates and time taken to bring patients to hospitals.Last week, at a review meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was decided to sharpen focus on ramping up tests and keeping the mortality rate low. Better hospital management, improved ambulance service and shorter triage period are some key parts of the government’s strategy to keep the mortality rate low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/appoint-officials-to-monitor-hospitals-centre-asks-states/story-fjmAF1ZPZgXsU9cW3R3jBL.html
18-07-2020||India||India to stockpile oil in US reserves||India is set to begin stockpiling crude oil in American strategic reserves to shield itself from any supply disruptions arising out of geopolitical reasons, and allow the purchase and storage of a large quantity of crude when international oil prices plunge, officials said on Friday.“We are in an advanced stage of discussions for storing crude oil in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase India’s strategic oil stockpile,” petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.This was one of the key outcomes of a virtual meeting between Pradhan and US energy secretary Dan Brouillette as part of the second US-India Strategic Energy Partnership (SEP) ministerial on Friday. HT first reported the move on Thursday. “The sides [India and the US] signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to begin cooperation on Strategic Petroleum Reserves operation and maintenance, including exchange of information and best practices,” an India-US joint statement, issued after the SEP meeting, said.An Indian official said, requesting anonymity, that state-run Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL) and other expert agencies involved in ensuring the country’s energy security may take this MoU forward and lay the road map for the collaboration with the US. ISPRL operates three crude oil storage facilities in India with a combined capacity of 5.33 million tonnes, enough to meet the country’s energy requirement for 9.5 days.While making his opening remarks at the second ministerial on Friday evening, Brouillette said, “We are beginning to collaborate on strategic petroleum reserves ...” He said the two countries are collaborating on various other projects such as nuclear energy and energy efficiency in buildings and appliances.“Apart from fostering bilateral energy trade and investments, we are seeking to align energy cooperation with energy security, expand energy and innovation linkages across our respective energy sectors, facilitate increased industry and stakeholder engagement as well as institutions of excellence from both countries,” Pradhan said.He added bilateral energy trade between the two countries jumped significantly in just three years with bilateral hydrocarbons trade touching $9.2 billion in 2019-20, which is 10% of the overall bilateral trade.Experts described the move to store crude in American strategic reserves as strategically significant since India imports more than 80% crude it processes. It had $101.4 billion crude import bill in 2019-20.“The move will not only ensure uninterrupted energy supply in the event of geopolitical turmoil but also protect the country from unprecedented oil price volatility as was seen in 2008 that caused immense stress on the exchequer,” CA Vijay Kumar Gupta, former central council member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, said. International crude oil prices saw a record jump at $147 per barrel in July 2008, only to plunge to $40 a barrel again in December that year.Anupam Manur, assistant professor at the think tank Takshashila Institution, said, “To keep a stockpile of crude oil in the US-based strategic reserves is an extremely beneficial move. If the idea of maintaining a strategic reserve of petroleum is to mitigate risk and ensure energy security, the objective can be truly achieved by diversifying our strategy. It is in India’s interest to geographically diversify the storage of our petroleum reserves. Beyond this, we should also look at getting into strategic partnerships with Oman, UAE, Sri Lanka, and Japan for our SPR [strategic petroleum reserve] storage strategy.”Recently, due to supply exceeding demand, international oil prices plunged as low as $19.33 per barrel on April 21. Taking advantage of the low international prices, India filled its three strategic reserves to the brim with an average cost of about $25 per barrel. International crude prices soon moved north after the produces’ cartel -- the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, particularly Russia (together OPEC+) -- resorted to unprecedented output cut. Currently, benchmark Brent crude is hovering around $43 a barrel. The US is increasingly becoming a key partner in India’s energy security. India has been importing oil and gas from the US since 2017. In just two years, the US has become one of the top 10 sources of crude oil imports for India.“Ideally, India should have strategic reserves for at least 90 days. Although it is developing its own storage capacities, it can currently store 5.33 million tonnes (MMTs), or 39 million barrels of crude oil, in the three existing caverns,” a second official said requesting anonymity.The three underground caverns are located in Vishakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur. The government has approved the construction of two more strategic crude oil reserves with a total of 6.5 million tonnes of capacity at Chandikhol in Odisha and Padur in Karnataka. The proposed facilities will provide additional storage capacity for 11.57 days of requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-stockpile-oil-in-us-reserves/story-5gcViA55uyn1ABD0YtCFgK.html
18-07-2020||India||Two FIRs filed after audio tapes stir row||The Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police on Friday registered two first information reports alleging a conspiracy to topple the Congress government in the state after the party’s chief whip Mahesh Joshi lodged a complaint on Thursday night citing three audio tapes, purportedly of conversations detailing the plot.Soon after the FIRs were registered -- with several charges including “sedition” -- the Congress demanded the arrest of Union water minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, rebel Congress MLA Bhanwar Lal Sharma, and an alleged middleman Sanjay Jain. The Congress also suspended Sharma and former tourism minister Vishvendra Singh from the party, and sought an explanation from them about the audio tapes.Shekhawat, who is fast emerging as one of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) prominent Rajasthan leaders, denied it was his voice on the audio clips, which were uploaded on social media on Thursday night, and said he was ready to face any investigation. The BJP, meanwhile, dismissed the tapes as “manufactured” by the Congress, which was “frustrated at its inability to keep its house in order”.HT could not independently verify the veracity of the tapes. The tapes were shared with mediapersons through WhtasApp from unverified numbers.The FIR and the charges come in the middle of a raging political battle in the state between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot, who was also the president of the party’s state unit until he was divested of both posts by the Congress on Tuesday.Gehlot, who has the support of at least 101 MLAs in the 200-member assembly -- they are all staying at the Fairmont hotel in Jaipur -- has blamed Pilot of conspiring with the BJP to bring down his government. Pilot, who has at least 21 MLAs supporting him -- they are at the ITC Grand Bharat in Manesar -- has maintained he and his allies are only opposed to Gehlot’s “dictatorial” ways and have nothing to do with the BJP.On Friday afternoon, an SOG team went from Jaipur for Manesar to record statements of Sharma and other Congress legislators staying at the ITC Grand Bharat. “We have sent the team to record the statements to further investigate the complaint,” said the SOG’s additional director general of police, Ashok Rathore.“Joshi has named three accused -- identified as Gajendra Singh, Bhanwarlal Sharma and Sanjay Jain -- on the basis of the recording he had in one complaint. In the second complaint, he has not named anybody,” Rathore said.The FIRs lodged by police identified Sharma as a Congress legislator and mentioned the names Gajendra Singh and Sanjay Jain. Though the FIR did not say Shekhawat, the Congress allegations against him appeared to link him to the complaint.On Friday, Surjewala said it is clear the BJP made attempts to topple the elected Congress government in the state. “Instead of fighting with China and Covid-19, Narendra Modi government is working to loot power,” he said. He demanded that the involvement of others, including leaders holding posts in the Central government, in the conspiracy should be made part of the SOG investigation. He also read out transcripts of the purported conversations. “The voice is not mine. Let the investigation happen,” Shekhawat told reporters in Delhi.Congress chief whip Joshi, who went to the SOG office to get copy of the FIRs, said it will be good if the voice on the tapes did not turn out to be the Union minister’s. “Otherwise, it would be a blot on democracy. He (Shekhawat) should come on his own to the SOG and give his voice samples. The MLA should also give the voice samples,” Joshi said.An SOG officer said on condition of anonymity that Joshi would be called to record his statement about the source of the recordings. Notices in this regard would be issued soon. “Call records of some suspects have been obtained and were being examined,” the officer said. This is the third FIR registered by SOG in the investigation related to an attempt to topple the Congress government. In the first FIR, on July 10, it named two BJP members, Bharat Malani and Ashok Singh, for allegedly trying to bribe legislators. On July 11, the SOG issued notices to Pilot and Gehlot to record their statements. It turned out to be the trigger that set off the ongoing political drama in the state, with Pilot saying that this was Gehlot’s attempt to “humiliate” him. The BJP’s Rajasthan president, Satish Poonia, said It is unfortunate that the CM’s residence has become a “source for leaking the fake audio and tarnish image of political leaders”.“If the tapes are genuine, why is the government not getting a CBI probe done?” Poonia asked.Pilot and his 18 Congress MLA supporters, have been served show-cause notices by the Rajasthan assembly speaker that mark the beginning of disqualification notices against them. The MLAs have challenged the move in high court, which will resume hearing the matter on Monday.Political analyst Bhanwar Meghwanshi said, “If the SOG is not able to reach a conclusion then for the first time in the history of Rajasthan, to settle political score an agency has been used.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-firs-filed-after-audio-tapes-stir-row/story-b3RGS4u3ax1dWMbP1HEIgI.html
18-07-2020||India||Stand-off between Rajasthan, Haryana police at Manesar resort||A five-member special police team from Jaipur was surrounded by dozens of Haryana police personnel outside a luxury resort in Nuh on Friday, a rare stand-off between police departments of two states that took place as fallout of the political battle playing out in Rajasthan. A special operations group (SOG) squad had arrived from Jaipur on Friday evening when they were surrounded by their Haryana counterparts while still in their white SUV. They were attempting to enter the ITC Grand Bharat resort where several MLAs from Rajasthan have gathered as part of a rebellion of former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. The team, which arrived to question one of the MLAs in connection with an audio recording that suggested a possible attempt to break the government in the state, was initially stopped for around one-and-a-half hours before it was allowed to enter the resort. “None of the MLAs were there. We searched the entire resort but failed to find them,” said an SOG officer, who asked not to be named. Another Rajasthan police official said that the MLAs were shifted to another hotel in Gurugram, about eight kms from ITC Grand Bharat. The Rajasthan police team almost entered the premises since most of the cops deployed by Nuh police retreated to their buses around 200 metres from the hotel entry. But as the Rajasthan squad arrived, a large posse of Nuh police reached the gate and formed a ring outside the hotel. The police team was asked to stay outside the hotel premises and wait for permission but it was only after Inspector Jitender Kumar, SHO, Tauru police station intervened and asked the cops from neighbouring states to retreat that they moved. Jitender Kumar, SHO, Tauru police station said that they had no role in stopping the police team and it was the hotel staff that had checked their documents and asked them to wait before entry. “We have nothing to do with their entry,” he said. “We came to know at the spot that a team from Rajasthan had come to investigate a matter but the local police had no information in this regard. We did not stop anyone from entering the hotel and later the police team was allowed entry by the management,” said Narender Bijraniya, SP, Nuh. Hotel officials deployed at the spot when asked about the issue said that the police team did not have permission to enter the resort. A senior ITC Hotels executive did not respond to requests for a comment on the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stand-off-between-raj-hry-police-at-manesar-resort/story-fxDR6sYYNueKzd4NzU4yiL.html
18-07-2020||India||High Court gives rebel Congress MLAs 4-day breather||Sachin Pilot and 18 other rebel Congress MLAs got a four-day breather as the Rajasthan high court on Friday directed that no action be taken against them until Tuesday, while deferring the hearing of their plea challenging the state assembly speaker’s disqualification notices.The speaker assured the court that he would not act till 5.30pm on Tuesday on the notices issued to dissident legislators over their failure to attend two Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meetings. The bench of chief justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice Prakash Gupta also asked Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi, who had filed a complaint before the speaker, to respond to the dissidents’ petition by Saturday. Senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the speaker, will resume his arguments at 10am on Monday. Senior counsel Harish Salve and Mukul Rohtagi, representing Pilot and others, completed their side of arguments. “Propriety demands that when the matter is in court action should not be taken. We have assured the court that the speaker will not take any action till the matter is being heard by the division bench,” said Prateek Kasliwal, counsel for the speaker. “The speaker will not take any action till Tuesday as it would not be justified as the issue sub-judice.”The MLAs, who moved the court challenging the notice issued to them by assembly speaker CP Joshi on July 14 seeking an explanation on why they should not be disqualified from the assembly, told the court that ruling party legislators disagreeing with the manner of functioning of the chief minister cannot be construed as indicating their intention to leave the party so as to trigger the anti-defection law.Criticising the party leadership is an exercise of freedom of speech and cannot be a ground to disqualify a lawmaker on the grounds of defection, Salve added in his submission. “Raising disagreements is an exercise of freedom of speech and will not amount to defection,” he said. The petitioners through their counsel, Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, contended that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session and that airing of grievances against party leadership cannot be construed as voluntarily giving up party membership under 2 (1) (a) of the Tenth schedule of the Constitution.The petition challenged the speaker’s notice, which was based on a complaint by Mahesh Joshi, that the MLAs should be disqualified from the Rajasthan assembly for defying the whip.In his complaint to the speaker, Mahesh Joshi sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under Clause 2 (1) (a) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution. This clause provides for disqualification of MLAs if they “voluntarily” give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.Mahesh Joshi cited the absence of the dissident MLAs in two Congress legislature party meetings of July 13 and 14 despite specific direction to attend the same along with hostile and prejudicial conduct against the Congress party, as indication of the dissidents’ intention to leave the party. But the dissident camp said Pilot had never indicated any intention to leave the Congress party.A party whip’s directions with respect to acts outside the house will not trigger anti-defection law envisaged in the tenth schedule of the Constitution, Salve submitted.“Party whip is not applicable when it comes to meetings at homes and hotels, it applies only to proceedings within the assembly”, he argued. He also submitted that though Pilot and other dissident MLAs had raised their voice against the manner in which chief minister Ashok Gehlot was functioning, the same cannot be construed as defection. Singhvi questioned the maintainability of the plea stating that it is a settled position of law that courts cannot interfere with the disqualification proceedings under tenth schedule until the speaker gives a decision. A challenge in court to a speaker’s notice to show cause, is premature, he said.The dissidents have stated in their petition that speaker’s notice is an attempt to stifle the voice of the petitioners who are seeking a leadership change within the party in a democratic way. They alleged any grievances regarding the functioning of the government were not tolerated by the chief minister Gehlot. The claimed that the chief minister called a legislature party meeting on July 13 without providing any specific agenda and levelled certain baseless allegations against them. Subsequently, they were issued notices by the chief whip for not attending the meeting, said the petition.“The undue haste and swiftness exhibited by the authority (speaker) concerned in taking cognisance of the said complaint (by the party whip) leaves no doubt in the minds of the petitioners that the move is aimed at arriving at a foregone conclusion leading to the disqualification of the petitioners,” it addedBoth Congress and BJP spokespersons declined to comment on court’s proceedings saying the matter was sub-judice.Political analyst Narayan Bareth said the court’s order was is a temporary relief. “The day’s development will not come as a shock to the government but to the dissidents as they had gone to the court with hope of getting relief,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-gives-rebel-cong-mlas-4-day-breather/story-TnD4vJwibu2SROhfErA91J.html

For our little family of four, getting to spend more hours together has been great,’’ writes Francis from Kenya. Himani, a teacher from Mumbai, says, “I recently made my students draw themselves as potatoes to show them what they’d look like if they chose to eat unhealthy during the quarantine.’’ Whereas, Estefania, a consultant in the USA, describes, “My son continues to go back and forth between his dad’s house and mine, which underscores the bond we have as a blended family.” Many such stories, dotted in a grid pattern, are narrated on an Instagram handle called 6ft love, which aims to bridge the six feet physical distance through emotional connections.   "Calamity, illness, death — these are unavoidable fates, inevitable visitors, always in the neighbourhood, somehow still surprising when they come knock. All we want, I think, is to forget that they’re on their way. To run outside, revel, play. But we know too vividly that when suffering isn’t at our door, it’s breaking down someone else’s. . . .I’m trying to nourish my capacities for generosity and moral clarity to keep up with times that promise to exact more and more of both." — Rega, Writer/Content Creator (Mumbai, India) __ Let’s create the world’s largest Social (Distance) Network!

The trans US-India team that has conceived this page includes urban planners Sabah Usmani, Sera Tolgay, Akemi Sato, designer Mira Khandpur, illustrators Diana Ang, Aashti Miller and Nikita Notowidigdo, and an environment and social specialist Daphne Yin. Every day, this Insta page profiles an individual’s story, including an illustration and a quote of how they are navigating the outbreak and dealing with physical distancing. “We are gathering stories spanning a diversity of experiences, backgrounds, and geographies. We welcome stories submitted in any language, and include quotes in their original language alongside an English translation. We aim to create the world’s largest Social (Distance) Network. I felt that there was a need to spread the message that just because we are practising physical distancing, it doesn’t mean we can’t be social or connect with people, be it our loved ones or strangers,” says Sabah Usmani, the brain behind this project. The team has so far profiled stories from more than 18 countries, 37 cities, and 50 professionals ranging from doctors and domestic workers to logistics operators, comedians and writers.The desire to document the quarantine and connect people also inspired three advertising professionals in Spain’s Barcelona to start Covid Art Museum on Instagram. The page displays artworks submitted by people across the world, created on different coronavirus themes spanning from toilet papers to social distancing. Emma Calvo, Irene Llorca and Jose Guerrero, the founders of this project, share, “Few days into the quarantine in Spain, and we realised that people were sharing artworks that they created during their isolation. We could sense a movement here and asked ourselves what would happen with all of this art. We didn’t want these artworks to be forgotten; so we came up with the idea of a digital museum, to make them more accessible to people all over the world.’’   by @vitu_od _________________ Follow for more: @CovidArtMuseum Share your artwork with us #CovidArtMuseum The world’s 1st museum for art born during Covid19 quarantine #CovidArt #Covid19 #QuarantineArtA post shared by  CAM The Covid Art Museum (@covidartmuseum) on Jul 3, 2020 at 1:22pm PDTThis team receives around 200 proposals every day from the world over. “The aim is to create a Covid Art Museum to serve as an archive to remember using art that collective feeling as it was expressed by people during the confinement. And, it can also be a meeting point between artists and other professionals in the creative world, generating fruitful connections,” adds Calvo.Back home in India, a team at Sunaparanta Goa Centre for the Arts — soon after lockdown — started brainstorming ideas on how to stay connected with their audience. What emerged from this search is the Surviving SQ (self-quarantine) series. A part of the series is Pallavi Paul’s Share Your Quiet project, which had invited people in isolation to share 10 second sound bytes of silence or old sounds that were forgotten, or new ones that have been discovered during this time. “The recordings we collected were streamed on Mondays as a symphony of silence. We received entries from more than 850 individuals from places as far as Norway, Serbia, Japan, New Zealand, New York, Milan, and Paris to as close as Panjim in Goa,” shares Leandre D’souza, curator at Sunapatra, adding, “We wanted to discover beauty in the emptiness of public spaces.

18-07-2020||India||Use data to predict upcoming hotspots, says epidemiologist who predicted million cases in mid-July||Within weeks of the outbreak beginning in early March, mathematical and epidemiological models predicted that India was on track for a high case load given its large population and dense cities. “The first million has happened in four months, the next million will happen before the end of next month if we give in,” says Bhramar Mukherjee, the head of the Biostatistics department at University of Michigan in an interview to HT. Mukherjee and academics from two other American universities were part of an India study group that first predicted India’s high caseload will reach to the levels it has now. Edited excerpts:Your initial projections included assumptions about how the outbreak would pan out in India and these now appear to have come true. Can you explain to us how you arrived at the results?Several things that led to the accuracy of our projections:(1) We updated our projections daily and our model got calibrated with more data on the ground each day. By May, it was robust and ran like a well-oiled machine. Initially it had larger uncertainty. I still do not trust long term projections (beyond two months) very much.(2)We made assumptions about the reproduction number when India comes out of lockdown under two scenarios of cautious return and moderate return. For forecasting we set R (reproduction number) at 1.2 and 1.5 respectively. Coincidentally the national R has stayed between 1.2-1.3 for the last one month. That also explains the agreement.(3)We quickly realised national data was masking state level trends so started to predict which states should be alert through state-level models. Our metrics dashboard is a very cohesive public health summary.What could authorities and the general public in India have done to have undercut the predictions you and your team made?First, centralised isolation. It is hard to self-isolate in Indian households. This can prevent household transmission and cluster transmission in high density neighbourhoods and large households. For populous countries like India, this is critical. Second, India must ramp up testing and carry out symptom tracking in absence of testing.There should be an integrative leadership that coordinates between different sectors of healthcare, public health, social support and economy. The measures must earn trust from the public around data and information.India should have data-driven policy making at a granular level. It is data deficient in the health sector and that is hurting us.And lastly, there should be a balance between alarmism and denial. We need to accept that this is a long haul. We cannot surrender to destiny. We are all tired but we have to keep at it.What part of the current data would you particularly like to draw attention to in order to slow the next million cases and what should India focus on?It is very crucial that the results of population-based large sero-surveys are released soon. Existing data should be used to:(a) Flag states/metros at nascent stages of growth and impose strong measures including punctuated and modulated lockdown. This cannot be done when infections are already leading to large case-counts, as these come with a lag. What you see as cases today happened as infections two weeks ago.(b) Scale up Covid-testing and treatment facilities. The healthcare system is fragile. Everyone cannot fall sick at the same time and still have a bed, oxygen. Anticipate emerging peaks, deploy resources in a data-driven way.(c) Before imposing lockdown, quantify what a two week lockdown will do for you, how much can you ramp up testing and Covid treatment? How many infections can you delay? Lockdown is not the cure or a default strategy. We need to re-lock only when necessary. A long term effective control of the virus will automatically revive the economy.With 400,000 active cases, we will never be able to afford a long enough lockdown to get the cases to 100s.While the million cases prediction has come true, the government has said that it has reduced fatalities and slowed the growth of the epidemic. Would you agree with the assessment?The first million happened in 4 months, I expect India to hit 2 million by the end of August if things are going as they are, even if Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu bring it under control as they seem to be closely inching toward.The low case fatality rate is a positive factor in favour of India but in India, a very large percentage of deaths are not medically reported. Even if they are, cause of death is often misclassified. Case fatality rate is a ratio of the number of deaths divided by the number of cases. Neither do I believe the numerator, nor the denominator, so I would not rely on the ratio to rescue me from this long and painful crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-data-to-predict-upcoming-hotspots-says-epidemiologist-who-predicted-million-cases-in-mid-july/story-y59IGsvwp5d47l2AuaEqqM.html
