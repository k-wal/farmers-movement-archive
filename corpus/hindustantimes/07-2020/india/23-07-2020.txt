We in the UK want to work with China and hope for positive, constructive engagement and strive for that...We welcome all partners who join us in calling out what is a serious violation of the UK-China joint declaration...,” Barton said.The UK also has “grave concerns” about human rights abuses, particularly against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, he added. Pointing specifically to Huawei’s role in 5G, he said the UK and India can work together to resolve such “wider global issues” and to diversify markets.Asked about the activities in the UK of Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan group banned by India, Barton declined to go into details but said Britain would act if any of its laws were violated.“In the UK, you have the right to protest and the right to freedom of speech is there but there are limits to it. Where people clearly break the law, we will take action. We have a dialogue with the Indian government across a range of issues of mutual interest and extremism of all kinds is one of those,” he said.Barton said there was no inconsistency between the Indian government projecting the country as an open destination for trade and investment while also working for self-reliance through the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiative. The two countries, he said, can work on making critical supply chains more resilient.“It’s perfectly possible for India to be an open trading economy and open to investments and international cooperation while also pursuing the [Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative] and wanting to manufacture in India and wanting to build manufacturing and other capacities and capability...I don’t see any inconsistency,” he said.Barton, a career diplomat with long experience of South Asia and India, advised the need for caution while responding to questions about the two countries cooperating on Covid-19 vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca backed vaccine that has shown encouraging results.He said it wasn’t known for certain if any of the vaccines would work, and the world community needs to keep backing a suite of potential vaccines till research reaches a stage where experts can be confident. Distribution of any successful vaccine would also be based on the ability of countries to pay for it and those needing subsidies, he added.India’s “fantastic vaccine capability” and the tie-up between the Serum Institute of India and AstraZeneca represent a “clear partnership with India” in this field, Barton said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-envoy-raises-concerns-over-china-s-actions/story-rt3dSBszYMpN0aNBii9oUL.html
23-07-2020||India||Curbs on procurement from border countries||New DelhiThe finance ministry on Thursday made an important amendment in its public finance rule that barred all government agencies to procure goods and services from bordering countries such as China and Pakistan on the ground of national security, two officials said, requesting anonymity. “The Government of India today amended the General Financial Rules (GFR) 2017 to enable imposition of restrictions on bidders from countries which share a land border with India on grounds of defence of India, or matters directly or indirectly related thereto including national security,” the finance ministry said in a statement. The GFR laws regulate all matters related to public finance.The order takes into its ambit all public sector companies, autonomous bodies and public-private partnership (PPP) projects receiving financial support from the government, it said. State government and its undertakings have been also directed to follow the suit.The Department of Expenditure, an arm of the finance ministry, issued two separate orders on late Thursday night. While the first order barred public procurements from countries sharing land-borders with India, the second gave exemptions to certain neighbours whom India offers lines of credit. According to the officials mentioned above, they could be neighbours such as Nepal and Bhutan.But the notifications did not mention names of any particular country or group of countries.Bidders from countries that are barred could bid in any procurement whether of goods, services, including consultancy services only if the bidder is registered with “the Competent Authority”, the statement said.“The Competent Authority for registration will be the Registration Committee constituted by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Political and security clearance from the Ministries of External and Home Affairs respectively will be mandatory,” it said.Relaxation has been provided in certain limited cases, including for procurement of medical supplies for containment of Covid-19 global pandemic till December 31, 2020.By a separate order, countries to which India extends lines of credit or provides development assistance have been exempted from the requirement of prior registration, the statement said.The new provisions will apply to all new tenders. In respect of tenders already invited, if the first stage of evaluation of qualifications has not been completed, bidders who are not registered under the new order will be treated as not qualified, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curbs-on-procurement-from-border-countries/story-1mQawKwSFrAZpAMNd9nTSO.html
23-07-2020||India||No extradition time frame in Vijay Mallya case: UK||New Delhi: The UK cannot give a timeframe for the extradition of businessman Vijay Mallya though the British government and courts are clear on their roles in preventing people from avoiding justice by moving across national borders, British high commissioner Philip Barton said on Thursday.Barton declined to answer a question during a virtual news briefing on whether Mallya had sought asylum in the UK, saying the British government never comments on individual asylum cases.“The UK government and the courts, [which] are independent of government, are absolutely clear around their roles in preventing people [from] avoiding justice by moving country. We are all determined to play our part in any case, and to make sure that we’re working together to ensure that criminals can’t escape justice by crossing national borders,” he said.Mallya’s extradition was ordered in February but “there is an ongoing legal case and I can’t comment any further on that and I can’t say anything at all about timescales”, Barton said. “The UK government understands the importance of the case,” he added.Last month, India said it had asked the UK not to consider any asylum request from Mallya, currently on bail pending his extradition, as there are no grounds for his persecution in the country. India has also said it has sought the early extradition of Mallya from the UK.The UK has so far only said a “confidential” legal issue was holding up Mallya’s extradition but that it was trying to deal with the matter as quickly as possible. Britain’s stance gave rise to speculation the 64-year-old businessman, wanted in India to face charges of financial irregularities, could have applied for asylum.Mallya lost his appeal against the 2018 order to extradite him in the UK high court in April. Last month, the high court also refused Mallya permission to appeal in the UK Supreme Court.He is wanted in India to face charges of financial offences involving Rs 9,000 crore borrowed by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines from several Indian banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-extradition-time-frame-in-vijay-mallya-case-uk/story-hmWDDslkVVhzxqoFUPxELM.html
23-07-2020||India||India accuses Pak of blocking review options||New Delhi India on Thursday accused Pakistan of blocking all avenues for an effective review of the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, sentenced to death for alleged involvement in spying, and said it reserved its rights to avail of further remedies.A day after the Pakistan government petitioned the Islamabad high court to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav for filing a review petition against his death sentence, the external affairs ministry charged Islamabad with systematically blocking access to the former naval officer, not providing documents related to his case and violating the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) order for a review of his conviction.“[Pakistan] has blocked all the avenues for an effective remedy available for India,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly briefing.“Pakistan has completely failed to provide the remedy as directed by the ICJ and India reserves its position in the matter, including its rights to avail of further remedies,” he said, without giving details.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India would take the next step after legal consultations. They didn’t preclude the possibility of again approaching the ICJ on Jadhav’s case.The Pakistan government promulgated an ordinance on May 20 to give foreign citizens convicted in the country the right to file a review petition in courts. The ordinance was aimed at complying with ICJ’s order for effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s conviction and sentencing by a Pakistani military court.But even here Pakistan’s actions had led to confusion, Srivastava said. Pakistan created confusion over the last date for filing a review petition, initially saying it was July 19 before changing the date to July 20. Pakistan took two weeks to inform India about the ordinance and shared the copy of it only after a request from New Delhi.India conveyed its concerns about “inadequacies and shortcomings in the ordinance” with Pakistan in June. It also informed Pakistan the ordinance “neither fulfils nor does it give complete weight to the judgment of the ICJ”, Srivastava said.India also made repeated requests to Pakistan to provide documents related to Jadhav’s case and was told they could be handed over only to an authorised Pakistani lawyer. “Thereafter, India appointed a Pakistani lawyer to obtain the relevant documents. To our surprise...when the authorised Pakistani lawyer approached the concerned authorities, they declined to hand over the documents to the lawyer,” he added.In the absence of unhindered consular access to Jadhav and the documents, the Indian side tried, as a last resort, to file a review petition in Islamabad high court on July 18. “However, our Pakistani lawyer [said] that a review petition could not be filed in the absence of power of attorney and supporting documents related to the case of Jadhav,” said Srivastava.Indian officials had walked out of a meeting with Jadhav on July 16 after Pakistan breached assurances about providing unimpeded consular access. “The meeting of consular officers with Jadhav on July 16 was scuttled by Pakistan authorities. The consular officers were instructed not to hand over any document to Jadhav. Hence, the officers could not obtain a power of attorney from Jadhav,” he said.Srivastava said Pakistan was “non-serious in its approach and was not interested in implementing the judgment of the ICJ in letter and spirit”. He added, “The whole exercise of not providing any documents related to the case even after repeated requests, not providing unimpeded consular access and some reported unilateral action of approaching the Islamabad high court on the part of Pakistan again exposes the farcical nature of Pakistan’s approach,” he said.Jadhav, 50, was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. In April 2017, Pakistan announced he had been sentenced to death by a military court.ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and stayed his execution while calling for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-accuses-pak-of-blocking-review-options/story-fwbfWHqrdOLgauwOiEZdbJ.html

23-07-2020||India||Piyush Goyal calls for building trust for trade at BRICS meeting||Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal called upon BRICS nations to enhance transparency in trade and build trust to prevent losing their role of preeminent trade partner. Goyal’s comments came during the 10th meeting of trade ministers attended by member countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—on Thursday.“It is trust and transparency which determines the sustainability of global supply chains and nations must demonstrate their compliance with global rules of trade to remain a part of global trade flow. Increasingly, nations which trust each other are coming together to build global supply chains with corresponding investments in manufacturing and services,” a commerce ministry statement said, quoting Goyal.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, had highlighted the importance of trust in building trade relations between countries during his address at India Ideas Summit organized by the USIBC forum on Wednesday.Referring to Covid-19 outbreak and its impact on the economy, he said trade can be an engine of reviving growth premised on strengthening of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) based on its principles of openness, fairness, transparency, inclusivity, and non-discrimination.He called for removing multiple hurdles to accessing medicines at affordable prices created by lopsided WTO rules for protecting intellectual property. “IPRs [intellectual property rights] should not block access to critical medicines and other devices required for the treatment of disease,” he said.Goyal said the pandemic has paradoxically provided nations a window of opportunity to add strength by building capacities, expanding manufacturing as well as by plugging into the global value chains. “As BRICS members are among the most affected countries in the world, we must collectively demonstrate a determined will to emerge stronger, while being prepared to face any such unknown crisis,” he said.The multilateral rules-based trading system is facing serious and grave challenges, including a spate of unilateral measures and countermeasures, deadlock in key areas of negotiations and an impasse in the appellate body, the minister said.Also Read: Northeast has potential to become India’s growth engine: PM Narendra ModiHe said the WTO reform process should take into account the existing realities in the world and should, therefore, be inclusive, balanced and consensus based, leading to prosperity for all.“It is disheartening that we are seeing some proposals at the WTO seeking to ride on the pandemic for pursuing commercial ends. It will essentially support the quest of developed countries’ firms to have unhindered access to the markets in developing countries, while putting constraints on developing countries to establish domestic manufacturing capacities,” he said.Describing 2020 as a turning point in the history of multilateralism, especially for the BRICS grouping, the minister said that any economic partnership must keep in mind the different size and population of each country, unequal levels of economic development and human development indicators, contrasting levels of prosperity, cultural diversity and significantly different political and judicial systems.“We place humanity at the centre of our global engagement and thus despite being hit hard by the virus ourselves, we have not shied away from providing humanitarian relief to those who sought it,” he said. India provided critical medical supplies to around 150 countries in these troubled times.As the ‘Pharmacy of the World’ we have catered to the spike in demand for drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine and Paracetamol being used for the treatment of Covid-19, he added.Talking about India’s proactive role in assessing and dealing with the challenges caused by the pandemic, he said saving lives has been India’s highest priority.“Despite being home to nearly 17% of the world population, we have only 8% of Covid-19 affected patients worldwide. Under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime minister Narendra Modi, we implemented one of the severest lockdowns at an early stage thereby breaking the coronavirus transmission chain and prepared the country to become self-reliant in covid care facilities,” he said.“We have done significantly better than many other countries, with a lower death rate and higher recovery rate,” he added.Speaking about the steps taken to mitigate the economic challenges posed by the pandemic and bringing the economy back on track, Goyal said the Prime Minister announced a stimulus package of over $300 billion, called ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-reliant India Initiative). He said the edifice of this mission stands on five pillars of the economy -- massive infrastructure building, technology, aspects of good governance, leveraging the demographic dividend, and promoting demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/piyush-goyal-calls-for-building-trust-for-trade-at-brics-meeting/story-hdtpkhAmSpSQ4niUJiwInL.html
23-07-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling: After Customs, NIA questions CM Vijayan’s former secretary||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the gold smuggling case on Thursday grilled Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar. He was suspended from service last week after his alleged link with one of the accused in the case Swapna Suresh surfaced.He was interrogated by the Customs department for nine hours on July 14. He was instrumental in getting a key post for Suresh in Kerala Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT department. She allegedly used her proximity with the powerful principal secretary to dabble in corridors of power.There are reports that he arranged a flat just outside the secretariat for the husband of Swapna Suresh and another accused PS Sarith. The accused had later used this flat for their smuggling activities. Sivasankar had earlier told the Customs that he arranged this over friendship and he did not know about their illegal activities. A senior IAS officer, he was the CM’s blue-eyed boy and was instrumental in bringing many IT and social projects to the state. In another development, the NIA has sought the CCTV footage of the state secretariat and sent a letter to chief secretary Biswas Mehta in this regard. Earlier, when customs sought this, his office had told them that the cameras developed snags during lightening in May. The NIA has also sought details of the service provider.When asked about this, the CM did not give a direct reply. “Let the NIA carry out its investigation. Its probe is going in the right direction. Why do you want to jump the gun,” he retorted. But the opposition has stepped up pressure on him. “The probe has reached the office of the CM. He has no moral responsibility to remain in power,” said BJP state president K Surendran. Congress state chief Mullappally Ramachandran also sought his resignation. The gold smuggling case came to light on July 5 when PS Sarith, a former employee of the UAE consulate in the state capital, was arrested when he went to receive a consignment in the name of an official of the consulate. Later, 30 kg of gold was retrieved from the consignment. Five days later, Swapna Suresh, a senior IT official and her friend Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru. Later the case was handed over to the NIA.The Customs department has deferred the transfer of key officials who are investigating the gold smuggling case following an outrage. The Union Home Ministry has also expressed serious reservations over the issue saying such a controversy should have been avoided when the investigation was going in the right track, a senior official familiar with the development said.The sudden transfer of six superintendents and two inspectors attached with Kochi unit of the Customs who are part of the ongoing investigation was issued by Mohammad Yousaf, Commissioner of Customs, late on Wednesday. After the issue triggered a controversy the Customs department made it clear that it was a routine transfer and it had been deferred for the time being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-after-customs-nia-questions-cm-vijayan-s-former-secretary/story-NyJnPWBmR7E4TxMuEeZx5M.html

The governments in opposition ruled states are being brought down immorally,” the letter put out by ANI says.Kamal Nath’s letter comes in the backdrop of alleged attempts to topple the Congress government in Rajasthan amid allegations of BJP’s involvement in the purported plot to fan dissidence in state Congress led by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.

He further suggests that the present political turmoil could have a link with the Centre.“My worries are not limited to the falling of the Congress government in the state. Country’s democratic system is undergoing a turmoil today and it is suspected that it could be centered in the capital. But I hope that this suspicion is proven to be without a basis and that you will come forward to save the falling prestige of India’s democracy,” he says in the letter.Kamal Nath’s letter comes on a day when another Congress MLA quit the party and joined the BJP in Madhya Pradesh, taking the total number of party MLAs to have quit the party in the last two weeks to three.

23-07-2020||India||Maintenance of peace along LAC basis of bilateral relationship with China: India||India on Thursday asserted that the maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the Line of Control(LAC) is the basis of its bilateral relationship with China, and said it expected the Chinese side to be sincere in completing the disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh. At an online media briefing, MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said another round of diplomatic talks under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) is expected to be scheduled soon. “The maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is the basis of our bilateral relationship,” he said. “Therefore it is our expectation that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas at the earliest as agreed to by the Special Representatives,” Srivastava added. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a nearly two-hour-long telephonic conversation on July 5 to bring down tension between the armies of the two countries in eastern Ladakh. Both sides began the disengagement process from July 6 following the talks between Doval and Wang who were Special Representatives for the boundary question. “We have also made it clear that India is fully committed to observing and respecting the LAC and that we will not accept any unilateral attempts to change the status quo along the LAC,” said Srivastava. He said the two sides have agreed during the conversation of the Special Representatives to work towards complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC and de-escalation from India-China border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquillity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maintenance-of-peace-along-lac-basis-of-bilateral-relationship-with-china-india/story-jDhpEQb7BYUdQNO9Oc5G4O.html

He said the case has been filed under section 26 of the Indian Forest Act 1927.Section 26 in the Indian Forest Act, 1927 deals with acts prohibited in forests including setting fire to a reserved forest, felling of trees, stone quarrying, clearing or breaking up any forest land for cultivation or any other purpose, erecting any building or construction and so on.Divisional forest officer (DFO) Dehradun also submitted an affidavit in the high court a few days back listing the action taken so far and what further action would be taken in the case. HT has seen a copy of the counter affidavit filed by the state government.A senior forest department official, privy to the developments, said on the condition of anonymity that after the high court had issued directions in December last year, they had taken possession of the 2.5 acre encroached land by Swami Chidanand Saraswati, in March. Earlier this month on July 6 and later on July 15, HC asked what subsequent action the forest department had taken in the matter.“We booked Swami Chidanand Saraswati, under section 26 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 (H2 case) and appointed an inquiry officer who will give his report on the matter. Range officer Rishikesh has been appointed as the inquiry officer. Based on his inquiry report, further action like determining the time period for which the forest land had been under encroachment, the penalty that needs to be imposed and the amount of compensation will be decided,” the official mentioned above said.According to the affidavit filed by the forest department, the inquiry officer will investigate for how long Swami Chidanand Saraswati was in unauthorised possession of the said forest land and the period of illegal occupation will be taken into account for calculation of compensation and subsequent imposition of penalty by DFO Dehradun.Vinay Kumar, who represents Swami Chidanand Saraswati, said the land had been donated by the villagers and part of it was bought from some people before 2005.“The land was around one hectare. We set up a Gurukul there and had plans to set up a school. But when we came to know that it was forest land, we immediately applied online for a lease of the land, which is still pending. When the case was filed in HC, we stopped the Gurukul in February and handed over the land to the forest department,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/head-of-famous-rishikesh-ashram-chidanand-saraswati-booked-for-encroachment-of-forest-land/story-jmN5r0x9cQOQmNgtL8pe1K.html

The man was identified as Kadar Hussain, a resident of Jaora town, about 40 kilometres from Ratlam district headquarters. He is already facing two theft cases lodged earlier, police said. A video of the brutal beating went viral on social media on Thursday prompting the police to conduct an inquiry into it but by then Kadar had been booked under the Arms Act and sent to jail.In the three-minute video clip Hussain’s hands are seen tied behind a pick-up truck and people beating him up with sticks. Those beating him are heard asking him to confess that he had stolen garlic from the market.City superintendent of police (CSP) of Jaora P S Ranawat said, “A group of people handed over Kadar Hussain to Jaora police station. They had also recovered a knife from his. After an inquiry he was arrested under section 25 of the Arms Act. Later, he was sent to jail.” Ranawat said, “Since the video has come to light now I have asked Jaora police station to identify the people who beat him up. We will take action according to findings in the probe.” This is the second incident within a week in Madhya Pradesh in which people have taken the law in their hands and beat up an alleged thief in public. Last week, a 30-year-old man was mercilessly beaten in Guna for allegedly trying to steal a pesticide packet. Later, police had registered a case against eight people who allegedly beat the man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-who-allegedly-tried-to-steal-garlic-tied-to-vehicle-and-thrashed-in-mp/story-HXJ1ronGN9bbBfJFzMjAwI.html
23-07-2020||India||Forest officer in MP transferred after complaint against BJP lawmaker||A forest range officer posted in Nauradehi sanctuary in Bundelkhand region in Madhya Pradesh was transferred within a fortnight of lodging a complaint with police against a BJP MLA.Madhya Pradesh’s principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) said the transfer on Wednesday was in the interest of the officer.Forest officer Tilak Singh Raipuria in his complaint lodged with sub-divisional officer of police (SDoP) at Tendukheda in Damoh district on July 10 accused BJP MLA Dharmendra Singh Lodhi of abusing and threatening him with dire consequences for taking action against two persons who were caught fishing in a prohibited area in the forest.The forest officer was transferred on Wednesday to Sheopur which is about 500 km away from Nauradehi.In his complaint to the police, the forest officer had said, “Pankaj Vishwas and Ramkishun Chakraborty of village Sarra were arrested on July 10,2020 under sections 9, 27, 29, 50, 51 (2) of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. I got a call to set them free. The caller introduced himself as Jabera MLA Dharmendra Singh Lodhi who inquired with me as to who had been arrested. When I told him the arrested man was some Doctor saheb who was hunting he said he had received a number of complaints against me and that if I didn’t release the man I would face dire consequences. He used abusive language against me.” Requesting the police to take necessary action, the officer said in the complaint, “MLA Dharmedra Singh Lodhi exerted pressure on me to let go a criminal and also threatened that he would gherao me with 1,000 people. While there was obstruction in discharging my duties as a government servant, I face a threat to my life.” An audio clip went viral on social media in which a man introducing himself as the MLA from Jabera constituency Dharmedra Lodhi is heard using abusive language against the officer Tilak Singh and threatening him. Lodhi, as heard in the clip, wanted no action against the fishing accused ‘doctor’ while the officer stood his ground.The MLA, however, denied that he used abusive language against the officer or threatened him and said there were numerous complaints of excesses against him that he had received from local villagers. When contacted after his transfer Tilak Singh said, “I take it not as a punishment posting but routine administrative exercise in the department.”Divisional conservator of forest at Sagar, Naveen Garg said, “There was no recommendation from my side for the transfer of the ranger officer.” Principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) Rajesh Shrivastava said, “We had received a complaint from the MLA which had in it statements and affidavits of some villagers too. We had sent an officer to conduct an inquiry into the complaint. The officer was transferred based on the inquiry report. We found that the atmosphere over there was against him. Hence, the transfer was effected in his interest.” (With input from Anupam Pateriya in Sagar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forest-officer-in-mp-transferred-after-complaint-against-bjp-lawmaker/story-frPwWXvEHa3O1HSG3L3duK.html

The air force could deploy the new fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, officials previously indicated to Hindustan Times.The Hammer, consisting of a guidance kit and a range extension kit fitted on a standard bomb of the Mk80 series, is manufactured by French defence firm Safran. The Hammer purchase will necessitate the import of Mk80 series bombs that can later be manufactured in India, said a second official.The other weapons that the Rafale jets will be armed with include Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles.While India initiated discussions with France to buy Hammer two to three years ago, the current border tensions with China have lent fresh urgency to the procurement, said a third official. “Enhancement of capability, especially under the present circumstances, will serve the IAF well. Efforts should be made to fast-track the purchase,” said Air Chief Marshal Fali H Major (retd), a former IAF chief.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to plug gaps in the IAF’s combat capabilities. The jets have been specially tailored for IAF.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases including Leh, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions – ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. It can carry more than nine tonnes of weapons on as many as 14 hard-points.The two Rafale squadrons will be based at Ambala in Haryana and Hasimara in West Bengal, covering the western and eastern fronts.Acting on a special request by the IAF, France has accelerated the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India --- five jets are coming to Ambala instead of four that were originally planned to be delivered in the first batch.According to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected by April-May 2022. Future deliveries will also be expedited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-eyes-new-smart-weapon-for-rafale-jets-amid-border-row/story-zbUjRqL6bjXGdagWPswaOM.html

23-07-2020||India||Pakistan has blocked review of Kulbhushan Jadhav’s case, says India||India on Thursday accused Pakistan of blocking all avenues for an effective review of the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, sentenced to death for alleged involvement in spying, and said it reserved its rights to avail of further remedies.A day after the Pakistan government petitioned the Islamabad high court to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav for filing a review petition against his death sentence, the external affairs ministry charged Islamabad with systematically blocking access to the former naval officer, not providing documents related to his case and violating the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) order for a review of his conviction.“[Pakistan] has blocked all the avenues for an effective remedy available for India,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly briefing.“Pakistan has completely failed to provide the remedy as directed by the ICJ and India reserves its position in the matter, including its rights to avail of further remedies,” he said, without giving details.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India would take the next step after legal consultations. They didn’t preclude the possibility of again approaching the ICJ on Jadhav’s case.The Pakistan government promulgated an ordinance on May 20 to give foreign citizens convicted in the country the right to file a review petition in courts. The ordinance was aimed at complying with ICJ’s order for effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s conviction and sentencing by a Pakistani military court.But even here Pakistan’s actions had led to confusion, Srivastava said. Pakistan created confusion over the last date for filing a review petition, initially saying it was July 19 before changing the date to July 20. Pakistan took two weeks to inform India about the ordinance and shared the copy of it only after a request from New Delhi.India conveyed its concerns about “inadequacies and shortcomings in the ordinance” with Pakistan in June. It also informed Pakistan the ordinance “neither fulfils nor does it give complete weight to the judgment of the ICJ”, Srivastava said.India also made repeated requests to Pakistan to provide documents related to Jadhav’s case and was told they could be handed over only to an authorised Pakistani lawyer. “Thereafter, India appointed a Pakistani lawyer to obtain the relevant documents. To our surprise...when the authorised Pakistani lawyer approached the concerned authorities, they declined to hand over the documents to the lawyer,” he added.In the absence of unhindered consular access to Jadhav and the documents, the Indian side tried, as a last resort, to file a review petition in Islamabad high court on July 18. “However, our Pakistani lawyer [said] that a review petition could not be filed in the absence of power of attorney and supporting documents related to the case of Jadhav,” said Srivastava.Indian officials had walked out of a meeting with Jadhav on July 16 after Pakistan breached assurances about providing unimpeded consular access. “The meeting of consular officers with Jadhav on July 16 was scuttled by Pakistan authorities. The consular officers were instructed not to hand over any document to Jadhav. Hence, the officers could not obtain a power of attorney from Jadhav,” he said.Srivastava said Pakistan was “non-serious in its approach and was not interested in implementing the judgment of the ICJ in letter and spirit”. He added, “The whole exercise of not providing any documents related to the case even after repeated requests, not providing unimpeded consular access and some reported unilateral action of approaching the Islamabad high court on the part of Pakistan again exposes the farcical nature of Pakistan’s approach,” he said.Jadhav, 50, was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. In April 2017, Pakistan announced he had been sentenced to death by a military court.The ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and stayed his execution while calling for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-has-blocked-review-of-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-case-says-india/story-LBTSYmt3I9QFaPbr0yr6cI.html

If one buys online the code will be given on the ticket, even on window tickets, and SMS will be generated and sent on the mobile phone which will have a link and it will show the QR code when the link is touched. Then the TTE at stations or on trains who either with their hand held equipment or on their mobile phones will be able to scan the code and immediately capture details of the passengers,” Railway Board chairman VK Yadav said at a press conference on Thursday.The option of QR codes will also be given to passengers buying tickets from the counter. Yadav also said nearly 85% of railway tickets were being booked online, at present.“It is not possible to shift completely to a paper-less ticketing across stations right now as there are still some passengers who do not use smartphones,” he added.Out of the 230 special passenger trains that are currently operating, 42 trains have an overall occupancy of 75-100% while around 40 are running at less than 30% occupancy and overall the trains are operating at an occupancy of 75%. Yadav said six trains in total have been cancelled following the request of state governments.Railways have already begun using QR code scanning at one division at Prayagraj on a pilot basis, officials said.“Airport-like check-in counters have also been made to minimize the exposure of our checking staff with the passengers,” an official said.“As a passenger enters the station premises, the QR code of his /her ticket will be scanned through a mobile app and this gets updated in the software’s database. The time of scanning the QR code also gets updated in the application…there will also be integrated checking kiosks with facilities for scanning the QR code of passenger tickets and thermal screening to get body temperature,” the official said.At Prayagraj division, onboard checking staff is also provided display modules with information on coaches and berths and total number of tickets issued.Railways is also planning to use a dashboard to know expected passengers for boarding at any time with the aim of deploying suitable number of checking staff and enable crowd management measures. “This will help in proper crowd management at the station. This information will update in real time mode,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-to-begin-contactless-ticketing-via-qr-codes-airport-like-check-in-at-stations-soon/story-pG8LVWLol8fQYrkahx1PdM.html

It was the second time when it reported more than 1,000 cases on a single day. While the state took 114 days to record its first 10,000 cases, it took just 15 days to register the next 10,000 cases. The spike of last 2 days has pushed the daily growth rate to 6 though it had remained under 5 for last 12 days. The surge in cases and comparative lower recovery meant the recovery rate has now come down to 65 per cent from more than 70% a week ago.Of the 1,264 cases, 540 were reported from Ganjam district alone where over 99 per cent of the cases were reported from local community while in Khurda district a record 137 cases were reported fuwlled by large number of infections in a flour mill. In Bhubaneswar city under Khurda district, 61 workers in a flour mill have tested positive in last 2 days.Making light of the surging cases, additional chief secretary of health department, PK Mohapatra said the numbers are rising as the government was aggressive in testing. “No State has been able to reverse the trend of the rising number of cases. We are chasing the virus from house to house. That is why cases are increasing in Odisha. The Covid recovery rate in she State is 65% and case fatality rate is 0.54%. We have 37.20 per cent of beds in Covid treatment facilities across Odisha are occupied. The district collectors have been asked to make an assessment of their medical infrastructure requirement for next 5 months,” said Mohapatra, urging for home isolation of asymptomatic patients both in rural and urban areas as over 70% cases reported in Odisha are asymptomatic.The health secretary said Odisha government has a stock of 4 lakh antigen kits and enough stock of PPEs, sanitizers and medicine for at least four months. “We are conducting RT-PCR tests in 19 labs and would add 6 more labs. The focus is on both RT-PCR and antigen tests,” he said.In Bhubaneswar, the civic body said there was little risk of community transmission of the virus as the first round of sero-surveillance showed community level exposure to SARS Cov2 very low. Of the 951 samples drawn by ICMR in Bhubaneswar as part of its sero survey, only 1.42 per cent had exposure to the virus. “This implies that large scale transmission has probably not occured in the city. Hence it ethical not to pass on or disseminate panic messages. But a large majority of the population is still susceptible to the infection,” said a BMC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-reports-1-000-covid-19-cases-for-second-consecutive-day/story-lKmsxkFo5bLZ00K9TAtOzI.html
23-07-2020||India||5 months after SC verdict, Defence Ministry issues order granting Permanent Commission to women||Five months after the Supreme Court ruled that Short Service Commissioned (SSC) women officers in the Indian Army are entitled to permanent commission (PC), the Defence Ministry on Thursday issued a formal sanction letter for granting PC to them, opening doors for women in a male-dominated force.The order will pave the way for “empowering women officers to shoulder larger roles in the organisation,” an army spokesperson said. A selection board will assemble soon to pick women for PC.The order specifies grant of PC to SSC women officers in 10 streams --- Army Air Defence (AAD), Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME), Army Service Corps (ASC), Army Ordnance Corps (AOC), and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General (JAG) and Army Educational Corps (AEC).“In anticipation, the Army Headquarters had set in motion a series of preparatory actions for conduct of the Permanent Commission Selection Board for affected women officers,” the army said in statement. The board will be scheduled as soon as the SSC women officers exercise their option and complete the requisite documentation.“It is wonderful to finally see this. I am elated,” said senior counsel Aishwarya Bhati, who had appeared for petitioners in Supreme Court.The army is committed to provide equal opportunities to all personnel including women officers to serve the country, the statement added.“As they say ‘a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.’ The government needs to be lauded for this leap. The equity has been achieved, however, equality still remains a goal to strive for,” said Wing Commander Anupama Joshi (retd), from the first batch of women officers commissioned into the IAF in the early 1990s. She said the army should allow women in combat roles too.The SC on February 17 ruled that SSC women officers in the army are entitled to PC and they have to be considered irrespective of their service length.The policy of the Centre in this regard to restrict PC to SSC women officers with less than 14 years of service was held to be violative of the Right to Equality by the apex court. It also held that there cannot be an absolute bar on women being considered for command appointments.The judgement was delivered on a petition by the defence ministry challenging a 2010 judgment of the Delhi high court which had ruled that SSC women officers in the army and air force should be granted PC at par with male SSC officers.The central government had issued a notification in this regard in February 2019 granting PC to SSC officers of the army. However, as per its proposal, only SSC women officers with up to 14 years of service were to be considered for PC.The Centre got a one-month extension on July 7 to implement the SC’s path-breaking decision to grant PC to women officers. Citing the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, the Centre moved an application before the apex court to extend the deadline by another six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-months-after-sc-verdict-defence-ministry-issues-order-granting-permanent-commission-to-women/story-XNsjTEuZcLePvVPISf0BMP.html

They claimed that he was brutally assaulted by a mob because he was caught stealing and had also registered a case against eight purported members of the mob.On Thursday, a government lawyer supported the ACP’s stand.She informed the two-member HC bench, comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Anuja Prabhudessai, that in terms of earlier court order she had personally viewed the closed-circuit TV (CCTV) footage that captured the incident of the assault on the deceased, but did not find any mob assaulting him.“Only the four policemen are seen to have used fiber lathis in a bid to discipline the deceased,” she said.She, however, added that further investigation was required to ascertain, if the deceased, indeed, succumbed to the injuries caused because of the use of the fiberglass lathis by the erring policemen.She was responding to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by lawyer and human rights activist Firdause Irani, raising concerns about police excesses during enforcement of the nationwide lockdown restrictions.Besides pointing out the assault on him, his wife and two sons by a team of policemen and civic body personnel outside his house in Goregaon (West), Irani has also highlighted a report of a human rights organisation that had revealed that a total of 15 people, including two from Mumbai, had lost their lives across the country due to police brutalities during the lockdown.Devendra was one of the Mumbai victims.According to the report, Devendra’s family members have alleged that on March 30, when they were going to meet a relative, a police team chased them and caught the deceased. The police personnel, the report added, informed the relatives that they were taking Devendra to Juhu police station, but in the morning they were informed by the police that he was lying at Nehru Nagar Chowk. He was declared brought dead on arrival, when his relatives took him to a hospital. The investigation into the case was entrusted with the ACP, Bandra division, in view of the allegations against the police personnel.On Thursday, HC, however, noted that two important witnesses in the case, Devendra’s mother and the brother did not co-operate with the investigation and though necessary, their statements were not recorded to date.Taking note of this anomaly, the bench has directed the ACP to issue fresh notices to them and make an endeavour to get their statements recorded by August 5.The second case pertained to the death of a porter, Sagir Jamal Khan, who was allegedly caught by police on April 18, when he was driving a handcart to deliver a refrigerator in Null Bazaar locality.The on-duty police personnel hit him on his head, hand and back.Later in the day, Khan suddenly collapsed while having dinner, and was declared brought dead on arrival, when he was taken to a hospital.According to the police, his post-mortem examination report has revealed that he died due to the enlargement of the heart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-policemen-assaulted-22-yr-old-whose-death-was-portrayed-as-a-mob-lynching-case-acp-informs-hc/story-3JdGfQQCifNaZDKD5eKC0O.html

Local transmission accounted for 70 per cent of news cases, the CM said adding it was a worrying factor.With 1,078 new virus cases total climbed to 16,110. Five deaths were also reported taking the death toll to 52. Out of 16,110 cases live cases are 9,458 and recovered 6,596. On Wednesday the state had reported 1,038 cases. The state capital Thiruvananthapuram is worst hit with more than 2,000 active cases. Many areas in coastal belt are under triple lockdown.The government has also decided to postpone one-day special session of the assembly called on July 27 in view of the serious pandemic situation prevailing in the state capital, said Vijayan. “The coming week is really critical for the state. Surge in locally-transmitted cases is really worrying. We need to step up our vigil and our future depends upon the correct steps we take today,” he said adding serious breach in restrictions led to sudden increase in cases. In view of rising cases, he said Muslim religious leaders have agreed not to conduct mass prayers during Eid al-Adha falling on July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharp-increase-in-daily-covid-19-cases-worries-kerala/story-HphYMBLtRkccrP5Zp9jHPJ.html
23-07-2020||India||Work on capping Assam gas well fire resumes day after explosion||Work on plugging the natural gas well in Assam’s Baghjan where a fire has been raging since June 9, resumed on Thursday, a day after three foreign experts suffered burn injuries at the site following an explosion.The experts from a Singapore-based firm suffered minor burn injuries on Wednesday while removing the tubing head spool of the wellhead (as part of efforts to plug the blow out) following which work was suspended for the day.The natural gas well belonging to Oil India Limited (OIL) in Tinsukia district had a blow out (uncontrolled release of gas or oil) on May 27 while work over operation to locate a new reservoir was underway. It caught fire two weeks later killing two firefighters and damaging over a dozen houses and has been blazing since then.“Work at the site resumed on Thursday. Personnel from OIL and other agencies are at the site and final preparation for placing the capping stack is underway,” Jayant Bormudoi, senior manager (corporate communication) OIL, said.Works related to plugging the well like excavation of ramps and cellar, opening of wellhead flange and six high discharge water pumps needed to spray water to the wellhead while capping operation is underway, are ready at the site, OIL said in a statement.“The three experts from Alert, (the Singapore-based firm engaged by OIL to plug the blow out) who sustained minor burn injury on Wednesday while removing the tubing head spool, are doing perfectly all right,” the statement said.According to OIL officials, work on plugging the blow out and putting out the fire are at a final stage and are expected to be over within the next few days.“The next task is to reinstall the blow out preventer (BOP), a three-ton equipment, on the well head. Once the BOP is placed, it is described as capping of the well. That will be followed by killing of the blow out,” OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika said.He informed that capping doesn’t mean that the gas will stop coming out of the well and the fire will be extinguished immediately. A valve on the BOP will inject a fluid inside the well, which will neutralize the pressure of the well slowly and push the gas back from the well into the reservoir.“The operation between capping of the well and killing the blow out can take 2-3 days. The gas was being drawn from a depth of around 3.5 km so the fluid has to fill up that entire column,” Hazarika said.The entire operation is expected to be over by the end of this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/work-on-capping-assam-gas-well-fire-resumes-day-after-explosion/story-TFnyRPCJTmM3b0wJx4rG8I.html

Some of those MLAs held hostage will also come and vote for us. We have a full majority and will come to the house with those numbers. We will prove the mandate,” said the CM.At the third Congress legislature party meeting this week, the CM impressed upon the MLAs to “stand like a rock”. He further added that neither the Congress nor the BJP wanted the assembly to be dissolved and election to take place. “The entire country is watching the way you’re fighting. Your respect has increased manifold. It’s not something ordinary,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier, contrasting the situation of his MLAs with those in team Pilot, the CM alleged that the latter were held against their wishes and have been calling him. The MLAs belonging to the Gehlot camp have been seen singing, doing yoga sessions and even trying their hand at cooking at the luxury resort in Jaipur where they have been sequestered.On the other hand, Team Pilot has been camping in the BJP-ruled Haryana. The Congress has so far claimed that 109 legislators are supporting the Ashok Gehlot government and insisted that the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) too had not yet sought a floor test. The BJP with 72 legislators has been watching the developments from the sidelines. The majority mark in the assembly stands at 101.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-to-call-assembly-session-soon-claims-majority/story-BeEAZnGUgRzpO8kTN3ycFO.html

23-07-2020||India||Pay cuts, compulsory leave can trigger ‘extreme acts’, say Air India pilots||Pay cuts and compulsory leave without pay scheme could have potentially disastrous psychological impact and lead to “desperate and extreme acts,” Air India’s executive pilots committee said on Thursday in a letter written to civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri.At least 60 pilots deployed in government’s Vande Bharat Mission flights have tested positive, the letter said, adding that at least one pilot has lost a family member to Covid-19 and those of many others have also been infected and appealed to the minister to rescind the decision to revise wages. “Our Association is also extremely concerned about the potentially disastrous psychological impact that the massive forced pay cuts and Compulsory Leave Without Pay scheme, may create on some employees. We shudder to think of the kind of desperate and extreme acts that could be triggered off because of the prevailing situation,” the letter said. Hindustan Times has reviewed a copy. The letter also cautioned against a litigation from employees. “As executives, we shall always support all acts and decisions that are financially prudent and serve the company’s best interests. Therefore, we believe that a rising stack of litigations and financial liabilities (contingent and current), arising out of pending financial dues owed to employees could potentially destroy our organization’s future health, and more so, would be unfairly transferred to any prospective buyer of Air India, in case the impending strategic disinvestment,” the letter added. The letter comes a week after the Air India board approved a leave without pay (LWP) scheme for its permanent employees for a period of six months to two years, which is extendable to up to five years. The national carrier had defended its decision last week stating that it was in a very challenging financial situation and is taking recourse to several initiatives with a view to ensuring the continuance of its operations.The airline has also decided to cut the pay of its cockpit and cabin crew with effect from April 1, 2020.“Recent decisions of Air India Board regarding rationalization of staff cost were reviewed in a meeting at the civil aviation ministry this evening. The meeting reiterated that unlike other carriers which have laid off large number of their employees, no employee of Air India will be laid off. There has been no reduction in the Basic pay, DA and HRA of any category of employees. The rationalization of allowances had to be implemented on account of the difficult financial condition of the airline that were exacerbated by Covid-19,” the airline said in a statement issued on Thursday.“Flying crew will be paid as per the actual number of hours flown. As domestic and international operations expand to reach pre-Covid levels and the financial position of Air India improves, the rationalization of allowances will be reviewed,” it added.The recent decision of the management adopting the compulsory leave without pay (LWP) model as well as the “massive wage cut” of the employees/Pilots emoluments has led to “serious discontentment and heartburn amongst the entire workforce”, the pilots said in their letter. “The world has acknowledged and lauded the invaluable contribution and sterling efforts of our Pilots as Corona Warriors during the Covid-19 outbreak. It was the will to respond to national call of duty, that got the Executive & other Pilots to think out of the box, to facilitate operations in the most difficult and challenging times, to keep the aircraft flying, and to keep our airline and its employees relevant, in an era plagued with bankruptcy and layoffs,” the letter said. The Air India’s pilot association the Indian Commercial Pilot Association on Monday also wrote to the national carrier’s management stating that changes in the wage settlement would be illegal and such a situation has the “potential to flare to an unprecedented magnitude.”At a press conference last Thursday, Air India chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal had said the national carrier is working on four fronts to reduce costs by reducing the debt, cutting on lease rentals, trimming staffing costs and reducing operating costs.The cost-cutting drive dovetails with a government plan to sell its entire stake in Air India amid increasing debt and mounting losses. The Centre, in January, started the process by releasing an information document for investors and offering access to financial and other data of Air India and its subsidiaries.The government’s entire stake in Air India, its 100% stake in low-cost subsidiary Air India Express Ltd. and 50% stake in ground handling unit Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited. are on offer.An attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw any bids. The airline’s accumulated debt is estimated to be more than Rs 69,000 crore. It posted a loss of Rs 8,556 crore in financial year 2018-19, as against a net loss of Rs 5,348 crore in the previous financial year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shudder-to-think-desperate-acts-pay-cuts-can-trigger-say-air-india-pilots/story-VcJvfvcEYOoKv6lLkWhPpL.html
23-07-2020||India||Another Congress MLA resigns from Madhya Pradesh assembly||The beleaguered Congress in Madhya Pradesh (MP) suffered another jolt on Thursday, when the third party lawmaker resigned from the state assembly in the past 12 days amid the rumblings of dissent that has rocked Ashok Gehlot-government in neighbouring Rajasthan.Narayan Patel (63), a Congress member of MP legislative assembly, who represents Mandhata assembly constituency in Khandwa district, is the third party legislator in 12 days to resign.Earlier, Pradyumn Singh Lodhi (52) and Sumitra Devi Kasdekar (36) had resigned from the state assembly and later joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Lodhi was promptly rewarded by the BJP, as hours after joining the party he was appointed the chairman of MP state civil supplies corporation. All the three Congress MLAs, who have resigned, were debutant lawmakers, who had won MP assembly polls in December 2018. MP Assembly’s Pro-tem Speaker Rameshwar Sharma said, “Narayan Patel tendered his resignation from the state assembly on Wednesday. I had asked him to take a final decision after giving it a thought. He confirmed on Thursday that he is willing to resign without any pressure on him or inducement.” Sharma made the announcement in presence of the MLA as a video was released to the media, where Patel was seen standing near the Pro-tem Speaker. Patel was unavailable for his comments, despite repeated attempts.Narendra Saluja, state Congress president Kamal Nath’s media coordinator, said, “The BJP has never been known to be a party with a difference. But, it is now overtly playing the dirty game of horse-trading in a bid to save its government as its leaders know the outcome of the assembly by-poll results. In a democracy, the ultimate judge is the public, who will certainly give a befitting reply to the BJP in the upcoming by-polls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-another-congress-mla-resigns-from-state-assembly/story-JetvbnFGnnFJFO8xuUKT3M.html

Both timing and day chosen for bhumi pujan are wrong,” Swaroopanand Saraswati said earlier Thursday. The Trust has fixed August 5 for bhumi poojan of the ram temple in Ayodhya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of the temple at 12.15 pm at Ram Janmabhoomi. Ruling out any change in schedule of bhumi pujan, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das said: “The most auspicious time and day for bhumi pujan has been chosen. This will not be changed.” According to Trust members, the bhumi pujan will take place on ‘Abhijit Muhurta’ at 12.15 pm on August 5, which is the most auspicious time to lay the foundation stone of Ram Mandir. “Abhijit Muhurta is capable of removing all obstacles,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, successor designate of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das. The Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, the body of saints that spearheaded the Ram Mandir movement across the country in 1990s, has always been at loggerheads with the Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati camp. “Opposition of Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati is just a ‘posturing’ and nothing else. It has no meaning. The bhumi pujan will be carried out according to the schedule fixed by the Trust,” said Prof Kaushal Kishore Mishra, political science department, Banaras Hindu University (BHU). Swaroopanand Saraswati has also been opposing the trust constituted by the Centre for construction of Ram Mandir after the Supreme Court’s verdict in favour of Ram Mandir on November 9 last year. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has also ruled out any change in schedule of bhumi pujan of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-change-in-ram-temple-bhumi-pujan-schedule-says-trust-chairman/story-XpedJDjUoSVEo1tprdB5XP.html
23-07-2020||India||Amid political crisis, Congress divided over assembly floor test in Rajasthan||The Congress on Thursday said there are two opinions in the party on holding the floor test in Rajasthan with one section suggesting going for an immediate trust vote while the other group is urging legislators to wait for the proceedings in courts to get over before proving their strength in the assembly.Addressing a virtual press conference, senior Congress leader Ajay Maken also said the party was not “disappointed” with the Supreme Court’s decision on a plea filed by Rajasthan assembly speaker CP Joshi seeking a stay on the proceedings in the high court, saying they were not expecting a favourable verdict and had already prepared a political plan to deal with the crisis.”When we go to the court these days, we don’t expect favourable decisions and we prepare ourselves for a decision which is not in our favour. It is not only a legal battle but mainly a political battle. Legal battle is just a part of the entire political battle. Knowing and understanding fully well that the courts may not give a decision in our favour we have prepared our political plan,” he said.ALSO READ | A mini win for Sachin Pilot in Supreme Court, over to HC at 10.30 am tomorrowThe Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Rajasthan high court to pass orders on Friday on a plea by rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident legislators challenging the speaker’s disqualification notice. It set aside the speaker’s request for a stay on the proceedings.The plea had challenged the high court order of July 21 which had asked the speaker to defer action on his notice to Pilot and other rebel legislators till July 24, arguing that the court’s intervention was premature as he is yet to decide on the issue of disqualification and has only issued notices.“No doubt, floor test is the only solution and we can go for it at any opportune time. We are confident of our numbers and will prove majority on the floor of the House. There are two views in our party. One section feels that we should wait for the proceedings in courts to be over and the other suggests that we should immediately go for the floor test,” Maken said.“But as far as the floor test is concerned we are very confident and will easily cross the majority mark with at least a margin of 15-20 legislators in the final count,” he added.ALSO READ | ‘If I meet him, he cannot say he didn’t know about crisis’: Gehlot on letter to PM ModiMaken and Randeep Singh Surjewala were deputed by the Congress leadership as the party’s two special observers to deal with the political crisis in Rajasthan.The Congress has so far claimed that 109 legislators in the 200-member assembly are supporting the Ashok Gehlot government and insisted that the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) too had not yet sought a floor test.Asked if the party has re-established contact with Pilot and other rebel legislators, Maken said, “We have been repeatedly requesting them to talk to us and tell us about their grievances. We have never said they are not part of the Congress.”The Congress leader said it was the rebel legislators who went to the court first.“I am here for the past 12 days and I am not a part of any group. My sympathies are with the young leadership as I consider myself a part of it. Similarly, Surjewala and KC Venugopal are also part of the same group. We have told them to come and talk to us and attend party meetings,” he added.Maken said it was unheard of till now that the ruling party’s legislators were seeking the floor test from their own chief minister. “If a Congress legislator asks for a floor test from its own government, can we call him a member of the Congress party? Have you ever heard that a sitting state Congress president has turned a dissident?” he asked.“Who demands the floor test? Why are Harish Salve and Mukul Rohtagi appearing for the rebel legislators? Will they ever appear for the Congress? Why is the BJP government in Haryana not letting the Rajasthan Police take voice samples of the rebel legislators lodged in a hotel in Manesar? Who is Gajendra Shekawat? Why are Amit Shah’s police protecting them? Why is ED (Enforcement Directorate) raiding relatives of the chief minister? Isn’t this the BJP’s open support to rebel legislators?”Asked why young leaders are leaving the Congress, Maken shot back: “Has he (Pilot) left the party? I don’t think he has left the party yet. We are in the Congress not for any post or importance but for its ideology. If you take the help of a diametrically opposite party like the BJP to damage the Congress, I don’t think you are a well wisher of the Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-political-crisis-congress-divided-over-assembly-floor-test-in-rajasthan/story-Bm6fKumWkawuNCoeel0FtO.html
23-07-2020||India||Pak approach in Kulbhushan Jadhav case farcical: India||India on Thursday accused Pakistan of blocking all legal remedies to Indian death row convict Kulbhushan Jadhav.MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava also said Pakistan adopted a “farcical approach” in handling the case, adding India is exploring available options in the matter.“In the absence of an unimpeded and unhindered consular access as well as of the relevant documents, as a last resort, India tried to file a petition on July 18,” he said during an online media briefing. “However, our Pakistani lawyer informed that a review petition could not be filed in the absence of power of attorney and supporting documents related to the case of Jadhav,” he added.Pakistan had earlier this month said July 20 is the last date of filing a review petition by Jadhav against the death sentence handed down to him by a Pakistani military court.The 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer was sentenced to death by the Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. India approached the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-approach-in-kulbhushan-jadhav-case-farcical-india/story-TLPurVCpcPeMeCuEHGJePK.html
23-07-2020||India||One Pakistani, 2 Indian-origin persons in US ‘blacklisted’ for anti-India activities||A Pakistani and two Indian-origin persons based in the US have been “blacklisted” by the government for their alleged anti-India activities. The move came after Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shewale wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah apprising them about the alleged anti-India activities of Rehan Siddiqui, a US-based Pakistani, and Rakesh Kaushal and Darshan Mehta. The trio will not be able to travel to India following the blacklisting. In a letter to Shewale, Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy said the issue was examined by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) following his complaint. “The MEA has apprised that Rehan Siddiqui, Rakesh Kaushal and Darshan Mehta have been blacklisted on the recommendations of the Consulate General of India, Houston,” Reddy wrote to Shewale. Siddiqui runs a radio station in Houston and organises cultural events with artistes from Bollywood. Kaushal and Mehta allegedly assist Siddiqui in organising such events. Reddy also conveyed to the MP that the Indian Embassy in Washington DC and the Consulate General in Houston have been requested to engage with prominent influencers, cultural bodies and bona-fide “Bollywood-affiliated” local entities to ensure that appropriate message is conveyed to Indian actors and artistes so that they disassociate themselves from such anti-national elements. Shewale, the MP from Mumbai South Central, said the government has advised the Bollywood celebrities not to participate in events organised by the trio. In his complaint to Home Minister Shah in February 2020, Shewale had said Siddiqui is the owner of a radio station in Houston and promoter of cultural events and has been allegedly involved in anti-India activities and anti-India propaganda. The MP claimed that Siddiqui’s radio station was funded by US-based Pakistanis and the Pakistan government. Shewale said that after the February 2019 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama, Siddiqui “launched a vicious anti-India campaign and tried to malign the dignity and honour” of the Prime Minister.

The treatment helps many patients who are in serious condition,” said Dr. Bhaisora.Fifty people have agreed to donate plasma for the bank at the hospital, officials said. There are more than 50 Covid-19 patients in the hospital undergoing treatment.Dr. Bhaisora said that health officials are trying to motivate patients who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate plasma for treating other patients. An incentive of Rs. 500 will also be given to patients from hilly areas to motivate them to donate plasma, officials said.Only those former Covid-19 patients who are between the age of 18 and 60 years can donate plasma up to 400 ml.“Patients who have recovered from Covid-19 can donate plasma 28 days after recovery but before 60 days. However, people suffering from cold, cough or any asymptomatic disease cannot give plasma,” he added.Officials from Government Doon Medical College Hospital in Dehraun said that talks are underway to start plasma therapy at the hospital soon.Dr. NS Khatri, deputy medical superintendent of the hospital said, “We are in the process of procuring the machines needed for plasma therapy. We will soon start treating Covid-19 patients through plasma therapy wherever needed.”Delhi was the first state to being plasma therapy and set up plasma banks to treat Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-plasma-therapy-for-covid-19-patients-in-uttarakhand-begins-in-haldwani/story-5oLW4XU3FJrncFGIHZ0IcO.html

23-07-2020||India||India to boost Rafale capabilities with HAMMER missiles under emergency order: Report||With the Rafales arriving in the country in the middle of a dispute with China, the Indian Air Force is further boosting the capabilities of the combat aircraft by equipping it with the HAMMER missiles from France.The order for the HAMMER standoff missiles with the capability to take out any type of targets at the range of around 60-70 kms is being processed under the emergency powers for acquisition given to the armed forces by the Narendra Modi government.“The order for the HAMMER missiles is being processed and the French authorities have agreed to supply them to us at a short notice for our Rafale combat aircraft,” government sources told ANI.In view of the urgent requirement for these missiles by the Air Force, the French authorities would be delivering the systems to India from the existing stock meant for some other customer, they said.HAMMER (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) is a medium-range air-to-ground weapon designed and manufactured for the French Air Force and Navy initially.The HAMMERs would give India the capability to take out any bunkers or hardened shelters in any type of terrain including the mountainous locations such as Eastern Ladakh, the sources said.When asked to comment, an IAF spokesperson refused to confirm or deny the developments related to the new acquisition.Five Rafale would be arriving in India from France on July 29 and their advanced weaponry including the long-range SCALP and Meteor missiles would have reached India before their touchdown.The first five Rafale fighter aircraft would start arriving in India by July 29 flown by pilots of the 17 Golden Arrows commanding officer.The delivery of the aircraft was earlier supposed to have been done by May end but this was postponed by two months in view of the Covid-19 situation in both India and France.The trainers will have the tail numbers of the RB series in honour of the Air Force Chief RKS Bhadauria who played a pivotal role in finalising India’s largest-ever defence deal for 36 Rafale combat aircraft.The aircraft on their way from France to India would be refuelled by a French Air Force tanker aircraft in the air around Israel or Greece before they make a stopover in the Middle East.India had signed a deal worth over Rs 60,000 crore with France in September 2016 for 36 Rafales to meet the emergency requirements of the Indian Air Force.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria was the Deputy Chief of Air Staff at that time and headed the Indian negotiation team for the deal which is the biggest ever in monetary terms in India. Armed with the long-range Meteor air to air missiles and SCALP, the Rafales would give India an edge over both Pakistan and China in terms of air strike capability.Sources said the air to air and the air to ground strike capabilities of the Rafale cannot be matched by both China and Pakistan and the aircraft would give India an edge over both the rivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-boost-rafale-capabilities-with-hammer-missiles-under-emergency-order-report/story-Xf0SGVcipUgXvL2qRU3FZM.html

The deceased have been identified as Bajrang Vetti and Tido Mandavi, who were a commander and a member of the CPI-Maoist, respectively, and belonged to Potali village,” the SP said.A meeting of Maoists was held in Potali village, where the villagers were hauled up for not digging up the road linking to the hamlet, the SP said.Later, the rebels instructed Vetti and Mandavi to carry out the assigned task, which they refused, citing that it would cause inconvenience to the villagers. The defiance infuriated the Maoists, who killed their two colleagues with sharp weapons and also thrashed three other villagers, the SP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-two-maoists-killed-in-dantewada-by-their-own-party-cadre/story-JKdCWvBqoOEKvLu6ZJu7xJ.html
23-07-2020||India||Verdict in Sachin Pilot, MLAs’ disqualification notice at 10:30 am tomorrow||The action in Rajasthan drama moves back to the desert state with the state high court set to pronounce its verdict on Friday at 10:30 am on the writ petition moved by rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 dissident MLAs challenging the speaker’s disqualification notice to them. Earlier today, the Supreme Court allowed the high court to rule on the petition filed by team Pilot against the speaker’s disqualification notice, adding that it would be subject to the outcome of the petition before the top court.The Pilot camp has argued that they cannot be disqualified for merely disagreeing with the decisions of some leaders outside the assembly. They also say issuance of disqualification notice by the speaker is a violation of their freedom of speech right. Their lawyers further argued that the lawmakers were given only three days’ time to reply during Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier, defying party whip, Team Pilot skipped the two Congress legislature party meetings but underscored that they have not given up their membership of the house. The writ petition challenges the speaker’s notice to rebel MLAs as well as the disqualification on the grounds of defection. If the rebel MLAs are disqualified, the majority mark in the 200-member assembly will automatically come down, making it easier for chief minister Ashok Gehlot to win a floor test. The number of lawmakers present at the two Congress legislature party meetings indicated that the Gehlot government would be able to stay in power even if with a wafer-thin majority. At the third meeting held this week, Gehlot urged the legislators to stand firm like a rock as the country is watching them.The Rajasthan CM hasn’t put a number of lawmakers on his side yet. “You’ll get to know the exact number when we win the floor test by a thumping majority. This time, every MLA will hear the voice of his conscience and vote,” Gehlot told HT on Monday.Sachin Pilot was stripped of his posts in the government and the party after, according to the Congress, he turned down peace overtures from the party leadership that asked him to make it clear that he was a ‘loyal soldier’ of the Congress and not working with the BJP.Encouraged by the support of the party, Gehlot has been launching sharp attacks on Sachin Pilot in an effort to dent his image as the Congress leader who led the party to victory in the 2018 state elections. Pilot was tasked to rebuild the Rajasthan Congress chief in 2014.Gehlot, who has accused Pilot of conspiring with the BJP to bring down his government, said his former deputy had used his command over the language and “his innocent face” to convince the media that he had worked hard to get the party in power. This wasn’t a fact, the chief minister said. “We knew he is nikamma (worthless) and nakara [good for nothing],” Gehlot told reporters on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/verdict-in-sachin-pilot-mlas-disqualification-notice-at-10-30-am-tomorrow/story-L2pIlVG6RlUBPc5yCdnFeI.html
23-07-2020||India||Chinese actions are a challenge for the world community: British envoy||China’s actions around the globe, including imposing a national security law in Hong Kong and the border standoff with India, are a challenge for the world community and Britain will work with partners to call out violations of international law, UK high commissioner Philip Barton said on Thursday.Following its exit from the European Union (EU), the UK will focus on healthcare, a long-term agenda for green growth and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and trade and investment while strengthening its ties with India, Barton said during his first news briefing after presenting his credentials.“There are challenges around the world on all sorts of Chinese actions, for us Hong Kong particularly is a focus, clearly for India the LAC (Line of Actual Control) is a particular focus,” he said.“These are concerning things and our hope would be that there can be de-escalation, and tensions do seem to have eased over the last week or two after the tragic loss of lives,” he said, referring to the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a clash with Chinese forces along the LAC on June 15.Barton welcomed progress by India and China in managing tensions and the commitment by the two Special Representatives on the border issue to disengage and de-escalate. “I hope we’re not about to see a change in that,” he said.Britain, he said, has its own concerns about a range of Chinese actions and has decided to remove Chinese technology giant Huawei’s equipment from all its telecommunications networks by 2027 because of concerns highlighted by the UK National Cyber Security Centre.“We don’t have a border with China but we have particular responsibilities for Hong Kong and the new national security law which China has imposed there, we see this as a very clear and serious violation of the UK-China joint declaration,” he said, referring to the agreement that laid out the administrative arrangement for Hong Kong when the former British colony was handed over to China in 1997.“We are very clear sighted about the challenges China presents in the region and around the world. We in the UK want to work with China and hope for positive, constructive engagement and strive for that...We welcome all partners who join us in calling out what is a serious violation of the UK-China joint declaration...,” Barton said.The UK also has “grave concerns” about human rights abuses, particularly against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, he added. Pointing specifically to Huawei’s role in 5G, he said the UK and India can work together to resolve such “wider global issues” and to diversify markets.Asked about the activities in UK of Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan group banned by India, Barton declined to go into details but said Britain would act if any of its laws were violated.“In the UK, you have the right to protest and the right to freedom of speech is there but there are limits to it. Where people clearly break the law, we will take action. We have a dialogue with the Indian government across a range of issues of mutual interest and extremism of all kinds is one of those,” he said.Barton said there was no inconsistency between the Indian government projecting the country as an open destination for trade and investment while also working for self-reliance through the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiative. The two countries, he said, can work on making critical supply chains more resilient.“It’s perfectly possible for India to be an open trading economy and open to investments and international cooperation while also pursuing the [Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative] and wanting to manufacture in India and wanting to build manufacturing and other capacities and capability...I don’t see any inconsistency,” he said.Barton, a career diplomat with long experience of South Asia and India, advised the need for caution while responding to questions about the two countries cooperating on Covid-19 vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca backed vaccine that has shown encouraging results.He said it wasn’t known for certain if any of the vaccines would work, and the world community needs to keep backing a suite of potential vaccines till research reaches a stage where experts can be confident. Distribution of any successful vaccine would also be based on the ability of countries to pay for it and those needing subsidies, he added.India’s “fantastic vaccine capability” and the tie-up between the Serum Institute of India and AstraZeneca represent a “clear partnership with India” in this field, Barton said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-has-created-challenges-across-the-world-uk-watching-lac-situation-british-envoy/story-9Ku3nsivgicqoThebeUthL.html

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) also directed commercial establishments like malls and offices to follow the same procedure with discarded protective personal equipment (PPE) from general public. “Discarded PPEs from general public at commercial establishments, shopping malls, institutions, offices, etc. should be stored in separate bin for 3 days, thereafter, disposed of as dry general solid waste after cutting/shredding. “Waste masks and gloves in general households should be kept in paper bag for a minimum of 72 hours prior to disposal of the same as dry general solid waste after cutting the same to prevent reuse,” the CPCB said. This is the fourth time the CPCB has issued guidelines on management of bio-medical waste generated from coronavirus. It, however, said that leftover food and empty water bottles handled by infected patients should not be collected along with bio-medical waste but with other general solid waste. “Leftover food, empty juice bottles or tetra packs, empty water bottles, packaging material, and any other items, generated or handled by Covid-19 patient should be collected along with other general solid waste in bags securely tied for handing over to waste collectors. “Yellow coloured bag should not be used for general solid waste,” it said. Yellow bags are dedicated for bio-medical waste from Covid-19, as per the guidelines issued time and again. The CPCB also recommended use of bio-degradable or non-disposable cutlery to minimize waste generation. “In order to minimize waste generation, as far as possible, non-disposable items must be used for serving food, which are to be handle with appropriate precautions and cleaned and disinfected as per hospital guidelines. “If use of disposable items is inevitable, use bio-degradable cutlery. The wet and dry solid waste bags to be tied securely in leak-proof bags, sprayed with sodium hypo-chlorite solution and hand over to authorized waste collector. Yellow coloured bags should not be used for collecting general solid waste. Compostable bags should be used for collecting wet-waste,” it said. It has also directed that isolation wards, including temporary healthcare facilities like rail coaches, must keep separate colour coded bins to maintain segregation of waste and use a dedicated bin to collect and store Covid-19 waste and keep it separately, use double layered bags for collection of Covid-19 waste and disinfect all bins/containers every day. From Covid-19 isolation wards, used PPEs such as goggles, face-shield, splash proof apron, plastic coveralls, hazmat suits, nitrile gloves must be collected into a red bag, it said. “Collect used masks (including triple layer mask, N95 mask etc.), head cover/cap, shoe-cover, disposable linen gown, non-plastic or semi-plastic coverall in yellow bags. Used masks, tissues and toiletries, of Covid-19 patient shall become biomedical waste and shall be segregated in yellow bag,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/general-households-to-cut-and-store-waste-masks-gloves-for-72-hours-before-disposing-of-cpcb/story-JUacNhYr3QfKYBEDGSbHRJ.html
23-07-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot asks for testing ‘horse trading’ audio clips in US, escalates attack on BJP minister||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has thrown a challenge to get the audio clips, purportedly carrying evidence of Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat’s involvement in alleged attempts to dislodge Rajasthan government, tested in a forensic lab in the United States to prove its veracity.Gehlot also said that those, whose voices are alleged to be on the audio clips, should get their voice tested to clear their names in the MLA horse-trading case being investigated by the state police.“If they think they don’t trust the Rajasthan government, then they can send the audio-tapes to the FSL agency in the US for a voice test. They should step forward and undergo a voice test,” Gehlot was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.In an indirect reference to Shekhawat, Gehlot added that Union ministers, MLAs or MPs give speeches and therefore their voice is easily recognizable.Shekhawat, a senior BJP leader from Rajasthan, has denied his involvement in the case and rejected claims that one of the voices on the three audio clips being probed by the police is his.Gehlot dismissed Shekhawat’s defence and said that the truth will win in the end.“Still, the first reaction always is ‘it wasn’t my voice’. They are also threatening people. Nothing is going to work. Satyamev Jayate,” the news agency quoted him as saying.Gehlot has upped the ante against Shekhawat and demanded that he subjects himself to the investigation in the case of alleged horse trading of MLAs aimed to overthrow his government. He and his party has accused BJP leaders of hatching the alleged plot in connivance with Congress rebels led by Sachin Pilot, the former deputy chief minister and head of the party’s state unit.Gehlot even wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Sunday naming Shekhawat as one of the BJP leaders allegedly involved in the act. He also referred to Sachin Pilot and MLAs supporting him as “over ambitious leaders” in his own party, who were purportedly hand in glove with the BJP to bring down his government.Sachin Pilot has denied involvement with the BJP and rejected conjectures that he may join the party soon.The BJP leaders in Rajasthan have, however, rejected Gehlot’s accusations and said his government was in trouble due to internal differences with his own party and alleged failure in governance.Also Read: A mini win for Sachin Pilot in Supreme Court, over to HC at 10.30 am tomorrowGehlot’s government is also locked in a legal battle with Sachin Pilot and his followers over a disqualification notice served to 19 party rebels by the assembly speaker.

Congress has also petitioned the Supreme Court in the same case asking it to prevent any interference in the proceedings before the speaker takes a decision on the matter. The SC, however, refused to stop the high court from announcing its verdict in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-asks-for-testing-horse-trading-audio-clips-in-us-escalates-attack-on-bjp-minister/story-DmrG8OKLuxYHZDzGeO8MoN.html
23-07-2020||India||‘If I meet him, he cannot say he didn’t know about crisis’: Gehlot on letter to PM Modi||After writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the ongoing political turmoil in the state, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said since India is a democracy, the Prime Minister needs to be aware of the complete scenario and he should not be misinformed about the political crisis.“I wrote to the PM as this is a democracy. I wrote the letter so that he doesn’t say that he didn’t have information or his people gave him incomplete information. I wrote it so that if I meet him, he doesn’t say that he didn’t know about the crisis,” Gehlot said referring to his letter to PM Modi, reportedly written on Sunday, over the political situation in Rajasthan.In the letter, the veteran Congress leader had alleged that there had been large-scale attempts to destabilize the elected Congress government in the state and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of trying to poach Congress legislators. Gehlot had also named Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in his communication to the Prime Minister. ALSO READ | A mini win for Sachin Pilot in Supreme Court, over to HC at 10.30 am tomorrowThe Rajasthan Chief Minister wrote, “There have been despicable attempts to destabilize elected governments through horse-trading. I don’t know to what extent you are aware of all this or whether you are being misled.”Locked in a bitter power struggle with his former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot that has almost led to the collapse of the government in the desert state, Gehlot wrote to PM Modi alleging that the ruling party at the Centre had made attempts to offer money to Congress MLAs to defect.“For some time, attempts are being made to destabilize democratically elected governments. This is an insult to the mandate and open violation of constitutional values. Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh are examples of this,” Gehlot wrote in his letter to the PM.ALSO READ | Sachin Pilot demands ‘Re 1 and apology’ from MLA who alleged bribe offer to join BJPThe ongoing power tussle between Gehlot and his erstwhile deputy Sachin Pilot has now entered its second week. On Thursday, the Supreme Court allowed the Rajasthan high court to pass orders tomorrow on a plea by rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs challenging their disqualification and setting aside speaker CP Joshi’s request for a stay on the proceedings.The Chief Minister has accused Sachin Pilot of seeking the BJP’s help to topple the Congress government in Rajasthan just like the modus operandi adopted in Madhya Pradesh, where former Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia’s defection to the BJP led to the collapse of the Kamal Nath government in March, this year.Sachin Pilot, who has gone to court over his disqualification, has served a legal notice to Congress MLA Giriraj Singh who alleged that he had been offered Rs 35 crore to cross vote in the recent Rajya Sabha elections, news agency ANI had reported.Pilot on Wednesday asked for a sum of Re 1 and a written apology before the media for the “false and frivolous allegations” within seven days. On Monday, Giriraj Singh Malinga said at the talks held at Pilot’s house he was offered money to switch to the BJP. The MLA said he subsequently informed chief minister Ashok Gehlot about the plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-i-meet-him-he-cannot-say-he-didn-t-know-about-crisis-gehlot-on-letter-to-pm-modi/story-Rma9OBEIfifydJUdwcGucP.html

Most of these seats fell vacant due to the death of sitting members.A senior EC official said the Covid-19 pandemic and the flood situation were two reasons behind the decision.As per the electoral law, EC has to hold bye-elections within 180 days (six months) of a seat falling vacant, another official pointed out. The six-month deadline to hold by-elections in these eight seats was ending on different dates in July, August and September respectively.When the EC assessed the situation, it found that it is difficult to adhere to the six-month deadline in these seats, and approached the Union law ministry to defer the polls, the official said.Under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, in certain cases, the EC, in consultation with the Central government (the Union law ministry), certifies that it is difficult to hold the by-election within the six-month period.Using this provision, the poll panel issued a certificate on July 22 to defer the elections in these eight seats.In a statement, the Commission said on Thursday that “this matter of timing etc of by-elections is also slotted for discussion in the Election Commission meeting to be held tomorrow” (Friday).The statement said the total number of by-elections due is 56 assembly constituencies and one Lok Sabha seat (including the eight deferred). However, a letter written by one of its senior officers to the law ministry regarding the eight bypolls is “causing some confusion”, the EC said and clarified that it was only “in respect of eight constituencies regarding which a reference to Ministry of Law and Justice was made ... due to some extraordinary circumstances peculiar to these constituencies.” Out of these total number of 57 by-elections, the Commission has already taken a decision to hold all by-election as per provisions and the deferring of these eight by-elections was only up to September 7, 2020, the statement said.The remaining 49 bypolls are due after September 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-defers-bypolls-for-one-ls-7-assembly-seats-due-to-extraordinary-circumstances/story-Ji3Nw1O4S0yj875RyheeeK.html

The Union Home Ministry has expressed serious reservations over the issue saying such a controversy should have been avoided when the investigation was continuing on the right track, a senior official familiar with the development said.The sudden transfer order of six superintendents and two inspectors attached with the Kochi unit of the Customs who are part of the ongoing investigation was issued by Mohammad Yousaf, Commissioner of Customs, late on Wednesday. After the issue triggered a controversy, the Customs department made it clear that it was a routine transfer and it was deferred for the time being.ALSO READ | Kerala gold smuggling case: NIA custody of accused extended“There are enough pressures as the investigation is progressing. The transfer drama can be part of it. It seems many who are part of the syndicate are rattled,” said a senior official, who did not want to be identified. He said the multi-agency probe is moving in the right direction. The gold smuggling case came to light on July 5, when P S Sarith, a former employee of the UAE consulate in the state capital, was arrested when he came to receive a consignment in the name of an official of the consulate. Later, 30 kg gold was retrieved from the consignment. Five days later, Swapna Suresh, a senior IT official and her friend Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru.The Enforcement Directorate has formally arrested three key accused, Sarith, Suresh and K T Ramees, another accomplice. The ED had registered a case against them under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the NIA court had earlier allowed it to question the accused. Opposition Congress and BJP said since the transfers were deferred they will not comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-after-outrage-transfer-of-customs-officials-deferred-for-now/story-DDErVGA91V77wF8MtzGDVM.html

The Congress leader said his tweets were being blocked by the social media giant without specifying what was “potentially sensitive” in his tweets. He has demanded a response from the country head of the company.“Twitter has been blocking my tweets saying it “includes potentially sensitive content” such as these without telling me what is “potentially sensitive content” in my tweets? I need to have the response of Twitter Country Head of India,” Digvijaya tweeted on Thursday.Digvijaya Singh added that classifying criticism of Central government leaders as “sensitive content” was an act of political bias.“If saying something against Narendra Modi or Amit Shah you find to be of “sensitive content” then you are being politically biased against me which you have no right to be. I have earlier complained to your Management of your biased attitude against me but without any response,” Digvijaya said in another of his tweets on the matter.In his defence, he said he was a “responsible” Indian citizen with an extensive record of public service.“I am a responsible Indian Citizen who has been elected to MP Assembly 5 times Lok Sabha twice and Rajya Sabha twice. I have been Minister in MP and CM MP for 10 years. Why should I post any objectionable tweet?” Digivjaya asked. Twitter was recently questioned by the Supreme Court of India over alleged defamatory tweets by senior lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan. Twitter’s counsel told the SC that the site can only disable a tweet on orders passed by the Court. According to the rule of contempt, for a publication including web/social media platform, the author and the publisher, both are called out in the matter.Social media have been under an increasing scrutiny for libellous content posted by users. The micro blogging site has a media policy that filters and bars graphic violence, adult content and hateful imagery among others.According to the company, first time violation of these policies leads to removal of the content and the user getting temporarily locked out of his account while a repeat violation leads to permanent suspension of the account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-responsible-digvijaya-singh-tells-twitter-after-some-posts-blocked/story-FHHevr5KnDhzazSHo5milK.html
23-07-2020||India||In highest single-day recovery, 29,557 patients recuperate from Covid-19 in 24 hours: Govt||As many as 29,557 Covid-19 patients have recuperated in the past 24 hours, the highest recorded in a day so far, taking the recovery rate to 63.18 per cent, the Union Health Ministry said on Wednesday. According to data updated at 8 am, total recoveries have surged to 7,82,606 and exceeded the active cases of Covid-19 by 3,56,439 as on date. The number of tests for detection of Covid-19 has also crossed the 15-million mark as the number of cases surged to 12,38,635 on Thursday. A total of 1,50,75,369 samples have been tested up to July 22 with 3,50,823 samples being tested on Wednesday, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) officials said. “One million tests were done in three days till Wednesday. The testing capacity has been increased to around 4 lakh per day,” scientist and media coordinator at ICMR Lokesh Sharma said. “While the total number of recovered cases has jumped to 7,82,606, there has been appreciable growth in the recovery rate, which stands at 63.18 per cent,” the ministry said. This accomplishment can be attributed to the central government-led Covid-19 management strategies, it said. Sustained efforts by the Centre, states and union territories (UTs) are resulting in more effective containment, aggressive testing, and prompt and efficient clinical treatment strategies. These are guided by the teams of domain experts in the Ministry of Health such as the Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) and ably complemented by the technical experts at AIIMS-New Delhi, centres of excellence in various states and UTs, ICMR and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The Union Government continues to coordinate with the efforts of the states and UTs by sending central teams of experts to areas witnessing increase in caseload and hand-holding of COVID hospitals in states through the tele-consultation programme led by AIIMS, New Delhi, the ministry said. “These combined efforts have resulted in Case Fatality Rate being managed at low levels. It is 2.41 per cent, as on date, and steadily declining,” it said. This has also helped in reducing the actual caseload of Covid-19 cases which remains confined to 4,26,167 active patients only. With the highest-ever single-day spike of 45,720 cases, India’s Covid-19 tally crossed the 12-lakh mark on Thursday, while the death toll mounted to 29,861 with a record 1,129 fatalities reported in 24 hours, according to the updated data at 8 am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-highest-single-day-recovery-29-557-patients-recuperate-from-covid-19-in-24-hours-govt/story-TV8IyfgtqTSmNXWIpj8G7M.html

Inhumane act at a time of pandemic distress. There should be a judicial enquiry by a sitting high court judge and there should be a discussion in the assembly,” Siddaramaiah, leader of opposition in the state assembly, tweeted.In another tweet, Siddaramaiahn said the Karnataka government was paying substantially more for ventilators than what others have. “Central govt has procured 50,000 ventilators under PM Cares at a cost of ₹4, lakh per unit. Tamil Nadu has procured at ₹4.78 lakh. But in our state, the price is between ₹5.6 lakh to ₹18.2 lakh.”He also took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a self-reliant India claiming that chief minister B S BS Yediyurappa’s government was importing Chinese medical equipment at exorbitant cost.“On one hand @PMOIndia advocates Aatma Nirbhar Bharat but here in Karnataka, his own Chief Minister @BSYBJP, has procured hundreds of crores worth Made in China medical equipment at exorbitant price. Is this not hypocrisy?” he said in another tweet.The Congress leader said the party will continue to cooperate with the government in saving people’s lives in the pandemic but insisted that “we will not cooperate with corruption and looting of money.”The government dismissed the charges saying no irregularities have taken place in the procurement of medical equipment to fight the pandemic .Health Minister B Sriramulu said, “I said it before and I am saying it now -- no irregularities have taken place,” according to PTI.On Tuesday, during an address to the people of Karnataka, chief minister Yediyurappa had said, “Not one rupee has been misused.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-judicial-probe-into-rs-2-000-cr-covid-management-scam-in-karnataka-siddaramaiah/story-FUScSXG9gfmgHMSEOuL7eI.html

23-07-2020||India||Always knew I would pursue films as career, says Ashish R Shukla||“It has been a long journey from being one of the assistants to the renowned Prahald Kakkar (ad film maker) to directing OTT series. But every day has been a learning experience for me. I had decided when I was in Arts School that film is what I will be pursuing as a career. I was intrigued by the entire process and wanted to be a part of it as soon as possible.” Those are the words of director Ashish R Shukla, who has been in the industry for almost 20 years and has tried his hand at advertising, writing, directing TV thrillers, serials and films.For Ashish, the turning point came when he saw the film ‘Salam Bombay’. “That film always inspired me. I remember I saw it on Doordarshan when I was just a child and I realised that this is what life is. I completed my major in photography and as it is said, life came a full circle. I got to know a gentleman staying in my building was associated with that film and was currently associated with ‘Dil Chahta Hai’. It was Sir Harish Amin. I met him and shared my love for films with him. It was through him that I got the opportunity to join Prahald (Kakkar) Sir’s team.“He (Prahald Kakkar) was my first teacher and after that I worked in ad films for different agencies. It was in 2007 that I made a short film, ‘The Lock,’ which Anurag (Kashyap) liked a lot and called me home. We both had a UP connection as my parents are from Pratapgarh and a number of relatives live in Lucknow too. He gave me a film to write that was based in Varanasi. At the same time, he was preparing for one of his films and he took me along and that’s how I joined the team as the creative head for ‘Dev D’,” said Ashish.It was then that he decided to go solo. “I started making documentaries and my most acclaimed one was a documentary ‘Inside Mumbai Terror Attack-26/11’ that also won an award and turned out to be a milestone for me. Around that time, a friend asked me to direct a feature film and I came on board. And that is how, finally, I got to direct my first feature film ‘Prague’.“The film was critically acclaimed and went to several international film festivals. It was also the biggest learning experience for me and I understood what to do and what not to do. Then I directed a crime show for TV ‘Shaitain- A Criminal Mind’, after which a couple of TV series followed, as did the first daily soap of my career. I was doing TV to support my finances as I had a family to take care of,” Ashish said.Currently, the young director is basking in the success of his second OTT series. “When a friend asked to meet her for a new project, I had no clue that the script would be so edgy and uncanny to direct. I was all game because this was my genre always and getting to work the way I was used to was an added advantage for me. And then in 2019 this riveting web thriller, ‘Undekhi’ happened that is now streaming on an OTT. It was different from my first OTT series ‘Band’ because here I was racing with time as each and every character was an enigma in himself or herself. I am happy with the way the show is being praised by all and especially by the audience. Now, I am waiting for the release of my next directorial ‘Bahut hua Sammaan,’ with one of my favourite actors, Sanjay Mishra. The film was shot extensively in Varanasi last year. Shooting for the next projects will be challenging during this phase but work has to start. Let’s see when we will be able to get back to work,” Ashish said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/always-knew-i-would-pursue-films-as-career-says-ashish-r-shukla/story-QB7aqjjdP7vYh6asDC0bRI.html

Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani, who pronouced the order through video conferencing, granted the relief to Shivinder in furnishing of a person bond of Rs one crore and two sureties by family members of Rs 25 lakh each. The judge also directed the investigating officer of the ED to request the Bureau of Immigration to open LOC in Shivinder’s name to prevent any unannounced exit from the country. The high court imposed various other bail conditions on him, including that he shall not tamper with the evidence or influence witnesses, directly or indirectly.He was arrested in the money laundering case last year.The high court had reserved its order on the bail plea on July 16 after hearing arguments from the counsel for Shivinder and Enforcement Directorate (ED).ED had opposed the bail plea saying that in the present case, money was diverted through a complex web of transactions and finding the trail was not easy. RFL is a group firm of REL - Religare Enterprises Ltd, which was earlier promoted by Malvinder Singh and his brother Shivinder Singh.The EOW registered an FIR in March last year after it received a complaint from RFL’s Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, Godhwani and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies. ED lodged a money laundering case based on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-grants-bail-to-ex-fortis-healthcare-promoter-shivinder-singh-in-money-laundering-case/story-5iRciXg953urbZFxRMKFUN.html

The Selection Board will be scheduled as soon as all eligible SSC Women Officers exercise their option and complete proper documentation. Women officers in the Indian Army have been striving for some time to ensure equal opportunities for all defence personnel, including eligible women officers. Last year in November 2019, the Supreme Court had directed the Army to take a decision on permanent commission to eight women army officers, who had approached the top court in 2010, against the bar on their absorption in the armed forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-grants-permanent-commission-for-women-officers-in-army/story-NgGyBTG8OYp0xTmctAMeZP.html

We are all determined to play our part in any case, and to make sure that we’re working together to ensure that criminals can’t escape justice by crossing national borders,” he said.Mallya’s extradition was ordered in February but “there is an ongoing legal case and I can’t comment any further on that and I can’t say anything at all about timescales”, Barton said. “The UK government understands the importance of the case,” he added.Last month, India said it had asked the UK not to consider any asylum request from Mallya, currently on bail pending his extradition, as there are no grounds for his persecution in the country. India has also said it has sought the early extradition of Mallya from the UK.The UK has so far only said a “confidential” legal issue was holding up Mallya’s extradition but that it was trying to deal with the matter as quickly as possible. Britain’s stance gave rise to speculation the 64-year-old businessman, wanted in India to face charges of financial irregularities, could have applied for asylum.Mallya lost his appeal in the UK high court in April against the 2018 order to extradite him. Last month, the high court also refused Mallya permission to appeal in the UK Supreme Court.He is wanted in India to face charges of financial offences involving Rs 9,000 crore borrowed by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines from several Indian banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-timescale-for-vijay-mallya-s-extradition-to-india-says-uk-envoy/story-xQ2kjbMC0MoWwrYTJoWMBJ.html

He also highlighted that despite having skilled carpenters and artisans, India continues to import furniture. “Can we not prepare India to become the factory of the world for furniture, can we not build to scale at competitive prices so that the world looks at India, to source from India,” he added. Further talking about yoga, the minister said yoga holds huge potential for industry and young entrepreneurs as the world is excited about it. “But did India really grab the opportunity that the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) opened up for India. Did we set up 100,000 yoga centres all over the world, did any entrepreneur amongst you or startups thought in terms of the possibilities that yoga offers by planning to train maybe 100,000 or 500,000 yoga teachers who would find an opportunity across the globe,” Goyal noted. He said one has to take a person in yoga room for four sessions only and for the fifth session, the person will come “running and then for the rest of his life, he would want to be a yoga participant, that is the power of yoga”. Cure is not only about medicine or about visiting hospital or a doctor for treatment, the huge possibilities of yoga as a preventive medication are known to many but have not been captured as an opportunity. “I do not know whether all of us have failed the nation and the people of India, where despite the Prime Minister with his vision of opening up door, opening up opportunities, for all of us, (we) have not seized the moment,” the minister asked. He added that post-Covid-19, people may not like to visit a medical practitioner for common cold and illnesses, “so why not look at preventive methods”. “I do not think all is lost, I still think that if some innovative youngsters plan to take it to the rest of the world, India can become a power house providing this technology and it’s a scientific technology. Every aspect of yoga, every ‘aasan’ teaches you something new,” Goyal said. Disruption need not always be technological as it not only comes out of computer screens, he said adding “disruption can come out of a variety of ways. It is for us to see whether we are willing to engage, whether we are willing to offer to the rest of the world India’s traditional strengths”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/identified-20-sectors-where-india-can-become-global-supplier-piyush-goyal/story-F5ouvgverdEDUemiTT3x1I.html
23-07-2020||India||‘Gratuitous’: Indian official’s acerbic retort on China’s advice on foreign policy||China’s advice to New Delhi to follow an independent foreign policy and safeguard regional peace reflects Beijing’s sanctimonious, even duplicitous approach in relations with other countries, a senior government official said on Thursday. “We do hope that China gives up its sanctimonious stand and takes real steps to further peace in the region and the world in accordance with international law. It wants India to give up on its close allies like the United States so that any global effort to get India entry into the UN Security Council as a permanent member or a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) despite an impeccable non-proliferation record unlike its all-weather ally Pakistan is blocked. With the Ladakh aggression, the Chinese perfidy in the garb of peace and tranquillity stands exposed,” the official said.A second official, part of India’s national security establishment, added that Beijing’s track record in its neighbourhood and the world reflected its “duplicitous and hypocritical approach”.Also Read: Navy’s forward posture against PLA in Ladakh muscles out Chinese threat on high seasThe strong remarks are as a reference to China’s assistance to countries such as Pakistan and North Korea develop nuclear weapons and delivery platforms, blocking UNSC sanctions against designated terrorists in Pakistan and flexing muscles along the 3,488 km long LAC and South China Sea as part of its cartographical expansion.ALSO WATCH | ‘Closing more Chinese consulates in US always possible’: Donald Trump The Chinese foreign ministry, responding to external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s assertion that India was never part of an alliance and will never be, said on Wednesday that China hopes and believes that India “will be able to maintain its independent foreign policy and safeguard regional peace and stability through concrete actions, and play a constructive role in international affairs”.The statement was seen in New Delhi to reflect concern in China over India’s growing proximity to the United States and loud voices of support for India from the Trump administration, particularly after China attempted to intrude into India in the Ladakh sector.The external affairs ministry hasn’t responded to Beijing’s statement.Also Read: From Ladakh to Japan’s Senkaku Islands, ‘bully’ China is in an overdrive“What China means to say,” a national security planner said, “was that India should forget about its attempts to intrude into Ladakh and move on. They made the same point when they wanted India to be part of the Belt Road Initiative, saying that it was a connectivity project and India shouldn’t mind if it passes through occupied territories in Pakistan.”Or telling India after trying to take over Indian territory in Ladakh that New Delhi should not let the boundary dispute impact the $ 100 billion bilateral trade.Contrast this approach with Beijing’s super sensitive stance when it comes to its perceived sovereignty issues in Arunachal Pradesh and elsewhere, claiming that state sovereignty is a core interest that is non-negotiable and protesting visits to the state by Indian dignitaries.Or when it fires a barrage of threats over Indian deals to supply Brahmos or Prithivi missiles to Vietnam and Philippines, two of the 20-plus countries it has territorial disputes with. But it goes right ahead to help client state Pakistan to build long range nuclear missiles, supplies fighter jets like JF 17 and other weapons including armed drones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gratuitous-indian-official-s-acerbic-retort-on-china-s-advice-on-foreign-policy/story-P7PWmiQN3R3h80LEXjaRrK.html

23-07-2020||India||Amit Shah urged to increase Chhattisgarh Police funds||Chhattisgarh Home Minister Tamradhwaj Sahu has urged Union Home Minister Amit Shah to increase the Centre’s share in the Police Modernisation Fund (PMF), reminding him of the state’s internecine war with the Left-wing extremism since its inception on November 1, 2000.Sahu drew Shah’s attention to the expansion of the Chhattisgarh Police since the new state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh (MP) two decades ago and 14 of its 27 districts come under the Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) Security Related Expenditure (SRE) scheme.Sahu wrote to Shah on Wednesday and cited facts and figures to underscore a gradual decline in the Centre’s share in PMF.In 2013-14, the funds sanctioned for the modernisation of Chhattisgarh Police were Rs 56 crore, but the requirement fell short by Rs 20 crore, the state home minister’s letter stated. “There has been gradual deduction of allocation under PMF for the state even though Chhattisgarh is fighting the Communist Party of India (CPI)-(Maoist) menace for several years. The trend is disconcerting and I am urging you to increase the Central government’s share in PMF,” he wrote.Sahu further stated that Chhattisgarh’s PMF share has been decreased, despite the fact that 14 of the 27 districts in the districts are LWE-affected and fall under the MHA’s SRE scheme. “ Out of these 14 districts, eight districts are severely Maoist affected and we urgently need funds for police modernisation in these areas,” the letter stated.Sahu also cited that the strength of the Chhattisgarh Police has increased from 22,520 to 75,678 personnel since its formation and during this period, 11 new revenue districts were created and the number of police stations has also gone up from 293 to 467.“Besides the Special Task Force (STF), Chhattisgarh has 22 armed battalions, a special information branch unit and training schools such as Police Academy at Chandrakhuri and Counter-Terrorism and Jungle Warfare (CTJW) College at Kanker. At present, a total of 45 battalions of paramilitary forces are deployed in the state to fight the Maoists,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-urged-to-increase-chhattisgarh-police-funds/story-XHoy8c01dKIY07DKNUxdnM.html

While Tilak was born in 1856, Azad was born in 1906. “Tributes to the two brave sons of Mother India, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Chandrashekhar Azad on their birth anniversary,” the prime minster tweeted.In a series of tweets, the vice president said, “Today, let us pay our tributes to these bravehearts and resolve to strive hard to realise their dreams for this great country.” There should be a greater focus in school books on the tales of sacrifice, patriotism and valour of iconic national leaders and freedom fighters to inspire the younger generation, Naidu said. He added that instead of merely covering commemorative occasions, the media must regularly highlight their stories. “Though Chandrashekhar Azad left his earthly abode too soon, at the age of 25 years, he was one of the most inspirational youth leaders of the freedom movement. He was also a mentor, philosopher and guide to a number of young freedom fighters, most notably Bhagat Singh,” Naidu said. Referring to Tilak, the vice president said he endeavoured to awaken the political consciousness of people through two weekly newspapers that he owned and edited, “Kesari”, published in Marathi and “The Mahratta”, published in English. “He vehemently criticised the British rule through these publications,” he noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vice-president-naidu-pm-modi-pay-tributes-to-bal-gangadhar-tilak-chandrashekhar-azad-on-their-birth-anniversary/story-jbAtsO7n1UyDuYrj1JWeoN.html

This is the reason why the temperature of the earth is increasing and badly affected climate. The world is afraid of climate change. There is the only way which our saints and ‘puranas’ had told us that trees are friends of human and only trees can save us. Indian culture has accepted the importance of trees and encouraged it,” he said.The Home Minister also lauded several initiatives by the Coal Ministry.“No one cared about labourers of mines of coal and minerals. After the constitution of District Mineral Fund, the government has spent Rs 49,000 crore for the development of the region where mines were set up,” he said.The Home Minister also paid tributes to Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Chandra Shekhar Azad on their ‘jayanti’.“Lokmanya Tilak and Chandrashekhar Azad both sacrificed their lives for the country. No one can forget the contribution of Tilak in India’s independence movement. His slogan ‘freedom is my birthright’ still inspires India’s youth.

23-07-2020||India||Jaipur court directs SOG to probe Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s role in credit society scam||A lower court in Jaipur has ordered the special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan Police to probe the role of Union Minister for Jal Shakti and Jodhpur Member of Parliament (MP) Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and his wife Naunad Kanwar, among several others, in the Rs 884-crore Sanjivani Credit Co-operative Society fraud case that was unearthed in end-September last year.Additional District Judge No. 8 Pawan Kumar gave the order on Tuesday (July 21) on the basis of a revision petition filed by two complainants from Barmer, who had invested Rs 68 lakh in the co-operative society and were denied their dues upon maturity of the sum.They also demanded an investigation into the role of the minister and his wife in the SOG case registered in August 2019.Shekhawat’s office said they would go through the contents of the order before making any comment about it.Ajay Kumar Jain, the complainants’ counsel, said the court accepted the revision petition and ordered the SOG to investigate the role of Shekhawat, Kanwar, and three others, including Mohan Kanwar, Rajendra Baheti and Kewalchand Daglia.“The revision petition was filed on June 20, which stated that despite the money trail to the personal accounts of minister Shekhawat and his wife, the SOG neither arrested them, nor seized their properties purchased from earnings from the fraud,” Jain said.The complainants -- Ladu Singh and Guman Singh of Barmer – moved court against the co-operative society that had started its operations in 2008 in Barmer and accused it of duping 50,000 investors, including them, of Rs 884 crore.The complainants had cumulatively invested Rs 68 lakh in the society, but were denied their maturity dues.“The SOG had also found in its investigation that Shekhawat and his wife’s companies had a 19% share in the co-operative society and had their hands in the till. The agency has found that money was transferred from the co-operative society to them,” Jain alleged.The SOG had registered a case against the co-operative society on August 23, 2019, after a preliminary inquiry on the basis of the complaints of unsuspecting investors and found that 50,000 of them were defrauded of Rs 884 crore. The co-operative society’s director Vikram Singh and others were booked under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by anybody in the capacity of trust), 467(forgery of valuable security), 468(forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document as genuine) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and were later arrested.In its preliminary investigation, SOG found gross financial irregularities after perusing the balance sheets of the co-operative society between 2009 and 2018, and 214,000 documents of its investors.“The SOG found that documents between the year 2008 and 2015 were destroyed by those who held positions in the co-operative society. Until June 30, 2019; 214,472 investors had invested Rs 883.38 crore, but none of them were paid maturity dues,” the preliminary investigation report had said.The SOG noted that the society promised unrealistic returns to lure investors, which offered 10% and up to 12% for the fixed deposit (FD) and the daily deposit schemes, respectively. The promised return was over 40% more than the existing market rate that banks and financial institutions offer for FD schemes. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition in the Congress-ruled desert state, is tight-lipped about the court’s order. “It won’t be prudent to respond to the court’s order in a hurry. We need to go through the content before reacting to it,” said Rajendra Rathore, deputy leader of opposition in the Rajasthan Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaipur-court-directs-sog-to-probe-gajendra-singh-shekhawat-s-role-in-credit-society-scam/story-X9n0yRPYzKbGhzW1WhO3jJ.html
23-07-2020||India||Northeast has potential to become India’s growth engine: PM Narendra Modi||Northeast has the potential to become India’s growth engine, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday while asserting that peace has now established in the region.Speaking after laying the foundation stone for the Manipur Water Supply Project today, through video conferencing, the Prime Minister highlighted that modern infrastructure is being built to improve connectivity.“The Northeast has the potential to become the growth engine of the country. Day by day my faith is getting deeper because peace is now being established in the entire region. The mantra of peace, progress and prosperity is echoing in the Northeast,” the Prime Minister said.“While blockades in Manipur have become a part of history, Assam has witnessed a phase of violence for decades. In Tripura and Mizoram too, youth have abandoned the path of violence. Now Bru-Reang refugees are moving towards a better life,” he said. The Prime Minister said modern infrastructure is being built in the Northeast emphasising that connectivity in the region is important, not for only ease of living, but also for achieving the goal for self-reliant India. He said that tourism potential of the region, including Manipur, is still unexplored.“Natural and cultural diversity of the Northeast is a great symbol of cultural strength. In such a situation, tourism also gets a lot of strength when modern infrastructure is built. Tourism potential of Northeast, including Manipur, is still unexplored,” he said. “Connectivity of Northeast is important for ease of living of people here. But it is also substantial for ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. On one hand, it strengthens our social and trade relations with Myanmar, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh, while also strengthening India’s Act East Policy,” he said. The Prime Minister said that India’s Northeast, in a way, is the gateway to our ancient cultural relationships with East Asia and the future of trade, travel and tourism.“With this thinking, there is a constant emphasis on connectivity-related infrastructure in the entire Northeast, including Manipur. Modern infrastructure is being laid in the Northeast along with roadways, highways, airways, waterways and i-ways as well as gas pipelines. Thousands of crores of rupees have been invested in the infrastructure of the region in the last six years,” he said. “Efforts have been made to connect the four capitals of the Northeastern states, 2 lanes to the district headquarters and all-weather road to the villages. Under this, about 3,000 kilometres of roads have also been prepared and projects are going on for about 6,000 kilometres,” he said. Asserting that there is a huge change in the area of rail connectivity in the region, the Prime Minister said that the work of connecting the capitals of every state of the Northeast with a good rail network is going on at a rapid pace.He highlighted that there are about 13 operational airports in the Northeast today. “To expand the existing airports in the region, including Imphal Airport, more than Rs 3,000 crores are being spent to build modern facilities there,” Modi added. “Another major work is happening for the Northeast, in the area of inland waterways. Work is now underway on more than 20 national waterways. In the future, connectivity here will not be limited to the Siliguri corridor,” he said. “Now clusters are being developed for value addition and marketing in local products under the self-reliant India campaign. In these clusters, all the facilities will be given to agro startups and other industries.The Prime Minister said that the region has the potential to replace India’s bamboo import with local production. “There is such a huge demand for incense sticks in the country. But for this also, we import bamboo worth billions of crores of rupees. A lot of work is being done in the country to change this situation,” he said. “Hundreds of crores of rupees are being invested under the National Bamboo Mission for bamboo farmers, artists associated with handicrafts and other facilities. This will benefit the youth of the region, the startups here,” he said. The Prime Minister said that many institutes are now being built in the region for health, education, skill development, start-ups and other training. “With the formation of sports universities and world-class stadiums, Manipur is becoming a major hub for the country’s sports talent,” he said. The Prime Minister said that ease of living is the right of everyone and his government is doing a lot of work in this direction. He said that the whole of India, including Manipur, is free from open defecation. The Prime Minister said that almost every family in the country is connected with electricity.“Today LPG gas has reached the kitchen of the poorest of the poor. Every village is being connected by a good road. Good homes are being provided to every poor homeless. There was a big shortage of clean water, so to complete it, work is also going on on the mission mode,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northeast-has-potential-to-become-india-s-growth-engine-pm-narendra-modi/story-zgyxCXNQrmkk9lf1mn5L0N.html

23-07-2020||India||A mini win for Sachin Pilot in Supreme Court, over to HC tomorrow||The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Rajasthan high court to pass orders tomorrow on a plea by rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs challenging the speaker’s disqualification notice, setting aside speaker CP Joshi’s request for a stay on the proceedings. “Can a person elected by people not express his dissent? Voice of dissent cannot be suppressed. In a democracy, can somebody be shut down like this?” Justice Arun Misha, heading the Supreme Court bench, asked Kapil Sibal, who is representing the speaker.The plea filed by Rajasthan speaker CP Joshi challenged the state high court order of July 21 which had asked the speaker to defer action on his notice to Pilot and other rebel MLAs till July 24, arguing that the court’s intervention was premature as he is yet to decide on the issue of disqualification and has only issued notices. The Pilot camp filed a caveat petition in the court, saying nothing should be done without notifying them first. The group has argued that if a group of MLAs raises its voice against the style of the CM’s functioning it cannot be termed defection. It further argued that the party whip applies only when the assembly is in session and issuing such a notice is a violation of their freedom of expression.The Congress requested the speaker to initiate proceedings after the Pilot camp absented itself from two Congress Legislature Party meetings. The speaker had argued that the notice issued to the MLAs was in the realm of legislative proceedings under the Tenth Schedule and said the judicial review of an ongoing anti-defection proceedings was limited. It further argued that the high court order on holding off action against the rebels amounted to violation of Article 212 (courts not to enquire into the proceedings of the legislature). The SC bench, however, said that the matter in the Rajasthan high court will be subject to the proceedings before the apex court.“The case requires prolonged hearing. It involves the very question of democracy itself,” said justice Arun Mishra.The top court will consider the question of whether courts can interfere with the disqualification proceedings initiated by the speaker at an interim stage before the speaker takes a decision on the disqualification plea. “We will hear only on the question of whether the court can interfere with the speaker’s proceedings or not. We will not go into whether the speaker acted mala fide or bona fide. We cannot go into that”, the Supreme Court said.The matter will be heard again on July 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-allows-rajasthan-high-court-to-pass-order-on-disqualification-notice-to-sachin-pilot-18-mlas/story-HojyWlr34e9CYaw2p702II.html

23-07-2020||India||In Speaker vs Team Pilot hearing in Supreme Court, this word becomes the sore point||The Supreme Court on Thursday said that dissenting voice in democracy cannot be shut down as it heard a petition filed by Rajasthan assembly Speaker CP Joshi against a high court order directing him to defer disqualification proceedings against Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident Congress MLAs.The Speaker argued in his petition that it is the top court’s duty to ensure that all constitutional authorities act within the “Lakshman rekha” drawn for each one of them.“Can a person elected by people not express his dissent? Voice of dissent cannot be suppressed. In a democracy, can somebody be shut down like this?” Justice Arun Mishra asked Kapil Sibal, who is representing the Rajasthan Speaker.The three-judge bench also included justices B R Gavai and Krishna Murari.The bench told Sibal that the high court had requested the Rajasthan Speaker to only wait till July 24. Sibal replied, “Suspend the word ‘direction’ from the order, court can’t do this.” The court replied, “So problem is only with the word? Order everywhere says ‘request’.”The court said the matter requires prolonged hearing. “You can have prolonged hearing but interim direction to speaker should be removed. My lords have never passed an interim order like this,” said Sibal.Justice Mishra asked Sibal on what grounds the disqualification was sought. “MLAs didn’t attend party meet, they’re indulging in anti-party activities. They’re in a Haryana hotel, incommunicado & sought floor test against their own party,” said Sibal.It was then that the judge asked him why can’t a person elected by people not express his dissent.Sibal, meanwhile, quoted from a Supreme Court judgement from March in the Manipur crisis. “Justice Nariman’s judgment in Manipur is in my favour. It is asking speaker to decide the matter, not defer the decision,” he said.When the bench asked if the Speaker can be an aggreived person, Sibl said, “I am not an aggrieved person. I am here because I have been asked not to decide the matter. That is against Constitution bench.”He also said that courts cannot decide on the matter, and that the Speaker has asked for an explanation from the dissident MLAs. “If the Speaker is satisfied, he won’t disqualify them,” said Sibal.Speaker Joshi has argued in his petition that the disqualification proceedings under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution are the business of the legislature, and cannot be interfered with.The disqualification notices were issued on the request of Rajasthan chief whip who said that the dissident MLAs did not attend the party’s CLP meetings. Pilot and other dissidents, meanwhile, argued that a whip cannot be issued when the assembly is not in session.The Congress has 107 members in the 200-member state assembly and the BJP 72.If the 19 dissidents are disqualified, the half-mark in the House will be slashed to 91, seeming making it easier for Gehlot to retain majority support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-sachin-pilot-kapil-sibal-rajasthan-congress/story-dFcIjODaYRrj0pb6Y0e0QK.html
23-07-2020||India||Green Card waitlist for Indian is more than 195 years: US senator||The backlog for an Indian national to get permanent residency or Green Card is more than 195 years, a top Republican senator has said, urging his Senate colleagues to come out with a legislative resolution to address this problem. A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently. Senator Mike Lee said on Wednesday that the current Green Card policy did nothing for the child of an immigrant whose dead parent’s Green Card application was ultimately denied because his or her job was no longer available. “Someone from India entering the backlog today would have to wait 195 years to receive an EB-3 green card. Even if we give their children this limbo status, none of them will have a prayer of becoming a US citizen,” Lee said on the Senate floor. In fiscal year 2019, Indian nationals received 9,008 category 1 (EB1), 2,908 category 2 (EB2), and 5,083 category 3 (EB3) Green Cards. EB1-3 are different categories of employment-based Green Cards. Lee, the senator from Utah, was speaking on the legislation moved by Senator Dick Durbin that seeks to protect immigrant workers and their children who are stuck in the green card backlog. “Green Cards are critical in the lives of so many who are here on temporary work visas. The backlog puts families at risk of losing their immigration status as they wait year after weary year to finally make it through this green card backlog,” Durbin said. “Our bipartisan agreement would add critical protections that were not in the original bill for immigrant workers and their immediate family members who are stuck in the backlog. They would be able to switch jobs and travel without losing immigration status. And children of immigrant workers would be protected from aging out so they will not face deportation,” he said. The Lee-Durbin agreement would make three changes to the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. First, it would immediately protect immigrants and their families who are stuck in the backlog by allowing them to “early file” for Green Cards. This would allow workers to switch jobs and travel without losing immigration status and prevent the children of immigrant workers from “aging out” of Green-Card eligibility so they will not face deportation while they are waiting for a Green Card. Second, the amendment would create a green-card set aside for immigrant workers who are unable to “early file” because they are stuck in the backlog overseas. Finally, the amendment would crackdown on abuse of H-1B temporary worker visas by outsourcing companies by prohibiting a company from hiring additional H-1B workers if the company’s workforce is more than 50 employees and more than 50 per cent temporary workers. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. “While we continue to debate the best way to fix the Green Card backlog, let’s make sure that no children of the affected families are harmed or deported. Just that simple. I offered a new bill, very simply stated, to protect children of immigrant workers act. This brief three-page bill would ensure that children do not age out while waiting for a Green Card,” Durbin said. “Imagine if you brought your children to the United States, worked on an H-1B visa and your children are waiting for you for the Green Card, you are paying for them to go to college because they don’t qualify as American Citizens for any type of federal financial aid. You’re making great sacrifices for them and then the day comes when they reach the age of 21 and they can be deported and your family divided,” he said. “Why would we want to let that happen?” Durbin asked. Noting that he has met many of these young people, the senator said it breaks his heart to hear their story that they may reach a point where they age out and be deported. “That’s why I wanted to offer this specific single provision. There is no reason these children should be punished for a broken immigration system. It’s not beyond our control to help them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-card-waitlist-for-indian-is-more-than-195-years-us-senator/story-7QMzcKyOuKVcsGbS7xQFlL.html
23-07-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi says PM failed to come with a vision to deal with China||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has failed to come up with a vision to deal with China even as he advocated a changed approach to resolve the border standoff.He said that as an opposition leader, it is his responsibility to question the prime minister, who in turn has to give a vision.“And I know that the prime minister is an opponent. My responsibility is to question him. My responsibility is to ask questions and to put pressure on him so he does his work. His responsibility is to give the vision. It’s not there,” Gandhi said in a video message issued on Thursday.“I can tell you, guaranteed, it’s not there and that’s why China’s is in there today,” he contended.The short video is the third in a series on the India-China border face-off. Through the brief videos, Gandhi wants to share his thoughts on national issues.Also read: Security agencies red-flag Chinese fronts in education, not just power and telecomIn the first video issued on Friday, he said India’s “troubled economy, foreign policy and neighbourhood” had prompted China to take an aggressive stand against the country.In the second video titled “China’s Strategic Game Plan”, Gandhi talked about how the Chinese had triggered the border issue to pressure Modi.In one of the sharpest attacks on Modi over the India-China border standoff, he said the Chinese are attacking his image as “they understand that for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’ (56-inch)”. Gandhi added that “if [Modi] allowed the Chinese to understand that they can manipulate him because of his image, the prime minister will no longer be worth anything for India”.In the third video titled ‘How should India respond to China?”, Gandhi listed different measures to deal with the Chinese.Also read| ‘Encouraging’: UK welcomes steps taken by India and China to ease border tensions“Psychologically you have to deal with the Chinese from a position of strength. If you deal with them from a position of strength, you can work with them, you can get what you need and it can be actually done. But if they sense weakness then you [have] had it,” he said.“The first thing is you not going to take on China without a vision. And by that I don’t mean a national vision. I mean an international vision,” added Gandhi.The former Congress president said China’s Belt and Road Initiative is an attempt to change the nature of the global order.“India has to have a global vision. India now has to become an idea. And it has to become a global idea. So that’s the thing that’s going to protect India, it is actually thinking big,” he said.Gandhi has been repeatedly targeting Modi and his government over Chinese transgressions and has said the prime minister was not being transparent on the issue. The Congress has been demanding that status quo ante be restored at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and Chinese troops be pushed to their side.Gandhi sought a changed approach to deal with the border issue with China.“Of course we have this border issue and we have to resolve this border issue. But we have to change our approach, we have to change how we think,” he said.“That is why I’m aggravated. Because I can see a huge opportunity is being lost. Why? Because we are not thinking long term, because we are not thinking big, and because we are disturbing our internal balance.”Gandhi lamented that Indians were fighting among themselves. “Just look at the politics. All day long, all day long, Indian is fighting Indian. And it is because there is no clear cut vision going forward,” he said.He also tweeted, “PM is 100% focused on building his own image. India’s captured institutions are all busy doing this task. One man’s image is not a substitute for a national vision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-says-pm-failed-to-come-with-a-vision-to-deal-with-china/story-52vCGgv7J9TWzyFjP03g1J.html
23-07-2020||India||Varavara Rao seeking bail under garb of pandemic, old age: NIA||The application of Elgar Parishad-Maoists links case accused Varavara Rao for bail on health grounds was a mere “ruse” and he was trying to take undue benefit under the garb of the Covid-19 pandemic situation and his old age, the NIA has told the Bombay High Court.His health condition was stable and he did not require treatment in a multispeciality hospital, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said in its affidavit on July 16, the day the 81-year-old poet and activist tested positive for coronavirus.Rao’s application of bail on health grounds thus, was a mere “ruse” and he was “trying to take undue benefit under the garb of current situation on account of global pandemic and his old age,” said the NIA, which is probing the Elgar Parishad-Maoists links case.The NIA also said in its affidavit that otherwise Rao won’t be eligible for bail only on merits of the case.“The prison authorities have responded timely and provided necessary medical aid to the appellant accused Rao.The applicant accused was admitted to J J Hospital for the complaint of giddiness on May 28 and after medical treatment, he was discharged on June 1 as he was found asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable,” it said.Raos medical record and the report submitted by J J Hospital’s superintendent did not suggest he was suffering from any such ailment which necessitated that he immediately obtain treatment in a multi-speciality hospital, the probe agency further said in its affidavit.Rao is currently currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19 and other ailments at Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai. On July 20, the Bombay High Court heard Rao’s bail plea briefly.His lawyer Sudeep Pasbola told the court that Rao was “almost on his deathbed” and even the NIA could not dispute the fact that his health was very critical.“His condition is very serious. He hit his head against the hospital bed while he was at the J J hospital and sustained severe injuries. Besides Covid-19, he suffers from several ailments, he is hallucinating and is delirious,” Pasbola said.“His days are numbered and if he is to die, at least let him die in the presence of his family members,” the lawyer said while seeking that Rao be granted bail.However, NIA’s counsel Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh told the court on July 20 that the state was “taking good care” of Rao and he had been admitted to one of the “best super speciality hospitals in the city”.The NIA is supposed to inform the court on Thursday if Rao’s family can be permitted to see him.Last month, the NIA filed an almost similaraffidavit opposing the bail application of Rao’s co-accused Sudha Bharadwaj, in the case.It said the bail application “pleading with regard to the medical condition of the petitioner is merely a ruse to obtain an order of interim relief which is not available to her otherwise on merits of the case”.Rao and nine other activists have been arrested in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, which was initially probed by the Pune Police and later transferred to the NIA in January this year.The case related to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial.The police have also claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varavara-rao-seeking-bail-under-garb-of-pandemic-old-age-nia/story-3sRYps54rCdrll26RIEOdJ.html
23-07-2020||India||PM Modi is 100% focused on building his own image, says Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that “India’s captured institutions” are all busy building the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Prime Minister is 100 per cent focused on building his own image. India’s captured institutions are all busy doing this task. One man’s image is not a substitute for a national vision,” he tweeted while posting a video on the microblogging site.In continuation of his video series focusing on border tension with the neighbouring country and other issues, the Congress leader posted another video on Twitter today and attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not having a vision and said this is the reason “why China is in there”, indicating Chinese troops are still inside Indian territory.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi suggested that India has to “psychologically” deal with Chinese from a position of strength and said that the country needs to have a global vision.“Psychologically you have to deal with Chinese from a position of strength. If you deal with them from a position of strength, you can work with them, you can get what you need and it can actually be done. If they sense weakness, then you had it. The first thing is you are not going to take on China without a vision and I don’t mean a national vision, but an international vision,” the Congress leader said in the video.He said that a huge opportunity is being lost at this moment.“India has to have a global vision. India has to become an idea and it has to become a global idea. The thing that is going to protect India is actually to think big. Of course, we have this border issue and we have to resolve this border issue. But we have to change our approach and thinking. This is the point at which the road parts if we go this way we become a major player and if choose another way we become irrelevant. That is why I am aggravated because I can see that a huge opportunity is being lost. Why because we are not thinking long term and thinking big because we are disturbing our internal balance,” he said.Attacking the Prime Minister, Gandhi said: “We are fighting amongst each other. Just look all-day Indian is fighting Indian. It is because there is no clear vision going forward. I know the Prime Minister is an opponent. My responsibility is to question him, ask questions and put pressure on him so he does his work. His responsibility is to give the vision. But it is not here that’s why China is in there today.”The former Congress president termed China’s Belt and Road initiative as an “attempt to change the nature of the planet”. This is the fourth video Gandhi has posted as part of his video series attacking the Centre over its handling of the ongoing tussle with the Dragon. Earlier, he released videos on June 17, June 20 and July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-is-100-focused-on-building-his-own-image-says-rahul-gandhi/story-ReehWPhaToMn1GqG1vQkhL.html

23-07-2020||India||Ahead of Raksha Bandhan festival, demand for Chinese rakhis fall||Ahead of the Raksha Bandhan festival, the demand for Chinese rakhis have fallen this year, according to shopkeepers from several parts of the country. People are refusing to buy Chinese rakhis due to tensions between India and China. Women are preferring India-made rakhis to Chinese rakhis. The locals also intend to boost the Indian economy by buying local rakhis.In Himachal Pradesh’s Shimla, Aanchal, a customer, said, “We always used to get Chinese rakhis. This year I am buying India-made rakhi. Why should we boost the economy of a country that is a threat to us? I would not tie a rakhi to my brothers which are made in China, the country that attacks our soldier brothers.” “We are not going to buy any Chinese products. This is beneficial for the local artisans as well. I would appeal to all to buy India made rakhis only,” she added. The local traders are also not buying or selling Chinese rakhis for Rakshabandhan. The traders said that India-made rakhis are also increasing employment among locals.“Customers are refusing to buy Chinese rakhis. Their first question is whether the rakhi is Chinese or not. Local handmade rakhis are selling. This would also affect the Chinese market, and benefit the locals. The money used to go abroad earlier, now it stays within the country,” said Mahesh Kumar, shopkeeper. Similarly, customers in Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad have said that they will buy India-made rakhis only.“We have to courier rakhis so we are here. We will buy Indian rakhis only. We are checking if the rakhi is Indian or not. We won’t buy Chinese rakhis at any cost. Be Indian buy Indian,” said Sanjana, a customer.“There is a demand for India-made rakhis only. No one bought Chinese rakhi. We have got rakhis from Jaipur and Kolkata. Less people are stepping out due to Covid-19,” said Ajay, shopkeeper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-raksha-bandhan-festival-demand-for-chinese-rakhis-fall/story-Vft19sVr3H9IrfSVPmpttO.html

It is the same for the top quality of the beverage as well.Jagannath said heavy rains in Assam and north Bengal is adding to the crop shortfall by another 15 per cent and producers are struggling to manage their operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-and-uneven-rainfall-hits-tea-crop-prices-firm-up-at-auctions/story-FtQBXR5UaEddQCie64pMOP.html

23-07-2020||India||In Rahul Gandhi’s latest video, a message to PM on China and ‘national vision’||Congress leader and former party chief Rahul Gandhi on Thursday sharpened his attack on the Centre and PM Modi, tweeting out that the prime minister is “100% focused on building his own image”. “India’s captured institutions are all busy doing this task. One man’s image is not a substitute for a national vision,” Gandhi posted along with a video. In a two-minute-long video, Gandhi talked about India’s ties with China after the brutal Galwan valley faceoff last month wherein 20 Indian Army soldiers were killed. “If you deal with them (China) with a position of strength, you can deal with them,” Gandhi said in the video. Gandhi said that if the Chinese sense weakness, then it will be a problem. “Dealing with the situation with China requires a vision, an international vision,” Gandhi said, adding that India needs to have a global vision and needs to become an idea in itself. Gandhi said that a huge opportunity will be missed by not thinking long-term and big.  Also read: India, China fail to make breakthrough in de-escalating tensions at LACPM is 100% focused on building his own image.

An Indian is fighting an Indian. This shows there is no clear cut vision going forward,” he added.Gandhi said that his responsibility is to question the prime minister and put forth questions, so that “he does his work”. “It is his responsibility to give the vision and I can guarantee you that it is not there and that is why China is in there,” Gandhi concluded.  This comes a couple of days after Gandhi took to Twitter and posted that the prime minister has fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power which has now become India’s biggest weakness as he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’.The Congress leader posted a video message on Twiter and wrote, “PM fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power. It was his biggest strength. It is now India’s biggest weakness.”In the video message, Gandhi spoke on speaking on “China’s Strategic Game Plan” and said, “What is China’s strategic and tactical game plan? It is simply not a border issue. The worry I have is that the Chinese are sitting in our territory today. Chinese don’t do anything without thinking about it strategically.”“In their mind, they have mapped out the world and they are trying to shape the world. That’s the scale of what they are doing. That’s what Gwadar is, that is what belt and road is. It is a restructuring of the planet. So when you are thinking about the Chinese you have to understand that that is the level at which they are thinking,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rahul-gandhi-s-latest-jibe-a-message-on-china-and-advice-on-national-vision/story-vh3E9pwwqCwfXmppqJV2pN.html

23-07-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh Scheduled Caste commission chairman alleges harassment by state government||The chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Scheduled Caste Commission alleged on Wednesday that the BJP-led state government was harassing him as the body decided to probe the incident in Guna where a dalit couple allegedly consumed pesticide and another couple from the family was beaten up by police.The commission’s chairman Anand Ahirwar also claimed that he was not allowed to enter his office on Wednesday. The office, Ahirwar alleged, was locked after an order from the secretary, who said he had got the order to the effect from the state government.“Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan cancelled on March 25 all the appointments made on different state commissions and boards by previous Congress-led state government. I challenged the state government’s order in the high court Jabalpur bench and got a stay on the government’s order,” said Ahirwar.“I was coming to office daily and discharging my duties. On July 16 and 17, I visited Guna to probe the matter in which a dalit couple allegedly consumed pesticide and other members of the family were beaten up by police during an anti-encroachment action of the district administration. The police booked all the family members including the couple who consumed pesticide. Police admitted the couple to the hospital but didn’t provide any medical aid to those who were beaten up by police brutally,” he added.“In the report, which I was about to submit to the state government on Wednesday, I recommended withdrawal of the criminal cases against the family and provide them with a ration card and also education to kids in the family. I also recommended that an FIR should be registered against the police. But before I could submit the report, the state government blocked my entry to my own office,” said the Scheduled Caste Commission chairman. Despite repeated attempts, tribal department’s principal secretary Pallavi Jain Govil and commissioner Chandrashekhar Borkar couldn’t be reached for their comments. They didn’t respond to phone calls and text messages. MP BJP spokesperson Rajnesh Agrawal said, “If Anand Ahirwar has any genuine grudge against the government he can lodge a complaint to the government authorities but he seems to be more interested in politicising the issues for obvious reasons. The state government took immediate action in respect with Guna incident and an inquiry has been ordered but still he is trying to draw political mileage from the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-scheduled-caste-commission-chairman-alleges-harassment-by-state-government/story-5epDFOw8Wgc0FK5Jp04XLN.html

23-07-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh govt’s employment initiative for migrant workers falls flat, private players show little interest||Nearly 5 percent of 7.30 lakh migrant labourers have got jobs and the biggest employers of these 35,000 odd labourers are village panchayats, not the private sector, shows Madhya Pradesh government’s data. The state government launched ‘Rozgar Setu’ web portal on June 10 to bring the migrant labourers and employers/job providers on a common platform so that the latter could choose the workforce as per their requirement, the announcement made in June stated. The state witnessed the return of 13.10 lakh migrant labourers and their family members from other states since March 24 when lockdown restrictions were imposed across the country given the Covid-19 situation. Of them, 7.30 lakh are labourers and remaining are their family members, as per the state government’s data. Of these 7.30 lakh migrant labourers, who include skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labourers, 35,361 workers are shown on the government portal as of Wednesday to have received employment through various employers/job providers. But, interestingly, while private players have shown little interest in the government’s initiative, as many as 27,908 of the labourers who account for as many as 79% of 35,361 labourers have been given jobs by village panchayats as per the state government’s data. Also read: Manipur, Madhya Pradesh opt for stringent lockdownsAs per Rural development and panchayat raj department officials, the panchayats in the state don’t have many jobs to offer, that too regularly to any person, except the job ensured for 100 days under MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act). As per the data, only 69 labourers have got jobs in heavy industries and less than 600 in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). After village panchayats, the second-best employers are contractors who have provided jobs to 2,700 while more than 550 got jobs through placement agencies. Builders have provided jobs to about 150 labourers, suppliers to 97 and commercial establishments have employed 67 labourers. In an open letter to employers on July 4, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “Rozgar setu portal has a database of all the migrant labourers after their skill mapping. More than 24,000 employers/job providers have got themselves registered who include those from heavy industries, MSMEs, builders, placement agencies, commercial establishments etc to provide jobs of permanent nature to the labourers for which I am grateful.” However, industries hardly showed any significant interest in the CM’s appeal. Chhindwara district tops the list in facilitating jobs through village panchayats to labourers. About 5,000 labourers have got jobs at the panchayat level, as per the data. Collector of Chhindwara, Saurav Kumar Suman said, “We have certain works other than those offered under MNREGA too, like works related to 226 anganwadi centres, panchayat buildings, mines etc., besides work offered by central government agencies like BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd), NHAI (National Highway Authority of India) etc. They engage labourers as per their need.” However, right to food activist Sachin Jain said, “The state government’s claim of providing jobs through village panchayats is misleading. There is hardly any significant work left after MNREGA at the villages. The fact is that the state government can’t provide or facilitate jobs to labourers overnight particularly because hardly any sincere effort was made in the past on the part of the government to create jobs in the state.” Yusuf Baig, a social activist from Panna district said, “I don’t see any work at the village level other than MNREGA provided to the labourers. Even MNREGA hardly fulfils their need. A family is supposed to get only 100 days a year job under MNREGA. If a family has four members then each of the members will get just 25 days job.” Mohd Makbool Ali, 53, a migrant labourer from village Mahtara under janpad panchayat Gohparu in Shahdol district got himself enrolled on the portal about a month. “Nobody has contacted me so far for any work. Even otherwise, I don’t see any work here. I will return to Mumbai the moment situation becomes normal over there,” he said. Another migrant labourer Rahul Kumar, 22, a resident of village Marpura under janpad panchayat Lahar in Bhind district was engaged with a security agency in Gurugram and echoed similar sentiments. He said, “It has been about a month now since I have been waiting for any response. I am planning to return to Gurugram.” On poor response to labourers from industries, president of the Association of Industries, Indore Pramod Daharia said, “Any industry will like to engage any labourer if it doesn’t have its trusted employees who are already engaged. There is a mutual understanding between the two sides and both understand each other’s needs. Secondly, after the lockdown, the industries are not running with their full capacity. Hence, they don’t need any labourer from outside.” President of Peethampur Audyogik Sangthan Gautam Kothari spoke in a similar vein. He said, “The industrialists prefer their own workforce. They are making phone calls to their workers and getting them back by arranging their transport. None of the industrialists would like to disturb its well-established system until unless there is some emergency or real shortage of workforce due to their employees stuck in other parts of the country.” Additional chief secretary (ACS), labour department, Rajesh Rajora said, “There are a good number of contractors who have provided jobs to labourers. We are making an all-out effort to facilitate as many jobs to labourers as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-govt-s-employment-initiative-for-migrant-workers-falls-flat-private-players-show-little-interest/story-B86DwuUS7kWysHVM9xwXuK.html

23-07-2020||India||Explainer: How foreign experts got injured at Baghjan oil well and what happens to efforts to plug blowout now||Amid expectations that Oil India Limited’s (OIL) natural gas well in Assam’s Baghjan, which suffered a blowout on May 27 and caught fire on June 9, would be plugged anytime soon, three foreign experts involved in the efforts sustained minor burn injuries while working at the site on Wednesday.According to OIL officials, the experts from Singapore-based Alert Disaster Control were trying to remove a spool from the well head when the incident happened. They were provided treatment at a hospital in Dibrugarh and are out of danger. The work on capping the blowout is expected to resume from Thursday.The well, which is among 17 gas wells and five oil wells in Baghjan oil field in Tinsukia district, had a blowout - uncontrolled release of crude oil or gas when pressure control systems fail - while a work over operation was on to produce gas from a new reservoir at a depth of 3729 metres.While efforts were on to plug the blowout and foreign experts were brought in, the well caught fire on June 9 killing two firefighters and damaged 13 houses in the vicinity. Around 2,000 families residing nearby were evacuated and houses in relief camps where they have been staying since.Initially, OIL had stated that it would take about a month to control the fire and plug the blowout, but flooding caused by heavy rains affected work at the site for several days delaying operations.The well, which spewed oil condensate and subsequent fire, was feared to pose threat to ecology and environment of the area as it was located close to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park and the eco-sensitive Maguri Mottapung Wetland, an important bird habitat.Studies by several agencies are underway at Baghjan at present to gauge the damage caused to the area by the blowout and fire. Last month, National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered formation of an expert committee to probe the blowout and subsequent fire and assess the damage caused to human life, wildlife and environment because of it.How the foreign experts got injured?Though the fire at the well, which initially spread to nearby areas, has been under control, it has been on fire since June 9 while tasks needed to be completed to douse it continue.To enable people to work around the edge of the well and close to its head, a water umbrella is sprayed at very high speed, which minimises the fire at the mouth of the well (while it continues to rage few feet above) allowing people to reach the well head.“Today an important operation was underway to open and remove the spool, a connecting equipment between pipes, from the well head. Two flanges on both sides are opened and the spool is lifted,” OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika said on Wednesday.“While they were doing it, the mouth of the well suddenly caught fire and it spread laterally for 3-4 feet. And since the experts were working within that range, they got injured. While two of them escaped with minor injuries, one tripped and fell and the uncovered portion of his hand caught fire,” he added.All three were immediately evacuated from the site by other personnel present and provided medical attention. They were they taken to a burn care unit of a private hospital in Dibrugarh where they got proper treatment. The experts have been discharged and are now at OIL’s hospital in Duliajan.According to Hazarika, one of the experts sustained around 20 per cent burn injury on his hand, another had 12 per cent injury and the third sustained eight per cent burn injury. All three are expected to resume work soon.What happens to efforts to control the fire?The fire incident that caused injuries led to suspension of work at the site on Wednesday. But OIL officials say work is likely to resume from Thursday and the blowout will be plugged soon.“The operation will go on as per schedule. On Wednesday, the damaged spool was removed before the experts got injured. The next task is to reinstall the blow out preventer (BOP) on the well head. It’s a three-tonne equipment which has to be fitted on top of the existing undamaged spool, which is now exposed,” said Hazarika.“It’s a very coordinated operation. We hope to start work on it on Thursday morning and fix it after 3-4 hours. Once the BOP is placed, it is described as capping of the well. That will be followed by killing of the blowout,” he added.Hazarika informed that capping doesn’t mean that the gas will stop coming out of the well and the fire will be extinguished. A valve on the BOP will be injecting a fluid inside the well, which will neutralise the pressure of the well slowly and push the gas back from the well into the reservoir.“The operation between capping of the well and killing the blowout can take 2-3 days. The gas is being drawn from a depth of around 3.5 km so the fluid has to fill up that entire column,” he said.The entire operation should be over by the end of this week, which would complete almost two months since the blowout happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explainer-how-foreign-experts-got-injured-at-baghjan-oil-well-and-what-happens-to-efforts-to-plug-blowout-bow/story-xECRZtqxDkTNgBxyew87SL.html

23-07-2020||India||Petition in Supreme Court seeks Commission to inquire Govt lapses in tackling Covid-19||Five retired bureaucrats and an academician have approached the Supreme Court through lawyer Prashant Bhushan for setting up a Commission of Inquiry to probe the lapses on part of the government in handling the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.On a day when Bhushan was slapped with a contempt notice by the apex court for his tweets accusing the judiciary of “destroying democracy”, the present petition was filed asking Court to hold the government accountable for its “gross mismanagement” of the pandemic situation.The petitioners include former Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officers KP Fabian and Madhu Bhaduri, former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers MG Devasahayam, Meena Gupta, Somasundar Burra and academician Amit Bhaduri.Also read: SC seeks detailed response from Prashant Bhushan on contempt matter over his tweetsThe petition alleges that the government failed on many counts which resulted in depriving citizens of their right to life and livelihood. The petition claims that the government failed to take timely and effective measures to contain the transmission of the disease despite getting notification of the disease from the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. This began with a failure to screen all international passengers arriving in India, according to the petition.Next, the petition alleges failure of the Centre to abide by its statutory obligations under the Disaster Management Act. Further, the petitioners accused the Centre of not consulting the National Task Force constituted on March 18, 2020, before imposing the lockdown. This committee had experts from the fields of epidemiology and public health. Timely and targeted provisions were not made to prevent job loss, income loss, deprivation of livelihood, starvation and exodus of migrant workers, the petition stated.The petition also touched upon the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) to health workers as an added ground for jeopardizing the safety of health workers. “The aforesaid lapses on part of the respondent (Centre) while dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic have led to a severe infraction of the fundamental rights of people,” stated the petition filed by Bhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-in-supreme-court-seeks-commission-to-inquire-govt-lapses-in-tackling-covid-19/story-BMC5LEbLL4pxPvG5lQS5MO.html
23-07-2020||India||Security agencies red-flag Chinese fronts in education, not just power and telecom||An exercise to minimise the role of power and telecom companies believed to be linked to the Chinese government could be expanded to cover other critical sectors such as higher education as well, people familiar with the development said after a July 15 review of the penetration of such companies and institutions in the Indian economy.The high-level meeting attended by national security planners and a select group of secretary-level officials comes against the backdrop of the Chinese army’s aggressive moves along the Line of Actual Control that led to a stand-off from May this year. The two sides earlier this month started disengaging at the face-off points in eastern Ladakh after several rounds of talks but Beijing has been slow to pull back its troops.Last week’s exercise was aimed at coming up with a comprehensive assessment of the footprint of Chinese companies and institutions that could be a proxy for the Chinese government or have close ties to the ruling communist party. “The initiative was driven by the top political leadership,” a government official said.Much of the discussion at the meeting revolved around a presentation made by security agencies that put the spotlight on two core areas; telecom and higher education.Security officials who briefed the top civil servants spoke about several instances of universities and colleges tying up with Chinese institutes through Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) without the requisite approvals.A classic example cited by the security establishment was the Chinese-government funded Confucius Institutes to promote Han Chinese language and culture - typicality set up in association with a local partner institution.In the telecom sector, security agencies pointed to the telecom department’s instructions to state-run phone company Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, BSNL, to amend its tender to exclude Chinese equipment makers from a large 4G upgrade project.But private phone companies often prefer Chinese equipment because they are cheaper. There have also been allegations that large tenders are tailored to suit Chinese companies. Industry body COAI had last month spoken against restrictions on private companies, insisting that geopolitical issues should be kept separate from corporate decisions.The education and telecom ministries have been asked to review the Chinese involvement in the two sectors in light of the presentation made by the security agencies and chart the next steps for the sector.The rule that requires approvals from the education ministry, home ministry and the external affairs ministry before signing pacts with Chinese institutions or universities isn’t new. On 1 October last year, the higher education regulator University Grants Commission told universities about the need for approvals for its courses. But it is unclear if the government followed up to ensure compliance.That exercise is expected to start soon.Beijing started setting up Confucius Institutes across the world in 2004 to promote Chinese language and culture in foreign countries. But as China started rolling out the institutes across the world, the Chinese government-funded outposts also started increasingly coming under the scanner of agencies in host countries. The initial concerns were only about academic freedom, institutional autonomy and reported instances of censorship. But some institutes started to shut after lawmakers expressed concerns that these served as a platform for chinese intelligence and political agenda. Some more, after the law prohibited the defence department from funding Chinese language programmes at institutes that host Confucius Institutes. These institutes have run into trouble in other countries as well including the UK, Canada, France, Australia and Sweden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-agencies-red-flag-chinese-fronts-in-education-not-just-power-and-telecom/story-HmWWF6zkf4n15bKidFv21I.html

The incident took place on Monday, but came to light on Wednesday when a case was registered.The youth, along with three others including one of her relatives who took her to the hotel have been booked, the police said.According to the police, the girl is a student of Class 9 in a city-based school and her father is a businessman.Yogesh Dev, police inspector who is among the investigators, said, “On Wednesday, the girl’s father lodged a complaint against four men accused of conspiring and raping her in the hotel. Based on the complaint, a case has been registered in which one of them has been booked for raping her while three others, including her distant relative, has been booked for conspiring in the crime.”“So far in the initial probe, it has been found that on Monday, her distant relative asked the girl to join him in a car ride. Trusting him, she agreed after which he took her to the hotel where the rape accused and two more people joined them,” he said. The four took her to a room in the hotel which was already booked. There, one of the four raped her. However, when she cried, they all became nervous and then dropped her near her house and fled. “After reaching home, she didn’t tell anything to her family members. However, seeing her tense, her family members asked the girl the reason for it after which she finally narrated her ordeal.

Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy said as the transfer of central funds to the state will decline this financial year due to economic recession, the borrowing is necessary. Odisha has already borrowed Rs 1,000 crore from these two funds.“When the first case of Covid-19 was detected in Odisha on March 16, we had only a single testing centre- ICMR-RMRC. After that, there have been several new testing labs. A total of Rs 340 crore has been spent from the Chief Minister Relief Fund, Rs 624 crore from State Disaster Relief Fund, Rs 73 crore from MLA LAD funds and the PRI institutions have spent Rs 875 crore for developing critical infrastructure to fight Covid-19. The scale of this pandemic is huge, so to meet the challenge of manpower and infrastructure engaged in the fight has been enormous. Life is above everything else. So priority will be given to manage the evolving crisis,” said Tripathy.Also read: Odisha village renamed after popular folk song Rangabati to honour lyricistSoon after the lockdown started, the Centre had allowed states to use up to 30% of unutilised district mineral funds for spending on Covid-19 infrastructure. So far, 19,835 persons in the state were detected with coronavirus in the state of which 108 succumbed to the virus.The pandemic has already started taking a huge toll on the state’s economy with its revenue earning down by 23 percent in the first quarter of the current financial year in comparison to the corresponding period last year. The total revenue collection between April and June was Rs 8,204 crore against last year’ss collection of Rs 10,645 crore.The chief secretary said most of the money on Covid-19 has been spent on paying salary and incentive to around 2 lakh doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, lab technicians, ASHA and anganwadi workers, ambulance drivers, veterinary docs and counsellors. There has also been a huge expenditure in purchasing masks, PPEs, testing kits and oxygen cylinders.“There have been several interventions for the livelihood of the economically vulnerable sections. Rs 1,500 have been given to construction workers, Rs 2,000 to people who successfully completed their quarantine period. All these figures were presented before the Council of Ministers today,” Tripathy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-its-revenue-declining-odisha-to-go-for-more-borrowings-from-environment-mining-funds/story-P5jCU04zoHIESrn7nSlPTN.html

As many as 120 animals have died due to floods in the Kaziranga national park, while 147 have been rescued as per the report by the Divisional Forest Officer, Eastern Assam Wildlife division. Many animals from the national park were seen migrating to higher places by crossing the streets after water entered Kaziranga.Currently, 45,281 people are being helped through 391 relief camps/distribution centres. The State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), Circle Offices, and locals have rescued 452 people so far. The rising water levels have damaged embankments, roads, bridges, and culverts, among other constructions like houses, etc in the state.On Wednesday, the Centre announced that it will release Rs 346 crores, in the first phase, under the Flood Management Program (FMP) scheme to Assam and will also hold talks with Bhutan to solve the recurring flood problem in the lower parts of the state.Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal held a meeting with Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, through video conferencing, on Wednesday, in which the information was conveyed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-floods-claimed-89-lives-affected-26-districts-report/story-tEwO9w1imv0l5AsTIPBT8H.html
23-07-2020||India||Covid-19 may further skew India’s tax profile||With Covid-19 infections crossing a million last week, and the virus spreading to new regions, India’s pandemic challenge is bound to become more difficult. Unless daily cases start coming down, business and consumer sentiment is unlikely to recover. This has also raised some doubts about government finances, especially revenue collections. A look at the available numbers suggests that indirect taxes might end up accounting for an even larger proportion of total taxes this year than they typically do. This is more than just an economic curiosity and has an important political economy implication for India, where governments have traditionally guarded against being seen as levying taxes on the poor.Also Read: June saw India make its first trade surplus in 18 years. But this isn’t good newsDirect taxes are progressive in nature – the rich pay at a higher rate than the poor – and a fall in share of direct taxes in total revenue entails retrogression in the tax burden. A person earning Rs 10 lakh per year faces a lower income tax rate than someone who earns Rs 1 crore per year. Indirect taxes do not make this distinction. Petrol is sold at the same rate whether it is meant for a motorcycle or an expensive car.India’s political economy landscape has two basic contradictions. Agriculture produces less than 15% of the GDP, but employs more than 40% of workers. And just a little over fifty million of India’s 400 million workers pay income taxes. These two numbers are often used to caution against any radical redistribution in favour of the ‘have-nots’, at the cost of the ‘haves’ in the economy. The rich are important for economic growth and revenue collection, and penalising them will not be fair, it is argued.That hasn’t stopped the government from taxing the rich more, though. In July 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman imposed a surcharge on the super-rich, which took the peak income tax rate to 42.7%. The move attracted a lot of criticism, and Sitharaman, in principle, accepted the criticism. “Ideally, we should bring it (peak income tax rate) down. Ideally, but we have to see when the timing is proper for this”, she told HT in an interview. In September last year, the government announced a major reduction in corporate tax rates, which it then estimated would lead to a revenue loss of Rs 1.45 lakh crore. Also Read: India’s painful economic recovery: Million cases, trillions of rupees lost and countingThe actual shortfall has turned out to be more . The reduction in corporate tax rates offset the revenue from the increased tax liability on the rich in 2019-20 (at least some of its beneficiaries were the rich). The share of direct taxes in the Centre’s gross total revenue came down by 2.5 percentage points from the 2018-19 level of 54.1%. RBI data shows that direct taxes, which include income tax and corporate tax, had a share of less than 40% in total tax revenue of the centre and states. The share of direct taxes increased sharply in the decade preceding the 2008 financial crisis (it used to be in the low double digits), reached a peak in 2009-10 and has stagnated at a slightly lower value since. In most OECD countries, direct taxes account for much of the total taxes -- up to two-thirds in some cases. Some see this as a sign of efficiency; others, who believe in income redistribution to offset inequality, see it as only fair and equitable.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();How will the pandemic affect this distribution? It is early to comment on this. Data from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) with the ministry of finance has tax collection data until May, 2020. A comparison on a year on year basis shows direct taxes suffered a bigger shortfall in comparison to indirect taxes in the first two months of the fiscal year. Total collection of corporate tax and income tax in April and May was Rs 52,707 crore, which is 14.6% less than the collection in April and May 2019. Collection of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), customs and excise duties, three major indirect tax heads, in April and May was Rs 71,961 crore, which is 52% less than the April and May 2019 collections.We will have a better picture when the June tax collections are released next month. However, a look at monthly rather than cumulative numbers paints a different picture. While indirect tax collections vis-a-vis previous year’s collections improved in May, direct tax numbers seem to have followed the reverse trend.Also Read: GST faces challenge to meet higher revenue expectationsThe recovery in indirect taxes is likely to continue in the month of June. The government reported June GST collections to have crossed Rs 90,000 crore, which was 91% of the collections in June 2019. The June collections could have included tax filings for previous months, as deadlines were extended during the lockdown.Both the central and state governments, especially the former, have increased taxes on petrol and diesel rather than passing the advantage of low crude prices to the consumers. An HT analysis showed that the gap between fuel prices here and international crude prices in the post-pandemic period continues to be the highest ever. With petrol and diesel consumption inching back to normal levels, governments will make a windfall in taxes. Petroleum ministry data shows that petrol and diesel consumption might be close to last year’s figures in July. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();On the other hand, it will not be surprising if the shortfall in direct taxes becomes bigger. Companies might have held back on lay-offs and pay-cuts in April in the hope that the lockdown would yield quick results. Such hopes have been belied. Most institutional and private forecasts for 2020-21 GDP have worsened over time. This means that outlook on profits and salaries, and therefore direct tax collections, will worsen overtime.For example, Indigo, India’s largest private airline, announced on Monday, that it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Also Read: Economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic to vary in sectorsAnecdotal evidence supports this hypothesis. A Mint report by Prashant Kumar Nanda earlier this month said at least 100,000 workers a day dipped into their statutory retirement savings in June as they grappled with income and job losses . With profitability taking a beating, corporate tax collections will also suffer. In effect, the contribution of indirect taxes, seen by some as affecting the poor more than the rich, in overall tax revenue, that was already skewed in India, is likely to become even more so because of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-may-further-skew-india-s-tax-profile/story-0XG75OWNyaklznDTjnfJ8L.html
23-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||There was talk of immunity passports as early as late March, when the Sars-Cov2 virus which causes the coronavirus disease was raging through Europe (Dispatch 18, on April 5, wrote about them). Back then, the thinking was that these passports would be issued on the basis of antibody tests — with anyone with antibodies for Covid-19 being eligible for one. These people, the argument went, could move around, work, travel, and help cities and countries get back on their feet because they couldn’t get infected.The idea was never implemented because researchers could not answer how long the antibodies or immunity (the two aren’t necessarily the same, but we will come to that shortly) would last. A recent study by researchers at the David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, may have the answer — Covid-19 antibodies have a half-life of 73 days, lower than the two years that antibodies for Sars-Cov-1 (which causes the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) last. The two numbers are not directly comparable, but the difference is clearly there and significant. The study covered only 34 patients (and all standard caveats that apply to research based on a sample that small, do). The researchers also did not study what happens to the antibodies after 90 days, but admit that there is a chance the “decay will decelerate”.The study’s finding — published in the New England Journal of Medicine — isn’t very different from another recent study published in pre-print server medRxiv by researchers from Kings College, London that found that Sars-Cov2 antibodies peak three weeks after infection, and then decline, with levels almost approaching the baseline in some cases in as little as two months. This sample size for this study was around 90 people including 64 patients.But these studies do not necessarily mean any immunity we develop to Covid-19 is transient.That’s because of T-cells (on which, suddenly, everyone seems to be an expert).According to recent research at the Karolinska Institute and the Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, twice as many people who have antibodies that fight Covid-19, have T-cells that target cells infected by the disease — which means the actual immunity in a population is higher than that measured by antibody tests. The researchers called this T-cell mediated immunity.If true (the study sampled around 200 people), this would mean that in Delhi, for instance, where a sero survey (blood test) found that 22.86% of a randomly selected sample of around 21,000 people had antibodies, the actual level of immunity could be much higher, perhaps as much as 45%, a little over the 43% a study by the universities of Stockholm and Nottingham came up with as the herd immunity baseline for Covid-19. That could explain a lot of things — including why the number of daily cases started declining in the Capital.This column wondered sometime back whether there was a peak infection rate after which the spread of the disease started declining. If the Swedish study holds, it could mean that the prevalence or infection rate itself is perhaps much higher than what is measured using antibody tests.Indeed, T-cells are emerging as the real heroes of the pandemic. According to another recent study by Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School, Singapore’s National Centre for Infectious Diseases, and others, Sars-Cov2 generates specific T-cells and, more importantly, coronaviruses such as this one activate T-cells with long-lasting memory. For instance, the study found that people who were infected by Sars in 2003, and recovered, still have T-cells specific to Sars-Cov1, and that these T-cells actually help protect them from Sars-Cov2. The researchers said that this cross immunity, as they termed it, could explain why some people are either immune already, or react to the infection differently from others (for instance, they might not infect others, or the intensity of infection could be lower).In essence, if all these studies hold, while the antibodies specific to Covid-19 might not last long, the number of people who are immune is actually higher than the number of those who have antibodies because of T-cells, which, it emerges, continue to be produced long after the infection in the case of coronaviruses.I would treat that as really good news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-41Ww26E5eDvY47BRbvK8QO.html

The village, where the lyricist was born, was renamed after getting ministry of home affair’s no-objection. Rangabati, a peppy folk number, is the most popular song in Odisha in the Sambalpuri dialect. Apart from being played at wedding, and cultural events, political parties also use it during their campaigns The song’s lyrics, a playful banter between between a boy and girl, celebrate the girl’s charms as well as their love.Gauntia, 77, was selected for the Padma Shri early this year. He has been conferred with the Odisha State Sangeet Natak Academy Award and Akashvani National Award for music and also honoured by Sambalpur University for his writings. He has written over 1000 songs.“I am happy that the village was renamed as Rangabati Bilung. We had been demanding this since 2004,” said Gauntia.The song was first recorded for AIR, Sambalpur, in 1975-76 but released in 1979 by Indian Record Mfg. Co(INRECO) in 45 rpm vinyl format. The foot-tapping Sambalpuri love duet composed by Prabhudutta Pradhan and sung by Jitendriya Haripal and Krishna Patel, became a rage in Odisha, undivided Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh a few years after its release.In 2007, the song was played for Odisha’s Republic Day Tableau and in December 2010, the it was played during the third ODI cricket match between India and Sri Lanka in Cuttack.

23-07-2020||India||Supreme Court grants bail to Bengali journalist arrested in alleged ponzi scam||The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted bail to Bengali journalist Suman Chattopadhyay who was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in December 2018 for his alleged involvement in a ponzi scam.A three-judge bench headed by justice Rohinton Nariman noted that Chattopadhyay is admitted to the Apollo Hospital in Bhubaneswar for serious heart trouble and lung infection and may, therefore, be more prone to Covid-19 infection than other prisoners.“We think this (is) one good reason for releasing the petitioner on bail. The petitioner be released on bail to the satisfaction of the trial Court immediately”, the bench comprising justices Navin Sinha and Indira Banerjee ruled.“After being in incarceration for over a year and a half, justice has finally been meted out to Chattopadhyay. The Supreme Court has long been a guardian of personal liberties of citizens, and today’s order is a reflection of that. This may be an important step in his otherwise longer drawn battle”, Chattopadhyay’s lawyer, Sahil Tagotra told HT. Chattopadhyay has served as the editor of Ananda Bazaar Patrika and Ei Shomoy, a Bengali daily. He had then started his own newspaper, Ek Din, and raised money from I-Core services which had come up using chit funds.I-Core group came under scanner after one Ajay Kumar Sahoo filed a complaint with the Bhubaneswar police that after maturity of his deposit with I-Core, the amount was not returned to him. Chattopadhyay and two promoters of I-Core were later arrested by CBI in the matter.While the promoters of I-Core were subsequently released on bail, Chattopadhyay’s bail plea was rejected earlier on several occasions both by the sessions court and the high court.The latest was on June 4 when the high court rejected the plea though Chattopadhyay had highlighted his deteriorating health coupled with the fact that he has been in jail for 18 months.Chattopadhyay submitted before the Supreme Court that the trial has not yet commenced in the case and not even a single question was put to him by CBI in the last 18 months. “Only three accused were arrested in the present case of which two main accused have already been granted bail by the high court. There has not been a single allegation against the petitioner that he may have attempted to influence the course of investigation, tamper with evidence or intimidate any witness”, the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-grants-bail-to-bengali-journalist-arrested-in-alleged-ponzi-scam/story-U7iO1eM9KXZB3DMOmItpjM.html
23-07-2020||India||India a key partner, pillar of US foreign policy: Pompeo||Describing India as one of the few trusted like-minded countries, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that New Delhi is an important partner and a key pillar of President Donald Trump’s foreign policy.In his virtual keynote address to the annual ‘India Ideas Summit’ of the US India Business Council (USIBC), Pompeo said he was happy to report that India is a “rising” US defense and security partner in the Indo-Pacific and globally.The United States, he said, “desires a new age of ambition” in its relationship with India.Asserting that the US has never been more supportive of India’s security, he said New Delhi too, is an important partner and a key pillar of President Trump’s foreign policy.“We don’t just interact on a bilateral basis. We see each other for what we are great democracies, global powers and really good friends. India is one of the few trusted like-minded countries whose leaders I call on a regular basis for counsel and collaboration on issues that span continents,” Pompeo said.“I’m confident that our relationship is only getting stronger. Let’s emerge from this current challenge more resilient and innovative than before. And let’s seize this moment to deepen cooperation between two of the world’s greatest democracies,” he added.Pompeo said the US has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the next G7 meeting to be hosted by President Trump.“We will advance the economic prosperity network. It is the group of countries and organisations that we consider natural partners with we share values like democracy, transparency and rule of law,” Pompeo said.The Group of Seven (G-7) is an international intergovernmental economic organisation consisting of seven major developed countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, which are some of the largest IMF-advanced economies in the world.Pompeo also said that he was happy to report that India is a rising US defense and security partner, in the Indo-Pacific and globally.“I’m confident that with our concerted efforts, we can protect our interests” he said.“We’ve revived the so-called quad that comprised the US, India, Japan and Australia. India is also part of a group of likeminded nations that I’ve convened regularly to advance shared interests,” he said.Navies from the US, India, Australia, Japan and France have been deepening their mutual cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region in view of China’s growing attempt to expand military influence in the resource-rich region.On Monday, a US Navy carrier strike group led by nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz carried out a military drill with a fleet of Indian warships off the coast of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Four frontline warships of the Indian Navy participated in the “PASSEX” exercise when the US carrier strike group was transiting through the Indian Ocean Region on its way from the South China Sea.The USS Nimitz is the world’s largest warship and the exercise between the two navies assumed significance as it took place in the midst of tensions between India and China in eastern Ladakh as well as in China’s military assertiveness in South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-a-key-partner-pillar-of-us-foreign-policy-pompeo/story-YVE14u6Cur7KTSrip44dKM.html

They lay these cables on the ground to drive away animals from farmland. On Wednesday morning, a 25-year-old male elephant was found dead at Bamandanga tea estate area. Forest officers said the elephant touched a low lying wire and not a cable placed by villagers to save vegetation. They described the incident as a fatal outcome of negligence by those who installed the power supply system at that spot.A 15-year-old tusker was found dead on Tuesday on a small patch of land near a house at Ramjhora tea estate in Birpara police station area. It touched an illegally powered cable.Nisha Goswami, divisional forest officer at Gorumara, said “a low lying electric cable killed the pachyderm on Wednesday.”Latiful Islam, a local panchayat member, said “The elephant must have entered the village to eat jack fruit and got electrocuted.” The last two incidents were reported at Buxa tiger Reserve forest and Madarihat near Jaldapara National Park on June 16 and June 24 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-elephant-electrocuted-in-24-hours-in-north-bengal-fourth-death-in-two-months/story-8Jh5EjeMEx5vOt8JddL1mK.html
23-07-2020||India||Invest in a country you can trust, Modi tells US||New Delhi/Washington: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday pitched India as a trustworthy and open business partner for the United States (US), seeking American investments in areas ranging from agriculture to health care to defence in a bid to boost economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.PM Modi also portrayed India as a “perfect combination of openness, opportunities and options”, said India had what was needed to power the global recovery post the pandemic, suggested that India and the US could together help the world recover, and reiterated that India’s domestic campaign for self-reliance would aid this process. The PM’s comments, while delivering the keynote address at the India Ideas Summit organised by the US India Business Council (USIBC), come in the backdrop of increased tensions of both US and India with China, for different reasons, and a search by global businesses with bases in China for alternative investment destinations. “The rise of India means a rise in trade opportunities with a nation that you can trust, a rise in global integration with increasing openness, a rise in your competitiveness with access to a market which offers scale. And a rise in your returns on investment with the availability of skilled human resources,” he said. Experts suggest that the PM’s emphasis on trust and openness is a clear attempt to contrast India with China. The PM referred to his government’s efforts over the past six years to make India’s economy more open and reform-oriented and to ensure increased competitiveness, enhanced transparency, expanded digitisation, greater innovation and policy stability. India’s opportunities, he noted, could help power the global economic recovery.Describing India and the US as natural partners, Modi said: “Now it is time our partnership plays an important role in helping the world bounce back faster after the pandemic. American investors often look out for the perfect timing to enter a sector or a country. To them, I would like to say: there has never been a better time to invest in India.”The approach to the future, the PM also said, must be a more human-centric one while focusing on resilience against external shocks, the lack of which was exposed by the pandemic. He referred to his government’s efforts to increase self-reliance in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis, saying, “Global economic resilience can be achieved by stronger domestic economic capacities. This means improved domestic capacity for manufacturing, restoring the health of the financial system and diversification of international trade.” The PM claimed that through the self-reliant campaign, India was contributing towards a prosperous and resilient world.Modi’s invitation to US business was in line with his efforts to pitch India as a trade and investment destination during the recent India-EU Summit and to build alternative supply and trade chains at a time of the heightened tensions with China following a months-long border standoff. He invited US businesses to invest in technology while pointing out that India has half-a-billion connected people, while an equal number are in the process of being connected. He also cited a recent report to claim that there were more Indians connected in rural areas than in urban areas. There were opportunities in front-line technologies such as 5G, big data analytics, quantum computing, block-chain and internet of things, he said.He also sought investments in agriculture, health care, energy, infrastructure, civil aviation, finance and insurance, and defence and space. India’s food processing sector is expected to be worth more than half a trillion dollars by 2025, while the health care sector is growing at more than 22% every year, he noted.US firms can tap opportunities in India’s efforts to moves toward a gas-based economy and in clean energy, while the number of air travels is expected to more than double within the next eight years and the country’s private airlines plan to induct more than 1,000 new aircraft over the next decade. “This is a huge opportunity for any investor who chooses to set up manufacturing facilities in India, which can become a base for supplying regional markets,” Modi said.Turning to space and defence, he said: “We are raising the FDI cap for investment in the defence sector to 74%. India has established two defence corridors to encourage production of defence equipment and platforms. We offer special incentives for private and foreign investors.” FDI flows into India during 2019-20 were worth $74 billion, an increase of 20% percent from the year before, Modi said, adding USIBC had informed him that the “pledged investment” from the US has crossed $40 billion this year. Amid the pandemic, India attracted foreign investments worth more than $20 billion between April and July, he added.The annual value of India-US trade has jumped to $140 billion and the Modi government has taken steps to increase the purchase of oil and gas from the US in recent years. However, the two sides were unable to bridge differences on key issues such as market access and tariffs to stitch together a mini trade deal in time for US President Donald Trump’s visit in February. Efforts are believed to be underway to conclude this mini trade deal before the US presidential elections at the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/invest-in-a-country-you-can-trust-modi-tells-us/story-6ofqpdINgE5dnucloKJ0gK.html
23-07-2020||India||Former JD(S) Karnataka unit chief AH Vishwanath who helped topple govt, nominated to upper house||Former Janata Dal (Secular) Karnataka unit chief A H Vishwanath who had helped topple the Congress-JD(S) coalition government led by H D Kumaraswamy and who lost the recent by-polls on a BJP ticket, was nominated to the Upper House in Karnataka by Governor Vajubhai Vala.Vishwanath who was earlier with Congress had joined the JD(S) after falling out with Siddaramiah and was made the JD(S) state unit chief. However, after differences with the Gowda family which controls JD(S) he had helped topple the coalition government.However, in the December 2019 by-polls held for 15 seats, Vishwanath was one of the prominent candidates to lose contesting on a BJP ticket. He had over the last few months expressed unhappiness at not being ‘rewarded’ for his role in ensuring a BJP government in the state. He had also promised to write a tell-all book called ‘Bombay Days’ with all the details of ‘Operation Kamala’ which lead to the formation of a BJP government in the state. The title refers to the days that 17 dissident MLAs had stayed put in Bombay (Mumbai) and helped topple the coalition government in Karnataka.Along with Vishwanath, four others have been nominated to the Vidhana Parishad by the Governor including senior BJP leaders C P Yogeshwar and Bharathi Shetty apart from Shantharama Budnna Siddi and Dr Talwar Sabanna. A senior BJP leader who did not want to be identified defended the move of nominating party leaders in the eminent citizens’ category and said: “Vishwanath has been nominated in the literature category as he has written a few books, Yogeshwar in the arts and culture as he was an actor earlier, Bharathi Shetty is a social activist, Siddi belongs to the tribal community and Talwar to the backward community.”Political analyst Manjunath said that by nominating Vishwanath and Yogeshwar to the Upper House, CM Yediyurappa has kept his promise to reward them for helping him come back to power. Yogeshwar is an old political foe of Kumaraswamy. “While it is unfortunate that political leaders who have lost in polls are being sent to the Upper House in this way, all parties have done this and are equally guilty. In a way the current nominations are a careful balancing act of one woman, tribal, a backward class representative as well as two politically important leaders being rewarded. Yediyurappa’s stamp can be seen in the choice of candidates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-jd-s-karnataka-unit-chief-ah-vishwanath-who-helped-topple-govt-nominated-to-upper-house/story-ob3buKEVvLt3W5WckqgtBI.html
23-07-2020||India||Speaker moves SC against order stalling proceedings||The Supreme Court will hear on Thursday a plea by the speaker of Rajasthan legislative assembly, CP Joshi, challenging the July 21 order of the Rajasthan high court asking him to defer till July 24, action on notices he issued to Sachin Pilot and 18 dissident Congress legislators, as the first step in their disqualification process. Joshi said in his plea that the high court order restraining the speaker of the assembly from continuing with disqualification proceedings is in violation of settled legal principles and an intrusion into the exclusive domain of the speaker.“The Supreme Court has a duty to ensure that the all the authorities under the Constitution exercise their jurisdiction within the boundaries and respective ‘Lakshman Rekha’ envisaged by the Constitution itself. Judiciary was never expected under the 10th schedule to interfere in the manner it has done in the instant case resulting in this constitutional impasse,” the plea filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes said.“We need to see if a mere show-cause notice (issued to the MLAs) on a petition (submitted by chief whip Mahesh Joshi) is beyond the speaker’s authority,” Joshi said earlier in the day in a press conference in Jaipur, during which he said he would approach the apex court.Meanwhile, Pilot and the 18 MLAs also filed a caveat before the Supreme Court on Wednesday, which means they will have to be heard by the Supreme Court before any order can be passed.“The law on this aspect is settled since a long time. In 1992, a five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court in Kihoto Hollohan’s case upheld the validity of the 10th Schedule (which deals with disqualification of law makers for defection) of the Constitution and said that courts cannot pass any stay order on proceedings before the speaker. The order of Rajasthan high court stays the disqualification proceedings before the speaker, which is in conflict with the Kihoto judgment and, hence, we have approached the Supreme Court to stay the high court order”, Fernandes said. That case stemmed from disqualification of some MLAs of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly and crystallised many principles regarding the powers of the speaker.In his press conference, Joshi too referred to the case, Kihoto Hollohan vs Zachillhu and Others, dating back to 1992, and that in it, the Supreme Court ruled that till the speaker takes a decision on disqualification applications, injunction orders aren’t passed related to members against whom applications are pending. “I am disappointed with the court’s directions,” he added. “This matter is of urgent nature. The order has reduced my constitutional authority, which is prima facie against the apex court’s decision.”In that case, the top court ruled that the judicial review should not cover any stage prior to the making of a decision by the speaker/chairman. No interference would be permissible at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings, the court said then.Joshi’s petition emphasises that. “In view of the aforesaid, the (high court) order is ex-facie illegal, perverse, and in derogation of the powers of the Speaker under the Constitution and hence deserve to be set aside,” it said. The Rajasthan high court, on Tuesday, directed the speaker not to take any action against Pilot and other MLAs till July 24.This order was passed after Pilot and the other MLAs had approached the high court on July 15, challenging the speaker’s notice which had asked them to furnish an explanation by July 17 on why they shouldn’t be disqualified from the assembly for their conduct, which the Congress party alleged was detrimental to the interest of the party and showed their intention to quit the party.“I am bound to pass orders on these applications as a constitutional authority,” Joshi said in the press conference. Pilot and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot have been at odds since the Congress government came to power in 2018. Gehlot was made CM while Pilot had to settle for the post of Deputy CM. Gehlot blamed Pilot for the party’s rout in the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan last year; Vaibhav Gehlot, the chief minister’s son, lost from Jodhpur in the election. Pilot, in turn, believed that he had no powers, with even appointments in ministries under him being made by Gehlot. The tussle became public earlier this month after Rajasthan police sought to question Pilot over allegations of attempting to pull down the Congress government in Rajasthan. Pilot was eventually sacked as deputy CM.The speaker’s notice to Pilot was based on the disqualification petition filed by the chief whip of the Congress in Rajsthan, Mahesh Joshi. Joshi, in his plea, cited the absence of the MLAs from two Congress legislature party meetings, held on July 13 and 14, despite specific instructions to attend it. This, he claimed, showed their intention to leave the Congress.Pilot and the other dissident MLAs have maintained they never had the intention to leave the Congress party and were exercising their right to criticise the party leadership and the functioning of chief minister Ashok Gehlot. In a democratic set-up, voicing disagreement with policies or decisions made by the party doesn’t amount to acting against the interests of the party, so as to lead to disqualification, they said in their petition before the high court.“Kihoto Hollohan is very specific that no quia-timet actions (injunctions to prevent wrongful acts) can be entertained. The speaker under the 10th schedule, may act as a tribunal, but judicial review is available only after the final judgment. Courts do not get into the internal functioning of legislatures is the principle of law since Bradlaugh v Gosset (UK judgment of 1884) and Keshav Singh case (of 1964) in India”, senior counsel Sanjay Hegde told HT.The matter will be heard by a three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra and also comprising justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari.“The petition by the speaker is pre-mature since the honourable high court has only reserved its order. It is only appropriate that the party to the case wait for the high court order before approaching the Supreme Court in appeal,” Pilot’s lawyer S Hariharan told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speaker-moves-sc-against-order-stalling-proceedings/story-EtJvdrkT1sOINvJDHV0NEI.html
23-07-2020||India||Delhi to conduct sero survey every month||A new citywide blood sampling will be carried out in the first five days of every month beginning in August, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said on Wednesday, announcing a regular survey to determine how much further Covid-19 may have spread in the Capital – a strategy that could show how close the city is to achieving herd immunity and whether it needs to tweak its response measures. The announcement came a day after the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) released results from the first such surveillance – known as a serological study – showing that 22.86% of 21,387 people who were tested showed signs of being exposed to the virus.“Sero-survey identifies people who have recovered from the disease. The 23% result of the previous survey is most likely to be people who got infected around mid-June, because antibodies take around 15 days to develop. It has been more than a month now. The government plans to make it a monthly exercise. We shall be doing the next sero-survey between August 1 and 5,” Jain said.The figures from the NCDC report, if extrapolated, could mean that over 4.5 million people -- or nearly 1 in every 4 - have had the disease and recovered till June end, manifold more than the 126,323 confirmed till Wednesday. They also suggest that the disease kills only 0.07% of people infected, as opposed to the 2.94% fatality rate in the city.The findings led experts to conclude that the peak of infections in the Capital was definitely over. “The biggest silver lining is that if we have such high population that was exposed in the past but did not largely display serious symptoms or succumbed -- then it is as good as a vaccine,” Dr Sujeet K Singh, director, NCDC, told HT on Tuesday. But, experts maintain that there is no room for complacency and people need to continue with precautionary measures such as social distancing and wearing masks.Epidemiologists believe an infection prevalence rate of 40-65% in a particular population could be adequate to reach a level known as herd immunity, when the number of people who have never had the disease (and are not protected by antibodies that infected people build) dwindle to such an extent that an infectious disease dies out due to a lack of vulnerable hosts.Jain, when asked about herd immunity by reporters he was interacting with, said even experts differ on this concept. “Usually, it is perceived as a stage when around 40% to 70% people have recovered from the disease. We cannot comment on herd immunity at this stage. We will get a better picture of that after the numbers of fresh cases stop emerging,” he said.The minister added that “there definitely was spread in the community”. “Whether one can call it community spread is a very technical thing as per the guidelines and protocols that are followed,” he said, asking people to remain cautious. “Around 77% of people are still vulnerable and we cannot be complacent. We should be serious about maintaining social distance, wearing masks and washing our hands regularly.”According to Jain, the protocol for the new surveys is still being finalised. “We are chalking out a strategy. It will be spread across the city, cover both containment zones and normal areas, include individuals of different age groups and the sample size will not be less than the previous survey,” he said.Officials in the health department, who asked not to be named, said the survey will be carried out by district surveillance teams and health department officials between the 1st and 5th of every month. The teams will fan out across neighbourhoods from where they will pick out people according to the stratification they need to follow, varying samples by age, gender and locality to represent as random a set as possible, this person said. The tests will be done through the Covid Kavach kit developed by Gujarat-based Zydus Cadila.NCDC, which carried out the previous survey on behalf of the Delhi government, is unlikely to be involved this time. The local teams carrying out the process will report to the district magistrates. “The sero surveys need to be repeated periodically to be able to establish a trend with respect to the disease spread. When ICMR approved antibody (blood) testing, it had advised all states to conduct sero-surveillance using the test from time to time to get a sense of how the disease has spread within the community. This is to be done by states and the Centre will pitch in if they require assistance, especially those with high disease burden,” said a Union health ministry official, requesting anonymity. Dr Lalit Kant, the former, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “Sero-survey done periodically can help the government focus their efforts – both in terms of speed and scale – in protecting the population still vulnerable to exposure to the Sars-CoV-2 virus.” “As far as the sample size is concerned, it is determined through a formula that primarily depends on prevalence rate of the disease. In Delhi, the prevalence rate has gone up, so the sample size for the upcoming survey is likely to be higher,” he added.Experts cautioned that Covid-19 still is scantly understood, especially with how it can lead to no symptoms in large proportions of the infected population, and that antibody testing in itself was a complicated process due to the way the virus behaves. “We are dealing with a new virus here and there is a lot of unknown. For instance, at this juncture, we do not know how long antibodies would stay in the human body after recovery from Covid. That is what makes trend analysis important,” said Puneet Misra, professor of community medicines in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi. “Methodology and sample selection will play a crucial role in the upcoming sero-surveys and the government should consider involving experts and specialists in this regard,” he added.(With inputs from Rhythma Kaul)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/city-to-conduct-sero-survey-every-month/story-qU3DnBTErfM2czYLytM7fL.html
23-07-2020||India||NK Singh stresses on Centre-state ties in fight against pandemic||India’s ability to fight Covid-19 largely rests on how well it manages Centre-state relations, NK Singh, the chairman of the 15th Finance Commission, said.Singh was addressing students of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Bangalore on Wednesday through video conference.“Giving a lecture on ‘Impact of Pandemic on Fiscal Architecture - Fiscal Federalism in the Near Future’, I stressed the need to reset the fiscal architecture in light of the pandemic. Unlike other countries, India has far more harmonious management of the Centre-State polity,” Singh tweeted. He said the states, which are fighting the pandemic, need resources, and the government should relax their borrowing limits. “This is the time for fiscal norms to be suitably relaxed. States need greater room to meet additional obligations caused by the pandemic,” IIM Banglore said in a tweet quoting him.In order to give fiscal space to states in this time of crisis, the Union government recently raised their borrowing limits. Announcing the last tranche of Rs 20 lakh crore ‘Atamnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-Reliant India Initiative) on May 17, finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Centre also accepted the demand of states to raise their borrowing limit from 3% of their respective gross state domestic product (GSDP) to 5%, and this would give them additional resources of Rs 4.28 lakh crore during the Covid crisis.The increased limit, however, depended on implementation of reforms by the states in four areas — one-nation-one-ration-card, ease of doing business, power distribution, and urban local body revenues, she said. In a statement, the finance ministry on July 12 said that it issued a formal communication to state governments raising borrowing limits by 2% of their projected GSDP in 2020-21 subject to implementation of specific state-level reforms.Speaking at IIM Bangalore, Singh explained the concept of “fiscal federalism”, a term first introduced by the German-born American economist Richard Musgrave in 1959 that deals with the division of government functions and financial relations between levels of government.He revisiting the evolution of fiscal federalism in India, which primarily dates back to pre-Independence era and emanates from the government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935. While the 1919 act provided for a separation of revenue heads between the Centre and provinces, the 1935 Act allowed the sharing of Centre’s revenues and the provision of grants-in-aid to provinces.He also explained the difference between “Union” and “Federation”. “Political scientist Alfred Stepan classified India as a “holding together” as opposed to a “coming together” federation. Unlike the federal form of government in the United States, which is described as an indestructible Union composed of indestructible states, India is an indestructible Union of destructible states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nk-singh-stresses-on-centre-state-ties-in-fight-against-pandemic/story-4dyStmoKIaWxeJVubnjIDP.html

The state has 136,980 active cases with a recovery rate of 55.62%. Maharashtra also recorded 280 fatalities on Wednesday, taking its death toll to 12,556.Pune city recorded the highest number of cases on Wednesday at 2,111, followed by Mumbai at 1,310. Confirmed cases in Pune stood at 43,645, while Mumbai’s tally was 104,678. Wednesday also saw the case count in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), excluding Mumbai, going up to 105,300, surpassing Mumbai’s tally.The state has been clocking over 8,000 cases daily for the past six days with infections increasing in the remaining eight municipal corporations outside Mumbai in MMR and in districts such as Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Solapur. The number of active cases in tier-two cities and towns of Maharashtra has seen a steep increase in the past month. Officials said they were confident there will not be any shortage of beds in these districts considering the new wave of infections could stretch health infrastructure. Senior government officials attributed the increase in active cases to the increased daily testing across districts and increased movement of people.An analysis of state health department data showed that Pune district had 7,071 active cases on June 22, and on July 21 it had 36,810 active cases, which its 61.61% of the total infections recorded in the district. A month ago, it had 43.97% active cases.Thane has the second-highest number of active cases at 36,180, which is 45.27% of the total caseload in the district. The Thane district, which has six municipal corporations under it, has been clocking a high number of cases in the past month. On June 22, it had 25,390 cases with 14,555 active infections. On July 22, its tally stood at 79,911 cases with 36,180 active infections.Nashik district has witnessed a similar spike over the past month. It had 1,185 active cases on June 22, which rose to 4,221 on July 21, accounting for 41.16% of the total cases.Solapur, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Jalna, and Latur districts have all seen similar caseload spikes.

Kolhapur district had 747 Covid-19 cases till June 22, which rose to 2,413, as of Tuesday.“In the past two to three weeks, we have seen a steep increase in the number of cases from rural as well as urban areas of the district. Between March and June, we did not see many cases, but the new wave has increased the active caseload in the district. We have ramped up health infrastructure, we have set up Covid Care Centres and requisitioned ICU beds from private hospitals,” said Dr BC Kempi Patil, civil surgeon, Kolhapur.Latur and Jalna districts, too, have over 50% active cases in comparison to the total cases registered. In Latur, there were 631 active cases as of July 21 (51.25% of the total cases). In the same period, Jalgaon district saw a decrease in the active caseload, from 41.22% to 28.46%. However, the absolute number of cases has gone up from 2,426 on June 22 to 8,138 on Wednesday.Active cases in Parbhani and Washim districts are comparatively lower in absolute numbers with 212 and 217, respectively. However, there has been a substantial increase from June. On June 22, Parbhani had seven active cases, and now it has 212 active, which made up 53.25% of the district’s total. Washim had 31 active cases and now has 217 active cases, which accounted for 56.07% of the total caseload in the district. Buldhana’s active case tally was 417, which was 62.33% of the total caseload.A senior government official said they were carrying out rapid antigen tests that gave faster results so as to stop the spread of virus in the period between tests and results of suspected patients. The official said that the “intermingling” of people of semi-urban areas and rural areas was a “possible explanation” for the wave of infections in these areas. Barring Thane, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Mumbai districts, the restrictions had been lifted much earlier in other districts as the cases were not many.“We do not want the outbreak to go out of hand in rural and semi-urban areas. We have seen an increase in these (rural and semi-urban) areas, but the increase is not exponential. All districts are now starting to use the rapid antigen kits for faster results. We have ramped up testing, tracing and treatment. The availability of beds will not be an issue as cases are not growing exponentially,” a senior government official said, who did not wish to be named. The official added that district administration has been asked to aggressively follow tracing, especially in densely populated areas of their districts.Meanwhile, Mumbai on Wednesday recorded 58 more fatalities, taking its toll to 5,875, while Pune city recorded 36 deaths, which pushed its toll to 1,117. Pimpri-Chinchwad recorded 1,133 new cases and 18 fatalities. Nashik recorded 298 new cases, while Ahmednagar district and city recorded 240 and 201 fresh Covid-19 cases. Kolhapur district reported 193 new infections, while Aurangabad city, which is nearing 8000 confirmed cases, reported 248 new Covid-19 cases.Maharashtra has so far tested 16,87,213 people with an overall positivity rate of 20%. So far, 187,769 Covid-19 patients have recovered and have been discharged. Currently, 858,121 people are in home quarantine and 44,975 people are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-becomes-first-state-to-add-10k-infections-in-a-day/story-Km2879DfnElknmQDiYJABO.html
23-07-2020||India||First antigen kit of Indian make gets ICMR approval||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday approved a second rapid antigen test kit, by Mylab Discovery Solutions, to diagnose coronavirus disease (Covid-19). This is the first Indian made test kit to be granted an approval.The test, named Pathocatch Covid-19 Antigen Rapid testing kit, is developed and manufactured in India. It will be immediately available for orders and will be priced around Rs 450.“Mylab team is working really hard to fight this pandemic in every possible way. After bringing an affordable RT-PCR test to reduce dependence on foreign kits, we launched Compact XL to accelerate Covid-19 testing. Now, with the approval for an antigen testing kit, we will cover whole spectrum of Covid-19 testing and leave no stone unturned to fight this pandemic,” said Hasmukh Rawal, managing director, Mylab Discovery Solutions. Mylab’s real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test kit was also the first indigenous test kit that received ICMR approval for use in India.Antigen-based testing is being used alongside rRT-PCR to scale up the country’s overall testing and treat patients early. Rapid antigen test is quicker than the rRT-PCR, as it takes just about 30 minutes, compared to about five hours for rRT-PCR testing. The process does not require a sophisticated laboratory, which is a key requirement for rRT-PCR tests. “That is the only way to break the transmission scale, by identifying those who are infected and isolating them so that they don’t spread the disease further,” said Jacob John, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore.Prior to this, the ICMR had approved antigen test kits by SD Biosensor, a south Korean company, which has a branch in Manesar of Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-antigen-kit-of-indian-make-gets-icmr-approval/story-Aj1lAHLJLSUOANbOJgNyzL.html
23-07-2020||India||Experts call for national database on coronavirus||India needs a centralised national database on everything related to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including standardised data on turnaround testing time, surveillance, home and hospital isolation, and proportion of cases among people with contact history , say epidemiologists and public health experts.In an opinion article in The New York Times, the former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tom Frieden recommended the compilation of standardised data on a range of parameters to better manage the pandemic that has so far infected 15,154,448 and killed 621,172 across the world. He wrote, specifically of the US that “we aren’t tracking the public health equivalent of vital signs” and that this is a “big reason the US is losing the battle against Covid-19”. Frieden’s article is based on work done by his current organisation, NGO Resolve to Save Lives, which, according to an article in NYT found that states were reporting only 40% of the “data needed to fight the pandemic”. In some ways, experts say, India is similar to the US in terms of its geographical size and diversity. The same data collection and standardisation problems the US has, are also manifest here, they add. The Resolve to Save Lives website lists some of this data. These include: “new confirmed and probable cases and per capita rates by date with 7-day moving average”;“new screening (antigen) and diagnostic (PCR) testing per capita rates by date, with threshold, with 7-day moving average”; “CLI (Covid-19 like illness) and ILI (influenza like illness) trends from emergency departments”; “diagnostic test turnaround time (specimen collection to test report), by week”; “time from specimen collection to isolation of cases”; and “new infections among health care workers not confirmed to have been contracted outside of the workplace, by week”.Epidemiologists in India say this data is crucial for clinical and epidemiological research. “It is all relevant data, especially turnaround time for testing as in most urban areas where there is a surge in cases, we see that there is considerable delay in testing, which further leads to delay in communicating positive results, and can eventually affect the time of isolation of cases. Hence, these are important parameters to document, and should be documented scientifically. What does not get reviewed won’t get done,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, professor, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.Experts also advocate transparency — they suggest national data must be shared real-time with the public to empower them to protect themselves.“Merely documenting information is not enough; what is documented should be put out in public domain for the benefit of people at large. If data is accessible publicly then there will be people willing to analyse it and come to conclusions that can help guide decision makers towards the right direction. As things stand now, the information that is in public domain is only what the government wants you to know. That’s not how it should be,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head, epidemiology and communicable diseases division, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “I should have access to information on, say, who is dying-- is it those who are marginalized and don’t have access to health care services or the section that has access to treatment. Also, which are the hot spots that I should avoid in case I am stepping out .” Union health ministry officials say that the centre has been closely monitoring the Covid-19 situation across states and union territories, and data generated through its testing and surveillance network is regularly updated at the central level.A union health ministry official said India is already collecting much of this data and following many of the suggestions mentioned in the article. “Our integrated disease surveillance programme network is updated on a real-time basis and the data is collected till the grassroots level. There is a dashboard in the ministry that is fed all relevant information from states. Laboratories testing Covid-19 samples are also feeding real-time information digitally on identified online platforms. Central teams are being regularly sent to states with high case load to coordinate with and assist local governments in managing the outbreak and look for gaps that need to be filled,” said a senior health ministry official, who did not wish to be identified.Where there are lapses, the problem is largely with the states, the official added. “At least 80% of the contacts are currently being traced within 72 hours of reporting of a case, but it is not the same across states. States are being asked to ensure test results are put out within 48 hours of sample collection, but many states are not following it. “Separate data is being generated from SARI and ILI cases for which all these patients are being tested for Covid-19 in the country. Some states are doing exceedingly well in data reporting such as Maharashtra and Gujarat where we can say the (real) numbers are what is being reported.” There is a huge variation in tests being done per million population across states. While a lot of data may not be available in the public domain, it is available to those who need it, said an ICMR official. “Testing data is duly documented from all 1270 approved laboratories that are conducting Covid-19 tests. Once a lab receives a sample, it takes up to six hours to process it and enter data into the ICMR web portal. The turnaround time is a maximum of 48 hours. All information is not being put out in public domain but internally the data is accessible to everyone who wants details. It’s an absolutely transparent and streamlined system,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, spokesperson, ICMR. Still, there is a massive discrepancy in testing rates, and opacity about turnaround testing time, surveillance and contact tracing , say experts. “Aggressive testing is needed but we must also keep in mind that it has to be done in a scientific way, as per the requirement of each state given the country is diverse and no two states will have the same requirement. Some states will have lower testing capacity even though they need more. Focus on states that are backwards in comparison and help them build capacity to meet the demand, ” said Dr Jacob John, former head, virology department, CMC Vellore.Frieden adds in his op-ed that the data would help serve as “an early warning system” about potential outbreaks or flare-ups; help improve “turnaround time of tests”; provide information on “size, lethality and status of control of every outbreak”; and make the system accountable for “how many health care workers have been infected each week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-call-for-national-database-on-coronavirus/story-gtk0VU9B1puqizWCaOd8DJ.html
23-07-2020||India||AAP leaders seek Tripura CM’s resignation||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday put forward a Jat and a Sikh leader from their fold to demand the resignation of Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb over comments that triggered outrage among members of both communities.At an event at the Agartala Press Club on Sunday, Deb said that every community in India has “certain characteristics”. He averred that while Bengalis could not be challenged on intelligence, those from Punjabi and Jat communities are known for their physical strength but have “less brains”. Deb later apologised for his comments.Delhi’s revenue and transport minister Kailash Gahlot and AAP’s Jat leader from Najafgarh area and Tilak Nagar MLA Jarnail Singh on Wednesday asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) what action was taken against Deb.“I ask Dushyant Chautala, you’re also a Jat, if you’re feeble-minded or mad, then how did you become Haryana’s deputy chief minister? Chautala should also ask for Tripura CM Biplab Deb’s resignation. We demand Biplab Deb’s resignation. Insult of Jats won’t be tolerated,” Gahlot said.Dushyant Chautala, the chief of the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), is running a coalition government in Haryana with the BJP. Jarnail Singh asked if the BJP has sent a notice to Deb or taken any action. “If they have not done anything that will mean that the BJP agrees with such regressive thought,” he said.On Wednesday, the Delhi assembly’s committee for peace and harmony held a meeting to review the complaints received against the Tripura chief minister.“After the careful examination of the complaints and impugned remarks, it has been prima facie found that these statements are inflammatory, unacceptable by any set of community standards. The committee noted that the impugned remarks are highly unbecoming of a chief minister,” the committee’s chairman Raghav Chadha RP Singh, national general secretary of the BJP who is also the party’s Sikh leader, said the AAP is dragging the issue despite Deb apologising for his remarks. “Deb has already apologised for his comments and people of both the communities have accepted it as well. So, the matter is long resolved. The AAP is unnecessarily dragging the issue to keep itself relevant in the media,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-leaders-seek-tripura-cm-s-resignation/story-cltw2ThCjwkY3Km3XljTeL.html
23-07-2020||India||Assam gas well: 3 foreign experts sustain burns||GUWAHATI: The efforts to plug a blowout of a natural gas well, which has been on fire since June 9 in Assam’s Tinuskia, suffered a setback on Wednesday afternoon when three foreign experts sustained burn injuries while they were working to control the fire.The gas well, which is owned by Oil India Limited (OIL) and is located at Baghjan, suffered a blowout (a sudden and uncontrolled release of gas or oil) on May 27 and caught fire two weeks later, killing two firefighters and destroying over a dozen houses in the area.While some reports said there was a blast near the gas well, OIL denied it. “There was no blast at the site as is being reported. The foreign experts and another person working at the site sustained minor burn injuries while trying to cap the well. They are all out of danger,” said OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika. An official, who spoke to PTI on condition of anonymity, said on-ground reports suggested there was a blast and its scale and nature were being ascertained.An environmental researcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “...A loud sound was heard.”The experts have been taken to a hospital at Dibrugarh, Oil India Limited’s senior manager, public affairs, Jayanata Bormudoi, said. The three experts injured on Wednesday, Anthony Steven Reynolds, Craig Neil Duncan and Doug Dallas, are from Alert Disaster Control, a Singapore-based firm engaged in plugging the blowout.A blowout that began in the oilfield on May 27 led to the uncontrollable flow of oil from gas well 5 – causing extensive damage to biodiversity and wildlife the region, according to a preliminary report on the environmental damage caused by the incident. The wildlife in the region includes, among several other species, the endangered hoolock gibbons and the Gangetic dolphins.According to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, the incident took place when the foreign experts hired by OIL were removing a spool from the well head — a task performed before installing a blowout preventer (BOP) to cap the fire. Work at the site was called off for the day after the incident.“The experts were provided immediate medical attention by doctor at well site and later on, they were taken to burn unit section of Astha Nursing Home at Dibrugarh. They have been released after dressing of the burn injuries. It is expected that operations will resume at Baghjan on Thursday,” OIL said in a statement.Work on capping the well was at an advanced stage when the incident took place. According to OIL, tasks such as excavation of ramps and cellar have been completed and the equipment to cap the well is ready. “Constant water umbrella, dewatering of ramp/cellar works were being carried out to provide a safe working space for personnel (involved in capping the well),” the OIL statement said.“The well control operation continues and capping of the well is expected shortly,” OIL tweeted.Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan took stock of the situation and wished speedy recovery to the three foreign experts. There are 17 oil wells and five gas wells in the Baghjan oil field, Baghjan oil field generates 1,200 kilolitres of crude oil per day and 1.5 to 2 million metric standard cubic metres per day of gas. OIL supplies crude oil to several refineries including Digboi refineries in Assam, it also supplies gas to various power companies and fertiliser companies and 400+ tea estates according to OIL.A preliminary report on the damage, by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) found that oil had leaked into the principal stream of Lohit river, polluting the water and the adjoining Maguri-Motapung wetland. “The toxic fumes and oil coating have universally affected flora and fauna. The contaminants and oil are continuing to be released and immediate steps are needed to contain this spill over. The toxins released are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments,” the report said.The well had a blowout during a work to extract gas from a new depth. While efforts were underway to control the blowout, the well caught fire and damaged houses located nearby. Nearly 2,000 families were evacuated from the area, with many of them residing in relief camps.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered the formation of an expert committee last month to probe the blowout and subsequent fire and assess the damage caused to human life, wildlife and environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-gas-well-3-foreign-experts-sustain-burns/story-cxRrglXF5fcRvU1cQkgKBJ.html
23-07-2020||India||SC rules out physical hearings for now, to take a call in 4 weeks||Resumption of normal court proceedings could jeopardise the health of those who will attend them including judges and lawyers, Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde said on Wednesday, hinting that physical hearings at the Supreme Court might not resume for the time being. The CJI also said a seven-judge administrative committee will decide in four weeks whether or not regular hearings can restart.The remarks were made during hearings of two separate matters including a petition filed by Bar Council of India (BCI) highlighting the financial crunch faced by lawyers after the shutdown of courts due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The other matter relates to the reservation in promotions.“Resumption of normal court proceedings jeopardizes all those who attend Court - judges, lawyers and all those who attend court. Medical advice is to not start resumption of Court immediately. Nonetheless, we find it is not possible to ignore the plight of lawyers,” the CJI said while hearing the BCI case.The court then took up suo motu a case for extending financial assistance to lawyers and issued notices to all high court and the Supreme Court Bar associations to examine the feasibility of setting up a relief fund to support the deserving lawyers.“We issue notice to all recognized HC [high court] and SC [Supreme Court] Bar Associations to show cause why a fund for relief of deserving and eligible lawyers should not be set up and further to enable them to invite donations from own members or legitimate sources,” the court said.Notices were also issued to the Centre and high courts.Later in the day, while hearing the case on the reservation, lawyers appearing in the matter requested the CJI to hear the case in open court and not via videoconferencing. The CJI then said the seven-judge committee will review the situation to take a call on whether or not physical hearing should resume.The Supreme Court has been hearing cases via videoconferencing since March 23 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic that has necessitated social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rules-out-physical-hearings-for-now-to-take-a-call-in-4-weeks/story-IrJyCHD1BjEAznbxIakA6I.html
23-07-2020||India||CAG ensured efficiency in govt ops: Naidu||Vice president M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday lauded the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), saying its reports have led to changes in the regulatory framework, governance structures, and delivery mechanism and thereby ensured efficiency and effectiveness of the government’s operations. “Today, the CAG has evolved as an enabler to Babasaheb’s [Bhimrao Ambedkar] vision that not only ensures public financial accountability but also acts as a friend, philosopher and guide of the executive,” he said while unveiling Ambedkar’s statue at the CAG office in New Delhi.He said Ambedkar, as the Constitution’s architect, is one of the builders of the modern India, which mandates the CAG to promote accountability, transparency and good governance through high-quality auditing and accounting and provide independent assurance to stakeholders, the legislature, the executive and the public, that public funds are being used efficiently and for the intended purposes.He said although the history of the audit department is almost 160-year-old, it was the Constitution that proved catalytic in transforming this organisation of the colonial era into the CAG of India as an independent pillar of Indian parliamentary democracy. “Today CAG is a strong and credible institution and the credit for this must go to the framers of our Constitution, particularly to Dr Ambedkar, who had the vision to ensure independence and wide mandate to the CAG.”He said Ambedkar’s life and work have inspired the nation. Naidu added it is heartening to see that the core values of the CAG—independence, objectivity, integrity, reliability, professional excellence, transparency and positive approach—draw inspiration from Ambedkar’s life and work.“For all the citizens of India, the Constitution remains a sacred book and a guiding beacon on all matters. We should salute the constitution-framers for their vision and statesmanship in giving us a constitution that laid a strong foundation for our parliamentary democracy and stood the test of times.”Naidu said house members should “question themselves if they had acted to enhance the dignity of the institution or to the contrary at the end of each day during the session and if their conduct was ethical during the inter-session period”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cag-ensured-efficiency-in-govt-ops-naidu/story-OY4rK8yNpmyoGBKrgg1ZnN.html
23-07-2020||India||Focus on resolving India-US trade issues: Jaishankar||India and the United States (US) should resolve their pending trade problems and “move on to something bigger” on the economic front by focusing on areas such as innovation and technology, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday.On the geo-political front, the minister said that the US has to learn to “work with a more multi-polar world with more plurilateral arrangements” and “go beyond the alliances which it has grown up [with] over the last two generations”, and suggested that India and the US together can shape the world. Jaishankar made the remarks during a discussion at the India Ideas Summit organised by the US India Business Council (USIBC). Speaking on the theme “Leading in times of crisis: Perspectives on US-India cooperation”, the minister side-stepped a question from the moderator, former US national security advisor Stephen Hadley, on whether the two countries should work towards a free trade agreement and noted that their discussions on trade in the last few years were dominated by “complaints”.It is in the mutual interest of both sides to resolve pending problems and “move on to something bigger”, Jaishankar said. There is a much bigger connect between the two countries beyond trade, as they are already working together on issues such as maritime security, counter-terrorism, connectivity, how to respond to pandemics, and climate change. Jaishankar, however, noted that going beyond the exchange of goods and a better investment climate and working together on innovation and technology will set the relationship apart. There is a need for “convergence on the big picture”, he added. “I would give a lot of emphasis to resolving our trade problems [and] take the journey into a higher gear than it has been before. I do believe it’s very possible,” he said.India and the US were unable to work out a mini trade deal before President Donald Trump’s visit in February due to differences on issues such as market access, tariffs and the data localisation policy. Pointing to the need for the US to go beyond the alliances it has forged over the decades, Jaishankar said: “We have the ability today, by working together, to shape the world.” He added the two sides can strengthen their bilateral agenda while shaping the larger global agenda.In the field of trade too, Jaishankar said, emerging and established players have different concerns amid the rebalancing of the global economy. While established players want the continuation of their advantages, they should be willing to accommodate the legitimate concerns of emerging players, he said.“That harmonisation, how well we do that, is very important,” he said.Jaishankar also noted the important of people-to-people contacts, saying the Indian American community in the US had grown from 3,000 in 1947 to more than four million. The community has added a new quality to the relationship and created bonding between the two societies that was centred round talent in economy, innovation and technology, he said. His remarks come in the wake of visa restrictions imposed by the US administration which substantially affect Indians. Senator Mark Warner, who also participated in the discussion, highlighted the need to increase both trade and defence cooperation. He said the international leadership is being threatened by an aggressive Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping. This threat is now playing out in the sphere of 5G, where Chinese standards, rules and protocols are dominating, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-resolving-india-us-trade-issues-jaishankar/story-MbQMlUR84R5OccmJdK8ugJ.html
23-07-2020||India||All digital platforms must be responsive to nations: Prasad||Union information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad called for digital platforms to be responsive, accountable and sensitive to the concerns of sovereign nations as far as safety, defence and privacy is concerned.Prasad raised the issue on Wednesday during the G20 Digital Minister’s Meet hosted by Saudi Arabia. His comments come in the backdrop of India’s ban on 59 mostly Chinese web and mobile applications including TikTok and UC browser due to security concerns.“In view of these concerns, the digital platforms having presence in many countries must become trustworthy, safe and secure. It is time to acknowledge that digital platforms anywhere in the world have to be responsive and accountable towards the sovereign concerns of countries including defence, privacy and security of citizens,” Prasad was quoted as saying by a press statement.China’s digital minister Miao Wei was also in attendance at the virtual meeting. India’s ban on the popular applications came in the aftermath of deadly border clashes with in the eastern Ladakh Sector in June this year, where 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers were killed. According to Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) officials familiar with the developments, neither China nor India took up the issue directly. “However, the minister did convey to all present at it is the right of a country to protect the data of its citizens,” a MEITY official told HT. Prasad also raised other data security issues and said that data must belong to the sovereign nation concerned. “Digital economy must go hand in hand with the Data economy. We need to acknowledge the sovereignty over data. Data must belong to the sovereign nation concerned, to protect also the privacy concern of its people,” Prasad added.Prasad also asserted that a robust data protection law would soon be passed in India. The concerned bill is still pending in Parliament. According to Internet Freedom Foundation trustee Apar Gupta, the minister mentioning a robust data protection policy was a positive step.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-digital-platforms-must-be-responsive-to-nations-prasad/story-mKJIApqsP5PRzTndH6xjTL.html
23-07-2020||India||Former judge to head Vikas Dubey probe panel, says SC||The Supreme Court approved on Wednesday the Uttar Pradesh government’s draft notification to appoint former top court judge BS Chauhan as the head of a three-member inquiry commission to look into the killing of eight policemen as well as the subsequent deaths of gangster Vikas Dubey and five of his alleged associates. The top court’s bench, headed by chief justice SA Bobde, directed that the inquiry commission should start functioning within a week and the probe be concluded within two months. Former high court judge Shashi Kant Agarwal and retired director general of police of Uttar Pradesh KL Gupta.The bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said: “Both the July 2/3 incident (when Dubey and his men allegedly killed eight policemen) and the July 10 incident when Dubey was killed have to be touched upon. The first was the motive for the second incident.”The commission’s probe will also examine how Dubey got bail/parole despite being accused in over 64 criminal cases. “We consider this as the single most important factor that this incident happened,” the judges said.In a hearing on Monday, the chief justice said giving bail/parole to Dubey reflected “failure of the institution” when such a man ought to have remained behind bars.On July 3, Dubey and his men gunned down a deputy superintendent of police and seven other cops who were attempting to arrest him. In a dramatic week that followed, Dubey went underground while several of his men were killed in police encounters. He was detained in a town in Madhya Pradesh on July 9. On July 10, while being brought back to Kanpur, he was killed in what police described as escape attempt following an accident of the car Dubey was in. The commission will hold its sittings in Lucknow and the government has to set it up within a week, providing it space and all secretarial assistance.A clutch of PILs filed before the court raised doubts over the July 12 decision of the UP government to appoint a one-man commission of justice Shashi Kant Agarwal to conduct the investigation. The action of the state government to pick justice Chauhan was objected to by one of the petitioners Ghanshyam Upadhyay, a lawyer practicing in Mumbai. The CJI shot back: “Even I would have chosen justice Chauhan.” It was the court that suggested the UP government choose a judge from the state. A similar enquiry ordered into an encounter in Telangana in December 2019 came to a halt since lockdown restrictions prevented members of the enquiry panel to travel or meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-judge-to-head-vikas-dubey-probe-panel-says-sc/story-Ge3UyLjn9fbXxiMP1giGnN.html
23-07-2020||India||Security agencies red-flag firms with connection to Chinese govt||Faced with a belligerent People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in East Ladakh, Indian security agencies have red-flagged the penetration of companies believed to have ties with the Chinese government in critical sectors, particularly telecommunications, higher education, and power supply and distribution. While the government remains tight-lipped over the issue, it is understood that last week, the senior-most bureaucrats of the critical ministries met on directions from the top leadership to understand the extent of this penetration. Senior officials of security agencies sensitized the officers on the issue, and the government has since issued verbal instructions to various departments to prevent this intrusion, HT learns. Also Read: The Middle Kingdom’s rush of blood and the need for strong Indian deterrenceTwo core areas highlighted in the presentation made by the security agencies were education and telecommunications. In education, under the garb of cultural promotion, Indian universities and colleges have tied up with their Chinese counterparts through Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), often without the requisite clearance of the designated authority — in this case, the Ministry of External Affairs or the Human Resource Development ministry. A classic example in this are the Chinese-government funded Confucius Institutes to promote Han Chinese language and culture — typicality set up in association with a local partner institution. The other area of serious concern is telecommunications, where private sector companies have preferred cheaper Chinese infrastructure for mobile and internet telephony. Sure, this isn’t unique to India, but security agencies fear that Beijing has made serious inroads into this sector. There have even been allegations that large tenders are sometimes designed to suit the Chinese companies. These concerns aren’t new. But many have been amplified in recent months, especially after relations between India and China took a turn for the worse following Beijing’s aggression in East Ladakh. Some departments acted immediately. Also Read: India bans TikTok, other Chinese appsFor instance, the Department of Telecommunications, last month, asked BSNL to tweak its tender to exclude Chinese equipment makers from a large 4G upgrade project. And the power ministry, on July 2 already issued a detailed order where all equipment, components and parts imported for use in the power supply system and network will be tested in the country to check for any kind of embedded malware/trojans/cyber threat and adherence to Indian standards.The order states that power is a strategic and critical sector that supports not only India’s national defence, vital emergency services and critical national infrastructure but also the entire economy and the day to day life. “Any danger or threat to power supply system can have catastrophic effects and has the potential to cripple the entire country,” said the order, a copy of which has been seen by HT. Also Read: China’s Xi Jinping is a successor to dictator Joseph Stalin: US NSA O’BrienIn order to protect the security, reliability and integrity of the system, the ministry has decided that all testing of equipment for use certification will only be done by laboratories designated by it.

23-07-2020||India||Monsoon belt receives deficient rain in July; north, central India still dry||Monsoon rains in July haven’t been as bountiful as they were in June mainly because of the monsoon trough (line of low pressure) moving towards the Himalayan foothills repeatedly, leaving many parts of northwest and central India dry this month, according to data from the India Meteorological Department. Until July 22, northwest India has a deficiency of -16% and northeast India has a surplus of 16%, contrary to what was predicted in June. IMD, in its long range forecast issued on June 1 forecast that northwest India is expected to receive excess monsoon rain at 107% of the long period average; Central India is likely to get 103% of LPA while south peninsula and northeast India area likely to receive 102% and 96% of LPA respectively with a model error of 8% (+/-). IMD scientists said these trends could change over the next few months, adding that the main reason for this deviation is an unusually calm Bay of Bengal. At least four to six low pressure systems form over the Bay of Bengal in the monsoon months, bringing rain over the core monsoon region—mainly central India.“There has been no low-pressure systems over Bay of Bengal since June 21. There has been only one low pressure system this monsoon until now. Low pressure systems during the monsoon pull all moisture leaving the north-eastern region dry. These systems then bring a lot of rain along the core monsoon zone,” said DS Pai, senior scientist, IMD Pune. “The western Pacific is also unusually calm, there have been no typhoons there. This could be due to year on year variability.”“Low pressure systems are the main rain producing systems during the monsoon. Their formation depends on monsoon dynamics such as interaction of south-westerly and easterly winds,” added RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.“We haven’t seen any low-pressure system forming possibly because the Bay of Bengal is not as warm. These low-pressure systems move along the monsoon trough bringing rain in east, central, northwest India. Between July 27 and 29 there is likely to be a major confluence of south westerly and easterly winds which can bring a lot of rain in the Indo-Gangetic Plains from UP to the northeast accentuating floods once again in Bihar and northeast,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Skymet Weather. The Centre will soon release Rs 346 crore as an initial amount for handling the flood situation in Assam, an official statement by the central government said.Followed by a discharge of around 3.50 lakh cusecs of water from the Valmikinagar barrage in Nepal, water from an aggravated Gandak river early on Wednesday morning inundated low-lying areas of Bagaha, Gopalganj and Vaishali in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-belt-receives-deficient-rain-in-july-north-central-india-still-dry/story-8JfqtNVN8zmhRNczrUQqFK.html

MOP is a restricted commodity for export under the foreign trade policy.The customs department’s investigation report, reviewed by HT, states that Agrasain Gehlot’s company – M/s Anupam Krishi – allegedly played a key role in the irregularities. The MOP was exported to companies in Malaysia and Singapore, an official said on condition of anonymity.The DRI, too, launched an investigation in the matter in 2012-13 which, an official said, was completed recently. Following this, ED registered a money laundering case, the official added.The searches come at a time when CM Gehlot is locked in a political battle with Sachin Pilot, who has been ousted from the posts of the deputy chief minister and the state Congress president. The customs probe report states that Agrasain Gehlot “knowingly opted to become a part of the syndicate in the entire chain of conspiracy by facilitating the said consortium (of private companies) by supplying subsidized MOP, which was meant for sale to farmers only and forged documents for which he admittedly gained certain amount as his commission”.ED raided a total of 13 places in Rajasthan, Delhi, West Bengal and Rajasthan in connection with the case. ED and the income tax department are also investigating Ashok Gehlot’s son Vaibhav Gehlot in connection with his links with a hotelier. IT teams, on July 13, searched several premises in Rajasthan and Mumbai belonging to three business groups including the hotelier’s on charges of tax evasion and recovered around ~12 crore in cash. Premises linked to two state Congress leaders were also searched. CM Gehlot has said that there are attempts to destabilise the government in Rajasthan.Reacting to the ED raids on Wednesday, the Congress said the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership in Delhi created a “raid raj” and was using federal agencies to arm-twist lawmakers to bring down the Ashok Gehlot governmentCongress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala, who has been camping in Jaipur to help the Gehlot government survive a rebellion led by Pilot, said the latest round of ED raids were ordered by the BJP leadership after three previous attempts to arm-twist Congress leaders and lawmakers did not succeed||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-raids-cm-s-brother-on-money-laundering-charge-cong-hits-out/story-usoS2Itcsp2HzEMhXW1q4H.html
23-07-2020||India||No breakthrough in de-escalating border tension despite military, diplomatic talks||India and China have lately failed to make a breakthrough in reducing border tensions in the sensitive Ladakh sector despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels, and the disengagement process at some points of the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) has virtually halted, people familiar with recent developments on this front said on Wednesday. The stalemate comes after top Indian and Chinese military commanders held talks on July 14 to discuss the road map for disengagement between their forces. The ground situation remains unchanged in the sector where both armies have amassed almost 100,000 soldiers in their forward and depth areas, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named.Also Read: Twin naval exercises with US supercarriers signal QUAD has arrived“There has been no forward movement in the disengagement of troops in friction areas along the LAC including Pangong Tso and Depsang. The overall de-escalation of conflict is a long way off,” said a second official, who did not wish to be named. He said the conflict was likely to stretch into to the winter months and the Indian armed forces were prepared for a long haul.Defence minister Rajnath Singh indicated last week that the negotiations to resolve tensions were complex. During a visit to Ladakh, he said progress in negotiations should help resolve the border dispute but added that he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved.”The disengagement process has barely made progress after the last round of meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders on July 14. Also Read: With Xi Jinping Centre On Diplomatic Thought, Chinese President is the new MaoOn Wednesday, Singh asked the air force to stay prepared for any eventuality while addressing top commanders. Experts said the situation was complicated and there was no quick fix.“The ball is in India’s court. The Chinese would be happy with status quo as they are already sitting in what we consider to be Indian territory. They have only carried out minimal disengagement. The government now needs to start thinking what to do next to break the deadlock,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).Also Read: How PM Modi called China’s bluff in Ladakh, writes Shishir GuptaIndia has moved three extra army divisions, fighter jets, several squadrons of frontline tanks, additional artillery and fully-ready mechanised infantry squads to the Ladakh sector as part of its efforts to strengthen deployments in response to Chinese military build-up.The build-up on both sides includes fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems.The Indian Air Force could also deploy its new Rafale fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, officials previously indicated to HT.India and China remain committed to “complete disengagement” which is an “intricate process” and “requires constant verification”, the Indian Army said in a statement last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-breakthrough-in-de-escalating-border-tension-despite-military-diplomatic-talks/story-CqMXymeWx2YpQlaTyIeisL.html
23-07-2020||India||Air Force ready to counter aggressive action: IAF chief||With disengagement between Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh turning out to be a challenging and sluggish process, Indian Air Force chief RKS Bhadauria on Wednesday asserted that the IAF was poised to counter any aggressive action by the neighbour even as defence minister Rajnath Singh asked the air force to stay prepared for any eventuality while addressing top commanders.Singh said the swift deployment of the air force’s assets at forward locations in response to the current situation in eastern Ladakh “sent a strong message” to the adversary. He was addressing the IAF’s top brass on the opening day of a three-day commanders’ conference.In his address, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria stressed on the need to focus on “the ability to handle situations at a short notice” to ensure a robust response.The defence minister last week said the progress in negotiations with China should help resolve the border dispute but he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved”, underlining the complex nature of the disengagement process along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).The disengagement process has barely made any progress after the last round of meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders on July 14, an official said on condition of anonymity.Addressing top IAF commanders, the minister said the military needs to stay prepared for a collusive threat from China and Pakistan, people familiar with the developments said. The military is keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict.The minister said the professional manner in which IAF conducted air strikes against a terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot last year, and the rapid deployment of IAF assets at forward locations in Ladakh sent a strong message to India’s adversaries.Bhadauria said the IAF was fully prepared to counter short-term as well as strategic threats, and its units were “evenly poised” to counter any aggressive action by the adversary.“The minister’s exhortation to the IAF to stay prepared for any eventuality has great importance in the present security environment. Air power has become the primary instrument of deterrence now and, as the IAF chief said, the air force would rise to the occasion if it comes to a shooting war,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.The defence minister said the country’s resolve to defend its sovereignty stood firm on the faith its people had in the military’s capability. He praised the IAF’s “proactive response” in bolstering its operational capabilities during the last few months, and assured the commanders that all requirements of the armed forces would be met.The conference is taking place days ahead of the IAF inducting its first batch of five Rafale fighter jets imported from France at the Ambala air base on July 29.The IAF could deploy its new Rafale fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, where Indian and Chinese forces were locked in a tense border confrontation for weeks before a protracted process of disengagement began and is still ongoing.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to plug gaps in the IAF’s combat capabilities.The possible deployment of Rafale fighters in Ladakh could be discussed at the commanders’ conference where the air force brass is expected to focus on the border row with China, the IAF’s preparedness and new purchases that have to be made fast.In the Ladakh sector, the IAF is projecting its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters and multi-mission choppers getting airborne regularly for demanding missions from a forward base in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-force-ready-to-counter-aggressive-action-iaf-chief/story-o9yEVL2xwShSGBNmfeU6JO.html

23-07-2020||India||Villages are not as they are shown on screen, says the man behind Panchayat||Inspired by classic Doordarshan shows like ‘Malgudi Days’, ‘Potli Baba Ki’, ‘Swami’, ‘Tenali Rama’, director Deepak Mishra conceptualised the hit series ‘Panchayat’. “Shows like those from our childhood are no longer made. We wanted to make a relatable show and refresh the rural connection of our Indian audience. So, we did extensive research and the connection of my writer Chandan Kumar and mine, with our villages, gave us the edge,” said the Varanasi lad.Initially, they were making it as ‘SDO Saheb’ but later switched to a panchayat setting. “We wanted to show realism. Usually, villagers are portrayed as ‘bhole-bhale’ log (simple people), who are ignorant and are shown in a very strange way. People raised fingers saying that our story was slow, takes time to sink in, and without any action, or a leading lady. But my writer and I were clear that we wanted to show a village in 2020 and probably the audience liked that realism. ”“Today’s rural youth is watching YouTube on mobile, they make TikTok videos, on ‘khaprail’ (clay-tiled) roofs they have dish antennas, flat screen TVs are fitted on mud walls...so it’s a different world now!”It was his UP connection that he set the show in Ballia. “My writer is from Patna, we shot it in MP but we set it in a village in UP East. Besides, we wanted to shoot the contrast between Noida and a desolate village.”After studying in Varanasi till Class 12, he studied mechanical engineering at IIT-Mumbai. “Our drama society fuelled my interest towards acting, dramatics and direction. We did plays in collaboration with Prithvi Theatre. Then, I met TVF founder Arunabh Kumar and that’s how we got associated. I kept learning and nurturing my interest in editing, scripting, direction and acting.”Mishra did some shorts (sketches) and later directed ‘Permanent Roomates-2’ and ‘Humorously Yours-2’. As an actor, he did ‘Rowdies,’ a spoof on ‘Roadies’, where he played Raghu Ram’s role, a broker in ‘Permanent Roommates’, and in its second season, he played a dumb cab driver.He feels that IIT helped him a lot in pursuing this art form. “Being a small-town boy, I would not have known all this, had I not gone to IIT-Mumbai. More than the subjects, they teach us how to live, perseverance, fighting attitude, learning from mistakes and moving ahead. Our field is a beautiful combination of art and science. Since I knew the technical aspects of film-making, it made things a lot easier.”The second season of Panchayat is now being scripted. “It’s in a nascent stage. After a successful series there is always high expectation from the second series. So, we don’t wish to hurry anything. Besides, crime-thrillers also interest me but I will do it in a different manner.”His family has now shifted to Lucknow. “They live in Gomti Nagar and whenever I come to the state capital, we go to Varanasi,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/villages-are-not-as-they-are-shown-on-screen-says-the-man-behind-panchayat/story-6oOrmwfK8RUnS0NJNU9WBI.html
