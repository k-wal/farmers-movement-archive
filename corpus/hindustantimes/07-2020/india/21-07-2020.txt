The mine was leased by a labourer who does odd jobs to earn a living.Thirty five-year-old Anandilal Kushwaha owns the lease of the 8m X 8m shallow mine in Ranipura area of the district where the diamond was found, according to the officer. Usually, such a shallow diamond mine of 64 square metres is awarded on a lease for Rs 200 for six months, as per the officer.Mineral resources department officer at Panna, RK Pandey said, “Anandilal Kushwaha deposited the 10.69 carat diamond to our office and it may fetch about Rs 50 lakh when it is auctioned in the coming days.”He said, “The quality of the diamond is good and it is palm shaped which will require less cutting. A royalty tax of 11.5% and 1% TDS will be deducted from the amount of money received through the auction.”This is the second time that Kushwaha has found a diamond in his mine.“I was excited to have this diamond during Covid time and lockdown restrictions. It’s all due to God’s grace. This is the second time when I have found a diamond but earlier the size of the diamond I had dug up on July 14 was 70-cent.”Kushwaha had engaged eight other people to help him dig the mine. He said that he will distribute the money from the auction of the diamond equally among everyone.“Though the (lease of the) mine was awarded to me, I will distribute the amount fetched from auction of the diamond equally among all nine of us as it was our collective efforts in the past six months that we could get such a precious stone. I will spend the money on the education of my son and daughter and other requirements of the family. But one thing is certain that I will continue to apply for lease of mines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/labourer-digs-out-10-69-carat-diamond-worth-rs-50-lakh-from-shallow-mine-in-mp-s-panna/story-yaUjr3wGrOMQ5Xi53ssGGI.html

21-07-2020||India||Three students who wrote Kerala engineering entrance exam test positive||Three students who wrote the Kerala Engineering Architecture and Medical (KEAM) entrance examination have tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday even as the opposition slammed chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for ignoring their warning and conducting the examination.Two of the infected students are from Thiruvananthapuram and the third is from Kozhikode in north Kerala. A parent also tested positive in the state capital. But the CM downplayed it saying desperate opposition was trumping up issues to put the state’s Coved-19 record in a bad light. He said there was no need to worry in this regard.At least 88,000 students had appeared for the KEAM examination on July16 in the midst of lockdown in many areas. Many opposition leaders including Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor had requested the government to postpone it in view of the pandemic situation but the CM rejected them citing the earlier instances of holding SSLC and higher secondary examinations. Also Read: UAE consulate’s charity handout puts Kerala minister under scanner in gold smuggling caseAfter the examination, photos and videos of large crowds of students and parents had appeared on social media and many took a dig at the government for conducting such an examination where social distancing could not be observed despite the state capital being under lockdown.“The CM takes everything personally and is adamant on his stand. We all pleaded considering the impending danger but he ignored our pleas. We wish he could have heard our pleas,” said Congress leader P C Vishnunath. Meanwhile, the state has reported 720 new cases of coronavirus, taking the total to 13,994. Out of these, 8,056 are active cases and 5,892 have recovered. With one more death, total casualties went up to 45. Among the 720 new cases, 528 are locally- transmitted ones, including 17 among the health workers and six among the paramilitary personnel, said the CM, adding there was a concerted bid to portray the state’s good work in a bad light.“Our main concern is to limit the damage and save as many lives as possible in trying times. But some people are out to sabotage it. They are quite intolerant towards the recognition the state is earning,” he said.He asked the opposition to spell out its contribution in six-month’s fight against the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-students-who-wrote-kerala-engineering-entrance-exam-test-positive/story-GOplZv3XFTpXcNUMpp3hOO.html

Except, the package is not an ordinary one. The box has seven small containers inside, each carrying the precious breast milk of Wangdus’ wife for their newborn, who underwent a complex life-saving surgery recently at a private hospital here. The boy was born through a C-section on June 16 at Sonam Nurboo Memorial Hospital in Leh and 30-year-old Dorjey Palmo found out that her baby was unable to suckle when she tried to feed him. “I was in Mysore when my family in Leh contacted me and my Guruji’s family members, who are doctors, suggested sending the baby immediately to Delhi or Chandigarh at a bigger hospital. So, my wife’s brother, Jigmat Gyalpo, took a flight from Leh and brought my child to Delhi on June 18 morning,” Wangdus said. Wangdus, who works as a manager in an educational institution in Mysore, took a flight too and reached early morning on the same day. Leh and Delhi are 1000-km apart by road and a direct flight takes one hour and 15 minutes. “I only once took my child in my hands when he was two days old. I didn’t touch him much because I had travelled from Karnataka and there was so much Covid scare. My brother-in-law carried him,” he told PTI. Upon landing at the Delhi airport, the baby was rushed by his father and uncle to the Max hospital, Shalimar Bagh in an ambulance and was admitted to its NICU (neonatal intensive care unit), hospital authorities said. At Max hospital, Dr Harshwardhan, Principal Consultant, Paediatric Department, diagnosed the baby with tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, which he said, is not very uncommon, but affects about “three in every thousand children”. Basically, in this condition, the child’s food pipe and trachea were connected, and it was unable to feed. When the child was brought to our nursery, the baby also had a respiratory infection “so we had to stabilise him first,” he said. “We conducted the surgery, lasting about three hours, the next day and it was a complex surgery, considering the baby was just four-days-old. But, the surgery was successful,” he said. The doctor said the baby was kept in NICU for three days and fed through nose via a tube, when he suggested the father about the need of mother’s milk. Wangdus said his friends at Leh airport, a very generous private airline which ferried the box free of cost every day, and “good-hearted passengers” helped the family in getting a daily supply of the mother’s milk from Leh to Delhi to fortify the baby who was recovering from the surgery. “My wife was unable to travel to Delhi due to the coronavirus scare and therefore we had to manage in this manner,” he said. “From end of June, this has been our routine, and on alternate days, I and my brother-in-law, go to Delhi’s T3 terminal and wait eagerly for the box, which have our contact numbers on it,” he said. “Today, my brother-in-law collected it, and my wife will keep sending the milk till our last day in Delhi,” the father said. Each box has seven containers, of 60 ml capacity each, and every day the boxes are also returned to Leh for refill the next day, Wangdus added. An emotionally overwhelmed father, said, his gurus in Bangalore were sending blessings every day for his well-being and “so many good souls have helped us through this journey in this difficult time. “Two days ago, my Guruji named my child Rigzin Wangchuk. Our flight tickets are booked for Friday, and we all will be going home finally,” he said. Wangdus said the baby’s mother, who works in the Revenue Department in Leh, is on maternity leave and eagerly waiting to hold her child back in her arms. “Every day, she was sending not just her milk for the newborn, which is needed for his healthy growth, but also her love for her child, from 1000 km away. I am happy, my baby is alright now,” he said. Max hospital, Shalimar Bagh is a dedicated Covid-19 facility and Dr Harshvardhan said, the baby was brought to the nursery section of the hospital which has no coronavirus cases. “Post-surgery, we also ran a COVID test on the baby just to be sure, and it came negative. We are very happy that the healthy baby will now be reunited with her mother on Friday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/journey-of-1000-km-mother-s-milk-sent-daily-from-leh-for-newborn-in-delhi-hospital/story-Qdce59iV8qCnSXoCUBsB6H.html

21-07-2020||India||Commerce minister Piyush Goyal proposes ‘preferential trade agreement’ with the US||Commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday proposed a “preferential trade agreement” with the US covering a limited number of goods and services as the next step after the signing of a “quick” trade deal that was just a few phone “calls” away and before the conclusion of a more ambitious Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that could take years.India and the United States have been working on a limited trade deal to expressly address the more urgent issues of concern to both sides and have said they planned to start negotiations on a broader Free Trade Agreement (FTA) later in the year, either before or after US elections in November.“Another couple of calls and we should be able to sort that out,” the minister said of the deal currently under negotiations. He was participating virtually an annual summit of the US-India Business Council (USIBC, a trade body), which was to take place in New Delhi but was being held virtually in view of the Covid-19 epidemic.But as the two countries worked towards a “much more sustainable, much more robust and much more enduring” partnership in the form of an FTA, which may take years to conclude, the two sides “should also look at early harvest in the form of a preferential trade agreement”, Goyal said.It could include “may be 50, may be 100 products and services” where the two sides could engage with “mutual trust and open spirit” to “kickstart” the trade partnership, the minister added.No other details were available of this interim trade pact. But people familiar with trade talks between the two sides, which have been on a long time but with renewed urgency for the last one year, said the idea is to keep the “ball moving” by continuing to address trade issues in small and manageable and not wait for the FTA, which will be a long and tedious process.The “quick” deal, as the minister described it, has been ready and waiting to be signed, but is being held over a “frustrating” desire from the US side to “squeeze” out as much as it can.According to the same people familiar with the talks, the United States has pushed for greater market access in agriculture, dairy and medical devices sectors in the limited trade agreement being finalised. India has sought restoration of preferential trade benefits under the US Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which were terminated by the Trump administration in summer of 2019 to force India’s hand.President Donald Trump’s insistence on trade deficit reduction and reciprocity precipitated a trade crisis between the countries, bringing long simmering issues to a head. He first slapped higher tariff on steel and aluminium imports from India and then evicted India from the GSP programme, which accounted for $6.3 billion worth of Indian exports to the United States in 2018, roughly 12% of total Indian goods exports to the United States.The two sides had tried to stitch together a Phase 1 of the deal in time for announcement during Trump’s February visit to India, but failed; Indians had complained about the constant sifting of the goalpost. The two sides announcement then a plan to wrap a limited deal shortly and a larger deal later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/commerce-minister-piyush-goyal-proposes-preferential-trade-agreement-with-the-us/story-kD2wZ8rXF1ldArRKjxM9LJ.html

All the 50 wards under Tirupati municipal corporation had been affected with some wards reporting more than 40 positive cases for Covid-19,” he said.Except those catering to essential services like medical shops and milk vendors, all the other business establishments, including wine shops and banks, would remain closed. The grocery shops and vegetable markets would be allowed only from 6 to 11 am.No private vehicles, autorickshaws and public transport would be available in the town, except for those who have medical emergencies and go to the hospitals, the collector said.“We shall review the situation on July 31 and take a call as to whether to continue the lockdown or end it on August 5,” Gupta said and reminded that the recent 45-day lockdown in Srikalahasti, another pilgrim centre about 35 kilometres from Tirupati, had yielded excellent results.Strangely, the TTD authorities are yet to take a decision on the closure of the Lord Venkateshwara temple atop the Tirumala hills for darshan of the pilgrims, who cannot reach the pilgrim centre without entering Tirupati town.Tirupati municipal commissioner PS Girisha clarified that the Road Transport Corporation had arranged buses from the RTC bus stand directly to Tirumala for the sake of pilgrims, who should not move anywhere in the town. No restaurants or shops would be available for them in Tirupati.“Those coming by their own vehicles or hired vehicles should go to the hills via Tirumala bypass road and should not enter the town. They could buy food parcels in the restaurants located on the bypass road,” he said.Meanwhile, the TTD announced curtailment of darshans for pilgrims in the wake of restrictions imposed by the district authorities. Starting Tuesday, the TTD stopped offline sale of 3,000 darshan tickets which was offered to pilgrims at Bhudevi Complex located at Alipiri.“Since the entire area has now come under lockdown, the facility for direct purchase of darshan tickets has been closed till further notice,” a TTD official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirupati-a-containment-zone-shut-for-14-days-tirumala-temple-stays-open/story-czECvZ5Sr4ampmWDpifQkI.html

The private taxi, bearing a Delhi registration number plate, was returning to the national capital carrying two passengers after dropping two others at Dugadda near Kotdwar, the police said.“The incident occurred at around 2 pm, when the private taxi was heading towards Kotdwar town from Dugadda after dropping two passengers there. The vehicle’s driver is identified as Bhupender Singh, a resident of Uttarakhand’s Champawat district, but lived with his family in south Delhi’s Munirka area. He used to drive a private taxi in Delhi. On his way back, Singh picked up two passengers for Kotdwar,” said Manoj Raturi, station house officer (SHO), Kotdwar police station. “The car got swept away on the way, as the mud came down flowing at a high speed from uphill into a monsoon-fed rivulet alongside the road. Though Singh was thrown out of the car, he was rescued. Unfortunately, he succumbed to his injuries later. While the other two passengers in the car got swept away,” the SHO added.A search operation has been launched by the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) authorities along with local police personnel to trace the two missing persons, Raturi said.“The missing persons are suspected to have been swept far away from the spot, as the water current is strong. Their footwears were found at least 500 metres away from where they went missing. Perhaps, their bodies will be found after the water level goes down,” he added.In Udham Singh Nagar district, two minor boys drowned in a pond, whose water level has increased due to rainfall, on Monday while taking a bath.Kuldeep Singh Adhikari, in-charge of the ITI police station at Kashipur, said, “Two boys drowned in a pond at Paiga village in Kashipur on Monday. They have been identified as Asif Ali (13) and Robin (9).”Dr. Rajiv Chauhan of LD Bhatt Government Hospital said the minor boys were brought dead on arrival.Intermittent rains continued across the Himalayan state on Tuesday and waterlogging incidents were reported from many parts.In Haridwar district, waterlogging affected traffic movement at several places, including Chandracharya Chowk, Bhagat Singh Chowk, Sandesh Nagar Colony, Vivek Vihar, Awas Vikas, Kankhal, Jwalapur, Moti Bazaar, and parts of Ranipur.In Chamoli district, NK Joshi, district disaster management officer, said the road leading to Badrinath shrine is still blocked near Pipalkoti, a landslide-prone zone, due to falling of debris from the mountain.“Though the blockade, which was on since Monday, was partially lifted on Tuesday afternoon, the falling debris from the mountain has disrupted traffic flow again,” Joshi added.On Tuesday afternoon, India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert --- the public is urged to steer clear of potentially dangerous areas --- for the next 24-hours in five districts, including Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, and Chamoli.The IMD authorities have advised the district administrations to be on their guard and maintain a strict vigil at settlements such as people living nears banks of rivulets, streams, and landslide-prone areas.On Wednesday, heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to occur at isolated places in Uttarakhand’s Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Dehradun, Haridwar, Tehri, Pauri, and Nainital districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-dead-2-missing-as-incessant-rains-lash-uttarakhand/story-iWQCLadPHRwvnLlPezfh6H.html
21-07-2020||India||Bihar cracks whip on pvt hospitals to treat Covid-19 cases||The Bihar government Tuesday roped in private hospitals in an effort to boost the number of beds available to Covid-19 patients following a nudge by the Centre.“The government has authorised district magistrates to identify private health facilities in Covid management,” Anupam Kumar, secretary, Information and Public Relations Department, Bihar told reporters.On Monday, Patna civil surgeon Dr Raj Kishore Chaudhary had issued an order notifying 290 beds for Covid-19 patients across 18 private health facilities in the state capital.He said the government had to force the private facilities into treating Covid-19 patients as they were reluctant to do so.“The private facilities will have to treat Covid-19 patients in times of pandemic. If they do not, we will lodge FIRs against them. The government can even take over their hospitals, along with their staff and doctors and force them to treat Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Chaudhary.Hitech Emergency, GS Neuroscience (10 beds each), Arvind Hospital (13), Medical Magadh Hospital, Dr Bimal Hospital & Research Center (25 beds each), Heart Hospital (14), Murlidhar Memorial Hospital (10), Anup Institute of Orthopaedic, AS Nursing Home (4), Paras HMRI Hospital (30), Curris Hospital (18), Mahavir Vatsalya Hospital (14), Palm View Hospital, Midversal Hospital (12 each), Ruban Memorial Hospital, Patliputra Colony (40), Tara Hospital, near Gandhi Maidan (9), Buddha Cancer Centre (7) and Nestva Hospital (12) were among the 18 private centres the Patna district administration had asked to keep isolation beds for Covid-19 patients.These hospitals have 1,254 beds, with 343 ICU beds of which 72 had ventilator facilities in them, according to the order issued by the Patna civil surgeon.“As of now, we have asked private hospitals to allot 25% of their total beds for management of Covid patients. Going ahead, if need arises, we will ask them to convert the entire hospital into dedicated Covid facilities,” said Dr Chaudhary.Also read: Bodies lie in Covid-19 ward in Patna’s NMCH, a hospital without mortuaryDespite the Patna district administration having issued the order on Monday, with explicit instructions to the management of private hospitals to begin Covid-19 isolation facility with immediate effect, most of these facilities were yet to begin admitting such cases on Tuesday.In addition to better management of its healthcare facilities, a central team, which was here on Sunday and Monday, had asked the state government to increase the number of beds in view of the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases.On Tuesday, Bihar’s Covid-19 tally stood at 28,564 with a doubling rate of 12 days. If infections were to grow at this rate, Bihar would cross 1 lakh cases in less than a month, for which the state had to be prepared, the Central team had pointed out during its discussion with senior state functionaries.The Central team was also critical of the unfettered movement in Rajeev Nagar locality, which was a buffer zone, as the entire stretch between road numbers 1 and 22 had been marked as a containment zone. The team, which found lack of police personnel, and unhindered movement of vegetable vendors in the area, called for better access control in containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-cracks-whip-on-pvt-hospitals-to-treat-covid-19-cases/story-SM4s7AnaCWcCXgoKg7Y3HJ.html
21-07-2020||India||Amarnath Yatra cancelled due to Covid-19, aarti to be broadcast live||The annual Amarnath Yatra has been cancelled due to the continuous rise in Covid 19 cases across Jammu and Kashmir. Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board on Tuesday said the virtual darshan of one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimages devoted to lord Shiva will continue to be telecast live during the morning and evening prayers, which will continue at the shrine, located at a height of 13,000 feet from the sea level.“Based upon the prevailing circumstances, the Board decided with heavy heart that it is not advisable to hold and conduct this year’s Shri Amarnathji Yatra and expressed its regret to announce the cancellation of Yatra 2020,” an official spokesman of the board said.The spokesperson said that the traditional rituals shall be carried out at the shrine without any interruption“The Board is aware of and respects the sentiments of millions of devotees and to keep the religious sentiments alive, the Board shall continue the live telecast/ virtual darshan of the morning and evening Aarti,” the spokesman added.The decision was taken at the 39th board meeting of SASB, attended by the lieutenant governor Girish Chandra Murmu as its chairman and other board members.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe board discussed the Supreme Court order dated 13.07.2020, which left the decision to conduct the Yatra to the administration after assessing the ground realities prevailing in Jammu & Kashmir.The Board was informed that the arrangements were on track since February 2020, but due to the nationwide lockdown, the state executive committee of Jammu and Kashmir had decided to keep religious places closed for the public. These prohibitions continue till 31st July.The Board further discussed that the pandemic has put the health administration system to its limit as a sharp spike in new Covid cases in July has put strain on the system. Health workers and security forces are also getting infected and the focus of the entire medical, civil and police administration was on containing the pandemic.Also Read: CM lauds Uttarakhand HC’s ruling on Charm Dham BoardTheir discussions underlined that diversion of resources for the Yatra will put immense strain on administration and will unnecessarily put the yatris at risk of catching Covid-19.The board also took the views of the government into consideration. The government had reasoned against holding the Yatra this year in larger public interest.The cancellation comes despite the administration making necessary arrangements for conducting a curtailed pilgrimage through a shorter Baltal track in Ganderbal district.Various government departments and security agencies had also made all preparations to welcome the pilgrims.Last year, the Amarnath Yatra was curtailed following intelligence inputs of terror threats and violence ahead of BJP led central government’s move of abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and in 2018, the pilgrimage was held for 60 days.The Amarnath cave is considered to be one of the holiest shrines in Hinduism and hundreds of thousands of devotees undertake the arduous annual pilgrimage in south Kashmir Himalayas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarnnath-yatra-cancelled-due-to-covid-19-aarti-to-be-broadcast-live/story-OAMfJ2HODtcjCMTtni0SZM.html

21-07-2020||India||Lucknow police recover 112 stolen cars worth Rs 11 cr in month-long ops||The Lucknow police said they have seized 62 cars including luxury four-wheelers from a gang of car thieves on Tuesday, a month after they seized 50 cars from the same gang.Police said the 112 cars are worth Rs 11 crore.Twelve people, including the owners of a second-hand car sales market, motor spare parts’ traders, mechanics as well as insurance agents were arrested. The gang had been operational for at least 20 years, police said.Police officials said these stolen vehicles were sold to politicians, businessmen and other white-collar people after preparing forged papers and changing their chassis numbers and registration plates. The cars included Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Honda City, Innova, Safari and Swift Dzire.Lucknow’s Commissioner of Police (CP) Sujeet Pandey said the team led by Vibhuti Khand assistant commissioner of police Swatantra Kumar Singh recovered 62 luxury four wheelers from different places after the arrest of seven people on Tuesday.He said that earlier, five people were arrested and 50 luxury four wheelers were recovered on June 21. Interrogation of those arrested and a subsequent investigation led to Tuesday’s developments.ACP Swatantra Kumar Singh said the recovery of 112 luxury four wheelers from a vehicle lifters’ gang is the biggest catch ever in terms of number of vehicles. He said 104 four-wheelers had been recovered from a single gang by the Maharashtra police a few years ago.“The entire operation to identify and trace gang members lasted for over a month, during which electronic surveillance as well as traditional ways of ground intelligence helped unearth the entire nexus,” said the ACP.He said the gang may have sold over 2,000 stolen vehicles to different people in the past 10 years. The stolen vehicles were sold in different parts of the country and even in Nepal, the police officer said.Singh said those arrested on Tuesday included the key accused Satpal Singh, who deals in sale of stolen four-wheelers through different mediums, including second hand car sales market as well as online platforms.Among the other six were four spare parts’ traders Manoj Kumar alias Bauwa, Enamule Haq, Vikas Jasiwal alias Vicky and Zia-ul-Haq, and two persons Israr and Vinod Sharma, who work in car repairing and denting workshops.“Before selling these at throwaway prices, they changed the chassis and engine numbers of these vehicles,” the ACP explained. “The vehicle’s details were verified from the forensic lab, which confirmed that it was stolen and its engine and chassis numbers were changed,” he said.MODUS OPERANDIThe gang members first bought cars which were totally damaged in accidents and also acquired the papers of these vehicles from owners. They would then steal a car of the same make and replace its engine and chassis numbers with that of the damaged car. They also changed the identification chip of the vehicle. After making these changes, they used to sell the car to a gullible customer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lucknow-police-recover-112-stolen-cars-worth-rs-11-cr-in-month-long-ops/story-qoYW8zAm1dKAf2u2QCdumK.html
21-07-2020||India||Assam flood situation continues to remain grim, over 24 lakh people still affected||Assam’s flood situation continues to remain grim on Tuesday, as over 24 lakh people are still hit hard across the north-eastern state, which keeps a date with monsoon fury every year.Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) authorities said of the 33 districts in the state, 24 are still reeling under floods.Goalpara in lower Assam is the worst-affected, as 4.58 lakh population is estimated to have been ravaged by floods.Barpeta and Morigaon districts are the other worst-hit districts, where 3.52 lakh and 3.15 lakh population, respectively, are braving the monsoon menace.Around 44,500 people have been displaced by floodwaters and have taken shelter at 397 relief camps, where local administrations are pulling out all stops to ensure maintaining social distancing norms and other precautionary measures amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.On Tuesday, two more deaths, due to drowning, were reported from Nagaon and Morigaon districts, as the toll climbed to 85, which is significantly higher than Covid-19-related fatalities at 58 to date.Another 26 lives in the state have been lost due to landslides caused by heavy rains since May.Rescue personnel evacuated 869 stranded people by boats in nine of the flood-hit districts on Tuesday and shifted them to safer locations on higher grounds. Floodwaters have inundated cropland, measuring up to 1.10 lakh hectares (ha) across the state.ASDMA’s latest bulletin said 66 roads in six flood-affected districts are either submerged or damaged.At least six bridges have been damaged, including five and one in Darrang and Barpeta districts, respectively.Darrang is located on the north bank of the mighty Brahmaputra river, which is flowing above the danger mark, along with Dhansiri, Jia Bharali, Kopili, Beki, Gaurang, Kushiyara and Sankosh rivers, at several places, Central Water Commission (CWC) authorities said.While 90% of 430 square-kilometre Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNTPR) -- the largest habitat of one-horned rhinos in the world. – is submerged, the authorities said.So far, 116 wild animals, including nine rhinos, have drowned to death in and around the park this monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-flood-situation-continues-to-remain-grim-over-24-lakh-people-still-affected/story-OoSoWjFXbZLQMc3MtjEG5K.html
21-07-2020||India||Indian Navy to move MiG-29K fighter jets to north amid border row with China||The Indian Navy is deploying its MiG-29K fighter jets to key air force bases in the northern part of the country amid border tensions with China in the sensitive Ladakh sector, people familiar with developments said on Tuesday.The navy has a fleet of more than 40 MiG-29K fighters, of which 18 are deployed on the country’s sole aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya, and the rest are based in Goa.Some of the Russian-origin jets are being moved from Goa to Indian Air Force (IAF) bases in the north, keeping in mind the security scenario, an official said. The IAF has moved several fighters from airbases in north India to Ladakh sector as part of a plan to strengthen the military posture there, said a second official.It couldn’t immediately be ascertained what role the naval fighters would be used for.“If assets and operational pilots are available, why not utilise them,” said naval affairs expert Captain (retired) DK Sharma.The Indian Navy has been part of the military’s ongoing efforts in Ladakh sector, which has been the focus of the standoff since 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash on June 15. The navy’s P-8I maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft have been used for surveillance of Ladakh sector, while their primary role encompasses carrying out anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and surveillance and reconnaissance of the oceans. The P-8Is, imported from the US, carried out similar surveillance missions during the 2017 Doklam standoff with China.The navy has also been active in the Indian Ocean, where it is keeping a close watch on possible Chinese naval activities. On Monday, a US Navy carrier strike group, led by USS Nimitz, conducted maritime drills with Indian warships in the Indian Ocean. The passage exercise involved a total of eight Indian and US warships.The drills came at a time when tensions have mounted over China’s activities in South China Sea, where the US Navy has conducted a major exercise involving two carrier strike groups.The navy has been on operational alert in the Indian Ocean, where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. It has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communication and choke points under its mission-based deployment model, and the vessels can be diverted for any mission.Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait, and from northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-to-move-mig-29k-fighters-to-north-amid-border-row/story-yU5X9WP1VxjVHvqOuLNoYO.html
21-07-2020||India||Relationship with India important, monitoring LAC very closely: US defense secretary||At a time when China is engaging in “systematic rule-breaking” and coercion, the US sees its growing security cooperation with India as “one of the all important defence relationships of the 21st century”, US defence secretary Mark Esper said on Tuesday.The exercise in the Indian Ocean between Indian Navy warships and a US Navy carrier strike group led by the USS Nimitz reflects the shared commitment of the two countries to boost naval cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific, he said.Delivering a speech on the US strategy and vision for security in the Indo-Pacific during a virtual event organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Esper didn’t directly refer to the India-China border standoff but made numerous references to what he described as rule-breaking and coercive behaviour by Beijing, especially in South China Sea and against members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean).Also read: Indian Navy to move MiG-29K fighter jets to north amid border row with ChinaHe made a special mention of burgeoning India-US security ties, which in recent years have expanded to the 2+2 dialogue between the foreign and defence ministers and big ticket deals for defence hardware, including aircraft and missile systems.“I want to highlight our increased defence cooperation with India, one of the all important defence relationships of the 21st century,” he said. Also read: US agrees to discuss social security tax burden of Indians working in America“We conducted the first ever joint military exercise last November and as we speak today, the USS Nimitz is conducting combined exercises with the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean, demonstrating our shared commitment to stronger naval cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific.”Esper added: “We also continue to grow our defence sales and look forward to a robust 2+2 ministerial dialogue later this year to build on this progress.”On the other hand, China has continued to engage in “systematic rule-breaking, coercion and other malign activities” amid the Covid-19 crisis, while the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has engaged in “aggressive behaviour” in the East and South China Seas, including sinking a Vietnamese fishing boat, harassing Malaysian oil and gas development, and escorting Chinese fishing vessels into Malaysia’s exclusive economic zone, he said.Asked about the India-China standoff during the question-and-answer session after his speech, Esper said the US is “monitoring it very closely and what’s happening along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)”. He said the US was “very pleased to see that both sides are trying to de-escalate the situation”.In response to a separate question, Esper said the exercise between the Indian Navy and the carrier strike group led by USS Nimitz “shows the growing cooperation between our countries and our ability to project power into the region and to sustain it with our allies and partners”.The US, he noted, is encouraging Indo-Pacific nations to expand intra-regional security relationships and networks of like-minded partners. In this regard, he pointed to the logistical support agreement finalised by India and Australia in June.Esper also referred to what he said was China’s “catalogue of bad behaviour” that accompanies a pattern of disregard for international commitments, failure to uphold commitments under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and disregard for the rights of other countries under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).China, he added, had bullied Asean nations out of an estimated $2.6 trillion in potential offshore oil and gas revenues and cut off access to important fishing grounds even as it made incursions into waters around Japan’s Senkaku Islands and looked the other way as North Korea violated UN Security Council resolutions related to its nuclear programme.“We call on China’s leaders to abide by the international laws and norms that China and the Chinese people have benefited greatly from over the years. While we hope the [China] will change its ways, we must be prepared for the alternative,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relationship-with-india-important-monitoring-lac-very-closely-us-defense-secretary/story-M1DDjM4umFt6BrgfXJoIiL.html
21-07-2020||India||India begins discussion on distribution of coronavirus vaccine, Indigenous candidates also in race||Indian government has said that it has already started to discuss the criteria and method for mass distribution of the coronavirus vaccine following reporting of encouraging results from human trials of international and indigenous vaccine candidates.Even as several leading vaccine candidates across the world are in a race to produce the first reliable medical intervention to block the spread of coronavirus, Indian government has indicated that the country was in an advantageous position for two reasons—firstly because one of country’s leading vaccine maker has been enlisted for manufacturing Oxford University’s vaccine candidate that has shown encouraging results in stage two of human trials as was reported yesterday and secondly because two indigenous vaccines were also not far behind in the race to produce a credible product.“We seem to be reaching a good stage in vaccine development. It gives us hope. We also feel proud when we see our country among leading nations on this front. We also see promise, not just for our country but for the entire humanity,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog.Also Read: Covid-19 pandemic: Wave of promising study results raises hopes for coronavirus vaccineOxford University’s Covid vaccine candidate called AZD1222 has started phase III of human trials and results so far have indicated that it has elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses without any serious side effects. The strongest response was seen in people who received two doses. The vaccine candidate’s co-producer AstraZeneca has also entered a deal with Pune-based Serum Institute of India to supply one billion doses for low-and-middle-Income countries, with first 400 million before the end of 2020.Apart from this, India was also hopeful about the two indigenous vaccine candidates among the leaders around the world.“India’s two Coved 19 vaccines are in phase 1 and 2 of trials. They are also progressing in this journey. Discussions have already begun how the vaccines will be made available to all those who need it. We will not leave any stone unturned,” Dr VK Paul added.He added that this was not just good news for Indians but for the entire humanity as attempts are being made that the world has access to an Indian vaccine as early as possible.“Every possible facilitation will be ensured making sure trials are conducted scientifically and ethically and that we arrive at an affordable option,” Dr VK Paul was quoted as saying by a news agency.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesDr Paul was referring to Covaxin jointly developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and ZyCoV-D, a candidate from Zydus Cadila, that have entered the human trials stage and shown promising results so far.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, has begun recruitment of subjects for the continuous phase 1 and 2 trials for Covaxin. It is one of the 12 centres that will test the safety and immunogenicity-- the ability of a substance to provoke an immune response in the body-- of the vaccine candidate.In the phase 1 trial, the vaccine will be given to a small number of people to see whether it is safe. In phase 2, the immune response it produces will be checked.The other leading Indian company Zydus Cadila has said that it is looking to complete clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate ZyCoV-D in seven months. The company had last week started clinical trials with the first human dosing.AIMMS director Guleria said that several phases of vaccine development were being carried out simultaneously considering the abnormal situation.“Normally, a vaccine takes about 10 years to develop. That is because the different phases of the trial are conducted one after the other after evaluation of the results. Even as the effectiveness of the vaccine is being studied, manufacturing capacity is also being built,” said Dr Guleria.India is the third worst-affected country, with its Covid-19 tally reaching 11,55,191. India is among the biggest manufacturers of generic medicines and vaccines. Many Indian companies are engaged in making vaccines for various diseases like polio, meningitis, rotavirus, measles etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-begins-discussion-on-distribution-of-coronavirus-vaccine-indigenous-candidates-also-in-race/story-8jm3AOqf49uNBPr7ckxYaI.html

Subsequently, we have taken all precautionary measures and sealed the village,” said Praveen Verma, deputy collector of Jagdalpur. He further said that collector Jagdalpur has sought a report from the Dean of the Medical College.On July 19, deputy director of Baliram Kashyap Memorial Government Medical College, Jagdalpur wrote a letter to the College and expressed his displeasure over the issue. He said that these ‘mistakes’ are unfortunate.“I have got information from the district officials because of a mistake in the detection of Covid-patient done by your department, a patient has been discharged from the quarantine centre, which can lead to spread of the disease. Second, the entry of Covid-19 patient of Bastar was shown in records of different districts... These mistakes are unfortunate,” the letter stated.The deputy director further said that an internal inquiry will be launched so that departmental action can be taken against those responsible.“We have ordered an inquiry over the matter. As soon as we came to know about this mistake we have sealed the village and made it a containment zone,” Rajat Bansal, Collector Jagdalpur, told Hindustan Times.On Monday, Chhattisgarh reported a total of 173 new Covid-19 cases and the total count increased to 5,598.Eleven Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), nine Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel and one Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF) jawan were among the new cases.Of the fresh cases, 66 were reported from Raipur district, 27 from Dantewada, 22 from Janjgir-Champa, 13 from Rajnandgaon, nine from Bilaspur, eight from Durg, seven each from Bijapur and Jashpur, four from Surguja, three from Mahasamund, two each from Raigarh and Sukma districts.Meanwhile, in Chhattisgarh, a seven-day fresh lockdown restriction will be imposed in nine urban areas of Chhattisgarh’s five districts following a spike in coronavirus cases for the past month.In Raipur, Surguja, and Baloda Bazar districts, the lockdown will be imposed from Wednesday for the next seven days following the orders of the respective collectors.While in the urban areas of Durg, Korba, and Bilaspur districts, the restrictions will come into effect from Thursday, state officials said.All government, semi-government and private offices will remain closed during the re-imposition of lockdown restrictions.

21-07-2020||India||UAE consulate’s charity handout puts Kerala minister under scanner in gold smuggling case||Kerala Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel is likely to be questioned in the gold smuggling case, said a senior officer familiar with the probe into the racket.Last week, Jaleel had said that he had accepted a sponsorship for food worth Rs five lakh from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate to distribute as ‘zakat’ (alms, one of the five pillars of Islam).The minister’s phone number had figured in the list of phone calls of one of the prime accused Swapna Suresh. According to the list that was leaked, Jaleel had made nine calls to Suresh in June with the calls ranging from 64 seconds to over three minutes. The accused had also called the minister’s office staff several times.Hours after the list surfaced on July 14, the minister had called a press conference and said he had called Suresh who was formerly employed in the consulate in connection with Ramzan kits being offered by the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. But this clarification only invited more trouble. The minister is not supposed to accept any fund or freebies without the consent of the Ministry of External Affairs, experts said. “All such contributions will have to come through the MEA only. A state minister cannot directly interact with the representative of a foreign country and it is against diplomatic protocol and norms,” said former diplomat T P Sreenivasan.The Opposition Congress has shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking action against Jaleel while the BJP sought his immediate resignation. “The conduct of the minister is punishable under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. We have requested the PM to include this also in the ongoing probe into smuggling,” said Congress MP the UDF convener Benny Behnan who wrote to the PM two days ago.But the minister said it was part of a witch-hunt and he is ready for any probe. “I did not accept direct money or fund. I accepted ‘zakat’ to distribute it to poor people in my constituency. I did it through a government agency. It is sad such a humanitarian move is mired in a controversy,” Jaleel said.He also said that during Diwali and Christmas many foreign missions carry out such humanitarian campaigns. But the BJP said the minister was trying to communalise the whole issue. “Cornered, now he is playing his favourite communal card,” said BJP state president K Surendran.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had sent a letter to the PM earlier this month requesting him to include the terror angle also in the gold smuggling probe. But many in the CPI (M) fear that the BJP may use it to embarrass the government when assembly elections are nine months away. “We hope the probe will not take a political colour,” said senior CPI (M) leader K N Balagopal.The Customs had seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. On July 9, the Union home ministry asked the National Investigation Agency to probe the racket. Several other central agencies are also involved in the investigation. The NIA has arrested four persons and Customs 13 in connection with the case so far. Two senior officials, the CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar and IT fellow Arun Balachandran, were removed after their name cropped up and many others are under the scanner now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-consulate-s-charity-handout-puts-kerala-minister-under-scanner-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-QHqSPJhcJQ48bNYZneS6SK.html

There is no question of lockdown either in Bangalore or any other district in the state, he said in an address to the state.The CM also said that normal economic activity would resume across the state from Wednesday except in containment zones.The CM’s address was seen as an attempt to bring clarity and to end uncertainty after the state had implemented a week-long lockdown in Bengaluru urban and rural from July 14 to July 22 to check rising cases of Covid-19. Apart from Bengaluru, five other districts in the state had implemented lockdowns of varying periods.“We will focus on the economy and help rebuild livelihoods….Restrictions will remain only in containment zones. All others across the state will fully return to normal economic activity,” the CM said. Yediyurappa also said that the recovery rate of Covid-19 patients in the state is 98% and there is no need to panic.The CM’s statement not to enforce lockdown in any part of the state came on a day when Karnataka registered 3,649 new Covid cases taking the total to 71,069 cases which includes 25,459 discharges and 1,464 deaths.

He warned of strict action against those who do not wear masks in public  He also sought the opposition’s cooperation in combating the pandemic and insisted that there has been no corruption in the drive against Covid-19.“All purchases are transparent and the is no corruption We will provide any details and documents sought by opposition within 24 hours. Not one rupee has been misused,” he said.Earlier this month, senior Congress leader and former chief minister and leader of opposition in the Karnataka assembly Siddaramaiah had alleged that there was a Rs 2,200 crore scam in the purchase of Covid-19 related equipment.Meanwhile,Medical Education minister Dr K Sudhakar after a meeting of the Covid taskforce on Tuesday said that the rates for testing for has been fixed at Rs 2,000per person if they come through government referral and Rs 3,000 per person ifthey directly approach a private lab.In another development, KPCC President D KShivakumar said that if the government failed to meet the demands of ASHAworkers in the state who are protesting for the last 12 days demanding enhancedpay and insurance cover, the Congress party would join hands with them toensure justice to Covid warriors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bs-yediyurappa-dumps-lockdown-says-karnataka-to-return-to-normal-economic-activity/story-YhVogwN7rpmQatZ8Q4LorI.html

She was grilled by the same team on Monday as well for about three hours.Vishnudutt Vishnoi, who was SHO at Rajgarh police station in Churu, was found dead at his official residence in Churu in May following which BJP and BSP leaders in the state alleged that he was under pressure.Two suicide notes were recovered from Vishnoi-- one addressed to his parents and the other to the Superintendent of Police of the district.In the suicide note to the SP, Vishnoi had said he was not able to bear the pressure put on him. In his suicide note, he had also said that he tried to give his best to the Rajasthan Police.A screenshot of a purported WhatsApp chat that Vishnoi had with one of his activist friends, in which the police officer talked about being trapped in dirty politics, had also gone viral.The leaders of the BJP and the BSP have alleged that the officer, who was known for his honesty and hardwork, was being pushed by Congress MLA Poonia, a charge that she has denied.CBI officials said that the questioning is being done to clarify certain things and it doesn’t mean that Poonia or Saini are suspects in the case.The officials also pointed out that Rajasthan government’s decision to block CBI probe in the state won’t affect this case as this case was sent by state government before the notification issued on July 19, which itself says that cases which have been already sent will remain valid.The CBI interrogation comes at a time when the Rajasthan government is facing political turmoil post Sachin Pilot’s rebellion. Deva Ram Saini said, “I am extending full cooperation and providing all required information.”Congress MLA Poonia also said she would cooperate with the investigating agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-questions-cm-gehlot-s-aide-mla-over-cop-suicide-amid-rajasthan-crisis/story-MFNYv5yT0gUPGxKREDw1UK.html

21-07-2020||India||YES Bank co-founder’s bail plea rejected by special PMLA court||A special Prevention of Money Laundering (PMLA) court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea filed by Rana Kapoor, YES Bank’s co-founder, former managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO), who has been booked for alleged money laundering by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Kapoor was arrested by ED on March 8 and produced before the special PMLA court.Initially, he was remanded to ED custody till March 11 and later sent to judicial custody.Earlier in March, CBI had registered two cases against Kapoor.One first information report (FIR) had alleged that the bankrupt YES Bank had invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) between April and June 2018. In lieu, Kapoor was allegedly paid “kickbacks” to the tune of Rs 600 crore by DHFL promoter, Kapil Wadhawan.DHFL had sanctioned a loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises in which Kapoor’s wife Bindu is a director and 100% shareholder, the CBI had stated in its FIR.Kapoor’s three daughters -- Rakhee Kapoor Tandon, Roshni Kapoor, and Radha Kapoor -- are also 100% shareholders in DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd.It is on the basis of the CBI case that ED began its probe into allegations of money laundering by Kapoor and subsequently arrested him on March 8.In the second case, CBI alleged that Kapoor and his wife bought a bungalow from Avantha Group promoter Gautam Thapar at a much lower price than it’s market valuation.In the past, Thapar had mortgaged the bungalow for a corporate loan of Rs 600 crore, but he sold it for Rs 380 crore to Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd, when Kapoor’s wife was a director of the company.ED filed a charge sheet against Kapoor, his wife, and three daughters for money laundering on the basis of its investigation. Kapoor’s lawyers moved bail plea after the charge sheet was filed, pleading that the case was based on documentary evidence that has already been collected by the agency and he is eligible to be released on a personal surety bond, which can be determined by the special PMLA court.ED, however, argued that the probe is yet to be concluded and that Kapoor could tamper with the evidence and also influence witnesses. The special PMLA court saw merit in ED’s argument and rejected his bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yes-bank-co-founder-s-bail-plea-rejected-by-special-pmla-court/story-62OOlZJIWbEUNWYnUu6YPL.html
21-07-2020||India||Centre cites four reasons to laud India’s Covid 19 containment efforts||The Central government on Tuesday presented data to back up claims that India has relatively well handled Covid 19 pandemic outbreak using a strategy of effective containment, surveillance, house to house survey, aggressive testing, prompt isolation followed by treatment, which have yielded good results so far.A senior health ministry official presented graphs on four aspects of the containment efforts, namely testing, positivity rate, fatality rate and the active case load of the disease to advance its argument.“As per WHO guidance note, to meet adequate testing parameters, 140 tests per million of population must be conducted per day and this level of testing should continue for a prolonged period of time for it to be effective. 180 tests per million of population is being conducted per day in India presently,” said Rajesh Bhushan, officer on special duty (OSD), health ministry.He added that as many as 19 Indian states and Union Territories were doing better than the national average benchmark. The top five on the list are Goa with 1,333 tests per million, Dadra Nagar Haveli (DNH) with 750 tests per million, Tripura with 643 tests per million, Tamil Nadu with 571 tests per million and Delhi with 536 tests per million.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe official added that testing should not be seen in isolation and must be looked at in relation to the positivity rate, which should show a significant drop with the rising number of tests to conclusively prove the efficacy of the containment efforts. “The ultimate aim is to reduce the positivity rate to under 5%,” he said.The government figures show that in 30 states/UTs, the positivity rate is lower than the national average of 8.07%. Rajasthan with 2.46% positivity rate and Karnataka with 7.29% positivity rate, represent the lower and the higher end of the group that has done relatively better on that front. On the front of absolute numbers, the official said it was not helpful to judge a country’s Coved 19 situation by the total number of people infected by the disease.“The actual load of the disease is 4,02,529 as on July 21. When we talk of statistics, we should not get entangled in historic data. We should focus on active cases since they test our health system’s efficiency,” he said.The official pointed out that the percentage of active cases has come down from over 90% as on March 24 to less than 40% as on July 21.Also Read: Covid-19 state tally: Delhi records less than 1,000 cases for first time in 7 weeks, Bihar a concernThe official added that the case fatality rate was another important parameter to judge the success of the country’s containment efforts. In India’s case, the case fatality rate has come down from around 3.36% as on June 17 to 2.43% on July 21.“Despite the limited resources, if we have been able to contain the case fatality rate to this level, then this speaks volumes about the role played by our health care workers. It also underlines the role played by our institutions of excellence such as All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), that took initiative to advise hospitals and doctors around the country on best practices to bring the fatality rate even further down,” he said.The official added that the government’s containment decisions were being taken in consultation with domain knowledge experts relying on science-based inputs and that the Centre has been extending all help and support to the states in this fight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-cites-four-reasons-to-laud-india-s-covid-19-containment-efforts/story-qe1fGUJ3R8e58XSu8sqk2L.html
21-07-2020||India||11 cops convicted for killing Rajasthan ex-royal in fake encounter 35 yrs ago||A special CBI court in Mathura pronounced 11 policemen, including a former deputy Superintendent of Police (SP), guilty on Tuesday in the murder of former royal Raja Man Singh.The CBI had presented the charge sheet against 18 police personnel; four of them died during trial and three others were acquitted. The convicted police officials included Kan Singh Bhati who was the deputy SP of Deeg in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur.The CBI verdict came 35 years after Singh was killed in police firing.Raja Man Singh was the younger brother of last ruler of Bharatpur, Maharaja Sawai Vrijendra Singh, and son of Maharaja Kishan Singh who was born on December 5, 1921. He studied engineering in England and was seven-time Independent MLA from Deeg from 1952 to 1984.Raja Man Singh’s daughter Krishnendra Kaur Deepa was the tourism minister in the last BJP government in Rajasthan.The CBI court hearing was shifted to Mathura from Rajasthan on a plea by Krishnendra Kaur Deepa.Man Singh was shot dead along with his two supporters in police firing in February 1985 after an incident of violence in which chief minister Shiv Charan Mathur’s helicopter was damaged.The CM had come to campaign for Congress candidate from Deeg, retired IAS officer Vijendra Singh, who was contesting against Man Singh.The chief minister was scheduled to address an election meeting in support of Singh. Ahead of the meeting, Congress workers removed flags and banners of Raja Man Singh. An enraged Singh reached the meeting venue with his supporters in his Jonga Jeep.He created a ruckus and even damaged the chief minister’s helicopter by his Jeep. Mathur was rescued by the security personnel.On February 21, 1985, curfew was imposed and police forces deployed in Deeg. Singh’s daughter Krishnendra Kaur Deepa alleged that after police registered complaint against her father, he was going to surrender himself before police but deputy SP Kan Singh Bhati with heavy police forces stopped his jeep in Anaj Mandi in Deeg and opened fire.Singh and his supporters Thakur Sumer Singh and Thakur Hari Singh were killed in the police firing.As the court pronounced its judgement, heavy police force was deployed outside to maintain law and order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-court-convicts-11-cops-including-deputy-sp-for-ex-royal-s-murder-in-rajasthan/story-M54w3o75NfoSpVSzfXnjlK.html
21-07-2020||India||‘Reign of fear across the country’: Mamata Banerjee attacks BJP, Centre||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the government it leads at the Centre, claiming there is reign of fear across the country.“People are unable to speak due to reign of fear across the country,” Banerjee said while addressing a virtual rally of the Trinamool Congress (TMC).Calling the BJP a party of “outsiders”, Banerjee said they will never get a chance to run West Bengal. “The central government has neglected us. People of West Bengal will give them a befitting reply. Outsiders will not run the state. There are some people who don’t have any political experience. They speak of killing people and setting things ablaze,” said the chief minister.Sharpening her attack further, Banerje said that the Centre is conspiring against “Bengal by saying every day there is violence”.“What about UP where ‘jungle raj’ prevails? What is happening in Uttar Pradesh? People in that state are afraid of lodging complaints with the police. Several policemen were killed in a single incident,” she said.“Centre has deprived West Bengal of resources, people will give a befitting reply for injustice,” Banerjee added.The chief minister also accused the BJP of using the state agencies to try and topple the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal and attacked the saffron party of “destabilising governments in Madhya Pradesh, Bengal and Rajasthan”.Banerjee said that the Trinamool Congress will win the assembly elections this time too. “Trinamool Congress will form the government again. The next elections will show a new direction to the state as well as to the country,” the TMC chief said.Assembly elections are due in West Bengal next year and the BJP has vowed to dethrone Banerjee. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats, marking the party’s highest ever growth in Bengal.The party has attacked Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress for violence in West Bengal. On June 9, Union home minister Amit Shah sharpened his attack on the chief minister, saying that while democracy has strengthened its roots in the entire country West Bengal remains the only state where political violence is propagated.Banerjee had stormed to power in 2011 by overthrowing the 34-year-old Left government. Before coming to power, Banerjee had promised to end political violence but killings and turf wars continued.The 2018 panchayat polls saw a spate in violence. While only 10 people died on the day of polling, against an all-time high of 76 in 2003 and 39 in 2013, the elections stood out because of rigging, booth capturing and burning of ballot papers in front of the media and policemen. More people were killed after the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reign-of-fear-across-the-country-mamata-banerjee-attacks-bjp-centre/story-mYBuYFuwVFz4sMBywBVq9L.html

Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha said no one was near the spot at the time of the incident.Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad and Ganga Sabha have demanded an inquiry into this incident at this ancient religious place in the context of the structural strength of the wall housing a pilgrimage thronged by millions every day.Watch: Landslide in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli following heavy rain“Akhada Parishad demands an inquiry into this incident as Har-Ki-Pauri is a place where thousands of people arrive on a daily basis. Mahakumbh is just five months away so construction of a stronger outer wall and related infrastructure works should be carried out in such a manner that safety of pilgrims and Har-Ki-Pauri personnel is ensured, “said Mahant Narendra Giri, president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad.Har-Ki-Pauri police station in-charge Amarjeet Singh said that the police personnel have cordoned off the whole area as the remaining portion of the wall, too, seemed vulnerable.Also Read: Uttarakhand HC upholds constitutional validity of Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management ActFormer municipal chairperson Satpal Brahamchari alleged that the wall caved in due to pressure from rain water which had accumulated due to uncovered digging work currently being undertaken for the underground laying of power cables and piped natural gas lines. A section of local traders seemed to agree with Brahamchari.Mayor Anita Sharma, too, weighed in and blamed the haphazard laying of underground power, piped natural gas lines and sewer lines for water logging and the subsequent caving in of the wall.District authorities said an expert opinion was needed to confirm if the collapse was indeed a result of lightning strike. District disaster management officer Haridwar Meera Kainthura said the reason will be known after submission of a report by disaster management experts and geologists.Local priests have interpreted the collapse as “a bad omen” and an expression of “wrath” by Ganga Maa, upset at the move to not to allow devotees to take a holy dip and offer Ganga Jal at Shivalingams on the pious festive occasion of Shravan Shivratri and Somwati Amavasya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-era-wall-at-haridwar-s-har-ki-pauri-collapses-in-lightening-strike/story-m0rg6NwXThNWeUeV6w3xyN.html

Vaiphei, chairperson, AHRC, and other members of the commission, Naba Kamal Bora and Deba Kumar Saikia, have issued the notice. Saikia had complained to AHRC about negligence in providing proper healthcare facilities and diet to inmates of the Central Jail in Guwahati and other prisons and correctional homes across the state and also cited the non-compliance of the Covid-19 protocol by the jail authorities.Earlier on July 9, Saikia had written to Kumar Sanjay Krishna and Dasharath Das, state chief secretary and inspector-general (I-G) (prisons), Assam, respectively, seeking an inquiry into the matter and also sought the release of undertrial prisoners, while citing the Supreme Court’s March 23 order that had directed state governments to free prisoners on bail or parole in a bid to decongest jails and correctional homes across the country because of the viral outbreak.Saikia urged the commission to direct the state government to constitute a committee to ascertain Covid-19-related facilities provided in the major hospitals of Assam since the viral disease was first reported over four months ago.He also wanted directions on whether the Covid-19 protocol was followed at Guwahati’s Central Jail and whether proper medical care was provided to the inmates.“Issue notice to the chief secretary and I-G (prisons) to submit a report to this commission on or before August 5 as to what actions have been taken by them in connection with the complaint,” the commission said in its order.Assam has recorded 25,092 Covid-19 positive cases till Monday, including 17,095 patients have recovered from their viral infection and 58 deaths.According to officials, 435 inmates of Guwahati’s Central jail, which has around 1,000 inmates, have tested Covid-19 positive to date.Peasant leader Akhil Gogoi is among the prominent inmates of the jail, who has contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Guwahati. Most of the inmates of the jail have recovered and 154 is yet to recover from their viral infection.On Monday, five people in Kokrajhar Jail in lower Assam, including four police personnel and an inmate, tested Covid-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-human-rights-commission-issues-notice-to-govt-on-covid-19-scenario-in-jails/story-AREZ4JnQ2v4xapPZrqSEvO.html
21-07-2020||India||Order on Sachin Pilot, rebels’ plea on July 24, Rajasthan speaker asked to wait||The Rajasthan high court said on Tuesday that it will pronounce its verdict on the writ petition filed by Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident Congress MLAs, challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by the state assembly speaker, on Friday. The speaker has been asked to take no action against the MLAs till then.The MLAs were served the disqualification notice after the Congress party complained to speaker CP Joshi that the lawmakers had defied a whip to attend two Congress legislature party (CLP) meetings last week on Monday and Tuesday.In its complaint to the speaker, the Congress had sought action against Pilot and the MLAs supporting him under the 10th Schedule of the constitution. The Pilot camp, however, has argued that a party whip applies only when the Assembly is in session.Sachin Pilot, who has maintained he is not joining the BJP, was sacked as deputy chief minister of the state last month and also as head of Rajasthan Congress unit. Govind Singh Dotasra has been appointed as the new head of the state unit. Even as the court hearing was on, the Congress held another legislature party meeting at the luxury resort where all its MLAs have been sequestered since the beginning of the crisis. Once again, team Pilot was missing.“Neither Congress nor BJP want Assembly to be dissolved and election to take place...Entire country is watching the way you’re fighting. Your respect has increased manifold. It’s not something ordinary. All of you have phones, there’s no pressure on anyone,” said chief minister Gehlot at the CLP meet. CM Gehlot, who admitted in a TV interview that he has not been on talking terms with his former Number 2 for the last 18 months, has been trenchant in his criticism of Sachin Pilot. In rather unpleasant remarks yesterday, the CM called Pilot “nikamma (worthless) and nakaara (good for nothing)”. Repeating his earlier charge, he said Pilot has been trying to dislodge his government. Gehlot also claimed that some MLAs of the Pilot camp, whose phone were snatched away, have been held captive. The CM added the dissident lawmakers have been “calling us and crying over phone while explaining their ordeal”. Sachin Pilot, when the drama began, claimed the support of 30 MLAs, however that number now stands at 18. On the other hand, Gehlot claims the support of over 100 MLAs. In the 200-member assembly, 101 is the majority mark. With 72 MLAs, the BJP has been watching the developments from the sidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/order-on-sachin-pilot-rebels-plea-on-july-24-rajasthan-speaker-asked-to-wait/story-6QBDJsVjrE8ws0OfbiLobP.html

The youth’s family said in a police complaint that he was murdered by the girl’s family.Tension is still palpable in the area since the girl and the youth belonged to different religious communities.The youth lived in the same village and police are investigating if the two had an affair and whether their parents were opposed to it.Sachin Makkar, superintendent of police, Islampur police district, said “We have arrested the father and two brothers of the girl based on the complaint of the youth’s father.”The autopsy report of the youth will be available to the police on Tuesday afternoon. The post mortem report of the girl did not indicate rape and pointed at poisoning, the state police earlier said.Police have also arrested 22 people in connection with Sunday’s arson and clashes in which police vans and government buses were also set on fire. Surajit Sen, vice president of the BJP North Dinajpur district unit, said, “The government and police have cooked up a story about an affair between the youth and the girl.”The police stopped a team of senior BJP leaders from visiting the village on Monday but Bengal’s tourism minister Gautam Deb met the girl’s family.The girl recently passed the class 10 state board exams.The youth’s uncle alleged that his nephew was murdered by the girl’s family on Sunday night. He alleged that both the youth and the girls had been killed.The youth’s mother said, “Someone called my son over the phone at 11 pm on Sunday and he left home. He later called and said he was with three people and would return soon. We never heard from him again.” “Police are investigating both the cases and looking into all possible aspects of the incident including social ostracism, parental pressure and the role played by some persons in hiding, misleading and diverting the attention from the actual incident,” the West Bengal Police said on Twitter on Monday.The girl’s father had alleged that his daughter was regularly harassed by the youth and he raped and murdered her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/father-brothers-of-girl-whose-unnatural-death-sparked-clashes-in-north-bengal-arrested/story-SAxo7eEINnKJvBTnzXCTIJ.html

Here’s why||The Union health ministry has warned all states against use of N95 masks with valved respirator, saying these can be detrimental as the valves do not prevent the virus from escaping out of the mask.The ministry has prescribed the use of home-made protective cover described on the website of the ministry.Prof (Dr) Rajiv Garg, director general of health services, issued the directive in a letter to the health secretaries of all states on Monday.“It has been observed that there is an inappropriate use of the N95 mask (particularly with valved respirator) by the public other than designated health workers. In this regard, I would like to draw your attention to the advisory on the use of home-made protective cover for face and mouth available on the website of the MoHFW,” the letter says.“It is to bring to your knowledge that the use of valved respirator N95 masks is detrimental to the measures adopted for preventing the spread of the coronavirus as it does not prevent the virus from escaping out of the mask,” the letter says. The advisory has asked the states to prevent inappropriate use of N95 masks.The government had in April issued an advisory on the use of home-made protective cover for face and mouth, asking people to wear it, particularly when they step out of their residences.The advisory stressed such face covers must be washed and cleaned each day, as instructed, and stated that any used cotton cloth can be used to make this face cover.It also listed the procedures of making such home-made masks, asking to ensure it fits the face well and there are no gaps on the sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-govt-wants-you-to-stop-wearing-valved-n95-masks-here-s-why/story-wnKap7lZQg1IZOAEm0gHHO.html

He also urged the legislators supporting him to “stand firm like a rock” and assured them that the mandate is with the Congress party as the turf war with Pilot whittled down to the numbers.“We will have more than 115 MLAs, including some from among the absentees. And nobody wants elections to happen be it Congress or the BJP,” he said during the meeting, according to people aware of the developments.He also had some words of praise for the MLAs.“The entire country is watching the way you’re fighting. Your respect has increased manifold. It’s not something ordinary,” he said, according to news agency ANI.“All of you have phones. There’s no pressure on anyone,” he said.Senior party leader Ajay Maken and state unit president Govind Singh Dotasra were among others present at the CLP meeting.The Rajasthan chief minister has also called a meeting of his cabinet later in the day, leading to another buzz about a floor test.Meanwhile, the Rajasthan High Court said it will pronounce its order on Friday on the petition by Sachin Pilot and 18 other rebel Congress MLAs challenging the disqualification notices served to them by the speaker of the state assembly, CP Joshi, last week for “anti-party activities”.The court also requested the speaker to defer any action against Pilot and legislators in his camp till then.If the high court decides to disqualify Pilot and members of his camp, it will have a direct bearing on the numbers in the Rajasthan assembly.Their disqualification will bring down the majority mark in the assembly—101 in the 200-member house making it easier for chief minister Gehlot to win a floor test. Gehlot has claimed he has the support of more than 100 members of legislative assembly (MLAs) and Pilot is being backed by 18 legislators.The disqualification notices to Pilot and the MLAs were served after the Congress party complained to Rajasthan assembly speaker Joshi that they defied a whip to attend two CLP meetings on July 13 and July 14.After he gave the meetings a slip, Pilot was sacked as the Rajasthan deputy chief minister and the president of the state Congress unit as he rebelled against Gehlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-tells-congress-mlas-backing-him-to-stand-firm-like-a-rock/story-MV9Cm9dXNCeZC3suLj1JaO.html
21-07-2020||India||Assam BJP MLA tests positive for Covid-19, fifth from state BJP to report||The raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in Assam’s tally is on an upswing, as politicians, cutting across party lines, are contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and adding to the north-east’s most populous state’s viral load.On Monday, Atul Bora, the BJP member of the Assam legislative assembly (MLA), who represents the Dispur constituency, tested Covid-19 positive in Guwahati and is undergoing treatment at a local hospital.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBora (69) got infected a day after the BJP lawmaker from Sonari, Nabanita Handique, too, tested Covid-19 positive.So far, five lawmakers – all from the ruling BJP – have tested Covid-19. Barring BJP MLAs Bora and Handique, their colleagues Krishnendu Paul of Patharkandi constituency, Narayan Deka (Barkhetry), and Bolin Chetia (Sadiya) were found to be infected.Paul and Deka have recovered, while Chetia, Handique, and Bora are still undergoing treatment.Opposition Congress has criticised the state government for playing petty politics over the pandemic.“The state government is trying to extract political mileage from the Cobid-19 situation. Opposition leaders are being prevented from reaching out to the public on the pretext of the pandemic. However, similar restrictions don’t hold good for the BJP leaders, who are mingling with the public while throwing social distancing norms to the wind,” alleged Debabrata Saikia, a Congress MLA and the leader of opposition in the state assembly.“Numerous people in certain areas have either been infected by the viral disease or have had to undergo quarantine after coming into contact with BJP MLAs and other leaders,” he further alleged.Earlier in July, Sushmita Dev, former Congress Member of Parliament (MP) from Silchar in Assam and the president All India Mahila Congress, had also tested Covid-19 positive. She underwent treatment at Silchar Medical College Hospital between July 8 and 19, when she was discharged after recovering from her viral infection.“Covid-19 positive cases have been spiralling in most parts of the state, as around 1,000 fresh cases are being reported daily. Frontline workers, who are battling the pandemic, including doctors, paramedical staff, police, and bureaucrats, are getting infected. In that light, it’s nothing unusual for public representatives such as lawmakers, too, who are adding to Assam’s Covid-19 positive tally,” said a state BJP leader, requesting anonymity.Assam has recorded 25,092 Covid-19 positive cases until Monday, including 17,095 recoveries and 58 deaths.Around 1, 000 police personnel, including senior officers; dozens of healthcare workers, including doctors; bureaucrats, hundreds of inmates in jails and correctional homes and over 70 people posted at Raj Bhawan are among the state’s Covid-19 patients, many of whom have since recovered from their viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-bjp-mla-tests-positive-for-covid-19-fifth-from-state-bjp-to-report/story-CYH7bK2zkANLphCa5XTVaJ.html
21-07-2020||India||Nearly 1 in 4 Delhiites exposed to Covid-19: Sero-survey data||A serological survey of Delhi’s population shows that 23.48% people may have been exposed to the pathogen that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Union health ministry said on Tuesday, releasing results of the exercise that covered over 20,000 people across the Capital’s 11 districts between June 27 and July 10. If extrapolated across the population, this would come to nearly one in four people, or 4.7 million of Delhi’s residents.“The results of the sero-prevalence study show that on an average, across Delhi, the prevalence of IgG [Immunoglobulin G] antibodies is 23.48 % [22.86%, when adjusted for sensitivity and specificity of the tests]. The study also indicates that a large number of infected persons remain asymptomatic,” the health ministry said in a statement.The ministry had commissioned a sero-surveillance study in Delhi, which has a population of about 20 million, and it was jointly conducted by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Delhi government. It was done following a rigorous multi-stage sampling study design between June 27 and July 10.Also read: Oxford Covid-19 vaccine’s first human trial shows promise, more phases underwayExperts in community medicine say that since the samples were collected in end-June and the beginning of July, there is a possibility more people may have developed antibodies against the virus by now.“This is suggestive of infection during mid-June, and since then, we have seen a decent increase in the number of cases. That means more people are exposed to the virus, and the disease prevalence could be higher,” said Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicine department of Safdarjung Hospital.“Also, it wasn’t a door-to-door sample collection, that also means about 5% to 10% of the population probably was missed. If you factor in all these variables then the prevalence should easily be around 40%, which is good.”He added, “It also means the susceptible population is going down, which suggests that the epidemic is moving downwards towards its end.”Survey teams were formed for all the 11 districts of Delhi, and blood samples were collected from 21,387 individuals. The samples were tested in labs for Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.IgG is the most common antibody in blood and other body fluids that the immune systems produces to protect against bacterial and viral infections and allergens. IgG can take time to form after an infection, and is useful in detecting a past infection, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Also read: Maharashtra facing surge in cases even outside red zonesEpidemiologists say merely knowing the presence of antibodies is not enough, as one needs to know the quality of antibodies to make some meaningful difference.Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division of ICMR, said: “We need more information to make sense of the survey, such as whether these antibodies are neutralising antibodies that can kill the virus, or for how long do these antibodies stay in a person’s system. Is it a long-term immunity or short-term? More relevant information needs to be put out.”The antibody test is not a diagnostic test but provides information about past infection due to SARSCoV-2 in individuals who test positive. Antibody testing repeatedly done over time, in the form of sero-surveillance, generates important evidence for assessing the spread of the pandemic from time to time, the health ministry’s statement said.“This implies the following: nearly six months into the epidemic, only 23.48% of the people are affected in Delhi, which has several pockets of dense population. This can be attributed to the proactive efforts taken by the government to prevent the spread of infection, including prompt lockdown, effective containment and surveillance measures, including contact tracing and tracking, as well as citizen’s compliance to COVID Appropriate Behaviours,” it said.“However, a significant proportion of the population is still vulnerable. Therefore, the containment measures need to continue with the same rigour. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing, use of face mask or cover, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoidance of crowded places etc, must be followed strictly,” it added.This was one of the largest sero-prevalence studies conducted in India using ELISA testing. ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV) at Pune developed and validated the indigenous blood-based IgG ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) test “Covid Kavach Elisa” for antibody detection for Covid-19, which was used for the sero-prevalence survey in Delhi. While real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test is the frontline test for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, robust antibody tests are critical for surveillance to understand the proportion of population exposed to infection. It takes about 2.5 hours to get results and can be deployed even in districts, says the research body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-1-in-4-delhiites-exposed-to-covid-19-sero-survey-data/story-YhKD2eZdGlYEWiAIaXLxEL.html

Airlines have limited options to turn to for funding except their promoters, given that 3rd party investors will be reluctant to provide capital right now, and the government is unwilling to do so.”On July 20, IndiGo, India’s largest airline by market share, announced the lay-offs due to the pandemic. CAPA said, “The decision by IndiGo to lay off 10% of its staff is the beginning of a painful process for Indian aviation as things start to unravel from the impact of Covid-19 in India. It will be impossible to survive this crisis without a strong balance sheet.”Airlines have been struggling since the Covid-19 lockdown was announced in late March. Even after domestic operations partially resumed from May 25, most aircraft are on the ground as airlines have been operating in a limited manner with only 60% of their capacity due to poor load factor.“Even while the state government has allowed 50 take-offs and 50 arrivals from Mumbai, not all are operating their planned flights, as demand has been low,” said a senior airline official who declined to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indigo-s-decision-to-lay-off-staff-is-the-beginning-of-a-painful-process-for-indian-aviation-capa/story-Yj9oY62JoKwkiyj0ZqOrUI.html
21-07-2020||India||Bi-weekly lockdown in West Bengal may help ease pressure on health sector: Doctors||Senior doctors in West Bengal have blamed people’s casual approach to lockdown guidelines and quarantine norms for high Covid-19 caseload in the state, and welcomed the TMC government’s decision to impose bi-weekly shutdown to stem the spread of the disease.Admitting that community transmission of Covid-19 has been detected in a few pockets of Bengal, surgical oncologist Dr Diptendra Sarkar said the “two-day total lockdown across the state will help the administration tackle the situation to a considerable extent”.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“In several areas, where contact tracing is not possible, community transmission has been detected. But that does not mean that community transmission has happened in the entire state,” he said.Talking about the new shutdown strategy, Dr Sarkar said, “We have to contain the rate of transmission. We have to flatten the curve which has moved upward over a period of time... The lockdown is being imposed in a very calculative manner.”“If it is in force on Thursday and Saturday, people wouldn’t get much to do on Friday. And Sunday is usually not a busy day. So the shutdown covers more than just two days. If we can continue this in the coming weeks, we might be able to ease the pressure on the health sector.” Another senior physician, Dr Syamasis Bandyopadhyay, said many people have flouted quarantine guidelines over the past few months, leading to the rapid spread of the disease.“There are family members of Covid-19 patients who have not submitted their samples for examination. Some have also violated quarantine norms. These are major reasons for community transmission,” he said.The physician was also sceptical that people might continue to disregard safety norms during this fresh spell of bi-weekly lockdown.“I think many still do not realise the need to be on self quarantine. I doubt how much this complete lockdown will help, under such circumstances.” The Bengal government on Monday announced a complete lockdown in the state twice a week in its bid to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission. The announcement came as Bengal recorded the highest one-day spike of 2,282 infections, which pushed the caseload to 44,769.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bi-weekly-lockdown-in-west-bengal-may-help-ease-pressure-on-health-sector-doctors/story-emQlUIfhgPJFRKcHlmDHML.html
21-07-2020||India||‘Rahul Gandhi, note your achievements’: Union minister’s biting comeback||In a lacerating comeback, Union minister Prakash Javadekar listed out Rahul Gandhi’s “achievements” over the last six months to counter what the former Congress chief called the Centre’s “achievements” in the time of coronavirus.Launching a counter-offensive, the minister found fault with Gandhi tweeting daily, prophesying that the Congress will be reduced to a party that only tweets. Gandhi, on a daily basis, has been challenging the Centre’s narrative on various issues and raising questions. Asking the Congress MP to take note, the information minister, answering in identical fashion as Gandhi’s tweet, listed out six “achievements” of the 50-year-old leader. The list went like this: Feb: Shaheen Bagh & riots March: Losing [Jyotiraditya] Scindia and MP governmentApril: Instigating labourers May: 6th anniversary of historic poll defeat [Congress]June: Advocating for China July: Party [Congress] destroyed in Rajasthan Going further, the BJP leader then asked the Congress leader to also note the country’s achievements in “war against coronavirus”.“India has the least average cases, active cases and death rate than the US, Europe and Brazil. By making fun of candle lights, RahulGandhi ji you have insulted the people of India and brave Corona warriors,” said the minister. The torrents of criticism followed Rahul Gandhi’s satirical dig to highlight priorities of the central government amid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic raging in the country. It also included a reference to Rajasthan Congress crisis.“Achievements of the government in the Covid-era: February -- Namaste Trump, March-- toppling the government in Madhya Pradesh, April -- making people light candles, May -- government’s sixth anniversary, June -- Bihar virtual rally, July -- Attempt to topple the government in Rajasthan,” Gandhi said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-note-your-achievements-union-minister-s-biting-comeback/story-8Nwx713nkIuF4gUPyzmzCI.html

The summit is being hosted by US-India Business Council.This year marks the 45th anniversary of the formation of the council.“US-India economic partnership has been one that has been growing in importance for both countries. We have seen that the pandemic has created enormous disruption on global supply chains including in the pharmaceutical sector and the US-India partnership is one of the trusted partners,” USIBC president Nisha Biswal had said last week, ahead of the two-day summit.Biswal said India stands to benefit as the companies look to diversify their global supply chains.The participants in the summit will discuss wide range of topics including the impact of coronavirus on global supply chain and healthcare collaboration between the US and India.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, External Affairs S Jaishankar, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal, Deputy Secretary of US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Eric Hargan, Senator Mark Warner, Representative (California) Ami Bera, India ambassador to the US Taranjit Sandhu, US ambassador to India Kenneth Juster and many more diplomats as well as dignitaries are expected to participate in the summit.The summit will also feature senior executives from top US and Indian companies, like Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet and Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran.“This year’s focus is on ‘Building a Better Future’. As Prime Minister Modi navigates the twin challenges of managing the health impact of Covid-19 and the associated global economic disruption, he has articulated the importance of the US-India Partnership in ushering an era of economic renewal and inclusive opportunity,” said Vijay Advani, USIBC global board chair.Speaking on the H-1B visa issue, Biswal said it is USIBC’s strongly held view that both the US and India benefit when workers, ideas, or innovations are allowed to move more freely across both borders.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-address-high-profile-us-india-summit-on-economic-revival-after-covid-19/story-Wm1Zmlfam8roIzDR3mAogL.html

21-07-2020||India||With Xi Jinping Centre On Diplomatic Thought, Chinese President is the new Mao||Chinese Communist Party General secretary and PLA commander-in-chief Xi Jinping became paramount leader of the Middle Kingdom in 2012. That President Xi thought himself second to none in the Chinese communist pantheon that includes founding father Mao Zedong and economic revivalist Deng Xiaoping became evident on Monday when the Xi Jinping Research Center for Diplomatic Thought was inaugurated within China’s foreign ministry.Foreign minister Wang Yi, who inaugurated the center in Beijing, said Xi’s diplomatic doctrine embodies 21st century Marxism and transcends traditional theories regarding international relations, Wang said, describing Xi’s doctrine as the ultimate guiding principle for Chinese diplomacy.According to China watchers, the new institute of research into Xi Jinping’s thought virtually places him on par with founding father Mao Zedong who led the cultural revolution in the Middle Kingdom that snuffed out millions of lives. Mao’s thought was incorporated into the Communist Party of China’s charter in 1945.Also read: From Ladakh to Japan’s Senkaku Islands, ‘bully’ China is in an overdriveIn October 2017, Xi Jinping was the first Chinese leader since Mao to have had an eponymous ideology included in the charter while in office. Deng’s name was added to the charter after his death in 1997.Deng Xiaoping, the man who led the rise of China as an economic power, stands below the pedestal with his doctrine that put economic development at the centre of party work and provided the ideological roadmap for the modernization of the Chinese economy. While the world sees Xi Jinping’s aggression in Ladakh and South China Sea as divergence from struggles within the party, this move clearly cements his position as the first and most powerful Chinese emperor.In the Indian context, it may be recalled that Mao Zedong mounted the aggression on India in 1962 after the failure of Great Leap Forward agriculture revolution in which millions died of hunger and famine, the PLA’s aggression on the India-China border under the garb of peace and tranquility has come after millions have been infected due to the coronavirus that originated in central China’s Wuhan.At Monday’s event, President Xi who aims to turn China into an eminent global power, upending Deng Xiaoping’s approach to adopt a low profile to expand Beijing’s trade was described as a great strategist with vision. Deng’s doctrine advocated that China should “keep a low profile and bide your time” to stay focused on economic revival.Xi, however, wants that China should take an active role as a contributor to development of global governance and what he had described as “a protector of international order”.Also read: In renewed attack on border row, Rahul Gandhi connects PM’s image and China’s plan“The theory of international relations has achieved a historic leap in the field of diplomacy in the localization of Marxism,” said foreign minister Wang at Monday’s event on XI’s approach.This wasn’t the only aspect of Deng Xiaoping’s efforts to reform China that President Xi has reversed. Two years ago, President Xi had removed the constitutional bar introduced by Deng in 1982 on the China’s president serving more than two terms. This will allow him to continue as China’s president for lifetime, quite like Mao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-xi-jinping-centre-on-diplomatic-thought-chinese-president-is-the-new-mao/story-2KnFtJVLyarsXxPXq2tdUO.html
21-07-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh: Lokayukta initiates inquiry into IPS officer video||Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh (MP) Lokayukta Justice NK Gupta took suo motu (on its own motion) cognisance of media reports and on Monday ordered a preliminary inquiry against an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, who is seen accepting envelopes from five police personnel in a video that has gone viral on social media.The video clip is believed to be three years’ old but still found traction on social media, as the 1991-batch IPS officer, V Madhu Kumar Babu, who was posted as the inspector-general (IG) of police, Ujjain zone, is seen receiving the envelopes from the five police personnel at the government-run guest house in Agar-Malwa, which was under his jurisdiction, when the incident allegedly occurred.A Lokayukta official release stated that special police establishment (SPE), Lokayukta, would probe the matter.Babu, however, skirted the allegations after the probe was ordered. “I’d like to speak about this later,” he said.But the viral video had an immediate fallout on Babu’s career prospects. The state home department relieved him on Saturday evening from the post of transport commissioner to police headquarters (PHQ) to an additional director-general (ADG) without any department under him.Babu told media persons after he was shunted out of his post that “a conspiracy has been hatched to malign my image. A high-level inquiry should be conducted in the matter to get to the bottom of it.”However, he has refused to comment on his purported action of accepting the envelopes, as the viral clip illustrated. The state Congress has demanded a high-level probe in connection with the alleged corruption case.PC Sharma, former Congress lawmaker, and an ex-public relations minister, alleged, “The state government should have immediately ordered an investigation after the video went viral on social media. But, no inquiry has been ordered yet. This shows that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government is not serious about curbing corruption in MP.”State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal, however, refuted Congress’s allegations.“The BJP government’s swift action in transferring the IPS officer is proof of transparent and good governance. We can’t make any comment on the officer’s conduct until the probe is over is and a report is made available. The government is serious about graft and its intent is clear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-lokayukta-initiates-inquiry-into-ips-officer-video/story-MLGDTPYlIlodLBbLQMwsKN.html
21-07-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi lists govt’s achievement, crisis in Rajasthan is one of them||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday added a reference to the political crisis in Rajasthan to question the priorities of the central government amid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic raging in the country.Gandhi in a tweet in Hindi listed the “achievements of the government” from February till July as he blamed the Centre for trying to destabilise the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan.The former Congress president also mentioned Madhya Pradesh, where the 15-month-old Congress government led by Kamal Nath fell in March after a rebellion by 22 party legislators.“Achievements of the government during the Corona period: ● February - Hello Trump ● March - Toppled government in MP ● April - Lighting candles ● May - 6th anniversary of the government ● June - Virtual rally in Bihar ● July - Attempt to topple the government in Rajasthan,” Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.This is the first time Rahul Gandhi has spoken publicly about the crisis in Rajasthan triggered by Sachin Pilot and other MLAs of the party revolted on July 10.He also added an “atmanirbhar” jibe to continue his attack on the government.“That is why the country is 'self-sufficient' in the battle of corona,” the lawmaker from Kerala’s Wayanad added.Before this, Gandhi had Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his direct line of attack as he released a video on Monday to throw a jab at the Centre on the ongoing border row with China.He had said the Chinese are attacking PM Modi’s image as “they understand that for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’ (56-inch)”.The video was the second of his series to share his thoughts on national issues.The Congress has targeted the Prime Minister since the June 15 clash in the eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Vallery in which 20 Indian Army soldiers were killed, accusing him of giving away Indian territory to China.The attack has mostly been led by Rahul Gandhi and the verbal duel has been on since then. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on its part, has accused the Congress of lowering the morale of the Indian Army and politicising a critical national security issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-lists-govt-s-achievement-crisis-in-rajasthan-is-one-of-them/story-OCEOqHWXJVi3TMdOjj3DgK.html

21-07-2020||India||Central team flags poor infection control in Patna Covid-19 hospitals, says it will create super spreaders||A Central team’s visit to Bihar’s first dedicated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) facility, Nalanda Medical College & Hospital (NMCH), in Patna, on Sunday was relegated to the back-burner and exposed the sorry state of pandemic management in the state.TV news channels on Monday telecast the horrific footage in a loop of the body of a Covid-19 victim lying in the middle of a ward while the delegates were making rounds of the hospital to assess the ground reality about the contagion management in the state. A Central team member was aghast to see an unrestricted movement of attendants and sundry other people in Covid-19 wards. “Such reckless acts are like superspreaders. The hospital needs to guard against the spread of infection. Else, it will be difficult to break the transmission pattern,” the member was quoted as saying during his interaction with a healthcare professional from Patna.Later, the delegates underscored that it is imperative to strengthen the hospital’s infection control policy; and instill confidence among frontline healthcare workers, who are battling the pandemic, during a meeting with Bihar government officials.Dr. Neeraj Nischal of New Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said a strict hospital infection control policy is the top priority and doctors and paramedical staff need to undergo exhaustive training to implement it.“The policy implementation will ensure that doctors and healthcare workers will work without any fear and hesitation amid the spread of the viral outbreak. All healthcare personnel will perform better, if they are made to feel safe,” said Dr. Nischal.The delegates have taken strong exception to the unfettered movement of attendants in the Covid-19 facility. “The wards are prohibited areas. The attendants’ unrestricted movement makes them potential superspreaders,” Dr. Nischal said during the meeting, while efforts are on to boost the morale of the hospital’s healthcare staff.Dr. Nischal is believed to have advocated for a mechanism to train doctors and healthcare workers in infection control in Bihar’s medical colleges that can function as nodal centres.The Central team members reinforced the concept of aggressive daily testing while citing that Bihar has been lagging behind in optimal utilisation of its test potential. “Bihar needs to conduct around 18,000 daily tests, which must be further increased. Test-contain-treat should the simple three-step formula to treat Covid-19 patients. An uptick in aggressive daily testing count is the need of the hour, as the state had to cope with a massive influx of migrant population amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions,” said Dr. Nischal, who also interacted with civil surgeons and others involved with the bid to contain the contagion, in the presence of Manoj Kumar, executive director, Bihar State Health Society (BSHS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patna-central-team-flags-poor-infection-control-in-hospitals-says-it-will-create-super-spreaders/story-22Vlp0oMEa129tSdawfqwJ.html

The team inspected some containment zones and dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in Patna and Gaya. It asked the state’s health department to focus on “contact-tracing and testing” to combat the deadly virus more effectively. Based on its survey, the team warned that Bihar could see a further rise in coronavirus cases, and recommended ramping up of the state’s medicare facilities. As on Tuesday, the state has recorded 27,646 cses of Covid-19 and 217 related deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-state-tally-delhi-records-less-than-1-000-cases-for-first-time-in-7-weeks-bihar-a-concern/story-AjZFWELb5292xbi6gOmm2O.html

It did not prompt any serious side effects and elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses, according to trial results published in The Lancet medical journal.A coronavirus vaccine under development by CanSinoBiologics Inc and China’s military research unit also showed that it appears to be safe and induced an immune response in most of the 508 healthy volunteers who got one dose of the vaccine.Germany’s BioNTech and US drugmaker Pfizer Inc also released details from a small study in Germany of a different type of vaccine that uses ribonucleic acid (RNA).In the not-yet peer-reviewed study of 60 healthy adults, the vaccine-induced virus-neutralising antibodies in those given two doses, a result in-line with a previous early-stage US trial. Closer home, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, began recruiting healthy participants for the continuous phase 1 and 2 trial of Covaxin, jointly developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech.In the phase 1 trial, the vaccine will be given to a small number of people to see whether it is safe. In phase 2, scientists will check the immune response it produces.The participants will also be followed up for 28 days and a longer period to check for any adverse effects, apart from the immediate reactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-37-148-new-covid-19-cases-in-24-hours-india-s-infection-tally-over-11-55-lakh/story-Ev6NPwubSlVsohPgIurgeM.html

21-07-2020||India||Four sub-killer P-8I craft coming to India next year, then talks for six more||India’s long-range anti-submarine, reconnaissance, surveillance and electronic jamming capabilities in the Indian Ocean Region are going to get a further boost with the induction of four more P-8I multi-mission aircraft from the US next year. India has the option of buying another six from Boeing to be negotiated later in 2021, people familiar with the developments in New Delhi and Seattle said.The Indian Navy variant of the P-8A Poseidon - P-8I where I stands for India - is essentially designed for maritime patrol. Integrated with the Harpoon Block II air launched missiles and lightweight torpedoes, the reconnaissance craft - it can carry 129 sonobuoys to locate subs - turns into a deadly submarine killer that can also launch anti-ship missiles.The proposed acquisitions come against the backdrop of China’s efforts to militarise the South China Sea and expand its sea footprint.Beijing had already acquired a string of ports in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran and east Africa to not only contain the Indian Navy but also challenge the presence of US Central Command forces as well as French and British Navy.Beijing has 70 percent stake in Kyaukpyu port in Myanmar, which sits in the Bay of Bengal, Hambantota port in South Sri Lanka dominates the Indian Ocean, Gwadar port in Pakistan sits on the mouth of Gulf of Oman and the port of Jask in Iran is located on the edge of Persian Gulf.National security planners believed that the possibility of China attempting to replicate its aggressive posture along the Line of Actual Control at a time of its choosing in the Indian Ocean Region was very real, a government official said.India also inched closer to formalising the anti-China QUAD - Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - strategic grouping. The United States, Japan and Australia are the other members.In some measure, the QUAD is already a reality on the high seas due to India signing the Communications, Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) agreement in September 2019. The P-8I helped.The pact provided the legal framework for exchange of encrypted communication. P-8I makes this possible with ease, particularly since the aircrafts are interoperable, can communicate securely and is designed for .“This is a de-facto QUAD because these have interoperability with the P-8A Poseidon delivered to other countries,” said the official.The secure communications enables one aircraft to share real-time operational intelligence, including a Common Tactical Picture with other P-8 aircraft.The P-8I aircraft is designed for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It operates with joint and combined But it can be used elsewhere too. The military had relied on the reconnaissance aircraft for surveillance during the ongoing Ladakh standoff with China as well as the 2017 Doklam standoff.It has a range of about 2,200 km and flies at a maximum speed of 490 knots, or 789 km per hour.The negotiations for the purchase of six more P-8I aircraft are yet to begin, a government official in New Delhi said. The purchase of six P-8I was cleared by the Defence Acquisition Council in November 2019, long before the stand-off with an aggressive China along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-sub-killer-p-8i-crafts-coming-to-india-next-year-then-talks-for-six-more/story-Y7jNhu6lZHU4dF2SXraU8M.html
21-07-2020||India||Delhiwale: And then there was music...||They have left. His partner has gone back to her family in Jaipur, and he has returned to his parents’ apartment in Gurugram’s Sector 30. “Everything has changed... it’s like our whole world has crashed down,” he says, talking on WhatsApp video.Indeed, musician Sidharth Gupta, 26, could no longer afford the rent of the second-floor barsati they had been calling home for almost a year, in Malviya Nagar in south Delhi. His resources quickly dried out as live performances, occasional assignments for music production and guitar tuitions had to stop when the coronavirus pandemic hit the country. As soon as the long lockdown was lifted and the Delhi-Haryana interstate border was unsealed, he gave up the place. Now, at his parents’ home in Gurugram, where he was living until one year ago, the music man is trying to pick up the pieces of his pre-corona life.In hindsight, those Malviya Nagar days in the BC (Before Corona) era seem like a dream, a kind of life belonging to artistes devoted to their passions. Sidharth would wake up around 9am. Mornings would always pass in a flurry of household chores that he would divide with his partner—jharoo pocha (sweeping) and cooking. Their terrace residence had two rooms, one of which he used as his “home studio”, and had filled with guitars, synthesizers, keyboards, speakers, and processing equipments.Lunch hour would come and go and as soon as the clock would strike two, his bandmate Utkarsh Varma would arrive by Uber, from his home in Greater Kailash II. Sidharth and Utkarsh have been friends since their school days in Delhi’s DPS RK Puram, and both specialise in electronica and hiphop. They co-founded a band—Shoals—two years ago, and they also produce music for clients. Together in the barsati, they would spend hours creating music scores while Sidharth’s partner, who works in the academia, was usually busy with her own work in the other room. If the daylight outside was changing with the passing of hours, the two musicians wouldn’t know — the home studio had heavy thick curtains drawn across the windows, and the light within was always the same. They would call it off by 8pm, and Utkarsh would leave, except on evenings when they had planned a get-together with common friends. Then, they would all sit in the barsati terrace outside, their bare arms smeared with Odomos cream to keep off the mosquitoes. Those were pleasant nights of chitchats, beer and impromptu music.That used to be the life back then.In the ongoing pandemic-ridden days, Sidharth keeps working with Utkarsh, of course, but they interact over the internet, working separately from their respective houses and exchanging recordings from computer to computer as they move on. He also continues to teach a few students individually through video calls, and takes on projects that can be carried on remotely, such as mixing or production jobs. “But the thing with music,” he says, “is that it is very important to feel the energy of your bandmate right around you.... and yet we have to adapt and change the way we work.”In the new normal, Sidharth says, “my routine involves a lot more practice on the guitar, as I had slowly lost my connection with the instrument when life was busy with lots of projects and jobs.” After practising for a few hours, he eventually shifts his focus to the various commissioned projects. Later, in his room, Sidharth poses for a photo shoot through the phone screen that connects him to this reporter. He sits on the edge of his bed littered with his laptop, synthesizer and all sorts of other instruments, and starts playing the guitar. Rest is music.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-and-then-there-was-music/story-eOlgdxnu2uSf4pbwAuLc2O.html

Samariya also added that if the worker is on duty in a holiday, then he has to be paid 300% of his basic. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal have relaxed labour laws.Panel chairman, BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab, questioned the authenticity of the ministry’s headcount for migrant workers. When the officials said that they have calculated number of passengers in shramik special trains to conclude that 1.09 crore migrant workers have returned home, Mahtab argued that shramik special trains also carried stranded students and tourists.Also read: Rajasthan creates most jobs for migrants under govt planThe panel also insisted that the ministry must come up with special social security card for all migrant workers—those coming through agencies, self-employed or joining factories directly—that will help them getting social security coverage. The panel said that as migrant workers have started returning to cities, the receiving states must make the social security cards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/workers-must-be-paid-for-extra-hours-says-centre/story-URRWomgs8FlYX7FWK2SfTJ.html

The panel was formed after some initial claimants to the reward said they played no role in the arrest of Dubey, the prime accused in the killing of eight policemen in Kanpur’s Bikru village on July 3. The committee comprises superintendent of police (SP), Ujjain City, Rupesh Dwivedi; SP, Ujjain rural, Amrendra Singh; and an additional SP rank officer.The top contender for the reward is Suresh Mali, who sells puja material and flowers at the Mahakal temple, according to people familiar with the matter , who requested anonymity. Mali recognised the gangster entering the temple and alerted the temple’s security staff, they said.Security guard Rahul Sharma is also in the reckoning for the reward, they added. Mali spoke to him about Dubey being present on the temple premises and he, in turn, informed the police. Initially, there were several claimants to the reward. But may changed their statements and admitted that they played no role in the capture of the gangster. Temple security guard Lakhan Yadav and priest Gopal Singh, for instance, initially spoke about the key role they played in the arrest, but could not corroborate their stories.Inspector general of police, Ujjain range, Rakesh Gupta, said the three-member committee was determining the role that various people played in the arrest of Dubey. The committee’s report would be submitted soon, following which Ujjain police would share it with UP police, he said.“There will be at least one civilian, a guard and our jawans who made the arrest. The committee has started working on this,” he said.Suresh Kahar (Mali), the flower seller in Ujjain who first spotted Dubey at the Mahakal temple and informed a guard, said, “I have heard through media that the security guard’s and my name have been selected for the reward. It’s all Mahakal’s blessings.”After Dubey’s arrest, Uttar Pradesh director general of police HC Awasthy said the reward money would be sent to the Madhya Pradesh state police chief to be awarded to those who merited it. MP officials said Kanpur police wrote a letter to Ujjain police, asking for the names of people who deserved the reward.Ujjain’s superintendent of police Manoj Singh was not available for comment on the issue. Inspector general of police, Kanpur range, Mohit Agarwal said he was not aware of any letter going out to the MP police from his office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vikas-dubey-encounter-madhya-pradesh-forms-panel-to-decide-5-lakh-reward/story-Qh8hZYaL48HADvPbyF9j1N.html

Once it is approved by the apex court, the same shall be notified.The state appointed retired Allahabad high court judge Shashi Kant Agarwal on July 12 to investigate the death of the gangster, who faced over 60 criminal cases, in an alleged encounter. “We are appalled at the fact that such a person was released on bail despite having so many cases. As an institution we have failed to keep a person behind bars,” a bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said, hearing a batch of pleas against the killing of Dubey and his associates by the police.The three-judge bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, told the Uttar Pradesh government that it was the state’s duty to uphold the rule of law.Dubey, who faced over 60 criminal cases, was shot dead on July 10 after he tried to escape from police custody while being transported to Kanpur, officials said. He was arrested from Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain the previous day.Dubey and his associates killed eight policemen, including a deputy superintendent of police, in a 15-minute ambush in Bikru village near Kanpur city on July 3 after the police team reached there to carry out a raid and arrest the gangster. Dubey and his aides escaped after the attack.Before Dubey was shot dead — police said he snatched a pistol from an official, fired at the team bringing him back to Kanpur and tried to escape after the vehicle carrying him overturned — five of his alleged accomplices too were killed in separate encounters.The court had indicated last week that it was keen to set up a judicial committee to probe the Dubey killing incident similar to the one it had set up in December 2019 when four rape-murder accused were shot dead in an encounter with Telangana police. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who represented UP DGP told the Court that a judicial enquiry in this case will demoralize the police force. He said the policemen’s rights when faced with a dreaded criminal who slaughtered policemen, must be upheld as well. The bench said, “If rule of law is to be strengthened, it will not demoralize forces…. You (police) must also understand that you are responsible for maintaining rule of law. It requires arrest, trial and sentence, if guilty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dubey-encounter-supreme-court-asks-up-to-keep-ex-judge-dgp-in-panel/story-w5iuBj1lTMcNO12kAsnmUP.html
21-07-2020||India||Rural unemployment inches up, urban figure dips slightly||India’s rural unemployment rate has started moving upward, with the summer crop sowing season drawing to an end.The rural unemployment rate climbed to 7.1% in the week ended July 19 from 6.34% recorded in the previous week, according to fresh data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). This is still below the figure for the week before India went into a lockdown on March 25, but economists feel it will see a gradual climb in the coming weeks, and July may not see job creation picking up much.Overall national unemployment also inched up to 7.94% in the week ended July 19 from 7.44% the previous week. However, urban unemployment remains the bigger concern, as it continues to stay high and its decline has been slower.Also read: Rajasthan creates most jobs for migrants under govt planThe urban joblessness rate came down marginally to 9.78% from 9.92% during the same time period, according to CMIE, reflecting the stubborn formal sector jobs space that is directly influenced by the existing business environment, which is improving very slowly.Economists and experts said the labour market will see a tougher challenge over the next couple of months both in the rural areas and in urban pockets. In rural India, the sowing season is nearing an end. Monsoon is expected to pick up in parts of India, bringing along with it natural calamities such as floods, which will restrict activities in the agriculture sector and partially limit low-end self-employment avenues.In urban areas witnessing sporadic lockdowns, the slow reopening of businesses will limit the faster recovery that the country saw in June.“The sowing season is nearing completion and the strain in the rural labour market will be visible in the coming weeks. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is helpful but may not be able to take pressure off and absorb all the people during the rainy season, who were earlier largely deployed in agricultural activities,” said Arup Mitra, a professor of economics at the Institute of Economic Growth in New Delhi.Also read: Sectors not hit by coronavirus may see spike in hiringCMIE data shows that rural employment scenario is much better in recent weeks, but “we must take note that a higher labour force participation rate in agriculture means only a marginal growth in productivity of labour. Immediate income growth is not there,” Mitra said.The Centre and the states must devise a strategy for the growth of non-farm sector in rural India which can help absorb people in decent jobs, he said. The slow recovery of businesses and the urge to cut cost by employers for survival has a direct impact on employment, Mitra contended.GN Jha, a farmer from Purnia in Bihar, agreed. “Farmers with a good land holding are doing fine, but people who don’t have enough land or working as daily wagers are in real trouble. The lack of cash in hand is a problem, and this will prompt people to go back to urban areas again despite the bad living conditions there. This is where non-farm activities and white-collar jobs in regional level will be of help,” Jha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rural-unemployment-inches-up-urban-figure-dips-slightly/story-cb4SJ2138xqSLR8HlZrs7N.html
21-07-2020||India||Two petitions on artefacts draw the ire of apex court||Petitions filed before the Supreme Court seeking preservation of artifacts recovered from the Ram Mandir site at Ayodhya in Faizabad district, drew the ire of the top court, which, on Monday, termed the plea as an attempt scuttle the November 2019 judgment of the top court awarding the site to the child deity, Ram Lalla Virajman for construction of Ram temple.A bench headed by justice Arun Mishra imposed costs of ₹1 lakh on each of the petitioners, stating that the petitions were frivolous and displayed scant respect for the top court’s verdict.“You are just trying to stop the verdict of this court. Is there no respect for this court’s judgment. We will order CBI investigation into all people involved in this petition”, justice Mishra remarked.Two separate petitions were filed before the top court in June pointing out the news reports about the discovery of ancient artifacts and remains of monuments at the temple site in May. One petition was filed by four persons from Maharashtra associated with cultural organization, Samyak Vishwa Sangh. The other petition was filed by DrAmbedkar Bodhikunja Foundation, a Bihar based NGO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-petitions-on-artefacts-draw-the-ire-of-apex-court/story-Ix4EExpDlBUv7xsBcoC7FK.html
21-07-2020||India||Rajasthan creates most jobs for migrants under govt plan||Rajasthan, whose chief minister Ashok Gehlot is now embroiled in a political battle with his ousted deputy Sachin Pilot, generated the highest employment in the first month of the Centre’s flagship job scheme for migrant workers who have returned home in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Rs 50,000-crore Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyaan, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 20, is spread across 116 districts from six states: Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha. Bihar, the launchpad of the programme, has emerged as the top spender under it.Bihar is home to the second highest number of migrant workers, next only to Uttar Pradesh, who returned home after the government enforced the lockdown for the pandemic starting on March 25. It has spent ~2,558 crore under the programme, and Rajasthan has generated 41.1 million persondays of employment, according to government data accessed by HT.Also read: House schedule may change next sessionThe job scheme was announced after at least 10 million daily wage workers returned home amid the lockdown that sparked fears of loss of livelihood. Policymakers clubbed together 25 schemes to generate jobs through the programme, primarily construction work that uses skilled migrant labourers. Only districts with at least 25,000 returnee migrant workers were eligible for the scheme. The scheme generated 110.2 million days of employment in the first month in all six states, underlining the demand for skilled jobs. The Centre’s other flagship programme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), saw a surge in unskilled employment in the hinterland of India.The six states have collectively spent ~ 9,699.62 crore so far on the scheme that will run for at least 125 days. Rajasthan, geographically India’s largest state, started the MGNREGS season on a tepid note because of the lockdown, but it generated 41.1 million days of work at a cost of ~2,502.67 crore. It has completed 24,000 projects of rural housing and 13,000 pieces of work for laying of optical fiber cables.Bihar, now home to at least three million migrant returnees, has given 18.7 million days of employment. It, too, saw heavy participation in building rural houses for the poor (53,741 projects), followed by laying of fiber optic cable (16,856 projects). Bihar generated fewer than half the days of work that Rajasthan did despite spending more. Jharkhand, is yet to pick up pace. It created just 1.83 million days of employment and spent ~247.92 crore—the lowest among the six states. Experts said the spending patterns and extent of job creation can vary because of different factors. “You need to see which projects are being taken up in higher quantity. Constructing national highways is less labour-intensive...construction of a rural house needs 2-3 workers whereas a cattle shed requires just one man,” said former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra. India’s most populous state, UP, received over 3.5 million migrants in the last three months. Under the scheme, it has generated 27.2 million days of employment and spent ~ 2,142.29 crore. Madhya Pradesh created 18.8 million days of employment, spending ~1,903 crore; Odisha generated 2.44 million days of employment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-creates-most-jobs-for-migrants-under-govt-plan/story-UzInXiEwoYp9aYN89di4TI.html
21-07-2020||India||House schedule may change next session||Indian Parliament’s monsoon session might see a different daily schedule for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to facilitate the participation of the largest number of lawmakers possible from each House while adhering to social distancing norms necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. A senior official familiar with the matter said that while one House could start in the morning at the scheduled time of 11 am, the other House could start its proceedings in the afternoon, to ensure minimum interaction between MPs of the two Houses and adequate space for lawmakers of both. The Lok Sabha’s current strength is 542 and that of the Rajya Sabha is 242. If this happens, it won’t be the first time parliament’s schedule has changed. During the 1962 and 1971 wars and the Emergency, the House proceedings were delayed. “This is also an emergency situation,” argued a second official familiar with the matter. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.

21-07-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine: Health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan says too soon for procurement in India||A deal for a vaccine with the developers of any of the candidates is too premature for India at this point, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday, even as news poured in of successes by at least three teams of researchers, some of whom have already entered into deals with other countries. Early-stage trial results published in the journal Lancet showed the vaccine candidate developed at the University of Oxford is safe and effective. The news was separately followed by successes reported by a Chinese as well as a German vaccine. “I do not know about the details of this particular vaccine candidate but there are more than 200 trials happening around the world currently for developing a vaccine against Covid-19, and all are currently far from the stage of manufacturing. None of these are a ready vaccine, rather, these are merely vaccine candidates,” said minister Harsh Vardhan, while also seeking to assure that India will not lag behind in providing vaccines to its people.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know today“Even though we are closely following every single related development, it will still be too premature to put out the vaccine procurement and roll-out plan of the government in public domain just as yet,” he said.“Having said that, I want to tell people that India government is in touch with all concerned involved in anti-Covid vaccine development, both nationally and internationally. I want to assure our citizens that the government is working to ensure whenever a vaccine is ready, wherever it is ready, it will be made available to our people also. We are also in touch with the World Health Organisation in this regard. We won’t lag behind in any way. We have plans in place and at the right time, we will make the information public,” he added.The minister also said that for the past few months, India is fully focused on managing Covid-19 pandemic in the country, with great success, including expediting drugs and vaccine development initiatives.“We have been expediting all permissions, be it related to investigational therapies such as Remdesivir or granting approvals to our indigenous vaccine candidates. There has been no delay and we have made some of the life-saving drugs available to our people in record time without compromising on regulatory requirements. The government is making concerted efforts, and will take up anything that is seen moving in a positive direction, and is good for its people. We are closely following the whole process,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-health-minister-dr-harsh-vardhan-says-too-soon-for-procurement-in-india/story-QjXAywMZ1ubdpPfcJshtxL.html
21-07-2020||India||AIIMS starts recruiting volunteers for Covaxin trial||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, began recruiting on Monday healthy participants for the continuous phase 1 and 2 trial of Covaxin, jointly developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. It is one of the 12 centres that will test the safety and immunogenicity, the ability of a substance to provoke an immune response in the body, of the vaccine candidate. “In the phase 1 trial, the vaccine will be given to a small number of people to see whether it is safe. In phase 2, we will check the immune response it produces. For that, we will have to check the antibody level of the participants as Covid-19 can be asymptomatic in many. We have a target of 100 patients. The trial vaccine will be given in an area close to the hospital emergency in case someone goes into anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction that can close the airway of a person),” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS Delhi.Apart from the immediate reactions, the participants will also be followed up for 28 days and a longer period to check for any adverse effects.Also read: Vaccine results shot in the arm for Covid fightThe participants will receive three combinations with different adjuvants – an agent that improves the immune response -- of the vaccine in either 3 microgram or 6 microgram doses. Apart from figuring out the correct dose, the investigators will also look at whether the immune response is long-lasting.“We need a vaccine that is first and foremost safe, the triggers and immune response, and that immunity lasts for at least a year or two. If it just lasts for six weeks, then it is of no use. Fortunately, from what we have learnt so far, the mutations in the virus have not been very significant or the antigenic drift is not as fast as the flu for which vaccine has to be taken every year. The mutations reported so far have not been in the spike protein that is the target of vaccines,” said Dr Guleria.In just 24 hours after seeking applications from people, the hospital received 1,000 applications against its requirement of 100 volunteers. Dr Guleria said the centre may be able to finish the trial in two to three months if the screening goes well. “Normally, a vaccine takes about 10 years to develop. That is because the different phases of the trial are conducted one after the other after evaluation of the results. It is a financial risk if everything is done simultaneously as all vaccine candidates do not work and scientists might have to go back to the drawing board. But, in this case, everything is happening simultaneously. Even as the effectiveness of the vaccine is being studied, manufacturing capacity is also being built,” said Dr Guleria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-starts-recruiting-volunteers-for-covaxin-trial/story-yGOb69cBQiZHmgUpu4bWWO.html
21-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India crossed the 40,000 cases-in-a-day mark for the first time on Sunday. Should one be worried?In the month between June 20 and July 19, the country added 705,097 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to the HT dashboard. That translates to 63.14% of the 1,116,597 cases it saw (cumulatively) till July 19.In the same period, it saw 14,209 deaths, 51.6% of the 27,487 cumulative deaths till July 19.But there is good news as well. The period saw 472,179, or 67.42% of the 700,324 recoveries from Covid-19 till July 19. On June 20, India’s recovery rate was 55.44%. On July 19, it was 62.71%. On June 20, India’s death rate (measured by the case fatality rate) was 3.22%. On July 19, it was 2.46%.Even when measured as a proportion of closed cases (deaths plus recoveries), the death rate has seen an improvement between June 20 and July 19 — from 5.5% to 3.77%.India had 170,077 active cases on June 20; and 388,786 on July 19.Also read: Delhi records lowest Covid-19 cases reported since June 1Irrespective of whatever else the numbers prove (or don’t), they clearly establish that: one, we seem to be getting better at saving lives (which, a previous instalment of this column wrote, was in evidence even globally) and two, the number of daily cases has been increasing.The first is important because it establishes that the increase in daily deaths (now consistently close to 700 as compared to consistently around 400 a month ago) ,while worrying, is offset by the fact that the proportion of those recovering is rising. The second is important because, when disaggregated across states, cities, and districts, it tells administrations where hospital beds and health care intervention are most needed.The increase in the number of daily cases has also come against the backdrop of increased testing. India was conducting an average of 177,439 tests on June 20. That increased to an average of 327,048 tests a week on July 20 (all averages are five-day ones). I’ve previously written about the relationship between cases and tests: as testing increases, the number of cases as a proportion of the tests (a.k.a. the positivity rate) increases to a point, then plateaus, and finally starts declining. Delhi, for instance, is clearly seeing a decline — as is Mumbai (although the Maharashtra numbers are now being driven to new highs by cases from the larger Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, and other parts of the state). Tamil Nadu is continuing to identify more new cases as it tests more (the state has carried out the most tests in India in absolute terms, around 2 million), but its positivity rate has come down from its peaks and continues to remain in the 10-12% range. On Sunday, for instance, the state saw 4,979 new cases, but carried out 52,993 tests, translating to a positivity rate of 9.39% (a number that is also within the range acknowledged by experts around the world that signifies adequate testing).Also read | India’s fatality rate lower than global average: GovtOther states, too, are seeing an increase in cases as they test more. Many of them — and this has been my refrain for weeks now — are still not testing enough, though, which is reflected in their positivity rates (either too low, without showing the waxing and the waning that comes with aggressive and adequate testing, as in Uttar Pradesh; or too high, as in West Bengal). Interestingly, in both states, the positivity rate has been increasing. The average daily positivity rate for the past week for Uttar Pradesh was 4.3%, and West Bengal, 14.4%, which is higher than the cumulative positivity rates in the two states — 3.3% for Uttar Pradesh, and 6% for West Bengal.Bihar is no different — its cumulative positivity rate is 6.96% and its average for the past week, 14.2%. Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal are three of India’s four most populous states (at first, third and fourth positions respectively; Maharashtra is in second).Which means the number of daily cases in India can be expected to increase even more over the next month, maybe even longer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-SWYE8nwWT76TD1yGMxCVVP.html

India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted thunderstorm with moderate to heavy intensity rain and gusty wind with a speed of 40-70km per hour over the national capital till 2 am, news agency ANI reported. The national capital is likely to witness heavy rains at isolated places over the next two days, the India Meteorological Department had said earlier in the day.Widespread moderate rains are predicted for the rest of Delhi and neighbouring areas, it said.“Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy showers very likely over Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh during the next two days,” it said in a weather forecast.“The rainfall intensity and distribution are very likely to decrease significantly thereafter,” the IMD said.The convergence of moist easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal and southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea is likely to continue over northwest India for another two-three days, weather experts said.The monsoon though is also running through the region. These two factors together can lead to moderate to heavy rains in Delhi-NCR in the next 24 hours, they said.The IMD’s regional forecasting centre predicted moderate rains along with winds gusting up to 40 kilometers per hour towards Monday night.During the day, sporadic light rains and cloudy weather kept the mercury in check in the national capital.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides official figures for the city, recorded a maximum of 32.6 degrees Celsius, two notches below the normal.The mercury oscillated between 30 degrees Celsius and 33 degrees Celsius in most parts of the city.On Sunday, the first heavy monsoon rainfall in Delhi claimed four lives, including that of a mini-truck driver who got trapped in a waterlogged underpass.According to the IMD, the Safdarjung Observatory had recorded 74.8 mm rainfall on Sunday.The Ridge and Lodhi Road weather station recorded 86 mm and 81.2 mm rainfall, respectively.Rainfall recorded below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate, and above 64.5mm is heavy, according to the IMD.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thunderstorm-rain-in-parts-of-delhi-heavy-downpour-likely-over-next-two-days/story-oB3FZgVioNLaoCVbbLsJhM.html
21-07-2020||India||29-year-old man is Goa’s youngest Covid-19 victim||A 29-year-old male Covid-19 patient in Goa died of the infection on Monday becoming the youngest victim of the disease in the state, health authorities confirmed. The patient who was believed to have been ailing with liver and heart issues became the state’s 23rd Covid-19 victim. Goa has recorded 3,853 cases till date and while the state was recording daily cases in double digits through the month of June, they have since moved to triple digits since the start of July giving a renewed headache to the state that was once credited with keeping the figures low. Health authorities have expressed concern that manufacturing units located in Goa’s industrial estates have become super spreaders of the disease with a single pharma company contributing 136 positive cases and prompting reprimand from the health secretary. Covid-19 cases from industrial units also spark fears of the disease spreading in the localities they hail from. On a positive note, two people above the age of 90 have recovered from the virus and have since been discharged after being in the hospital for 23 days. “A 90-year old woman who was admitted in a critical condition and, suffering from dementia and malnutrition steadily improved under the able treatment and care of the COVID Hospital doctors and staff,” the state government said in a statement. She was the second 90-year old to survive after a 91-year-old was cured and discharged a couple of weeks back. The Mormugao taluka of Goa has been placed under a week-long lockdown even as the rest of the state emerged from a weekend lockdown. Mormugao is the worst affected taluka in the state and accounts for more than one-third of the state’s Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-year-old-man-is-goa-s-youngest-covid-19-victim/story-ioCmabAaLeKC1mVKJP6tOM.html

I have moved CAT [the Central Administrative Tribunal] and am awaiting justice,” she said.A second official, who also works in the CAG’s office, said, “She was dismissed from service immediately after the finance ministry gave its approval in May this year.” Email queries sent to CAG and the ministry of finance did not elicit any response.According to a PTI report published in HT on September 6, 2017, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) booked the principal director for allegedly diverting funds of the Coffee Board during her posting there.It said, quoting the first information report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation, that Subramaniam was charged with allegedly diverting Rs 16.2 crore of the Coffee Board funds into mutual funds, causing a loss of Rs 53.3 lakh to the organisation and corresponding gain to herself during her posting as its director, finance. The case pertained to the period between 1998 and 2003.Subramaniam on Monday said, “No single officer could take such a financial decision alone. All decisions pertaining to financial matters were taken collectively and with complete knowledge of my superiors. No money is traced to any personal or individual account. Entire money remains with the government. I have been framed for some notional loss...Truth will come out if relevant documents are produced.” A third official, working at the finance ministry, said, “The action has been taken after a thorough investigation on this matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cag-dismisses-principal-director/story-I7ZMGh9UnWDYeAhMOS0AEL.html

Apart from essential services, all other activities will be prohibited. Lockdown will be imposed on Sunday and the day either preceding or following Sunday i.e. Saturday or Monday which will be decided by the district crisis management group in such districts. The night curfew will be imposed in all the districts from 8 pm to 5 am,” said an official communiqué quoting the CM.However, there was no official information about the districts with high infection. A complete lockdown has been observed on Sundays across the state since July 8.The announcement came on a day when the state reported 710 new Covid-19 cases, taking the count to 23,310 including 6,888 active cases. With 17 more fatalities recorded during the day, the death toll rose to 738, according to the state health department bulletin released late on Monday evening.Indore district reported the maximum number of cases (6,115), followed by Bhopal (4,363 cases), Gwalior (1,706) and Morena (1,332). There are least six other districts which have more than 500 Covid cases each.Of the738 deaths, 295 have been recorded in Indore district, 138 in Bhopal and 71 in Ujjain.As per the communique released by the CM’s office, “all offices of the state and Union government will function with 30 to 50 % capacity except for the infection-free districts where offices will function to their full strength.Private offices and commercial establishments will also function with 30% to 50% capacity. In case of any corona patient is found at private offices and commercial establishments, they will be closed for 7 days.”The CM said action would be taken against any government officer and employee who didn’t wear masks, didn’t follow physical distancing or violated the Corona guidelines in any way.A review of rising corona infections in the state revealed that one of the main reasons for the spread of infection was the gathering of people.The CM made an appeal to people to celebrate all upcoming festivals including Raksha Bandhan and Eid at home. “No permission will be granted for celebration of festivals in public”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-to-impose-2-day-lockdown-every-week-in-districts-with-high-covid-19-incidence/story-yigJ9J07069C9DTXmOICsL.html

The drills also came at a time when tensions have mounted over China’s activities in the South China Sea, where the US Navy has just conducted a major exercise that involved two carrier strike groups.“The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group is transiting through IOR. During the passage, #IndianNavy units undertook Passage Exercise (PASSEX) with #USNavy. Indian Navy had also conducted similar PASSEXs with #JMSDF (Japan) and #FrenchNavy in recent past,” the Indian Navy tweeted.The Eastern Fleet of the Indian Navy is currently carrying out manoeuvres near Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the warships that took part in the exercise were from that fleet, said a second official, also on condition of anonymity.Also read: US backs ASEAN on South China Sea, challenges China’s predatory world viewWhile operating together, the US and Indian naval forces conducted high-end exercises designed to maximize training and interoperability, including air defence, the US 7th Fleet said in a statement. It said the Nimitz carrier strike group’s operations were designed to provide security throughout the region while building partnerships with friends and allies.The 7th Fleet is the largest of the US Navy’s forward deployed fleets.“Naval engagements such as these exercises improve the cooperation of US and Indian maritime forces and contribute to both sides’ ability to counter threats at sea, from piracy to violent extremism. These engagements also present opportunities to build upon the pre-existing strong relationship between the US and India and allow both countries to learn from each other,” it added.The Nimitz carrier strike group, consisting of flagship USS Nimitz, Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Princeton and Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Sterett and USS Ralph Johnson took part in the drills. India was represented by INS Rana, INS Sahyadri, INS Shivalik and INS Kamorta.“It was a privilege to operate with the Indian Navy,” said Rear Admiral Jim Kirk, commander of the Nimitz carrier strike group.Also read: US rejects Chinese claims in South China Sea in new escalationThe Indian Air Force has deployed half a squadron (eight to 10) of its Jaguar fighters at the Car Nicobar air base, in a show of strength amidst the tense confrontation between Indian and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, said a third official.The IAF has raised its guard along the northern border to deal with any military provocation by the Chinese forces and forward bases have been ordered to be on their highest state of alert.The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are more than 1,200 km from mainland India. A significant volume of China’s oil imports passes through the Malacca Strait, which is south-east of these islands.The Nimitz carrier strike group entered the Indian Ocean from the Malacca Strait and is on its way to the Persian Gulf.“A passage exercise is normally undertaken whenever an opportunity arises, in contrast to pre-planned maritime drills. While the Malabar exercise with the US will be conducted later this year, it is always good to exercise with like-minded navies and exchange best practices whenever there is a chance,” said naval affairs expert Captain DK Sharma (retd).The navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. It has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points under its mission-based deployment and the vessels could be diverted for any mission.Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.The nuclear-powered USS Nimitz, one of the largest warships on the planet, is returning from an operational deployment in South China Sea. A carrier strike group led by USS Ronald Reagan was part of the US drills in South China Sea.The US deployment to South China Sea came after China’s People’s Liberation Army-Navy conducted drills in the contested waters, provoking a sharp reaction from neighbouring countries and Washington. The US Navy has said its operations in South China Sea are designed to support a “free and open” Indo-Pacific.The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 17. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year.The formal invitation to Australia is expected to be extended after some time in view of delicate negotiations between India and China on disengagement and de-escalation to end their standoff along the LAC.China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-indian-us-warships-conduct-maritime-drills-in-indian-ocean/story-WwAcbU0FyKbrwcJLr05aGP.html
21-07-2020||India||LAC stand-off :Rahul attacks PM, BJP hits back||New Delhi: Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Monday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the border standoff in eastern Ladakh, saying that the Chinese were targeting the PM’s image as a strong leader, and that he feared that Modi was succumbing to it.“They (Chinese) understand that in order for Narendra Modi to be an effective politician, in order for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhappan (56) inch’, and this is the real idea the Chinese are attacking,” Gandhi said in the second part of a series of short videos on the India-China border face-off he released on Monday. His reference is to a comment made by Modi in the run up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where he referred to his 56-inch chest -- to reiterate his strongman image. That “strongman image” is Inia’s “biggest weakness” now, Gandhi tweeted in a message accompanying the video. His comments drew a swift riposte from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda, who said that the Congress leader preferred to believe the Chinese army over India’s own government, and described him as “weak on facts and strong on mud-slinging”.In his first video released on Friday, Gandhi claimed that a “troubled economy, foreign policy and neighbourhood” had prompted China to adopt an aggressive posture against India.Titled China’s Strategic Game Plan, the second video, which is two-and-a-half minutes long, is Gandhi’s take on how the Chinese have triggered the border issue to put pressure on Prime Minister Modi.“It is simply not a border issue. The worry I have is that Chinese are sitting in our territory today. Chinese don’t do anything without thinking about it strategically. In their mind they have mapped out the world and they are trying to shape the world. That’s the scale of what they are doing,” he said.“And they (Chinese) are thinking of putting pressure in a very particular way. And what they are doing is that they are attacking his (Modi’s) image... They are basically telling Mr Narendra Modi that if you do not do what we say, we will destroy the idea of Mr Narendra Modi as a strong leader,” Gandhi claimed.He then went on to ask how Modi will react to the situation.“Will he take them on? Will he take on the challenge and say absolutely not, I’m the Prime Minister of India. I do not care about my image, I’m going to take you on. Or will he succumb to them?” asked the former Congress chief. “The worry I have so far is that the Prime Minister has succumbed.”The BJP’s Nadda, in a series of tweets, said the video showed Gandhi wanted a weak India and a strong China.“We saw yet another (failed) edition of ‘Project RG Relaunch’ today. @RahulGandhi Ji was, as usual, weak on facts and strong on mud-slinging,” Nadda tweeted.“Why does one dynasty want a weak India and a strong China? Many leaders in Congress also disapprove of one dynasty’s shenanigans!” he added, in a reference to the Nehru-Gandhi family.“For years, one dynasty has been trying to destroy PM @narendramodi. Sadly for them, PM Modi’s connect with 130 crore Indians is deep-rooted. He lives and works for them,” Nadda wrote. “Those who want to destroy him will end up only further destroying their own party,” he said in a fourth tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-stand-off-rahul-attacks-pm-bjp-hits-back/story-QHRCQjtgNjZkZjdZ1WtrNK.html
21-07-2020||India||Priest at Tirumala temple dies of Covid||Calls for a temporary closure of the Venkateshwara temple in Tirumala intensified following the death of a former chief priest due to Covid-19 on Monday.Srinivasa Murthy Deekshitulu (75), one of the 18 priests of the Tirumala temple who had tested positive for Covid-19 last week, succumbed to the infection at Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS). B Vengamma, SVIMS director, said Deekshitulu, who was admitted to the hospital on Saturday, had comorbid conditions of diabetes and kidney-related ailments.Priests and employees of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) have called for a temporary closure of the temple to the public to check the spread of the virus.Deekshitulu, who belonged to Archakam Peddinti family, one of the four families of hereditary priests associated with the Tirumala temple for centuries, had served as the chief priest for over two decades. He, along with three other priests, was forced to retire in 2018 during the Telugu Desam Party government. After the YSR Congress government came to power, he had been participating in the temple rituals although he was not restored to the office.The TTD decided against following the specific procedure for last rites of hereditary priests due to the ongoing pandemic.The TTD Staff and Workers United Front, affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, submitted a representation to TTD executive officer Anil Kumar Singhal requesting that visits to the temple be temporarily suspended in the wake of a growing number of positive cases on the Tirumala hills.The TTD staff pointed out that more than 1,000 positive cases of Covid-19 were reported in Tirupati town and around 100 employees of the TTD have tested positive. “These employees can end up infecting devotees when they go up the hill to Tirumala to perform duties. In this context, employees are all very worried,” the representation stated.Soon after the death of Deekshitulu, TTD trust board chairman YV Subba Reddy flew to Vijayawada to hold a meeting with chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to discuss the demand from various sections of the TTD for the closure of the temple.Subba Reddy had told the reporters last week that 15 of 50 priests at the Tirumala temple have tested positive, besides 140 other TTD employees, since the temple was re-opened on June 8.Honorary head priest of the temple AV Ramana Deekshitulu found fault with the TTD authorities for continuing to allow pilgrims despite a surge in Covid-19 cases in Tirumala.He alleged that the TTD officials were obediently following anti-hereditary archaka (priest) and anti-Brahmin policy of the TDP. “Disaster if this continues. Please take action,” he appealed to chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priest-at-tirumala-temple-dies-of-covid/story-U3mTLeisS0xRjkQ14brkWJ.html

21-07-2020||India||Ram temple trust’s invite to PM Modi sparks political row||The timing of the start of construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya — the country is in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic — and an invitation extended to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend it by the trust mandated to oversee the construction have sparked a political debate.A day after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar criticised the timing of the bhoomi pujan, set for August 5, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh questioned the invitation extended to Modi to the ceremony by the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, which was formed last year to construct the temple.Singh said the Centre had appointed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders as members of the trust while overlooking religious figures such as the Shankaracharyas.If the Prime Minister lays the foundation stone of the temple on August 5, all Shankaracharyas and Swami Ramnareshacharya ji of the Ramanandi sect should be invited to the function and made members of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said.He supported Pawar, who has criticised the timing of the function. “You are right, Pawar saheb. Wish Modi-Shah had paid heed to what you said, then the situation of the country would have been different,” he tweeted in Hindi, referring to the Prime Minister and home minister Amit Shah.Also read | Row over invitation to PM Modi for Ram Temple bhoomi pujan unwarranted: VHPPawar, whose party is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi ruling coalition in Maharashtra, together with the Shiv Sena and Congress, said on Sunday that some people think building a temple in Ayodhya will help eradicate the Covid-19 pandemic.“We are all thinking of how to fight the battle against Covid-19 but some people think that pandemic will be mitigated by building a temple. Our priority is to see how to improve the economy which has been affected due to lockdown,” he told a press conference in Mumbai.His remarks exposed fissures within the Maha Vikas Aghadi. On Monday, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut claimed his party had “laid the road” to the Ram temple and removed the main roadblocks in its construction “not for politics but out of faith and for the cause of Hindutva”.Raut said Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray always visits Ayodhya. “Uddhav Thackeray always goes to Ayodhya. He went when he was not chief minister and he went there after becoming chief minister too,” Raut said when asked whether the chief minister will visit Ayodhya on August 5 when Modi is likely to attend the bhoomi pujan.“The ties of the Shiv Sena and Ayodhya are intact. It is not a political relationship. We do not go to Ayodhya for politics and did not go there for politics in the past too. Rather, it is the Shiv Sena which laid the road to the Ram temple,” he said.Asked about Pawar’s remark, Raut said, “The fight against coronavirus is being fought by our doctors in white attire, whom we call devdoot (messenger of God) is only what I can say.”The VHP, which has been at the forefront of the campaign to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya on a site Hindu groups believe marks the birthplace of the warrior-god, defended the invitation to Modi. It said the ceremony will be performed in line with all laid-down protocols that need to be followed to avoid transmission of the coronavirus.Alok Kumar, the international working president of the VHP, said the controversy over the invitation to the PM, who is yet to confirm his presence, was unwarranted.“There is no confirmation on who all will be present for the ceremony. The invitations have been sent out by the trust after deciding the names unanimously,” he said. GRAND PLANSAfter some changes are made to the existing model, the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya would become the third largest Hindu temple in the world, said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, designated successor of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust. Architects Nikhil Sompura and Ashish Sompura, the sons of the project’s chief architect Chandrakant Sompura, will prepare the new design.“The architects have presented a rough sketch of the new layout before Mahant Nritya Gopal Das,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das. “The temple’s height is likely to be 161 feet, width between 270 and 280 feet and length anything between 268 and 300 feet,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-trust-s-invite-to-pm-sparks-political-row/story-G0uYdLGGPjQQwsz0JUOwwL.html
21-07-2020||India||IAF to induct 5 Rafale jets on July 29||NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force will induct its first batch of five Rafale fighter jets from France at the Ambala air base on July 29 if weather permits, an IAF spokesperson said on Monday.“The IAF’s air and ground crews have undergone comprehensive training on the aircraft, including its highly-advanced weapons systems and are fully operational now. Efforts will focus on operationalisation of the aircraft at the earliest,” said Wing Commander Indranil Nandi. A formal induction ceremony will take place next month, he added.The air force is inducting the fighters at a time of heightened military tensions with China. Hindustan Times on Monday reported that the IAF could deploy its new Rafale fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, where Indian and Chinese forces were locked in a tense border confrontation for weeks before a protracted process of disengagement began and is still ongoing. India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases.Acting on a special request by the IAF, France has accelerated the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India --- five jets are coming instead of four that were originally planned to be delivered in the first batch.Preparations are currently on to fly the jets to India with a stopover at Al Dhafra air base near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab EmiratesThe French air force will refuel the Indian fighters using its Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft on their way to Al Dhafra from where aerial refueling support is expected to be provided by the IAF’s Russian Ilyushin-78 refuellers.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the IAF’s combat capabilities.The possible deployment of Rafale fighters in Ladakh could be discussed at the IAF commanders’ conference in New Delhi from July 22 to 24 where top air force brass is expected to focus on the ongoing border row with China, the IAF’s preparedness and new purchases that have to be made fast.“During the three-day conference, the discussions would take stock of the current operational scenario and deployments. The plan of action for operational capability enhancement of the IAF in the next decade will also be discussed,” Nandi said. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria will chair the conference. IAF in the Next Decade is the theme of the conference.According to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected in April-May 2022. Future deliveries will also be expedited.France handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8 last year.“Any capability in terms of air-to-air missiles and electronic warfare systems will be very critical in a future air engagement. And the Rafale brings that capability to the table for good measure,” said Air Marshal KK Nohwar (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-to-induct-5-rafale-jets-on-july-29/story-MhrcbIGHR3SiV4GPY1emnJ.html
21-07-2020||India||‘Development matrix’ may define share given to states||The 15th Finance Commission is in the process of devising a “development matrix” of states based on their social indicators, especially in health and education, which will likely serve as a new parameter to decide the transfer of financial resources, such as taxes and grants, to them. Finance commissions rely on a host of yardsticks in deciding a state’s share in the nation’s financial resources, such as taxes. Predominantly, income criteria, such as per capita incomes and growth, determine who gets what. Poorer and disadvantaged states get a bigger chunk of the resource pie. “But per capita incomes are not good enough a basis compared to a holistic development index, not that the two of them are coterminous. So, we felt that a development matrix will be a better guide,” chairman of the 15th Finance Commission, NK Singh, told HT. A “development matrix”, as is being considered, will for the first time bring the levels of social development, especially access to health-care and schooling, of states into the framework of how resources are distributed. Analysts say this could address deficits in crucial areas, such as health-care, provided states spend the additional resources for the purpose they are given. Also read | Boost to rural economy: Record sowing points to good harvestThe Constitution, through Article 280 to 281, provides for finance commissions as a mechanism for division of taxes and revenues vertically i.e. between the Centre and states, and horizontally, i.e. among all states, based on levels of development, prosperity and regional needs. To decide on a state’s share of resources, finance commissions usually rely on parameters such as income distance, population size, geographical location and forest cover, etc, which are then assigned weightages. Income distance is the difference between average per capita incomes and the per capita income of an individual state in question. It gives the most direct measure of how rich or poor a state is. Forest cover is included as a parameter because it is assumed that heavily forested states will have less land to devote to factories, hurting growth. Such states qualify for additional resources.“If the development matrix is put in place, states with poor health and education facilities will qualify for additional resources. That’s the implication and it is a welcome move,” said NR Bhanumurthy, the vice-chancellor of Bengaluru Dr BR Ambedkar School of Economics. Economists widely hold that, over time, poorer states should come up to the level of richer states, as richer states hit their growth limits. They call this “income convergence”.Singh said the dilemma was that in India, poorer states weren’t catching up with richer states. “We need to know what is behind this,” he said, referring to poor investment in social infrastructure.Also read: Centre’s rural spending doubles amid Covid-19 pandemicSingh said the 15th Finance Commission was therefore weighing the idea of including sectoral initiatives, such as health and education, in the development matrix. “Would sectoral initiatives be helpful? And this is the idea the Finance Commission is toying with and exploring...if this could be one way of overcoming the past legacy while trying to aim for a greater convergence by not just relying on income distance but on some other parameters,” Singh said. The Singh-led 15th Finance Commission has already submitted its first report to the government for the 2020-21 period. It then received an extension till October 30 to submit its final report covering financial years 2021-22 to 2025-26 (April-March).Some southern states, including Andhra Pradesh, have been unhappy with the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission — the body is mandated to take into account the 2011 census instead of the 1971 census. This, some southern states feel, will result in penalising them for keeping population growth stable, while rewarding the northern states. In 2018, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu said states like his would be “penalised”, and the new development matrix could lead to similar concerns from states that have done better on social indicators.“The commission will uphold the principles of efficiency as well as equity,” Singh said, when asked whether the new system would address these concerns.Indian states broadly fall into high, middle and low-income categories and unlike China, poorer states have showed no signs of moving up the income ladder towards a national income convergence. “One of the reasons is, we invest so little on health and education. These areas have an intrinsic value of their own, but also help economic growth. Including non-income parameters by the finance commission will be a significant shift,” said S Mahendra Dev, director of the Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research.India’s overall health spending has consistently lagged global averages, leading to poor health outcomes. The total expenditure on health by the Centre and states for 2019-20 was Rs 2.6 lakh crore, or just 1.29% of GDP, according to official data. This includes salaries, gross budgetary support and transfers to states under programmes such as the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. Of the total expenditure, the Centre’s share is 25%.By comparison, the UK spent 9.6% of its GDP on health in 2019-20, according to the OECD.Bhanumurthy said one problem is that if states with poor health and education infrastructure were to be given additional money to develop these facilities, there is still no mechanism to ensure that states use them specifically for these purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/development-matrix-may-define-share-given-to-states/story-qSOrqmjpymTuLpIRO4zQKO.html
21-07-2020||India||Rajasthan revokes general consent for CBI to probe cases in state||The Congress government in Rajasthan has withdrawn the general consent accorded to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases in the state, making it mandatory for the central agency to seek the state government’s express permission before investigating cases within its borders.The Rajasthan home department issued the orders on July 19, a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanded a CBI probe into the allegations by the Congress in Rajasthan that leaked audio tapes on social media proved the BJP was in collusion with rebel Congress leaders in an attempt to bring down the Ashok Gehlot government.“The government revokes all previous general consents issued by the state government under section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946,” the notification issued by the home department said.“In view of revocation of all previous general consents issues earlier vide notifications, prior consent of government of Rajasthan shall be required to be taken on case to case basis for investigation of any offence or class of offence under section 3 of the DSPE Act, 1946 by the DSPE,” it added.Rohit Kumar Singh, Rajasthan’s additional chief secretary, home, said: “Its administrative provisions were already there, it was notified yesterday [Sunday].”In 2018, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh — all states ruled by non-BJP parties — withdrew the general consent to CBI, alleging that the Centre was misusing the agency to harass opponents. The government of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, which came into power in Andhra 2019, decided to reverse the decision.CBI comes under the DSPE Act and it requires states to give the agency a general consent to act against central government employees within a state as public order and police are under the purview of state governments, which routinely renew the permission.Officials said in June 1990, too, the then Rajasthan government refused to give such ‘’ general consent’’ to the Centre, according to news agency PTI.The BJP questioned the Rajasthan government’s move, saying there was an “indirect emergency” in the state. “The way the state government misused the SOG and the ACB and it was afraid of CBI action... There is something fishy,” BJP state president Satish Poonia told reporters.There was no immediate response from the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-revokes-general-consent-for-cbi/story-UfxWQ2Wno0S51nCT8TbDsJ.html
21-07-2020||India||SC notice to Akshardham Temple Trust on petition by green activist||The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Akshardham Temple Trust, admitting an appeal by environmental activist Manoj Mishra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, an organisation founded to revive and protect the river and its floodplains, challenging a National Green Tribunal order of 2019. The notice was issued on July 13.Mishra, in an appeal to the Supreme Court, pointed out that the NGT had in effect overturned its own decision directing payment of compensation of 5% of project cost by the temple trust for seeking post-facto environmental clearance for expansion of its complex on the floodplains following a letter by the temple authorities in 2019.In 2013, Mishra moved NGT against the expansion of a cultural complex on Akshardham premises without prior environmental clearance, which is mandatory under the law.The temple trust, known as the Bochasanvasi Sri Akshar Purshottam Sanstha, applied for an environmental clearance after beginning construction on what is categorised as a flood zone recognized by NGT’s own principal committee as an area likely to be submerged during a one in 25-year flood in the absence of an embankment.NGT, after hearing the matter, directed in 2015 that the Akshardham Temple Trust pay an environmental compensation of 5% of project cost for violating the environment clearance norms.It had also directed a principal committee constituted by NGT with river and water experts from Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi; Delhi University; Jawaharlal Nehru University and others to ascertain whether the construction was indeed on the Yamuna floodplains.The Akshardham Temple Trust sent a letter on November 1, 2019 wherein it claimed that NGT’s 2015 order doesn’t stand. “It is humbly submitted that the above case has now become infructuous as no view has been expressed by the principal committee and the undersigned is suffering for no reason whatsoever. That the regular statutory renewals are being hampered due to pendency of this case and both the SC decision as well as the other earlier Manoj Mishra case on Yamuna categorically held that the Akshardham temple is a sanctioned structure…”According to Mishra’s appeal in SC, based on Akshardham Temple Trust’s letter, NGT had reopened the case and without hearing any objections by the appellant, directed that no payment was required to be made by the trust in the “absence of any violation.”“During the hearing, SC asked how can the Tribunal pass such an order based on a letter? Where does the Tribunal get the power to overturn a decision based on a letter?” said Mishra.“The expansion was not on the flood plains. It was in ‘O’zone (river zone). The expansion was on already sanctioned space. The judges in SC did say that a letter cannot be the basis for an order but we will soon submit a detailed response to all the contentions,” said Sanjay Upadhyay, advocate representing the Akshardham Temple Trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-akshardham-temple-trust-on-petition-by-green-activist/story-451m2RwUh9bLfChhJa8a4K.html
21-07-2020||India||Delhi flooding: Govt fixes responsibility, blame game on||The Public Works Department (PWD), municipal corporations and the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) have been asked to identify new waterlogging-prone areas, especially those in proximity to a construction site, the Delhi government said on Monday. A group of chief engineers has also been constituted for the purpose, it said.The direction came a day after Delhi saw one of its worst rain crisis with several areas being inundated and two people drowning on waterlogged stretches. Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev held an emergency meeting on Monday on the city’s monsoon preparedness plan. The chief secretary said that the head of the departments (HoDs) of the agencies responsible for tackling monsoon related problems will be held responsible for any lapses, officers who attended the meeting said. The Public Works Department, the MCDs, New Delhi municipal council (NDMC), Delhi Jal Board, and the revenue and flood and irrigation departments are responsible for cleaning and maintaining roads and drains in the city.Also read: Why does Delhi flood every Monsoon?“All agency heads of MCDs, NDMC, DJB, PWD and the divisional commissioner have been directed to work in unison. A group of chief engineers of these agencies has been formed to jointly inspect all vulnerable points and take coordinated action,” Dev said.The chief secretary said all the stipulations of the ‘Flood Control Order, 2020’ released on June 26 should be followed without any negligence or compromise. “Directions were also issued that the 24x7 control room must be kept operational at all times without fail. Besides, relief for any loss of life or property must be expeditiously extended, preferably same day,” Dev said.A senior official who attended the meeting said the incident in which a person drowned in the submerged road under the Minto Bridge on Sunday was also discussed in the meeting. “At Minto Bridge, the problem arose because of an embankment resulting from some construction activity. Apart from engineering solutions, at least four temporary pumps have also been set up there to drain out water,” the official said.In an interview to HT, Delhi’s PWD minister Satyendar Jain blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the Minto Bridge mess. “I think the waterlogging at Minto Bridge was because the BJP people deliberately closed the drain in front of the BJP headquarters. They had done it last year as well and we had to get it opened up. Why else would the water not drain out despite having four pumps working there?” he said.RP Singh, national general secretary BJP, refuted Jain’s claim. “These are baseless allegations. The BJP headquarter was constructed only three years ago but waterlogging problem near Minto Road has persisted for long. The truth is that out of five pumps there, only one was functioning. The AAP is in the power in Delhi for the last six years and yet there are 159 places in the city which get inundated every monsoon. They should make water harvesting pits at Minto Road to control flooding. They don’t do their work but blame others for problems.”The minister said nearly 1,500 pumps – including mobile pumps – have been deployed across the city to prevent waterlogging. The political blame game which followed the Sunday’s incidents continued on Monday with Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta holding the Delhi government’s PWD and DJB responsible for waterlogging in the city. “If the Delhi government had taken its responsibilities seriously in time, then preparations for the monsoon would have been done and no person would have died today nor would the roof have been snatched from anyone’s head. The chief minister is asking to not indulge in blame game, on the other hand his own MLAs are making baseless statements,” Gupta said. Raghav Chadha, DJB’s vice-chairperson and Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Rajendra Nagar, said that the MCDs are yet to complete desilting of all stormwater drains in the city.“The Delhi government is doing the desilting works of the drains and now the MCDs should also finish their work. At Anna Nagar, the houses that were washed away in Sunday’s downpour were built on the BJP-ruled South MCD’s drain number 12. Even the Minto Bridge stormwater drain is under the MCD,” Chadha said in a press conference.Mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) Anamika Mithilesh said initially all the staff was engaged in coronavirus related duties but still the corporation floated tenders for desilting process to start the work.“Entire process was delayed as labourers were not available in the city and our departmental staff such as sanitation workers, DBC workers were busy in sanitisation exercises; collection and transportation of garbage from containment areas. Even the machines such as jetting machine, lifters, tippers were engaged in coronavirus related works. All our drains are clean now and the allegations made by the AAP leader are baseless,” she said. Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that he conducted an inspection of all the areas on Monday where waterlogging happened and found that ghat drains were not cleaned by the PWD there.“The PWD did not complete desilting of drains. Most of these are bigger drains and smaller drains of civic bodies discharge water in them. Since these drains are not desilted, the water flows back in MCD drains and inundated the area. Instead of blaming MCDs, the government should do its work properly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-flooding-govt-fixes-responsibility-blame-game-on/story-EL70xdgzocoywBnDus31XP.html
21-07-2020||India||Odisha Human Rights body asks vigilance cop to pay Rs 5 lakh for framing official in graft case||Holding a former deputy SP of the state vigilance department guilty of framing a junior engineer in a fake bribery case, the Odisha Human Rights Commission has asked the state government to recover Rs 5 lakh from the retired vigilance officer and pay it to the engineer.In his order, OHRC chairperson justice BP Das recommended that Himansu Sekhar Mishra, the former deputy SP of the vigilance department in Dhenkanal district pay Rs 5 lakh to former junior engineer of Kamakhyanagar Notified Area Council Rajendra Prasad Mishra for framing the latter in a false vigilance case.On March 24, 2017, Rajendra Mishra was arrested by the vigilance over allegations of demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 25,000 from a contractor to facilitate an official work. He was then suspended from service.The junior engineer then moved the Odisha Human Rights Commission alleging he was framed in a false case by Himanshu Mishra, the former DSP of vigilance. He alleged that he was framed as he did not allow the contractor to execute some work in a sub-standard manner under his supervision. He alleged that the contractor conspired with the vigilance staff including the deputy SP and laid a trap.The former junior engineer submitted the CCTV footage of his office room in which a vigilance constable was seen keeping a bundle of Rs 25,000 in his left side drawer at around 6.00 pm. When the engineer raised allegations of being framed, a DIG of vigilance conducted an inquiry and recommended departmental action against the DSP and others involved in the case.The OHRC chairperson said that after going through the report submitted by the DIG of Vigilance, recording statements of all the accused in the case and watching the CCTV footage, it was clear that the case against the junior engineer was a fake one.As the illegal and stage managed trap has tarred the junior engineer’s dignity and reputation, the commission said the victim is entitled to get compensation. The human rights panel also recommended that the contractor be black-listed and marked ineligible from getting any government contract in future.The commission, however, said the junior engineer can donate the compensation amount to the District Red Cross Fund of Dhenkanal if he wishes.Though Odisha claims to be turning aggressive against corrupt officials, its record in conviction is such cases is quite poor. In 2018, the department could get conviction in about 51 per cent of vigilance cases while in 2017 it was 47 per cent. The department is yet to release its conviction rate in 2019. It had also a high pendency at the investigation stage. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in its report for 2017 said that over 92 per cent of vigilance cases were pending for investigation in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-human-rights-body-asks-vigilance-cop-to-pay-rs-5-lakh-for-framing-official-in-graft-case/story-sVNid387EGiDH7sMLp3jlO.html

Jain was hospitalised with fever on June 15 and diagnosed with Covid-19 on June 17. On oxygen support until last Thursday, Jain credited his recovery to plasma therapy and pranayam, a breathing exercise in yoga. Edited excerpts:How was your experience with the coronavirus disease?Whenever doctors asked me how I was feeling, I said I was absolutely fine. The doctors used to laugh that I never said I wasn’t fine. Two days after I was moved out of the ICU (intensive care unit), I came home. The doctors had said that I should stay at the hospital, but I said when I am not in the ICU, staying in the hospital or at home was the same. Even after coming back home, I needed oxygen daily. It has just been three days since I haven’t needed it.Oxygen is very important when it comes to this disease. And, I think pranayam helps. My oxygen saturation was dipping even after I came home; when I spoke to the doctors they asked me to try pranayam. I started doing it around 12 days back and there has been an impact. So, all the people – those who have the infection and even those who don’t – should do pranayam.Also read: Daily new Covid-19 cases drop in Delhi, CM Kejriwal says ‘don’t be complacent’What helped you get through it?First of all, people should not be scared, they should be strong mentally. When I got the infection, everyone in my family other than me was worried. I was never scared. People are not scared of the disease, they are scared of dying. I never even thought that there was a possibility that I could die. That might be the reason I recovered from the disease easily. The biggest immunity buster or booster is the mindset of the person.The cases are going down now. Is it time for de-escalating Covid-19 preparedness?We cannot decide what to do based on a seven or 10 days’ trend. Today, we are getting just over a 1,000 cases a day, but we do not know whether the numbers would remain there. We are comfortable at the moment; if we scale down and then the cases start rising again, what will we do? Scaling back up is easier said than done. So, we need to wait and watch.We are reviewing the situation daily. There was a time when some hospitals were at 100% occupancy; now it is just 50%. Beds are available at every big hospital in the city. This is a comfortable situation.Getting the 16,000 beds was not an easy task and we had planned ahead. Had there been a need for 80,000 beds, we would have arranged that too. The CM (Arvind Kejriwal) had said, keep three times as many beds ready as the number of cases in the city – for 1,000 patients in the hospitals we wanted 3,000 beds ready and for 5,000 patients 15,000.At present, our occupancy is less than a third of the hospital beds available, so we do not need to scale up the beds further. We will maintain this for some time.Also read | In its fight against coronavirus, Capital has turned a corner: CM KejriwalHas Delhi crossed its Covid-19 peak?The numbers are definitely going down, but I think it is too early to say whether the cases have peaked. Even if you see the trends in the US, a month ago it had started declining but now look at the situation there – the highest number of cases are being reported from there. It is very difficult to predict anything about this virus. If today, I say that it’s over, the cases might start going up from tomorrow. And, when we had predicted a sharp increase, it went down.So, we need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.There are two plasma banks in Delhi government hospitals and preparations to set up a third one have begun. Are enough people donating plasma?We have received some donations, but I would like to appeal to all those who have recovered from the infection to come forward and donate plasma. They can save someone’s life. I will donate my plasma once I get the doctors’ nod.A sero-surveillance study had been conducted in Delhi to gauge the population-level presence of Covid-19 antibodies. What have we learnt from the study?The sero-surveillance tells us how many people in the population have already had the infection. What we have learnt is a huge number of people have had it. But the results of the survey will be declared by the central government’s NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control).How will this help us in planning ahead?First, let us find out the number. Then, we will see what to do. However, I think treatment is the most important. At this time, we should leave the other things and focus on treating Covid-19 just like any other ailment.In your capacity as the public works department (PWD) minister, could you tell us what went wrong with monsoon preparedness that led to water-logging at Minto Bridge after the first heavy shower of the monsoon season?I think the water-logging at Minto Bridge was because the BJP {Bharatiya Janata Party} people deliberately closed the drain in front of the BJP headquarters. They had done it last year as well and we had to get it opened up. Why else would the water not drain out despite having four pumps working there?Apart from that, about 1,500 pumps – including mobile pumps – have been deployed across the city.Yesterday, Delhi received about 80-90mm rainfall within two hours – that is about 15% of the total annual rainfall of the city. This means Delhi got two months’ worth of rain in two hours. This is the reason there was water-logging in some places. But all the water across Delhi was drained out – even from Minto Bridge – within two hours. Five years ago, this would have taken two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-wait-and-watch-no-let-up-in-preparedness-against-covid-satyendar-jain/story-MLNQY2bEIg0BebetqZkuhJ.html
21-07-2020||India||Delhi records lowest Covid-19 cases reported since June 1, case fatality rate at 2.96 per cent||Delhi reported 954 cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday, with number of fresh cases dipping below the 1,000-mark for the first time since June 1 when 990 cases had been recorded. However, the number pertains to the weekend when fewer tests had been conducted – only 11,470 as opposed to an average of almost 20,000 over the last three weeks.The city also reported 35 more deaths due to the infection, taking the total toll so far to 3,663. Delhi’s case fatality rate now stands at 2.96%.With fewer tests, the positivity rate – the percentage of people who test positive among those tested – also increased to 8.32. In comparison, the average positivity rate recorded over the last week was 7.61.Also read | In its fight against coronavirus, Capital has turned a corner: CM KejriwalThe number of tests had shot up in Delhi since the third week of June when the rapid antigen tests, which give results within 15 minutes outside of laboratories, had been introduced. The positivity rate had almost touched 37% in the second week of June when very few symptomatic people were being tested.The number of active cases or those living with the infection at any given time has also reduced to just about 15,000. The highest number of active cases reported in the city was just over 28,000 reported in June-end. Along with the number of active cases, the number of hospitalisations have also reduced, with just 3,517 people admitted to hospitals as on Monday, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government.Delhi had massively scaled up Covid-19 infrastructure when the cases were shooting up in June. Currently, there are 15,462 hospital beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at AIIMS, said: “There is a downward trend, but not everyone in Delhi has had the infection. For now, what has helped Delhi is the high testing rate, which in turn means that more cases must have been detected and isolated preventing further spread. It is not the time to slow down. The high testing rate must be maintained. The number of beds that have been earmarked so far should also remain because once we de-escalate getting the numbers back might be a challenge. The government should wait at least a month to decide if we can lower our guard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-reports-954-cases-lowest-since-june-1/story-c7D98b2zUuRo4SX7Z6FmdM.html
