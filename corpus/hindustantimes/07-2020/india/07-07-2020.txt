The medical superintendents of all government and private COVID hospitals have been issued directions in this regard. The feedback form will have questions about cleanliness, food, doctors at the hospital, blood group and underlying conditions. It will ask if the recovered person is willing to donate plasma. In plasma therapy, the antibody rich plasma from a recovered patient is extracted and administered to a patient. The trials are trying to find out if the antibodies can help patients recover. Last week, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated India’s first plasma bank at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences here to ease access to plasma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-to-collect-feedback-from-covid-19-survivors/story-3doompSr9xzlWnFuIS6dyO.html
07-07-2020||India||In bilateral talks, India raises with US its decision on foreign students’ visas||India on Tuesday raised with the US its decision to withdraw US visas from foreign students whose courses moved fully online even as the two countries held extensive talks covering a range of issues like ongoing threats to the rules-based international order as well as situation in the Indo-Pacific region.It is understood that India’s border row with China figured in the talks between Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale though there was no mention of it in the press statements issued by the two sides. In a statement, the US State Department said Hale and Shringla agreed to consult closely on all challenges and endeavour to support each other’s objectives, adding the discussions included ongoing threats to the rules-based international order, maritime security, and the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It said both officials pledged to remain in close contact on regional and international issues of mutual concern.On the Trump administration’s decision on students’ visas, official sources said Shringla raised the issue following which the US side said they will keep the best interests of the Indian students in mind and would try and mitigate the impact of the decision. The online talks were held under the framework of India-US Foreign Office Consultations. In a move that is expected to adversely impact hundreds of thousands of Indian students, the US immigration authority announced that foreign students will have to leave the country or risk deportation if their universities switch to online-only classes in this fall semester due to the coronavirus pandemic.In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said the two sides discussed ways to further enhance mutually beneficial trade and people-to-people ties, including through visa facilitation for students and professionals.It said Shringla and Hale exchanged views on a number of regional and global issues of shared interest. “They reaffirmed their commitment to work towards ensuring a free, open, inclusive, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific. They agreed on the need to deepen cooperation in the United Nations, especially during India’s membership of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2021-2022,” the MEA said.India and the US have been expanding cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region where China has been trying to expand its military and economic clout.Referring to the COVID-19 pandemic, the MEA said the two sides agreed to further strengthen the bilateral health partnership, including on pharmaceuticals and vaccine development. On its part, the US State Department said both sides agreed that the US-India health partnership, including cooperation on pharmaceutical and vaccine development, will continue to play a critical role in the world’s recovery from COVID-19. The MEA said the two sides agreed to remain in touch, and move forward on the bilateral agenda through a range of mechanisms like the 2+2 ministerial dialogue that India will host later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bilateral-talks-india-raises-with-us-its-decision-on-foreign-students-visas/story-RKoa3z6mRijpYWmTjTCaoK.html

07-07-2020||India||Kanpur’s controversial ex-SSP transferred days after massacre of cops||Former Kanpur SSP Anant Deo Tewari was on Tuesday transferred from his present post of Deputy Inspector General of Police of the Special task Force (STF) after a letter of slain DSP Devendra Mishra seeking action against Station Officer Vinay Tiwari of Chaubeypur police station for his ties with gangster Vikas Dubey, surfaced. Anant Deo Tewari had allegedly ignored the complaint.Vinay Tewari was subsequently suspended, allegedly for passing on information about the police raid on Dubey’s house, during which eight police personnel were killed by the gangster and his henchmen early Friday.Three other IPS officers were also transferred in a minor reshuffle. The government in its order said Anant Deo Tewari has been transferred as DIG PAC, Moradabad sector, while Sudhir Kumar Singh, who was posted as commandant of 15th battalion PAC in Agra, replaced him.Anant Deo Tewari, who was posted as SSP Kanpur till June 15 before being promoted as DIG STF found himself in controversy after the letter by the slain DSP became viral on social media. Mishra’s daughter released the letter on social media, alleging inaction by senior police officers in not removing Vinay Tewari despite her late father’s complaints against him.There were demands on social media for Anant Deo’s removal from his present post as the STF was investigating the killing of eight policemen during the raid at Vikas Dubey’s house in Kanpur’s Bikru village.In the other transfers, SSP Moradabad Amit Pathak and SSP Varanasi Prabhakar Chaudhary swapped places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-s-controversial-ex-ssp-transferred-days-after-massacre-of-cops/story-LPIkl1ae21ZWeAWLoPkLFK.html
07-07-2020||India||India targets Pakistan at UN body over counter-terrorism record||India on Tuesday mounted a sharp attack on Pakistan during a virtual meeting of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, accusing it of sheltering and supporting terrorists and pushing a false narrative on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.Mahaveer Singhvi, joint secretary (counter-terrorism) in the external affairs ministry who led the Indian delegation for the webinar organised by the UN body, pointed out the meeting was being held on a day when the Indian embassy in Kabul was attacked by a Pakistan-backed terror group 12 years ago and Indians and Afghans were killed.“It is very unfortunate that a country which perpetrated terrorist attacks in Mumbai (2008), Pathankot (2016), Uri and Pulwama is now preaching to the world community,” Singhvi said in his intervention during the meeting with the theme “The global scourge of terrorism: Assessment of high risk threats and trends including the rise of violent extremism and hate speech in a pandemic environment”.“While the world is coming together to battle the pandemic, it is unfortunate that Pakistan, a state which sponsors cross-border terrorism, continues to use every opportunity to peddle false narratives and make baseless, malicious and egregious allegations against India and interfere in our internal affairs,” he said, adding that the statement by Pakistan’s representative at the meeting was part of this pattern.Singhvi added, “Even as Pakistan provides shelter and support to terrorists, it continues to peddle a false and motivated narrative on the situation in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is seeking to portray its military, financial [and] logistical support to cross-border terrorism against India as a freedom struggle. It is also peddling misinformation about India’s domestic legislation and policies.”The webinar was part of the UN body’s virtual counter-terrorism week, and Singhvi pointed out that terrorists have made innumerable attempts to infiltrate India “from their safe abodes across the border to carry out attacks and have even used unmanned aerial systems to smuggle weapons across our borders”.At the global level, terrorists have tried to exploit financial and emotional distress caused by the pandemic, and used the increased presence of people online and on social media to disseminate misinformation through hate speech, fake news and doctored videos, he said. Another disturbing trend is the collection of funds by proscribed terror groups ostensibly for charitable activities but which would be used to finance terror, he said.Singhvi described Pakistan’s statement claiming credit for eliminating al-Qaeda as “ludicrous” and said the group’s founder, Osama Bin Laden, was recently glorified as a “martyr” by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in Parliament. “This is a chilling reminder of the patronage that international terrorists receive in Pakistan,” he said.Khan had publicly acknowledged the presence of up to 40,000 terrorists in Pakistan and the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the UN Security Council had reported that about 6,500 Pakistani terrorists from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are operating in Afghanistan, he said.“Pakistan’s role as epicentre of terrorism has been well documented by numerous international organisations including UN and FATF. Unlike Pakistan, India does not make any distinction between terrorists and invariably condemns terror attacks anywhere in the world, including the one in Karachi, referred to by Pakistan’s representative in his statement,” Singhvi said.The Indian official also criticised human rights violations in Balochistan, Kyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the discrimination against religious and cultural minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-targets-pakistan-at-un-body-over-counter-terrorism-record/story-wLb4CA11IDrtHoqtybgOaM.html

Five of the Sars-Cov-2 infected women died during pregnancy and one died during giving birth to a child, as per the audited data.The health department also did a social audit of people who were declared dead on arrival at hospitals. Until July 5, 78 Covid-19 positive people were declared dead on arrival. Social audit of 41 of these cases has been done and the remaining cases are held up for various reasons including the mandatory waiting period of three weeks after a Covid 19 related death, for an audit to be conducted.“The social audit found that in at least one-fourth of these cases, the cause of death was the delay in taking the decision to take a person to the hospital.

Doctors eventually attended him but he died shortly thereafter.The man had been admitted to the People’s General Hospital on June 23 for renal failure before he contracted Covid-19.“It is unfortunate that a patient was ill-treated in Bhopal. A magisterial inquiry has already been ordered and wrongdoers will not be spared,” the chief minister told reporters.The People’s General Hospital released CCTV footage where the driver and ambulance attendant of Chirayu Medical College and Hospital could be seen leaving the patient unattended on the floor of the parking lot. The deceased’s son demanded a tough action against the management of both the hospitals.“People’s General hospital, where my father was left unattended, neither informed any of family members including me nor provided the necessary treatment to him and Chirayu hospital’s ambulance left my father in a serious condition on the floor in the parking lot. The driver of the ambulance said instead of taking my father to Covid-19 designated Chirayu Hospital, he came back to People’s Hospital as my father’s condition was getting critical,” said the son.“How could a sensitive person leave a critical patient unattended at a parking lot?” he asked and demanded legal action against the driver too.Zameel Khan a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Bhopal, said the patient was left behind after a disagreement between the two hospitals.“The ambulance came at around 7.30 pm to take the patient to Chirayu Hospital after he tested positive for coronavirus as Chirayu happens to be a dedicated Covid hospital. But later, the driver called the People’s General Hospital that they were coming back as the patient was getting critical and needed an ambulance equipped with a ventilator. When People’s General Hospital refused to take the patient back, the driver left the patient in the parking lot. Later, while the doctors at People’s General Hospital started treating him, he died,” Khan said.The two hospitals blamed each other for the patient’s death. The People’s General hospital blamed Chirayu Medical College and Hospital for the lapses whereas Chirayu hospital administration blamed People’s Hospital for not providing correct information to it regarding the patient and later refusing to attend the patient. People’s General Hospital’s manager Udayshankar Dixit said, “As we are not a Covid-19 designated hospital, we requested the ambulance driver not to come back but he not only ignored our request but also left the patient outside the hospital without informing us.” Chirayu Medical College and Hospital managing director Ajay Goenka said, “The driver came back with a good intention as the patient was getting critical. He informed a doctor of People’s General hospital that they needed to take care of the patient just for 20 minutes as another ambulance equipped with a ventilator was on its way but People’s General Hospital refused to take care of him immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patient-in-bhopal-dies-after-being-dumped-in-hospital-parking-lot/story-Ze2jOxEYeFbFnHAW9MYPqI.html
07-07-2020||India||Ready for CBI probe in gold smuggling case, says Kerala CM after removing top aide||A day after a senior information technology consultant to the Kerala government allegedly emerged as the key player in the gold smuggling racket operated through diplomatic channels, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday rushed to contain the political fallout of the racket, removed his top aide M Sivasankar and declared that he was ready for any probe.A brief statement by Vijayan’s office announced the transfer of the chief minister’s principal secretary M Sivasankar “with immediate effect”. Sivasankar’s charge has been handed over to another IAS officer Mir Mohammad.Sivasankar has been linked to the IT consultant Swapna Suresh who is alleged to have played a key role in the gold smuggling racket following the seizure of 30 kg gold from a diplomatic consignment on Sunday. The government sacked Swapna Suresh the next day.But the opposition kept up the pressure. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala sought a CBI probe, alleging that Swapna Suresh and Sivasankar, who was also the state’s IT secretary, were linked. Other opposition leaders also joined in, insisting that the chief minister was aware of Swapna Suresh’s appointment and that she was given key responsibilities.Customs officials on Sunday had seized a diplomatic bag that landed from the UAE, ostensibly being sent to its consulate in the state capital. Since authorities cannot not open a diplomatic bag under the Vienna convention, they roped in UAE consulate officials. The bag, which arrived on a chartered flight from the UAE, contained 30 kg of gold in cylindrical form hidden within some equipment.Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the consulate, has been arrested by the customs. He is alleged to have disclosed Swapna’s role in the racket. There are reports that they made at least 10 such sorties which went unnoticed.Chief Minister Vijayan played down the controversy saying the state was ready for any probe.“She was hired by a placement agency. Customs also made it clear that nobody had called from the CM’s office to bail her out. Some people are creating a smoke screen to portray the government in the bad light,” he said.Asked why he had removed his principal secretary, the chief minister said he was sent out of the CM’s office after receipt of some general complaints.BJP state president K Surendran, however, alleged that a senior official from the CM’s office did make a call to customs officials pleading with them to spare some people involved in the case. The gold bars and sticks were hidden inside some of the household equipment like handlebars to avoid detection.As the controversy raged, the CPM central leadership said the party is ready for a probe by an agency including the CBI. The United Arab Emirates embassy has also said it will cooperate with the ongoing probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-for-cbi-probe-in-gold-smuggling-case-says-kerala-cm-after-removing-top-aide/story-rZ77ByvUpTR7zO7YA5t98M.html

07-07-2020||India||Ban on foreign tours, buying cars as Odisha limits expenses to fight Covid-19||Air and first class rail travel ban for officials were among several measures adopted by the Odisha government on Tuesday as part of its austerity measures to make space for Covid-19 related expenditure.Odisha finance department secretary AKK Meena in a letter to all the government departments said there would be a complete ban on purchase of new vehicles for the next two years and travel and official tours have to be avoided in general.“All administrative departments are required to prioritise their expenditure needs in order to limit the expenditure within the resources available with priority to make fiscal space for Covid-19 related expenditure. There would be a complete ban on travel outside the country and air travel in business class using government funds. Air journey should be avoided and meetings through video conferencing or IT may be preferred. In exigencies approval of authority one level higher than the present delegation would be required for journey by air. There would be a complete ban on journey by train in 1st class AC by all government officers,” Meena instructed in the letter.The finance secretary further said if any officer has to travel, then no reimbursement would be allowed for occupancy in any hotel in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai.There would be a complete ban on creation of new posts except for the health & family welfare department.New engagement of consultants, outsourcing and employing services of retired government officers would be restricted. In case, there is necessity for creation of posts for modernisation of administration or effective implementation of development and welfare programmes, the same would be considered only against abolition of equivalent posts with concurrence of the finance department.Experts have said that Odisha has no other way than to borrow liberally so as to provide for higher spending on healthcare and continue with its welfare programmes.Recently, while speaking at a webinar organised by the Odisha Alochana Chakra, former chief secretary Jugal Mohapatra and former NIPFP professor Dr Tapas Sen said as economic activities remained suspended for most part of the April-June period, the Odisha government could raise only 60% of the revenues it had budgeted for the quarter.“If this trend continues through the rest of the financial year, the government’s revenues in financial year 2020-21 may fall about Rs 49,600 crore, or 40%, of the Rs 1,24,000 crore budget target,” said Dr Pravas Mishra, a public finance analyst with Oxfam India. “Assuming that economic activities and revenue collections return to normal by October-December quarter, the most optimistic scenario could still leave the state with a revenue shortfall of at least Rs 17,000 crore, or 25%.”Mohapatra said the government of Odisha could tap the Debt Redemption Fund that has about Rs 12,000 crore lying in it. Also, it has enough headroom to borrow from the RBI via ways and means advances, as the limit for such loans has been raised to 5% of GDP, around Rs 22,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-foreign-tours-buying-cars-as-odisha-limits-expenses-to-fight-covid-19/story-vPpbciRtRxMDwzvdpSyn6L.html
07-07-2020||India||Assam govt’s Covid-19 management decisions whimsical, says IMA||The Assam unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Tuesday expressed resentment and reservations on certain policy changes by the state government on management of Covid-19 pandemic in the state.In a letter addressed to health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma (copy of which is with HT), the IMA unit said with present surge in Covid-19 cases in the state it will be difficult to control the situation in the absence of proper planning. “Increasing hospital beds without manpower planning will be futile exercise as we have very limited resources in terms of doctors and health workers,” the IMA’s letter said.Till Monday, Assam had recorded 12,522 Covid-19 positive cases. The state’s biggest city, Guwahati, and rest of Kamrup Metro district have been placed under total shutdown for 14 days beginning June 28 due to community spread of the disease.“On Monday, the government issued a fresh set of guidelines increasing Covid duty for doctors from existing 7 days at a stretch to 11 days followed by 3 days in quarantine and resumption of duty after their tests come negative,” said Dr. Satyajit Borah, IMA Assam unit president.“This was done without consultation with stakeholders. Working in Covid centres for 11-days at a stretch wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits in this summer without air-conditioning in most centres is very exerting and will demoralize frontline workers,” he added.The IMA unit also opposed the government’s decision to switch over from RT-PCR tests to rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests for checking health workers engaged in COVID. It added that according to ICMR, the RAD test “is less sensitive and negative result does not rule out Covid”.“Already a number of doctors and healthcare workers have fallen victim to Covid and such unplanned and insensitive steps will further endanger the health workers. IMA demands a critical review on why so many doctors and health workers are affected by the disease,” the letter stated.Though exact figures of Covid-19 infection among doctors and health workers wasn’t available, IMA office bearers mentioned nearly 20-25 doctors have tested positive for the virus in the state.“IMA urges the government to take experienced healthcare professionals and groups in confidence in proper planning to face the challenges rather than taking closed door and whimsical decisions. Otherwise the much talked about successful Assam model will collapse in no time,” the letter cautioned.The IMA unit advised the state government to adhere to ICMR’s advice of management of asymptomatic Covid-19 patients in their homes in order to lessen burden on healthcare workers and facilities.Reacting to the IMA letter, principal secretary (health and family welfare) Samir Kumar Sinha mentioned that he was aware of the issues raised and they will be sorted out after consultations.“We had to raise the number of Covid duty days from 7 to 11 for healthcare workers due to the surge in cases. We have to provide medical services to the patients or else there will be more deaths,” Sinha said.“Unlike RT-PCR test, which used to take several days to get results, the RAD test allows us to get results within an hour. Once the results come negative and their quarantine period is over, healthcare workers can get back to duty,” he added.Health department officials requesting anonymity said keeping asymptomatic Covid-19 patients in home quarantine is tough for Assam as healthcare workers will need to pay visits regularly to monitor them. But a change in protocol is expected within the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-govt-s-covid-19-management-decisions-whimsical-says-ima/story-NseeOuSKnv9QRVH3IJppKO.html
07-07-2020||India||Alliance intact in Bihar, says BJP; Congress works at ‘honourable’ pact||The BJP and Congress in-charge for Bihar were in the state on Tuesday to shore up and firm up their alliances ahead of the assembly polls. The BJP said that NDA partners will fight unitedly. The Congress, on the other hand, said it will hammer out an “honourable” pact with its coalition partners.Underscoring that its alliance in Bihar was intact, the BJP said that it would contest the polls with its two other partners - JD(U) and the LJP - with a “positive mindset” and on a “development plank”.The comment assumes significance as differences have cropped up between the JD (U) and the LJP on several issues lately.“NDA is comfortably placed. Nobody should have doubt about the alliance. The alliance will contest elections unitedly on the plank of work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government in six years and the steps taken during the lockdown period,” said Bhupendra Yadav, Rajya Sabha MP and in-charge of Bihar BJP affairs.The BJP in-charge also made it clear to the cadres that they should not bother about who will be contesting how many seats. “Whatever seats one gets, NDA will fight unitedly. Prepare for all 243 seats,” he said.The LJP had been critical of JD(U) over employment opportunities for migrant labourers during the lockdown, farmers’ issues, seat sharing, and, above all, the issue of chief ministership in the state.The Congress in-charge for Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil also sent a message to sulking alliance partners that the party would have an “honourable” tie up with the alliance partners for the upcoming assembly polls.Gohil, who was recently elected to the Rajya Sabha, rushed to Patna on a three-day visit apparently to coordinate with the leaders of the opposition alliance in the wake of fissures emerging over two issues — common minimum programme (CMP) and coordination committee.Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha and campaign committee chairman Akhilesh Prasad Singh were also present when Gohil addressed the gathering of party workers at the BPCC office at Sadaquat Ashram in the evening.A senior BPCC functionary, pleading anonymity, said that meeting the top leaders of the alliance to sort out “minor” differences on the issues of CMP and coordination committee also topped the AICC in-charge agenda, which was not included in his official itinerary.“HAM-S leader Jitan Ram Manjhi is also anxiously waiting for Gohil’s meeting with RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav to sort out issues,” he said.BPCC media in-charge HK Verma said that Gohil’s visit was quite significant as the party would form an initial view for the seats it would bargain to contest in the assembly polls with RJD and other alliance leaders. The party leaders have identified around 100 out of 243 seats to contest in the upcoming assembly polls set to be held in October-November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alliance-intact-in-bihar-says-bjp-congress-works-at-honourable-pact/story-d27OHwL0iWKoDBTpOmWQOL.html
07-07-2020||India||Gadkari seeks forest clearance for infra projects, nudges ministries||Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday chaired a meeting of the ‘group on infrastructure’ with railway minister Piyush Goyal and environment minister Prakash Javadekar seeking to expedite clearances for several pending highway and infrastructure projects. The road transport and highways minister raised the issue of outstanding forest clearance for 187 highway projects. It was also noted that many projects had not yet applied for Stage II forest clearance. Environment minister Javadekar was asked to direct the forest officers posted in states to follow and implement the circulars and orders issued by the environment ministry.“Special High powered committees on forest issues can be conducted as is being done in Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Arunachal Pradesh. It was felt that this step will remove many hindrances in the way of infrastructure projects, which will save both time and money,” the transport ministry said.A major issue before infrastructure projects is tree cutting, however, there are ambiguities over inclusion of certain local breeds of shrubs and plants in forest cover, the ministry noted.“An example of Babool or Kikar was presented in the meeting. This being an exotic Arabian shrub, its inclusion in the definition of trees is causing hindrance while considering forest clearance for several projects. In Delhi, an ambitious project monitored by PMO, the Dwarka Expressway, is facing such 1939 Babool shrubs in a total of 6364 trees. It was pointed out that many States like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh do not cover this shrub in land revenue code as a tree,” it said.The meeting was also attended by the railway board chairman, senior officers of the ministries of road transport, power environment and forests, NHAI and representatives from the state governments of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka.Chairman railway board, director general forests and director general roads have been directed to meet every month to expedite work on the concerned projects.It was stressed in the meeting that level crossings on National Highways need to be removed, as they constitute major accident spots. It was pointed out that while their designs had been approved at 167 locations, but work has not begun as yet.“MoUs were signed in this respect over 5 years ago, and there is a need to improve performance. In this direction, it was agreed to monitor the projects under Setubharatam programme on a monthly basis. It also was underlined that 30 road projects are pending with Railways. However, the railway minister assured to resolve these within two days,” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gadkari-seeks-environmental-clearance-for-infra-projects-nudges-ministries/story-fXnmeXfMPtpKeQ5RQGunyK.html

07-07-2020||India||NHAI’s elevated Saharanpur-Dehradun road to reduce wildlife casualties||The National Highway Authority of India’s (NHAI) proposed 12-km, four-lane elevated road to Dehradun, through Shivalik forest in Saharanpur, is expected to be a unique model of development that takes care of wildlife conservation.The road will connect Mohand in Saharanpur to Dehradun and replace the existing two-lane road on which many wild animals often die after getting hit by vehicles.The elevated road will take a detour into the Mohand Rau (seasonal rivulet), instead of the earlier plan to widen the existing road to four lanes and pass it through two tunnels. It will provide a safe corridor to wild animals, especially tigers, to walk freely between Rajaji National Park (RNP) and Shivalik forests.A joint team of RNP, Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Saharanpur forest department and NHAI conducted the final spot survey of the area last week to finalise the alignment of the proposed road. NHAI’s Dehradun region project director Vibhav Mittal said the project would be a unique model where development and conservation of wild animals would go hand-in-hand. He hoped its tendering would be processed by the end of this year. The entire project would cost between Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 1,700 crore and vehicles could ply on it with a maximum speed of 80 km per hour. He also claimed that there would be minimum loss of trees and hills during completion of the project.The Uttarakhand government had recently decided to translocate a few tigers in Motichur range of RNP’s tiger reserve from other locations of the state.Meanwhile, the Saharanpur forest department sent a proposal to declare over 33,000 hectares of thick forest area of Shivalik forest as the fourth tiger reserve of UP and second in western UP.A six month trap camera survey of the forest has spotted more than 50 leopards, different species of herbivores, snakes, civet cats and many other animals which make it perfect for relocation of tigers, which were sighted here till 2005. Sanjay Kumar, divisional commissioner of Saharanpur, said initially the project was designed to widen the existing road to four lanes with construction of two tunnels. “But we shared the idea of an elevated road and the NHAI accepted it after verifying its viability and cost. It will be a mesmerising journey for people with scenic beauty of hills and rivers on both sides of the road and at the same time set an example of development by taking care of wildlife conservation,” Kumar said.Conservator of forest of Saharanpur division V K Jain, who is working hard to get the Shivalik forests declared tiger reserve, said the elevated road would prevent deaths of animals. He further said people would have a road on which they can travel at 80 km per hour to make their journey faster and pleasant. The existing road to Dehradun passes through jungle area of Mohand and Shivalik hills up to Daat Devi temple. A new tunnel has been built close to the old tunnel near Daat Devi temple and project director Mittal says that the elevated road would end at the temple. He further said NHAI generally constructs roads for a speed of 120 km per hour but because of many sharp turns in the hills, this road will have maximum speed of 80 km per hour and cut travel time to Dehradun by an hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhai-s-elevated-saharanpur-dehradun-road-to-reduce-wildlife-casualties/story-JgXPjEecDj6k9Bm0wmOdmI.html

In 2018, the pilgrimage was held for 60 days.Thousands of pilgrims either trek the traditional and longer 45-km-long Pahalgam route or the shorter 16-km Baltal route to the holy shrine every year.One of the holiest pilgrimages of Hinduism, the Amarnath Yatra attracts pilgrims from India as well as across the world. There have been terror attacks on the route of the yatra in the past. The last attack took place in 2017 on a bus from Gujarat in Anantnag district that left seven pilgrims dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarnath-yatra-1000-pilgrims-on-helicopters-500-on-foot-to-be-allowed-per-day-via-baltal-track-this-year/story-THuiDktB0jUafuhVax4tSI.html

07-07-2020||India||HC raps officials for ‘pathetic’ condition of Maharashtra’s famed Lonar crater lake||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday came down heavily on state bodies for failing to preserve the 113-hectare Lonar Crater Lake in Buldhana district.The Lake, declared a notified National Geo-heritage Monument in 1979, had turned reddish-pink since June 9-10 due to high salinity, acidity (pH) and an algal bloom, the forest department had said. However, the exact reasons are yet to be confirmed by research bodies. The district collector and forest department both said the natural lake colour was restored last week following heavy rains.The HC bench noted that the Geological Survey of India (GSI) had conducted a survey of the pink water and will submit a report within a week, while reports from scientific bodies such as the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and Agarkar Research Institute, Pune will be submitted before the next hearing on July 22.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOn Monday, the HC bench of Justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor was hearing hearing a 2009 petition by lawyer Kirti Atul Nipankar and others against various state bodies and it rapped the Buldhana district administration, Lonar municipal council, and public works department (PWD) for their indifference to previous HC orders, callous approach in conserving the lake. The court also cautioned that further disobedience of its orders could lead to contempt proceedings against erring authorities.Based on submissions, the bench highlighted two issues of immediate concern, open defecation by Lonar citizens at the lake including in the area where the sewage treatment plant (STP) is located and discharge of sewage water from Lonar city freely entering the lake.During the last hearing on June 15, the HC had taken cognisance of the change in lake’s colour, open defecation and improper sewage treatment and directed four senior lawyers to visit the crater and submit a status report. The inspection was undertaken on June 17.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“The inspection report has now been placed on record. We find that the situation at and around Lonar Lake is really pathetic,” the bench said in its 12-page order published on Tuesday.“The pathetic situation has arisen mainly because of the indifference rather callous indifference of many of the authorities responsible in their own way for conservation and preservation of Lonar Crater Lake.”Meanwhile, the bench took serious note of Buldhana collector’s alleged failures to implement HC directions and to attend court hearings, not even through video conferencing for the latest hearing and in person prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.“We are of the prima-facie view that the Buldhana collector.. has failed in discharging fundamental duties in the recent past, thereby owing an explanation to this court, for dislodgement of the prima facie impression,” the bench said.Suman Chandra, district collector and magistrate, Buldhana said, “There has been no intentional negligence. Over the past three months, there was a delay due to Covid-19. Special efforts will be made to ensure that all directions of the HC are complied with at the earliest. Meanwhile, the lake colour has normalised after rain that led to dilution. The colour had turned pink due to the increased salinity.”The bench also directed the civic body to furnish documental evidence of increased STP capacity (from 500 kilo litres per day to 1000 KLD) by July 22, and ensure untreated sewage is stopped from entering the lake within three days from the order date.Located 500 km from Mumbai and over 90 km from Buldhana city, the oval shaped Lonar Lake is a part of the 383-hectare Lonar Wildlife Sanctuary declared on June 8, 2000.The lake has an average diameter of over 6,000 feet and is 449-feet deep. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it was formed by a meteorite impact between 35,000 and 50,000 years ago. It was identified as a unique geographical site by a British officer C J E Alexander in 1823. A combined area of 366-hectare of Lonar Lake and surrounding regions was first proposed to be declared as a Ramsar site, a wetland of ecological importance in 2017 by the state forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-raps-officials-for-pathetic-condition-of-maharashtra-s-famed-lonar-crater-lake/story-FYshUxpUewR92zPm6kcnfP.html

The order, however, did not mention how long the fresh spell of the shutdown will last.  A containment zone has a stricter form of the lockdown and people are not allowed to leave or enter such areas while a buffer zone is a certain area marked outside the containment zone.A Centre-mandated nationwide lockdown in containment zones is in place till July 31.“Current concept of containment zones may be combined with the current concept of buffer zone and together they may constitute a revised and broad-based containment zone approach,” read a government notification.The state government said the following activities will be barred in these broader containment zones: all offices (government and private), all non-essential services, all congregations, all transportation, all marketing/industrial/trading activities. The movement of residents, the government added, will be strictly regulated.“Local authorities will try to arrange home delivery to the residents staying inside the broad-based containment zones,” it said further.In another decision last week, flights from six coronavirus hotspots - Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai and Ahmedabad - will not be allowed to land in Kolkata between July 6-19 as the state government stepped up efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus.Kolkata has of late been witnessing a daily average of 200 people being infected by coronavirus. The city had 2,415 active coronavirus cases on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-club-containment-buffer-zones-for-stricter-lockdown-from-july-9/story-bBRw2NydQegQNTDMcHNS4M.html

The bag, which arrived on a chartered flight from the UAE, contained 30 kg of gold in cylindrical form hidden within some equipment.The UAE’s ambassador to India, Ahmed Al Banna, has told the media in Dubai that he will coordinate with officials in Kerala for the investigation into the incident.A statement issued by the UAE embassy said the mission in Thiruvananthapuram and its diplomatic role had no role in the matter. The statement said the embassy “condemns the attempted misuse of diplomatic channels by an individual engaged in smuggling activity” and “firmly rejected such acts”.“Initial inquiries conducted by the mission revealed that a former locally hired employee of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram was responsible for this act. The employee in question was fired for misconduct long preceding this incident,” the statement said.“At this time, it appears that this individual exploited his knowledge of the mission’s channels to engage in criminal activity,” it said.“The UAE looks forward to fully cooperating with Indian customs authorities to thoroughly investigate this matter and urges stringent legal action against those involved,” the statement added.Police in Kerala have named two former employees of the UAE consulate – Sarith Kumar and Swapna Suresh – as suspects in the case. Sarith was arrested after he allegedly went to the airport with a fake ID card to collect the diplomatic bag.People familiar with developments, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the diplomatic bag apparently had the required authorisation, including documentation regarding its contents and a tamper-proof seal.Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, authorities in the receiving state cannot open a diplomatic bag even if they have suspicions about its contents. The bag can only be opened in the presence of officials or diplomats of the sending state. This was done in the case of the UAE’s diplomatic bag after receiving the required permission, the people said.Sarith worked as a public relations officer for the UAE consulate but was fired some months ago as “he was not doing his job”, Al Banna told Gulf News. “Unfortunately, he used different means and ways to misuse the name of the consulate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uae-embassy-says-diplomats-had-no-role-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-D7KTWVzDX8Jx6XFS0NQImM.html

Essential government services and medical emergencies will be exempt from the restriction,” he added.Besides Kokrajhar, authorities in Nagaon, Tinsukia, Biswanath, Sonitpur, Nalbari, Barpeta and South Salmara districts have also imposed a ban on travel to and from Kamrup Metro under provisions of Disaster Management Act, 2005. People found violating the ban will have to undergo 14 days quarantine.“We issued an order on Tuesday restricting movement to and from Kamrup Metro. People who returned from Guwahati or any part of Kamrup Metro during the past few days have been advised to undergo home quarantine for 14 days and report to health authorities immediately if they show any symptoms of Covid-19,” said Nagaon deputy commissioner Jadav Saikia.Meanwhile, Assam health authorities launched door-to-door coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests at a locality in Guwahati from Tuesday following a spike in coronavirus infections.Rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests, where results are made available within an hour, started in Ward-2 (Pandu), a densely populated locality, under the Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC), state health minister Himanta Biswa Sharma said.Healthcare workers aim to conduct 3,000 RAD tests by Wednesday. The door-to-door RAD tests are aimed at measuring the extent of spread of the viral disease within the community.Taking a cue from Kamrup Metro, some other districts in the state have also enforced lockdown restrictions. On Monday, a two-week lockdown began in the hilly Dima Hasao district, allowing only 30% of all grocery shops to operate between 11 am and 4 pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.The authorities in Upper Assam’s Jorhat district also announced on Monday that they would impose a lockdown for from July 9 to July 15, both days inclusive.Dima Hasao and Jorhat districts had recorded 89 and 145 Covid-19 positive cases, respectively, until Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-assam-districts-impose-travel-curbs-to-and-from-guwahati-after-covid-19-cases-surge/story-04mKeC65TL74PtcvJ99xWM.html

The incident happened after the cop put up posters of the rebels in his village urging them to surrender during a campaign last month.Superintendent of Police , Dantewada , Abhishek Pallava told Hindustan Times that around dozen Maoists entered the Gumiypal village on Monday night and abducted constable Ajay Telam’s parents. “They abducted Telam’s father, Lachhu Telam (64) and mother Vijjo Telam (62 )and also beat up the constable’s sister,”the SP said.Telam was recruited in the District Reserve Guard by Dantewada police last year.“He had distributed pamphlets and put posters of Maoists in his village, urging them to surrender. On Tuesday, about 15-20 rebels from the village were about to surrender and hence out of frustration, Maoists have abducted his parents,” Pallava said.Last month, the Dantewada police had launched the ‘Lon Varratu’ campaign under which posters and banners of the rebels, who carry cash rewards on their heads, are being put up in their native villages. The posters mention their names and appeal to the rebels to join the mainstream.“I had met families from Gumiyapal village and urged them to come and live in Dantewada district headquarters. Some families did move but the constable’s parents, who are old, decided to live in their village,” said the SP.Police sources said that about 200 people have gone to jungles to appeal to the Maoists to release Telam’s parents.Last week, Maoists killed a policeman’s brother-in-law in Hiroli village of Dantewada.Meanwhile, tribal leader Soni Sori said that Maoists’ act is condemnable but blamed the police force of “using the youth for their own gain”.“If Maoists have abducted Ajay’s parents, this is completely wrong and is condemnable. But police are using tribal youths like Ajay for their gain. For the last two years, Ajay was being accused by villagers of giving information of two tribal youths – Lachhu and Podia – who were killed by security forces,” said Sori.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-abduct-policeman-s-parents-in-chhattisgarh-s-dantewada/story-8EATXxLkXRl0AT62i3U1IL.html
07-07-2020||India||‘I stand with Modiji ’: Shashi Tharoor uses PM Narendra Modi’s 2013 tweet to target Centre’s response to China||Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday retweeted a 2013 tweet by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which he had posted as the chief minister of Gujarat while questioning Indian troops’ withdrawal from the conflict zones at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in Ladakh sector.Retweeting the post, Tharoor said he agreed with the question Modi raised then as the Gujarat chief minister in 2013, while referring to instances of Chinese incursions into Indian territory and the subsequent stand-off between the armed forces of the two sides.“China withdraws its forces but I wonder why Indian forces are withdrawing from Indian territory? Why did we retreat?,” Modi, then Gujarat chief minister, had asked in a tweet dated May 13, 2013.On 15 April 2013, a platoon of Chinese troops had erected four tents southeast of Daulat Beg Oldi, 19km inside the Indian territory which resulted in a 21-day standoff. Two months later, the same year, Chinese soldiers again intruded into the Chumar sector in Ladakh on June 17. Modi had accused the then UPA government of not standing up to Chinese aggressions.US Military to stand with India in conflict with China, indicates White House officialMore than seven years later, Tharoor retweeted Modi’s questioning of the withdrawal of the Indian forces in 2013 to draw a parallel with the current situation in July 2020, when Narendra Modi-led Central government has negotiated an agreement with China for the withdrawal of troops from forward positions in the eastern Ladakh sector, where the two sides clashed in a brutal face off on June 15 in Galwan Valley, leading to deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and an unverified number of Chinese casualties.“I stand with Modiji on this. PM must answer his question!,” Tharror said while retweeting Modi’s 2013 tweet.Tharoor’s dig at the Modi government’s handling of the current crisis follows the beginning of an agreement between India and China to disengage from the Line of Actual Control which has resulted in troops on both sides withdrawing up to 1.5km from key friction points of Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra.Explained | Missiles, fighter jets: How India’s boosting forces amid China rowThe breakthrough to a three month long tense stand-off followed a conversation between the Special Representatives (SR) on the boundary issue, national security adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. Officials also attributed the developments to intense bilateral engagements over the past few days at the diplomatic and military levels.This is not the first time that Tharoor has tried to use PM Modi’s tweets from the past to bring into focus Modi government’s handling of the border dispute with China. Earlier on June 18, he had retweeted several of Modi’s old tweets on the issue, posted on May 13, 2013, February 8, 2014 and August 15, 2013 respectively. Tharoor’s re-tweets are in line with Congress offensive accusing the Centre of being soft on China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-stand-with-modiji-on-this-shashi-tharoor-uses-pm-narendra-modi-s-2013-tweet-to-target-centre-s-response-to-china/story-vlsXqF3ah4vQsV1w0mPkPL.html

An average of 12 murder cases occur every day. Between 2016-2018, crimes against children increased by 24% in UP. What have the UP Home Department and CM done other than covering these figures?” she tweeted.In another tweet, she said that the letter that slain police officer Devendra Mishra wrote to the then SSP was an alarm for last week’s ambush where Mishra and seven other policemen were killed. “Today there are many reports that the letter is missing. All these facts raise a serious question on the working of the Home Department of UP,” Priyanka Gandhi said.The massacre of the policemen who had gone to raid the gangster caught the police on the wrong foot and exposed a rot in the department’s ranks forcing it to suspend several personnel for ties with Dubey and allegedly tipping him off about the raid. The UP government which has often publiscised a policy of zero tolerance to crime has come out in poor light following the encounter. The UP Police have launched one of its biggest manhunts ever to arrest Dubey who has vanished after the ambush and is suspected to have crossed over to Madhya Pradesh. The police also raised the bounty on Dubey’s head to Rs 2.5 lakh. On Tuesday, the Uttarakhand Police went on alert after reports that the gangster was sighted in UP’s Bijnor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-accuses-up-govt-of-dressing-up-crime-statistics/story-tg8kghZcuD5FuB5zCDfEiN.html

There is non-application of mind on the part of the state government,” he argued before the court and cited the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016, which only empowers the UGC to take such a decision.The plea stated, “The hanging sword of uncertainty is faced by final year students and the resolution is not clear as to when the examinations will be conducted and the academic year will end. The fate of a large number of students, who wish to take admission for their post-graduation courses, is hanging in balance.”The petitioner prayed before the court to quash and set aside the resolution.The court directed that the UGC should be made a party to the PIL and the Maharashtra government to file its response within a week.The next hearing of the PIL will be on July 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-challenges-cancellation-of-exams-due-to-covid-19-hc-asks-ugc-to-be-made-party-state-to-respond/story-PZyxyz1P1Q3MxLrHai6CNN.html
07-07-2020||India||SC notice to Centre on plea for refund of ticket for flights cancelled due to Covid||The Supreme Court Tuesday asked the Centre and the DGCA to respond to a plea seeking directions to airlines to refund full amount of tickets for the flights cancelled due to restrictions imposed in India to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan issued notices to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) seeking their replies on the plea which has alleged that airlines have failed to refund the ticket amount and are “illegally imposing” the mechanism of ‘credit shell’ on unwilling passengers.“Issue notice,” said the bench, also comprising Justices S K Kaul and M R Shah.The plea, filed by Air Passengers Association of India, claimed that refusal to refund the amount is “arbitrary” and is in blatant violation of the Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) as acceptance of ‘credit shell’ is at the sole discretion of the passengers.“It is submitted that the airlines are illegally imposing the mechanism of ‘credit shell’ on the unwilling passengers. The concept refers to a form of credit note which can be used to make a new booking with the same airline for a period so provided by the airline, usually of one year, as is being offered by most of the airlines,” said the plea, filed through advocate Rohit Rathi.The bench said the matter would be heard along with a pending petition in the apex court which has also raised similar issue. The apex court said the petitioner’s counsel shall serve a copy of the plea to Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.The plea filed by the association has also sought declaring as “arbitrary” the action on the part of airlines in not refunding the full ticket amount. It said that on April 16, the Ministry of Civil Aviation had directed all airlines to refund the full amount collected for tickets booked during first lockdown period from March 25 to April 14, and also where refund was sought by passengers against booking being cancelled.The plea said the office memorandum further directed that for ticket booked during the first lockdown period for travel during the second lockdown period from April 15 to May 3 and the passenger seeking refund on cancellation of ticket, the airline shall refund the full amount without levy of cancellation charges.It said the DGCA had issued a circular on April 19 directing the airlines to refrain from booking tickets for journeys to be undertaken with effect from May 4.The plea claimed that despite the directives of the ministry and the DGCA, the airlines have failed to refund the ticket amount.“The action on the part of airlines insofar they fail to refund the money of the passengers is in blatant violation of the CAR given that the acceptance of ‘credit shell’ is at the sole discretion of the passengers,” it alleged.“It is submitted that the money lying in the ‘credit shell’ may not be of any avail to the passenger who had a specific reason for booking the tickets during the lockdown,” the plea said. It said that in these “testing times”, a passenger might require the money lying in ‘credit shell’ for immediate necessity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-centre-dgca-on-plea-for-refund-of-ticket-for-flights-cancelled-due-to-lockdown/story-s9HpgD40Y2s5IeEsHEKKuO.html

In addition to this, authorities should come up displays with descriptions about the year of construction of bridges, as many date back to the British era,” said Shikhar Paliwal, founder of the Being Bhagirath foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/selfie-points-to-come-up-on-british-era-bridges-in-haridwar/story-4jBmCKcuyLp9l1Jz1Qi3NO.html

Hou has, over the last few days, met President Bidhya Devi Bhandari and senior Nepal Communist Party (NCP) leader Madhav Kumar Nepal as well, triggering criticism about the envoy’s role in Nepal’s internal politics. Nepal and Khanal, both former prime ministers, are aligned with the rival faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known by his nom de guerre Prachanda.A meeting between Hou and Prachanda hasn’t matured yet. Prachanda, who is leading the campaign to oust PM Oli, is reluctant to meet her, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times. It is not clear how long he would be able to resist.Hou Yanqi’s deep interest in Nepal’s politics and PM Oli’s continuation has been widely criticised in Kathmandu.The Chinese Embassy has defended Hou’s meetings. Embassy spokesperson Zhang Si told the Kathmandu Post that China did not wish to see the Nepal Communist Party in trouble and wanted the leaders to resolve their differences and stay united.“The embassy keeps good relationships with Nepali leaders and is ready to exchange views on issues of common interest at any convenient time,” said Zhang, according to a report in the Post.The ambassador – and the embassy – keeps good relationships with the government, political parties , think tanks and all walks of life in Nepal, and always exchanges views on issues of common concern at convenient times, said Zhang.Prachanda’s reluctance to make it convenient to meet the ambassador stems from his experience in April this year when Hou persuaded the three big feuding players in the NCP - Prachanda, Madhav Nepal and Oli - to stay on the same side. That intervention came as a reprieve for PM Oli, who promptly fuelled a controversy around a 80-km road built by India and issued a new political map for Nepal to consolidate his position in the party and government.When the rebel leaders revived their campaign for his exit from one of the two posts that he holds - the NCPs co-chairman and the Prime Minister’s office - KP Sharma Oli promptly blamed New Delhi for the rebellion, even accusing Prachanda and his faction of batting for the Himalayan nation’s giant neighbour India that was upset over the map.PM Oli’s accusation, designed to put Prachanda on the back foot, however, appeared to backfire when he amped up the campaign against the prime minister, now insisting that Oli quit the prime minister’s office.Kathmandu watchers say Oli has dug in his heels and is unlikely to just give in. Instead, according to reports in Nepal’s media, he is planning to split the party and form a government in coalition with Sher Bahadur Deuba-led Nepali Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-envoy-hou-yanqi-steps-in-to-save-pm-oli-govt-her-office-says-don-t-want-ncp-in-trouble/story-d4YoLhsDt5bkF5qsavvnuJ.html

Your desk-job may be good for your health||Conventional wisdom has it that a desk-job with long hours before the computer is unhealthy, but new research released on Tuesday suggests that a typical office-based job has a lower risk of poor cognition compared to those that involve manual work.Research by experts at the University of Cambridge has concluded that people who work in jobs that require less physical activity – typically office and desk-based jobs – are at a lower risk of subsequent poor cognition than those whose work is more physically active.Lack of physical activity and exercise are known risk factors for major health conditions, including cognitive impairments such as memory and concentration problems. But evidence on whether physical activity actually protects against cognitive decline is inconclusive.The researchers examined patterns of physical activity among 8,500 men and women aged 40-79 years at the start of the study and who had a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds and educational attainment. The team was able to separate physical activity during work and leisure to see if these had different associations with later life cognition.The study, published on Tuesday in the International Journal of Epidemiology, concludes that individuals with no qualifications were more likely to have physically active jobs, but less likely to be physically active outside of work.Besides, a physically inactive job (typically a desk-job), is associated with lower risk of poor cognition, irrespective of the level of education. Those who remained in this type of work throughout the study period were the most likely to be in the top 10% of performers.Those in manual work had almost three times increased risk of poor cognition than those with an inactive job, the study adds.Says the study’s lead author Shabina Hayat: “The often used mantra ‘what is good for the heart, is good for the brain’ makes complete sense, but the evidence on what we need to do as individuals can be confusing”.“People who have less active jobs – typically office-based, desk jobs – performed better at cognitive tests regardless of their education. This suggests that because desk jobs tend to be more mentally challenging than manual occupations, they may offer protection against cognitive decline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chained-to-computer-your-desk-job-may-be-good-for-your-health/story-rjcjkJjYr0dPu9ZkFa9WON.html

Eight policemen were killed in an ambush in Kanpur when they had gone to arrest notorious criminal Vikas Dubey. The criminal continues to be on the run. “We’ve directed all police authorities in the State to assess the level of criminals before conducting raids, gather information about them and plan accordingly,” Uttarakhand DG (Law and Order) Ashok Kumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.  We've directed all police authorities in the State to assess the level of criminals before conducting raids, gather information about them and plan accordingly: Uttarakhand DG (Law and Order) Ashok Kumar on being asked about steps taken by police after UP's Kanpur encounter pic.twitter.com/yyMNY6xvIsThe officer said authorities have been told to raid only after taking everything into account. “If the criminal is of a very high level then we can call commandos for assistance,” he added.Fifty dedicated teams and over 3,000 police personnel across UP have been deployed in a massive manhunt to nab history-sheeter Vikas Dubey. The police have also raised the bounty on his head to Rs 2.5 lakh from the initial Rs 50,000.According to local police officials who did not want to be named, the UP police team came under attack from three sides when it had gone to arrest the criminal from his village in Kanpur. Taken by surprise, as they ran for cover, criminals on the ground accosted them and snatched their weapons, they said.By the time a wounded policeman escaped the site and raised an alarm, the criminals — believed to be around 20 in number — escaped.The autopsy report said that the policemen were killed by their own weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assess-level-of-criminals-before-planning-raids-uttarakhand-top-cop-after-kanpur-encounter/story-37TwHV3IeX2igLt532KifI.html
07-07-2020||India||With 40 teams chasing Kanpur gangster, UP police vows not to sit quietly till Dubey is nabbed||Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday said 40 police teams and a special task force was hunting for dreaded gangster Vikas Dubey, on the run after ambushing eight policemen with the help of his accomplices in Kanpur city last Thursday night. The state police chief added that the force will not rest until Dubey is nabbed.The sensational and barbaric execution of policemen last Thursday night is also in focus for exposing moles in the state police force who actively tipped off Dubey hours before the police raid and led their own colleagues into a deadly trap laid by the gangster. A stunned UP police force is now in hot pursuit of the gangster who managed to flee with his accomplices the same night.“40 teams and STF are working. We’re collecting information on Vikas Dubey’s accomplices and members of his family. Until and unless we arrest Vikas Dubey and his accomplices, we will not sit quietly,” UP’s ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar was quoted as saying on Tuesday by news agency ANI.Two sub-inspectors and a constable were suspended yesterday over suspicion that they might have leaked information to Dubey. Another sub-inspector was suspended earlier for his alleged links with Dubey. The police chief cited the huge cache of arms and explosives found at Dubey’s house which was razed down by police later to question if there was a deeper link to this incident.3 more cops suspended on suspicion of links to Vikas Dubey“The entire house was searched and 2 kg of explosive substance, 6 country-made pistols, 15 crude bombs and 25 cartridges were recovered,” Kumar said before adding, “Where did they get such a huge cache of weapons? What weapons were used? Information was received that someone kept it hidden at his home.”Police had also stumbled upon a concrete bunker built inside Dubey’s house that was stocked with provisions to last for months apart from the seized weapons and explosives, hidden carefully inside the walls.25 cops, all eyewitnesses to 2001 murder, turned hostile during Dubey’s triaState-wide raids to track down Dubey, who faces 60 criminal cases, are continuing. An alert has been sounded in all 75 districts of the state and 25 teams from 40 police stations are involved in search operations. UP borders have been sealed and posters put up at toll plazas in the state amidst apprehensions that he might have already crossed the border. The bounty on his head was increased to Rs 2.5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh.Officials believe that Dubey had supporters in the police force who helped him and his gang have a free run. This suspicion was corroborated when Daya Shankar Agnihotri, an aide of Dubey arrested on Sunday, claimed in a video statement that Dubey had been alerted about the raid by a caller from a police station. It is suspected that the police station in question could be the one in Chaubeypur, about 14km from Bikru village where Dubey lived. Vinay Tiwari, the Chaubeypur station officer was the first person to be suspended in the case. There are allegations that he has been protecting Dubey. “It is viral in the media that Circle Officer Devendra Mishra, who lost his life in Kanpur encounter, had written a letter. DGP has sent an IG level officer to investigate this. The truth will come out in the investigation,” Prashant Kumar said., referring to reports that Bilhaur circle officer Mishra, who led the raid team to Dubey’s village, had told former Kanpur senior superintendent of police about Tiwari protecting Dubey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-40-teams-chasing-kanpur-gangster-up-police-vows-not-to-sit-quietly-till-dubey-is-nabbed/story-jpb0EWWQxcmj9gnzP01zpN.html

Another sub-inspector was suspended earlier over his alleged links with Dubey.Officials were also probing a purported report by Devendra Mishra, the deputy superintendent killed in the failed raid.HC Awasthy, Uttar Pradesh’s director general of police, has said the force was conducting raids to track down Dubey, who faces 60 criminal cases.An alert has been sounded in all the 75 districts of the state and 25 teams from 40 police stations pressed into action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-firing-up-police-release-photos-details-of-15-absconding-accused/story-vVkjOCqMfUA147NvoFteKK.html
07-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand HC reserves judgement in PIL against govt takeover of Char Dham, 51 other temples||Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Monday reserved its judgment in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy against the state government’s takeover of the Char Dhams and 51 other temples in the hill state by invoking the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019, said counsel Manisha Bhandari, who appeared in the matter along with petitioner Swamy.Kartikey Hari Gupta, the counsel representing intervenor, Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), in the matter that is supporting the state government’s stand, said the court over the past week had heard all the parties concerned and reserved its judgment in the matter.The PIL had challenged the constitutional validity of the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019, by which the administration and control of major Hindu religious institutions have been taken over by the Uttarakhand government or by any authority functioning under the state government.Last December, the Uttarakhand assembly had passed the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Bill.In January, Uttarakhand Governor Baby Rani Maurya gave her assent for the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019.Aggrieved priests had threatened that they would move the HC against the Act, as they claimed to have been kept in the dark about the new law.They had alleged that the government took the step to ensure its control over shrine-related issues, bypassing the powerful priest community. On February 10, a four-member delegation of the state’s priest body met Swamy and submitted documents that were required to file a PIL along with a copy of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019.Soon, Swamy filed the PIL against the formation of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board and the resultant Act.Gupta said he argued in favour of the state government’s decision and presented various historical and legal documents before the court.He said the Act does not interfere in the matter of religion, it only regulates the temporal functions associated with matters of faith, as far as these shrines are concerned.“The administration of these temples was made by the then HC bench of Kumaon in 1899, which had separated the religious and temporal affairs. The 1939 Act for the management of these temples records that the law was needed due to the mismanagement of temples and also to alleviate pilgrims’ plight. The new Act has been passed to further that objective and it is valid,” he said.Gupta cited that the shrines’ mismanagement led to a separation of religious and temporal functions.“Irish lawyer Edwin T. Atkinson has recorded this fact of gross mismanagement of temples in the Himalayan Gazetteer published in 1884. The Supreme Court in its Ayodhya Ram Mandir judgement last November had also held that gazetteers are key evidence that courts can rely on,” he added. Gupta said he apprised the HC that “Manusmiriti, which is the ancient text for Hindu laws, in its Chapter 7 lays down that it is the choice of the King as to whom he wants to keep a priest and all rites and sacrifices in temples are performed by priests on his behalf. Thus, priests have no inherent right to manage temples. Scholar and educational reformer Madan Mohan Malaviya in 1933 had also published a book appealing to the public to hand over the management of temples for their better upkeep.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-hc-reserves-judgement-in-pil-against-govt-takeover-of-char-dham-51-other-temples/story-h8Lt9Ty7WBrbqTUpZk7VDK.html
07-07-2020||India||ED slaps money laundering case against GVK group and MIAL for airport scam||The Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday filed a money laundering case against GVK Group that runs the Mumbai airport, its chairman Dr G V K Reddy, his son G V Sanjay Reddy and several others for alleged irregularities worth over Rs 800 crore in the development of Mumbai airport, officials familiar with the developments said.ED’s probe under PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) is based on a CBI FIR registered on June 27 in which 13 people were named including Reddy and his Sanjay Reddy, MIAL (Mumbai International Airport Limited) and several companies which were given contracts at the airport. CBI had even searched the premises of GVK in Mumbai and Hyderabad last week. The anti money laundering probe agency will soon start examining the accounts of companies and transfer of funds to ascertain the money laundering. It has powers to attach properties during investigation.In a statement issued last week, a MIAL spokesperson said, “MIAL is surprised to note the registration of case by CBI against MIAL and others. MIAL would have provided every assistance had the agency sought explanation or any document even if a preliminary enquiry had been initiated. MIAL is a transparent and responsible corporate entity which is committed to co-operate with the agency in its investigation to arrive at the truth”. On Tuesday, a GVK spokesperson said, “We have not received any notice from the Enforcement Directorate”.MIAL is a PPP (public private partnership) between AAI (Airports Authority of India), GVK and foreign entities in the name of MIAL under which GVK has a shareholding of 50.5%, AAI with 26% and remaining with shareholding is with foreign companies.The AAI entered an OMDA (operation, management and development agreement) in April, 2006 for modernization and up gradation, operation and maintenance of Mumbai airport as part of joint venture called –MIAL. As per the agreement, it was decided that MIAL will share 38.7% of their revenue as annual fee with AAI and that the government authority will have the first right on the revenue. “The essence of agreement was to create a world class facility and at the same time protecting the interests of government of India, promoters and passengers,” CBI FIR filed on June 27 states.“Despite there being a clear cut understanding in the OMDA, the promoters of GVK group in MIAL, in connivance with their executives and the unknown officials of AAI resorted to siphoning of funds fraudulently adopting various modus operandi,” CBI says.It has been alleged that MIAL entered into fake work contracts during 2017-18 with at least nine companies on the pretext of real estate development. MIAL transferred the funds to them but these projects have never been executed on the ground, and the transactions were only on papers. Using this modus operandi, Rs 310 crore have been fraudulently siphoned off which resulted in wrongful loss to AAI and corresponding gain to themselves. Similarly, from 2012 onwards, GVK used the surplus of MIAL to the tune of Rs 395 crore to finance their other group companies. The promoters of GVK, CBI has alleged, also embezzled funds by resorting to inflating the expenditure of MIAL.Subsequently, CBI FIR alleges that the GVK group connived with their family members, relatives and employees they assigned the premium retail areas of Mumbai airport to their family members at extremely low rates thereby reducing the revenue of MIAL on account of rentals and sales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-slaps-money-laundering-case-against-gvk-group-and-mial-for-airport-scam/story-h64ohqBSo4JpzCCvNmYU4O.html

The increase in recovery rate was recorded on the day India crossed the grim milestone of over 20,000 deaths due to the infection, with 467 new deaths in the last 24 hours. The country has recorded cases over 20,000 for fifth day in a row. However, in terms of death toll globally due to Covid-19, India is at the seventh spot, behind United States, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain, indicating better grasp over the infection spread in the country. Just a day before, India had overtaken Russia as the third most affected country globally, behind the United States and Brazil. While the country recorded one lakh coronavirus cases in 110 days, it took just 49 days for the cases to multiply seven fold and cross the seven-lakh mark. India’s case fatality rate is approximately 2.8 per cent and the number of active cases a little over a third of the total, suggesting the country’s health care system is able to keep up with the outbreak.In contrast with first week of June and May when India had recorded an average of 250 and 101 deaths respectively, the country has recorded an average of 450 deaths every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-from-one-lakh-cases-in-110-days-to-7-lakh-in-just-49-days/story-tw6fIRPEBn2zrbwbATMl8L.html

During the operation, some Maoists opened fire and the security personnel retaliated. On Tuesday morning, the body of an active member of the Bansadhara-Ghumusar-Nagabali division of CPI-Maoist outfit was recovered along with two weapons and some other Maoist articles from the spot.Also Read: Maoists preponed tactical counter-offensive campaign in ChhattisgarhMeanwhile, police said the identity of three of the four Maoists killed in the Sunday operation has been established. One of them was identified as Kosa Sodi alias Sukru, a member of the Odisha state committee of the CPI(Maoist) with a bounty of Rs 20 lakh on his head. Sodi hailed from Malkangiri district and had taken the place of Sabyasachi Panda after his expulsion from the outfit in 2012 and is involved in a number of cases. Two others were identified as Itesh and Reena, both area committee members with rewards of Rs 4 lakh each on their heads.Sunday’s encounter of Maoists was the first by police in Odisha this year. In August last year, police in Malkangiri district had killed Rakesh Sodhi, a platoon commander with a bounty of Rs 8 lakh on his head during an encounter.

07-07-2020||India||Rajasthan has more inbred tigers than any other state in India: Research||Rajasthan has more inbred tigers than any other state in the country, ongoing research by the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) has found.Anubhab Khan, one of the researchers who is a part of the NCBS team, said the reason behind the inbreeding—producing offspring from mating or breeding of individuals or organisms that are closely related genetically—in Rajasthan because of their isolation. “Tigers from here have dispersed up to 150-200 km towards Madhya Pradesh, but there aren’t any reports of any coming to Rajasthan from other states,” Khan said.“We have sequenced tiger genome across Rajasthan. Here, mostly the tigers have dispersed or shifted from the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) to Sarika Tiger Reserve (STR) in Alwar and Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) in Kota. This shows that all the Rajasthan tigers are related,” he added.The NCBS team has been using hair, blood, tissue and muscle samples from the big cats to create their genetic database and pedigree in Rajasthan.“In the six-year-long study, we have collected blood samples (besides tissue and muscle samples) from 18 dead or tranquilised tigers, and hair sheds of 34 tigers,” he added.Khan said the study of tiger genome through its hair is a faster and reliable method. “Earlier, we had to wait for a tiger to get tranquilised, but now we just need to follow the tiger and wait for him to sit,” he said.The researchers, so far have studied 60 tigers from eight states of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Khan said the study was useful in numerous ways. For example, he said, that if a tiger is to be shifted from Ranthambore to Mukundra, the sequencing of its genome will help identify the RTR big cat—not related to any other such animal in MHTR—that can be sent there for better reproduction.“Mitochondrial (related to cell) lineage can also be studied. During the study, we found that T-47 (a tiger) whose parents were not known is from the family of Machli, the longest surviving tigress,” he said.Emphasising on the need for inbreeding, RTR field director Manoj Parashar said it has been seen everywhere as the tiger population is isolated. It’s the tigers from RTR, which have gone to Sariska and Mukundra. There are zero possibilities that any tiger from outside comes in contact.“Inbreeding is right but it has not affected the population figure of tiger,” he said.Parashar said the research is ongoing and the report is yet to be submitted.A senior forest official, who did not want to be named, said in order to avoid inbreeding and create a fresh gene pool of tigers, the forest department in Rajasthan is mulling bringing two to three big cats from Madhya Pradesh under the tiger reintroduction programme to the Sariska Tiger Reserve.Sariska has 20 big cats—11 females, five males and four cubs.The officer also pointed to the need for a fresh gene pool of tigers.“In the case of the death of tiger ST-16, cancer was suspected.

The night flying activity seen in Ladakh is part of IAF training to keep the skills of pilots and other personnel honed,” he said. “The challenges in those hills are many, especially illusions caused due to hill shadows and faulty depth perception that are overcome with experience,” said Bahadur, a veteran helicopter pilot who has carried out night flying in the area.While disengagement is underway along the tense and heavily militarised border, the Indian armed forces are keeping their guard up and advancing with maximum caution with the IAF’s forward air bases continuing to be on their highest state of alert to deal with any Chinese provocation, a second official said.The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has withdrawn up to 1.5 km from friction areas in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra along the LAC, and the Indian Army has pulled back proportionately, acting on an understanding reached last week by top Indian and Chinese military commanders on a phased de-escalation of the ongoing border conflict, as reported by Hindustan Times on Tuesday. Some thinning of PLA soldiers has also been noticed at the sensitive Finger Area near Pangong Tso.The IAF has played a key role in the Ladakh sector since border tensions began in early May. Its C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft have been used to move soldiers, tanks and infantry combat vehicles to the sector, while C-130J Super Hercules aircraft have undertaken sorties to the advanced landing ground in the strategic Daulat Beg Oldie sector to support the military’s forward deployments, the officials said.The IAF’s new inductions --- the Apache attack and Chinook multi-mission helicopters --- have significantly enhanced the IAF’s capabilities, the officials said. Armed with fire-and-forget Hellfire missiles, an Apache can track up to 128 targets a minute and prioritise threats. The missiles equip the gunships with anti-armour capabilities. The Chinook’s main roles include transporting troops, artillery and battlefield resupply.The defence ministry last week approved the purchase of weapons and ammunition worth Rs 38,900 crore, including 33 new fighter jets for the IAF that is grappling with a shortage of warplanes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-projects-day-night-all-weather-combat-capability-in-ladakh/story-31G9srT7pcmyg5KYIDzyDO.html

We aim to conduct 3,000 tests in the ward by Wednesday,” Sarma had tweeted on Monday.The move follows the detection of 3,891 Covid-19 positive cases in Guwahati and rest of the Kamrup Metro district between June 24 and July 6.Earlier, the Assam government had imposed 14-day lockdown restrictions from June 28 to July 12 in the Kamrup Metro district in a bid to contain the viral outbreak.Sarma had admitted that community transmission of the pandemic occurred in Guwahati. The door-to-door RAD tests are aimed at measuring the extent of spread of the viral disease within the community.“We decided to start the campaign with Pandu, as the area has become a Covid-19 hotspot and many cases have been detected from there. Other localities in the city will also be covered at a later stage,” Sarma told media persons on Monday.Some districts in Assam have imposed travel bans to Guwahati because of the spike in Covid-19 positive cases in the city and other parts of the Kamrup Metro district.On Saturday, Sonitpur district authorities imposed restrictions in a bid to ensure “public health, hygiene, and safety of the general public”.The move follows similar steps taken by Nalbari and Barpeta district administrations while invoking the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.Several districts in the state have taken a cue from Kamrup Metro and enforced lockdown restrictions, as Assam grapples with its annual woes, the flood fury due to torrential downpour and swollen rivers. So far, floods have affected over 6.9 lakh people in 17 districts in the state and 38 people have died due to the seasonal scourge.On Monday, a two-week lockdown restrictions began in the hilly and tribal-dominated Dima Hasao district, allowing only 30% of all grocery shops to operate between 11 am and 4 pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.The authorities in Upper Assam’s Jorhat district also announced on Monday that they would impose a lockdown for from July 9 to July 15.Dima Hasao and Jorhat districts have recorded 89 and 145 Covid-19 positive cases, respectively, to date.Assam has reported 12,522 Covid-19 positive cases, including 7,882 recoveries and 14 deaths, until Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/door-to-door-covid-19-testing-begins-in-guwahati-after-spike-in-cases/story-vpgijhhKTDhBldYW1wXz6I.html

A part of this amount is being spent as compensation for those whose houses were damaged by cyclone Amphan. But there have been complaints that thousands of people whose houses were not damaged also got the money.More than 50 of those TMC workers who received show-cause notice from the party in Nandigram have returned the compensation of Rs 20,000 that the government transferred to their bank accounts for repairing homes. In no other area of Bengal has so many people been charged by the party in a single move. Complaints of nepotism in south Bengal districts run into thousands.“TMC will conduct a survey in all 25 community blocks in the district and take action against errant workers,” said Sisir Adhikari, TMC Lok Sabha member and the party’s East Midnapore unit president.TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee had on Sunday said that those involved in nepotism would be punished by the party.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Monday that the state government is rectifying the lapses which might have occurred in its efforts to pay the compensation to the victims quickly.“A few lapses might have taken place while we fast- tracked the compensation payment process on an emergency basis. We are rectifying the anomalies. Every affected family will receive the monetary relief,” she had said.Incidentally, the TMC-led movement against acquisition of farmland for a chemical hub at Nandigram witnessed unprecedented violence in the last years of the Left Front government and helped Banerjee come to power in 2011. The violence, which continued for more than two years, erupted after 14 villagers died in police firing in 2007. It is widely acknowledged that without the Nandigram movement and a prolonged agitation against the proposed Tata small car plant at Singur in Hooghly district, Banerjee might not have been able to overthrow the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led government. The two incidents rocked the state, became headlines in the international media and galvanised public opinion against the Buddhadeb Battacharjee government. “TMC sponsored the violence in Nandigram with help from Maoists. After she came to power, Banerjee promised to transform Nandigram with new industries. It never happened and local people had to look for jobs in other states. Now they are witnessing loot by the ruling party,” said Md Salim, a member of the CPI(M) politburo.The BJP on Monday started an agitation at Singur as well, alleging that a woman who had asked for tarpaulin after the cyclone was raped by a TMC worker in June. The party said the woman and her husband were threatened and told not to go to the police.BJP state women’s wing president Agnimitra Paul led the agitation at Singur police station. “The woman has two children. She was raped and threatened,” she said. An officer at the police station said that a complaint has been registered.While community block development offices are still receiving applications from scores of people who did not receive the compensation, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has turned this into a raging issue prior to the 2021 assembly polls. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh on Sunday launched a website where people who have been deprived can lodge complaints. To counter this, TMC has accused the BJP of indulging in the same nepotism in several parts in North 24 Parganas district. On Monday, TMC workers staged an agitation at a panchayat office in the district’s Bagdah area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-congress-pulls-up-200-workers-after-allegations-of-corruption-in-distribution-of-cyclone-relief-amount/story-gNOb4AlyE9353v3TVtelvO.html

She had come to visit her grandmother, who lives at Agripada in south Mumbai, in June.The rape survivor, who had befriended the accused on the social media network about a year ago, has been in regular touch with him, her relatives told the police.“On July 1, the accused, who works at a Haryana-based company that manufactures bottled water, along with his MP-based friends came to Mumbai in a private vehicle and picked up the minor girl from Agripada. He took her to his native state Rajasthan and raped her there,” said Sawalaram Agawane, senior inspector, Agripada police station.The police started a probe on the basis of a complaint filed by the rape survivor’s grandmother at Agripada police station.A preliminary probe revealed that the rape survivor was in contact with a person on the social media network for a while and recently the communication had become more regular.Police analysed her social media activities and zeroed in on a suspect’s profile and also found his phone number linked to it. An analysis of the call details traced the accused’s links to Rajasthan and MP.Two separate police teams were sent to these two states.A police team arrested the accused and rescued the rape survivor from Rajasthan’s Jhalawar district on Monday. While the other team arrested the accused’s three accomplices from MP. Police have also seized an MP registered car that was used in the rape survivor’s abduction.“The accused have been brought to Mumbai on transit remand. They will be produced before a court on Tuesday. However, one accused is still wanted in the case,” said R Syed, inspector, Agripada police station.The accused has been booked under relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, Agawane said.The rape survivor has been sent to a children’s home for safe custody, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-22-year-old-from-rajasthan-arrested-for-kidnapping-raping-minor/story-bH88sUX6soC8dqXd5IM7hN.html
07-07-2020||India||‘BJP is LeBron James of elections, Congress a dilettante’: Sanjay Jha||Drawing attention to the BJP’s pole position in election management, Congress member Sanjay Jha, who was recently removed as party spokesperson, compared the party performance to one of the greats of American basketball: LeBron James. In comparison, the leader, said the Congress appeared like “dilly-dallying dilettantes”.“The BJP is the LeBron James of election management and organisational agility. By comparison, we look like dilly-dallying dilettantes. It is an asymmetrical war,” wrote Jha in an article for scroll.in.The Congress has still not addressed the leadership issue in the party, with Sonia Gandhi holding the reins as interim president after Rahul Gandhi resigned taking responsibility for the dismal performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. At the party’s top body meet recently, there was again the murmur of Rahul Gandhi returning as president, however the rumours have been strongly denied by the Congress. Zoya Hasan, who taught at JNU and authored a book on the Congress, told HT there is a larger problem with the party. “...The basic problem is that Congress doesn’t have a full time president for more than a year which should be unacceptable at any time but more so when the ruling party has a strong leader and the leading opposition party has none. It’s odd for a party to have an interim president (Sonia Gandhi) and de facto president (Rahul Gandhi) but no full time president. No political party can function without a full time president,” said Hasan.The BJP has already kickstarted its virtual ‘Jan samvad’ to spread the its message with elections in Bihar and Bengal ahead. There is no such activity seen on the Congress side. Turning spotlight on the Congress rule - 55 years since Independence - Jha said the party needs to step up “not through an occasional sugar-rush or Twitter tantrums, but a bold imaginative structural transformation”.The leader was removed as party spokesperson after he wrote two articles in a major daily that predicted the Congress’s political oblivion because of its “extraordinary lassitude and lackadaisical attitude”.He complained about the lack of internal democracy in the party and called for renewal of political strategy and brought the focus back on the leadership issue.In an earlier tweet, he also made it clear that he will be “throwing his hat in the ring” as a candidate for the Congress Working Committee - the highest decision-making body in the grand old party - as and when the polls are held.Jha, Mumbai-based former banker-turned-Congress politician, in his latest article, called the Congress “India’s most powerful brand”, but added that it needed a “dramatic reinvention”.Underlining that he is not joining the BJP or any other party, Jha said those who criticised him for speaking the “truth” have not cared to understand him. As a way forward, he suggested that they revisit My Experiments With Truth and Discovery of India, books by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, respectively.The party leader, who calls himself “hardcore Nehruvian”, also offered hope, saying one can always start anew. “It is never too late to make a new beginning. The ostrich is the fastest animal on two legs, reportedly clocking a mind-numbing 75 km an hour. The giant bird is also known for burying its head in the sand. The Congress must make a choice,” wrote Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-is-lebron-james-of-election-management-congress-a-dilettante-sanjay-jha/story-N8aO5kbv9ML4nw9kQSAuAN.html

They alleged that Unitech had convinced them to book a flat at Wild Flowers Country in Gurgaon for a sum of Rs 57.34 lakh in August 2011.Later, 90 more complaints concerning the same project were registered against the firm.

07-07-2020||India||India keeps focus on building border infrastructure, Rajnath Singh chairs crucial meet to review projects||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday held a meeting with Border Roads Organisation (BRO) chief Lt Gen Harpal Singh and other officials about the progress in ongoing infrastructure projects on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China and Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan.The meeting went for about an hour where the BRO chief gave presentation to Singh about the work being done to boost infrastructure in India’s border areas, news agency ANI reported.India’s push to improve the infrastructure in the border areas was the primary reason for clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. Beijing was opposed to a 60-metre bridge over Galwan river in eastern Ladakh that would consolidate India’s hold of the sensitive sector by allowing Indian infantry to move across the cold mountain river and also protect the 255 km strategic road from Darbuk to Daulat Beg Oldie, the last military post just south of the Karakoram Pass.That bridge was completed last month, days after a face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers.In the last few years, there have been frequent face-offs in certain sensitive areas in Eastern Ladakh. It has been a direct outcome of India’s ability of increased patrolling in the area due to vastly improved infrastructure readiness.The genesis of the building up of faster strategic infrastructure can be traced back to 2014, when the Modi government gave it a big push. One of the first decision of the government was to issue a general approval in July 2014 for the creation of road network by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) within 100 km of aerial distance from LAC. This general approval ensured that requirement of prior central government and other bureaucratic process were done away with.In May, the BRO completed a key road in Uttarakhand which will cut travel time drastically. The road was inaugurated by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh through video conferencing. He also flagged off a caravan of nine vehicles from Pithoragarh to Gunji to indicate that both passengers and load can be sent by the new road stretch through mountainous terrain.The road has been built from Ghatibagar in Dharchula to Lipulekh near the border with China. It is also known as Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra Route. The road is 75 kilometre long.The road ends at the 17,000 feet high Lipulekh pass. From there, Mount Kailash is located around 97 km north of the pass in Tibet. The Lipulekh pass, close to the tri-junction of India-China-Nepal, is the lowest point in this section of the high Himalayas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-keeps-focus-on-building-border-infrastructure-rajnath-singh-chairs-crucial-meet-to-review-projects/story-Ar1BNZOKmq1uf1frBD56hP.html
07-07-2020||India||BJP relying on the Kashmir issue to stitch Bengal strategy||The 119th birth anniversary of nationalist leader Dr. Syama Prasad Mookherjee, the founder president of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, which led to the birth of the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1980, was used as a platform by the party president JP Nadda to target the Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal.However, the policies of the Congress and the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, particularly in the context of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), were the mainstay of his speech.Addressing a digital rally on Monday, Nadda dubbed the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) government as an impediment to Bengal’s development and called for dismissing it “lock, stock, and barrel”.As the Bengal assembly polls, slated to be held next year, draws near; the BJP has been sharpening its attack against its main rival, the TMC. From accusing it of fostering policies of appeasement to shielding those involved in financial scams; the BJP has recently begun blaming the Bengal government of not taking the Centre’s help in its battle against the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and “depriving” the people of the state of benefits of Central schemes such as Ayushman Bharat.However, it was Dr. Mookherjee’s clarion call of “ek desh, ek nishan, ek vidhan” to scrap the special status of J&K that has set the tone for the BJP’s battle royale in the state in next year’s assembly polls.On Monday, Nadda trained his guns on the TMC government by accusing the party of being power-hungry and chose Dr. Mookherjee as an arsenal. He said Dr. Mookerjee, who was instrumental in ensuring that Bengal and Punjab were not merged with Pakistan during the Partition in 1947, had opted to resign from the Nehru cabinet, when he had felt ideologically distanced from the government.“West Bengal has always given the country a new vision and a new direction, however, under the current dispensation, the state’s condition is pitiable. The current West Bengal government has not only ruined education in the state, manufacturing, and trade has also been severely affected. For the sake of the country and West Bengal, Dr. Mookherjee had resigned from a position of power. However, to the current government clinging to power is all that matters,” Nadda said.The party is relying on the J&K issue to stitch its Bengal strategy for the next year’s assembly polls.By bringing up Dr. Mookherjee’s stand on the Kashmir issue it has drawn a comparison between the Bharatiya Jan Sangh founder’s push for national integration versus CM Banerjee’s constant tussle with the Centre.“The state government has adopted the policy of appeasement and violence in the state. It is not even cooperating with the Centre in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, whereas PM Narendra Modi has been speaking about cooperative federalism. The West Bengal government has not allowed BJP MLAs (members of legislative assembly) and MPs (members of Parliament) to participate in the war against the viral outbreak. The TMC government is busy filing cases against BJP lawmakers in a bid keep them under house arrest,” Nadda said.In Bengal, where the BJP had won a record 18 of the 42 Lok Saba seats in last year’s parliamentary polls, the party is assiduously trying to dislodge the TMC government from power.It recently rejigged its state unit and expanded the roles of known Banerjee-baiters.And while its political opponents have accused it of trying to appropriate the legacy of Dr. Mookherjee, social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and renowned poet Nazrul Islam; the BJP has found ways of linking the current discourse to its ideology.For instance, the issue of stripping J&K of special status, which has a pan-India resonance, has been particularly cited in the context of Dr. Mookherjee’s sacrifice.“Dr. Mookherjee’s three contributions in the national interest can never be forgotten -- the partition of Bengal before the Independence, the establishment of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh and the J&K movement,” Nadda said.Will the BJP’s gambit of making Dr. Mookherjee and J&K the focal point of the Bengal polls pay off?Ajay Gudavarthy, a political commentator and a faculty member at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said the BJP could benefit from linking the polls to the reading down of Article 370 of the Constitution. “Dr. Mookherjee is not part of the popular discourse or culture of Bengal in the way, say, Swami Vivekananda is. His name may resonate with the urban middle class, but the issue of J&K and the scrapping of Article 370 is an emotional issue that people support,” he said.BJP’s national vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, however, said it is a matter of interpretation, if the party is reviving Dr. Mookherjee’s legacy for its own political gains.“Dr. Mookerjee’s legacy is an inseparable part of national politics. He has been an icon of our ideology and our political journey; and consequently, bound to figure in our narrative,” Sahasrabuddhe said.“We cannot help if people find that there are many similarities in the current situation in West Bengal and those during the times of Dr. Mookherjee. If there is any party that is talking about his legacy, it is the BJP. Although he was a Congressman, the Congress has forgotten him. It is the BJP that tried to translate his ideals into reality. For example, his dream of keeping secessionist forces in J&K at bay by abrogating Article 370,” he added.Saugata Roy, TMC’s Lok Sabha MP from Dum Dum constituency, said the BJP is banking on Dr. Mookherjee since the party doesn’t have an icon in the state that it can call its own.“Dr. Mookherjee never had a deep political base in Bengal...while he enjoyed respect because of being the son of Sir Ashutosh Mookherjee, Syama Prasad was never a freedom fighter and never went to jail... the BJP is projecting him because it doesn’t have an icon In Bengal.

The two sides also spoke about working together to avoid such incidents in future, a top government official had said.Doval and Wang, the two special representatives on the boundary issue, had “a frank and in-depth exchange of views on the recent developments in the Western Sector of the India-China border areas”, an external affairs ministry statement had said. On Tuesday, the former Congress president tweeted two photographs of the statements issued by India and China after Sunday’s talk between Doval and Wang. A part of the Chinese statement has been highlighted in one of the photographs.“National interest is paramount. GOI’s duty is to protect it,” Rahul Gandhi posted on Twitter.“Then, 1. Why has Status Quo Ante not been insisted on? 2. Why is China allowed to justify the murder of 20 unarmed jawans in our territory? 3. Why is there no mention of the territorial sovereignty of Galwan valley?” Gandhi asked.Rahul Gandhi has been relentless with his attack on the government over the border standoff with China in Galwan Valley of eastern Ladakh.The Congress party has also been taking jibes at the Centre since the June 15 violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley, which resulted in the killing of 20 Indian Army soldiers, including the commanding officer of 16 Bihar Regiment.It has also been questioning the government whether Indian land has been occupied by China.The Bharatiya Janata Party, on its part, has attacked the opposition party for what it called the demoralising of the country’s armed forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-3-questions-rahul-gandhi-reminds-govt-of-its-duty-over-border-stand-off/story-k0CtH3F5CZSQcmQHNkJV0N.html

We will attain the number one slot in this unfortunate area if the number of cases continue to go up,” it said.The war of Mahabharata lasted for 18 days. Prime Minister Modi had exuded confidence (in March) that we will win this battle against Covid-19 in 21 days. But it has been over 100 days and the coronavirus still persists and those fighting it have become tired, the Shiv Sena said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Patients are recovering on a big scale in Maharashtra, but the situation in some areas of the state turns one restless, it said citing the example of Thane district, which has been a major Covid-19 hotspot.The Shiv Sena said several politicians, public representatives, policemen, health workers and other administrators are getting infected by the disease, and this does not suit the country and states.“The coronavirus will be there and (we) need to live with it...the vaccine for coronavirus will not be available before 2021...that means (we) will have to live with coronavirus at least till then, it said.Without naming anyone or any party, the Shiv Sena said questions are being raised as to for how many days the lockdown will continue.But when you open the door (ease restrictions), the “messengers (threat) of coronavirus” are right out there, the Marathi publication said.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has relaxed lockdown restrictions to some extent, but the threat is still not over, the Sena said.It said the Covid-19 must be fought even though the industries, economy and lifestyle have been hit hard by the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-fight-more-difficult-than-mahabharata-shiva-sena-takes-dig-at-pm-modi/story-bVzgsjYhO7DQHY5hTMG2yN.html
07-07-2020||India||After eight days, diesel price hiked again; petrol remains unchanged||New Delhi: Fuel prices again started moving north after a pause for eight days, as oil companies on Tuesday raised pump price of diesel by 25 paise that pushed up its price in Delhi to a record Rs 80.78 per litre.The retail price of petrol, however, remained unchanged for the eighth day on Tuesday at Rs 80.43 per litre, according to state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). Retail prices of auto fuels differ from city to city across the country due to variations in local levies.Pump prices of auto fuels that witnessed a rising streak since June 7 saw 12.86% and 16.41% jump in the rate of petrol and diesel, respectively.In comparison, the international benchmark, Brent crude, rose by 1.89% in the last one month.During the intraday trade on Tuesday, Brent was trading at $42.81 per barrel, or about 1.3% lower than the previous day’s close weighed down by a stronger dollar and oversupply concerns.A petroleum ministry spokesperson said, “The diesel and petrol prices in the country are linked to the international prices of finished products, and not crude prices.”However, he could not immediately provide the percentage changes in global benchmarks of petrol and diesel in the one-month period between June 7 and July 7.An executive of state-run oil marketing firm said, requesting anonymity, that companies do not disclose data related to the price movement of petrol and diesel benchmarks as a matter of commercial secret.Theoretically, the government has no role in the daily revision of petrol and diesel prices, as these are deregulated products. The government had deregulated petrol pricing in 2010 and diesel in 2014.State-run fuel retailers – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) – declined comments. The three public sector oil companies control over 90% of domestic fuel retail trade.The oil company executive mentioned above said petrol and diesel rates are also high because of a significant jump in central levies that mop up the entire price benefits when international crude oil prices were low.In the last one month, petrol and diesel rates have seen 21 and 23 revisions, respectively.Prior to the start of a daily price surge, petrol was sold at Rs 71.26 per litre in Delhi and diesel at Rs 69.39 a litre on June 6.Two people with direct knowledge of fuel pricing matters, requesting anonymity, said that the price rise in the last month also gave an opportunity to state-run oil marketing companies to recover their past losses, as they had frozen fuel rates to provide relief to consumers, who had been distressed by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Fuel retailers had frozen petrol and diesel rates since March 16.However, retail prices were raised on May 5 because the Delhi government had raised the value-added tax (VAT).Almost all states have raised VAT on petrol and diesel since mid-March to take advantage of low oil prices in the global markets.One of the persons working in the petroleum ministry said all past dues of oil marketing companies have been already been recovered and the current fuel price hike is purely aligned with international prices of petrol and diesel. Diesel prices in Delhi have surpassed petrol because the state government raised VAT on diesel sharply. Even otherwise, internationally, diesel rates are higher than petrol, the person said. The Union government raised excise duties on petrol and diesel twice – first on March 14 by Rs 3 per litre each, and later on May 5 by Rs 10 a litre on petrol and Rs 13 on diesel. A Re 1 per litre hike in excise duty meant an additional Rs 14,500 crore revenue to the exchequer.Consumers could not reap the benefit of the recent oil price slump because both the Centre and states have cornered the entire benefits through higher levies in the forms of central excise and VAT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-eight-days-diesel-price-hiked-again-petrol-remains-unchanged/story-HhgX9cnQ1DYynUYgwPLl2O.html
07-07-2020||India||Despite worries, many felt happy during Covid-19 lockdown, finds online survey||During the first two phases of lockdown (March 25-May 3), not everyone was fearful. There were some who were happy for different reasons like getting ample time to spend with family and working from home in pyjamas. Happiness is also coming from the fact that they do not have to commute to work daily and getting stuck in traffic.This has been revealed by a pan-India online survey conducted by Centre for Marketing in Emerging Economies (CMEE) at Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow (IIML). The survey was conducted in collaboration with Qualisys Research and Consulting.“This wasn’t a planned holiday but a sudden one. I am getting more family time which is a rarity these days, more sleep and less work is making this time worthwhile,” said a 22-year-old student from Punjab.There were 931 respondents across various online platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, out of which 124 (or 13 per cent) said they were happy .“Due to this lockdown, I am spending more time with family, especially kids, which I was not able to do earlier,” a 38-year-old chartered accountant from Delhi said about his lockdown experience.The happy ones were also treating the lockdown time like an unplanned vacation. For many who had not faced economic consequences by then, it was like a paid vacation during which they pursued hobbies and reduced their sleep deficit. The survey further revealed that 56 per cent of these happy people tried out new dishes and 38 per cent of them talked over phone with friends and relatives - something they were not able to do earlier.“I am getting to spend a lot of quality time with my children and my wife, I am able to assist my wife with household chores and getting more time interact with my friends and relatives over phone or social media,” said a 34-year-old investment manager from Gurugram.“Happiness is a frame of mind and once the factors that contributed to that happiness change, the mood could change. But it was interesting to see that some viewed lockdown like a vacation,” said IIM, Lucknow’s prof Satyabhusan Dash who led the research survey.The adage that money cannot buy happiness does not hold true in this case as people with a higher income had a higher happiness quotient. Some 15 per cent of all those who earned over Rs 10 lakh annually were happy as compared to only seven per cent of those who earned less than that.“I am getting 10-hour of sleep everyday,” said a 22-year-old student from Hyderabad.However, being happy did not mean that they were not worried about the current pandemic. About 52 per cent of the respondents were very much worried about the prevailing situation, yet they managed to stay in a happy state of mind.The survey also found that 40 per cent of the total sample size said it was fearful, 22 per cent felt sad, 11 per cent respondents felt disgusted, nine per cent were surprised and five per cent respondent felt angry.The survey covered participants in 104 cities across 23 states across metros, tier-1 and tier-2 cities.Snowballing sampling methods were used to cover a fairly representative sample across India. Given the nature of these online platforms, the survey has a skew predominantly towards male (62 per cent) vs female (38 per cent), higher education (63 per cent post graduation and over) and upper income participants with 40 per cent over Rs 10 lakh annual income. Ashu Sabharwal (founder, Qualisys), Mohan Krishnan (former VP, Kantar), Avinash Jain, PhD scholar (IIM Lucknow) and Ankita Singh (research director, Qualisys) were integral part of the research team.“There was also a joy to see the earth healing and reclaiming itself and the newness of being at home with family,” said Sabharwal.Those who are happy are also of the belief that Indians have higher immunity level to face the disease as compared to the rest of the world. They also strongly believe that India is in a better position as compared to other countries in the world.Some of the respondents who are spiritually inclined see this unlikely event as the nature’s way to bring justice and heal itself. And many do not believe in fretting over something which is not in their control, they are trying to make the most of the current time. They see a ray of hope even in this trying times and are of the belief that everything will return to normal sooner than later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-worries-many-felt-happy-during-covid-19-lockdown-finds-online-survey/story-UzO8qSjrvW20CBVBC1hoGM.html
07-07-2020||India||Chinese envoy to Nepal in fresh row for her meetings with Nepalese political leaders||China’s envoy to Nepal Hou Yanqi is at the centre of a fresh controversy for her meetings with Nepalese political leaders amid growing pressure on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli from within his party to step down over charges of poor governance.Hou is no stranger to such controversies, as she held a series of meetings with leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) in late April and early May after an internal rift in the party became public and threatened to lead to the ouster of Oli. Political analysts also believe China played a key role in bringing together various communist leaders to form the ruling party.In the past week, Hou met President Bidya Bhandari on July 3 for what was described as a courtesy call and senior politician Madhav Kumar Nepal, who heads the foreign relations department of NCP, on July 5.As with her meetings with Oli and NCP chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” and Nepal in April-May, analysts believe Hou is engaged in efforts to shore up the position of the beleaguered prime minister. Media reports in May said that Hou had, in her earlier meetings, expressed concern at the rift within the NCP and urged the party’s leaders to maintain unity and avert any sort of split.Hou’s latest meetings with government officials and political leaders have sparked concerns among political analysts and former diplomats as they came at a time when Nepal’s politics is in disarray and different actors are attempting to gain the upper hand, The Kathmandu Post reported on Tuesday.Questions have been raised about Bhandari’s role in the ruling party, especially against the backdrop of tensions between Oli and Prachanda. Thirty of the 44 members of NCP’s standing committee have asked Oli to step down as party chairman and prime minister.Bhandari’s meeting with Hou led to more questions, especially since foreign ministry officials said the President’s Office has repeatedly violated the diplomatic code of conduct, The Kathmandu Post reported.An under secretary of the foreign ministry is posted in the President’s Office to brief Bhandari on potential meetings with foreign dignitaries and envoys, but this official wasn’t informed about the meeting between Bhandari and Hou, the report said.“As per the diplomatic code of conduct, foreign ministry officials should be present at such meetings, but we were not informed,” an unnamed ministry official told The Post. “So there is no institutional record of the meetings and we don’t know what the talking points were.”During her meeting with NCP leader Nepal, Hou discussed the conflict within the ruling party and urged all sides to maintain restraint, according to sources cited by The Post.Bishnu Rijal, deputy chief of NCP’s foreign relations department, didn’t provide details of the meeting.“I don’t have details about the meeting between Nepal and ambassador Hou but as far as I understand Chinese protocol, the Chinese begin meeting top ranking officials and gradually come down to other officials,” said Rijal, implying Hou should have already met the two NCP chairs before meeting Nepal.Hou also reportedly met Oli before the beginning of NCP’s standing committee meeting, which began on June 24. On Monday evening, Hou met senior NCP leader Jhala Nath Khanal to discuss internal politics, according to an aide to Khanal.The Chinese envoy has reportedly been advising NCP leaders to remain united as Beijing is concerned about “political stability” in Nepal.Asked about the objective of Hou’s meetings, Chinese embassy spokesperson Zhang Si told The Post that China didn’t wish to see the NCP in trouble and wished its leaders would resolve their differences and stay united.The ambassador and the embassy have a good relationship with the government, political parties, think tanks and people from all walks of life, and always exchange views on issues of common concern, Zhang said.Foreign affairs analysts, however, haven’t taken kindly to the Chinese envoy holding meetings with Nepalese leaders at a time of crisis within the ruling party, The Post reported.“I blame our leaders for inviting interference in our internal affairs,” former ambassador Lokraj Baral said. “Earlier, the Indian ambassadors would involve themselves in our internal affairs, and now it is the Chinese’s turn.”Baral pointed to the changing facets of Nepal’s relationship with both countries, where India is viewed with more suspicion than China.“When the Indian ambassadors did the same thing, we called it interference,” he said. “But the same does not apply to the Chinese. Only the media have raised this issue, but the political leadership and public intellectuals have not thought about it that way.”Recently, NCP and the Chinese Communist Party held a virtual interaction and Nepal, as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, voted in favour of the controversial Chinese security law for Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-envoy-to-nepal-in-fresh-row-for-her-meetings-with-nepalese-political-leaders/story-jBfStIx7OWlorYRVamASXI.html
07-07-2020||India||Maoists preponed tactical counter-offensive campaign in Chhattisgarh||The outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) has made a key strategic change and advanced its annual tactical counter-offensive campaign (TCOC), where rebels carry out maximum attacks against security forces, to two phases this year – January to March and April to June – officials said.Usually, TCOC was be carried out between March and June, allowing rebels easier move in dense jungles of Central India during peak summer.However, an alarming trend has come to light amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, where ultras managed to freshly recruit 50 cadres in eastern Bastar, a Maoists’ letter seized by the security forces revealed, said a police official posted in the region. The officials believe that rebels have also managed to recruit new cadres in Sukma, Bijapur, Dantewada, and Narayanpur districts.The seized letter is written by Maoist leader of Maad division of Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee, Sukhlal, and addressed to the banned party’s leader Nagesh, who goes by his first name.The letter stated that TCOC would start in January this year, as a marked departure in a bid to take security forces by surprise.Sukhlal claimed that half a dozen ambushes and attacks were carried out in the Maad division in Narayanpur district and also fresh recruitment of 50 cadres since TCOC had started in January.TCOC is an arm of the Maoists, which reports to the party’s Central Military Commission (CMC), whose chief is responsible for making an annual strategy for the counter-offensive operations against security forces that are aimed at destablising the government by an aggressive armed rebellion. A fresh recruitment drive for cadres is also carried out during this period. Typically, the new recruits are deployed in areas, where the rebels are planning fresh strikes against security forces.“TCOC helps Maoists to regroup and startle security forces with a pulverising attack out of the blue. Though the campaign had started in January, the Minpa attack on March 23 was its culmination, when 17 jawans were killed in a daring attack in Sukma district. This is for the first time that TCOC has been advanced to January and held in two phases,” said the official quoted above.Data showed that 26 security personnel were killed and bodies of 20 rebels were recovered in Chhattisgarh between January 1 and June 30. Most of the strikes were carried out in the Left Wing Extremist (LWE)-hit areas such as the tribal-dominated Bastar division and districts that come under the newly formed Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh (MMC) region.In 2019 and 2018, 12 security jawans and another 35 lost their lives in anti-Naxal operations, respectively.“The Minpa attack, where 17 jawans were killed on March 23, is the worst-attack on security forces over the past two years. Altogether, 21 jawans were killed between January and March,” said an Indian Police Service (IPS) official posted in Chhattisgarh.The official expressed concern about the fresh recruitment drive in eastern Bastar.“This is a worrying trend. Over 300 cadres have been recruited in the Bastar division between March and June, despite the pandemic. The Maoists’ toll of 20 between January and June is the lowest in the 10 years,” he said.DM Awasthi, director-general of police (DGP), Chhattisgarh, said, “The pattern for conducting TCOC has been constantly changing over the past few years. In the last couple of years, TCOC was held for four months after June and ended in December. It was started in January this year, as they have become more flexible. However, we were prepared because we had prior information of an early start.”Shubhranshu Chaudhary, a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) journalist-turned-peace activist in Maoist-infested areas in central India, weighed in on the TCOC’s early start in January“If TCOC had started in January, it also suggests an ‘over militarisation’ in the party’s ranks since the new leadership assumed charge. Now, the party is filled with people, who are adept at Guerrilla warfare since Nambala Keshav Rao, alias Basavaraju, took charge as the new general secretary. There has been a sea-change in their combat strategies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-preponed-tactical-counter-offensive-campaign-in-chhattisgarh/story-fZIwhSp4NHT0Md4RfVYfhP.html
07-07-2020||India||As India crosses another grim Covid-19 milestone, these states could emerge as new hotspots||India has seen a huge spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last few days, which has taken the country’s tally to over seven lakh.But there are some states which are of particular concern where the positivity rate - total cases per 100 tests - has been rising.Among these states is Odisha, where the positivity rate stands at 9.44 per cent, more than the national average. According to Union health ministry, the national positivity rate is 6.73 per cent.On Monday, Odisha reported 456 new cases from the 4,827 samples tested. The rise is a sharp departure from positivity rate of 4-6 per cent that it reported till July 1. The total number of positive cases in the state shot up to 9,526 on Tuesday and the number of fatalities stand at 38. There are close to 3,000 active cases in the state.Looking at the rise in the number of cases and increasing positivity rate, the weekend curfew in Odisha, which started on June 1, has been extended to 18 districts from an earlier 11 for the entire month of July.The other states which are heading towards becoming the new hotspots are West Bengal and Puducherry. While the positivity rate in Puducherry is 5.5 per cent, it stands at 4.16 per cent in West Bengal. This is an increase of more than one per cent from May 19, when Bengal’s positivity rate stood at 3.11 per cent.Chandigarh too has a high positivity rate of 4.36 per cent.The World Health Organisation (WHO) had advised governments in May that the positive confirmation rate should remain at five per cent or lower for at least 14 days. The states who do not meet this criteria are considered closer to the red zone.Goa, which though has a very low positivity rate, has seen it increase from 0.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent in the last one month, according to official data.The Goa government plans to expand the scope of Covid-19 testing in the state by designating special teams at the primary health centres and community health centres to collect samples of suspected coronavirus patients, health minister Vishwajit Rane has said.Currently, samples for Covid-19 testing are collected only at the district hospitals in Margao (South Goa) and Mapusa (North Goa), and the sub-district hospital in Ponda (North Goa).The number of Covid-19 positive cases in the state stand at 1,813.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-india-crosses-another-grime-covid-19-milestone-these-states-could-emerge-as-new-hotspots/story-2c26CuoqOWKjjY5VgHNjuO.html

The report came on Monday that suggested my father suffering from Covid-19. The Peoples Hospital called Chirayu Hospital, a Covid-19 designated private medical college’s hospital, for an ambulance to shift him there,” he said.“The ambulance came at around 5pm and took my father. I also left the place but later in the evening, I came to know that my father was abandoned by Chirayu Hospital ambulance back at People’s hospital. The carelessness of staff of both the hospitals led to the death of my father. I want strict action against them,” he said. Relatives of Covid-19 patients are not allowed to accompany them, he said.The administration of Peoples General hospital, where the patient was allegedly abandoned, blamed Chirayu Medical College and Hospital for the death. “The patient has been visiting the hospital for his dialysis for the past five years. He was referred to Chirayu Hospital after completing all the discharge formalities in an ambulance. After 20 minutes of discharge, the ambulance attendant called us that they are coming back and we should get ready to provide the man treatment at ICU,” Udayshankar Dixit, the Peoples Hospital’s manager said.“I asked him not to come back as we had already sealed our ICU as he was the first Covid-19 patient detected in our hospital for the safety of other patients. But instead of listening to us, they left the patient on a stretcher in the parking area. We arranged a PPE kit and provided the patient oxygen but he died,” said Dixit.When contacted, Chirayu Hospital’s director Dr Ajay Goenka denied the allegations as “baseless to say that patient was left abandoned in parking”. He said the man was in a critical condition due to renal failure and was also suffering from a heart ailment.“When a doctor from Peoples Hospital called us, our team of doctors inquired about the condition of the patient to send the ambulance accordingly but the doctor over the phone didn’t explain the condition. When the ambulance driver was taking the patient to Chirayu Hospital, he found that he was very critical and needed ventilator support,” Goenka said.He said the ambulance driver called the Peoples Hospital and asked them to attend to the man as Chirayu Hospital was 45 minutes away. “The ambulance driver urged the People’s Hospital to manage the patient for just 20 minutes till another ambulance from Chirayu equipped with a ventilator could reach there. First, the administration of Peoples Hospital refused to take the patient back. Later, it provided oxygen and CPR. When our second ambulance reached there the patient was found dead,” Goenka said.As the photo and video of the man lying in the parking area went viral on social media, Zameel Khan, a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), reached the hospital and shifted the body to a morgue. SDM Khan said tough action will be taken against whoever is found responsible for the man’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhopal-covid-19-patient-dies-family-alleges-he-was-left-unattended-in-private-hospital-s-parking-lot/story-0AcVdHR9VIGMRw7bzZUrqM.html

Backing the ban, he had said these apps could sometimes “serve as appendages of the CCP’s surveillance state”“India’s Clean App approach will boost India’s sovereignty,” he had added.The spokesperson did not explain the “costs”, but in recent days, the United States has announced the end of export of controlled defense equipment to Hong Kong over the new Chinese national security law that western powers have said is violative of China’s international commitments. And Trump has signed into law a bill that sought to impose sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the repression of Uighur minorities.The president and allies in Congress have also talked about holding China accountable for the spread of the coronavirus by billing it the damages caused to the US economy.Also read: For Ladakh stand-off, how India readied its fleet of Apache attack choppersJosh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri state, moved a resolution in March that sought to hold China “accountable” for the pandemic and “design a mechanism for delivering compensation from the Government of the People’s Republic of China to all affected nations for the harm caused by its decision to hide the emergence and spread of COVID–19 during the initial weeks of the outbreak”.Missouri has already filed a lawsuit against China for damages.Support for India in its recent border confrontation with China has been growing. In a TV interview recently, a Republican senator who is a close ally of President Trump, denounced China’s aggression on the border with India to illustrate the growing threat the Asian giant poses to the United States and its allies and partners around the world.

And they have killed 20 Indian soldiers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-notes-de-escalation-in-ladakh-but-calls-for-punitive-costs-to-reign-in-china/story-tYgOt0yCiCUFVz2QeanLuL.html

Dr Amonkar was also the ex-president of the Goa unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Dr Amonkar, 68, was found positive on June 22 and admitted to the state’s dedicated Covid-19 hospital but his condition deteriorated in the following days and he succumbed to the infection on Monday.“Deeply saddened by the passing away of Dr. Suresh Amonkar, former President of BJP Goa Pradesh and Former Cabinet Minister of Goa Govt. His contribution to the state of Goa is immense and will never be forgotten. I express my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family,” Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant tweeted. “Shocked with the unfortunate demise of my close friend, former Health Minister Dr. Suresh Amonkar. I shared a close bonding with him. He lived with sincerity and Honesty in his personal, professional, political & social career. My condolences to his family. May his soul rest in peace,” Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat said. Dr Amonkar was a two-term MLA, being elected to the Goa Assembly in 1999 and 2002, as well as served as minister in the first Manohar Parrikar cabinet in 2000 as a minister of health.

07-07-2020||India||Odisha’s Covid-19 positivity rate crosses national average, Opposition leaders attack state government over testing||As Odisha’s Covid-19 positivity rate went past the national average of 6.73% and more and more hospitals turned Covid hotspots, Opposition leaders accused the state government of failing to control the pandemic by not increasing its daily testing.On Monday, Odisha reported 456 new cases from the 4,827 samples tested indicating a positivity rate of 9.44 per cent, a sharp departure from positivity rate of 4-6 per cent that it reported till July 1. The total number of positive cases in the state shot up to 9,526 and the number of fatalities stand at 38. There are close to 3,000 active cases in the state.For the third day on Monday, the number of local cases was more than 30 per cent of the total suggesting onset of community transmission. Among the positive cases reported was a BJP MLA, a 70-year-old priest attached to one of the prominent temples in Dhenkanal town, two doctors and a pharmacist working at a community health centre of Ganjam district. The MLA is the first legislator in Odisha to get infected by Covid-19.The rise in cases came even as Opposition Congress and BJP slammed the state government for falling tests. Senior Congress leader Santosh Singh Saluja said the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in Odisha would have been more than 1 lakh had the state government done more testing. “Had all migrant workers who returned from Maharashtra and Gujarat been tested for Covid-19, then we would have known the actual spread of the disease. The government is just picking and choosing few infected people from a large number of people already infected,” said Saluja.The general secretary of BJP’s Odisha unit Golak Mahapatra alleged that the state government has miserably failed in scaling up the daily tests to 15,000 resulting in the current situation. “Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in April had announced that the government would conduct 15,000 Covid-19 tests a day in June. It’s already July, and we are testing arund 4,000-5,000 samples a day,” said Mahapatra.Referring to Delhi, Mahapatra said increasing testing there brought the situation under control.BJP’s another general secretary Prithviraj Harichandan also raised questions over the Covid-19 management by the state government saying it had become more bureaucratic which is not yielding any result. “Over last month, we have seen weekly shutdowns. Has it helped bring down the numbers? The state government has just no clue about the spread of the virus,” said Harichandan.Meanwhile, a Covid-19 positive person escaped from a hospital in Nabarangpur district by scaling the boundary wall. Nabarangpur district collector Ajit Kumar Mishra said the 50-year-old who was brought to the Covid-19 hospital on July 3, went missing on the morning of July 5. “The patient was missing when the hospital staff went to offer him breakfast. A police complaint has been lodged,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-s-covid-19-positivity-rate-crosses-national-average-opposition-leaders-attack-state-government-over-testing/story-g3nPVccwb0t52WYERjTk8H.html
07-07-2020||India||PM must apologise for remarks made at all-party meet on June 19: Congress||The Congress on Monday lauded the Indian army for “pushing back” Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh but demanded an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his June 19 remarks at the all-party meeting that no one had entered Indian territory or occupied any Indian post.“Our brave army has been trying to push Chinese army back and we are very happy to see reports that we have succeeded. We are proud of our army...,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera told a virtual news conference. Prime Minister Modi stated at an all-party meeting last month that neither anyone is present in the Indian territory nor is any Indian post captured by the Chinese.The Congress said Modi’s stand contradicted past remarks by defence minister Rajnath Singh and foreign minister S Jaishankar on Chinese intrusion.“What we are worried about is the PM’s comments that he made at the all-party meeting where he said that ‘No one has entered our territory or occupied any of our post’... The Prime Minister should use this opportunity come out and address the nation, take the country into confidence and apologise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-must-apologise-for-remarks-made-at-all-party-meet-on-june-19-congress/story-seHwgfuKNxKJeuuaTULYhP.html
07-07-2020||India||Phone call at 8.45 am, then a video call: The backstory of the PLA’s pullback||India will adopt a cautious approach, cognizant of the risk of an “accident”, to the limited withdrawal by China’s People’s Liberation Army soldiers who had set off the stand-off at four locations in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley and Pangong Lake. PLA has started troop withdrawal from the stand-off sites at three locations in the Galwan Valley and is in the process of dismantling some structures on Finger 4, one of the eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range that overlooks the Pangong Lake.The troop pullback till Monday evening was thinner, and slower at Finger 4 than the other locations, said an Indian military commander. “We need to keep track of the movements at Pangong Tso to arrive at any firm conclusion,” he said.The army officer said PLA had been at a disadvantage in Galwan, Gogra and Hot Springs in terms of their military positions. In Pangong Tso, however, the situation favoured the Chinese since they had built a road up to Finger 4, he said.Officials said the disengagement process was likely to be a gradual and calibrated process by both sides, with each point being negotiated by the military commanders on the ground.China was the first to start thinning its troops at the site of the June 15 bloody clash that killed soldiers on both sides. Local army commanders quickly relayed the information to their superiors once they were able to establish a trend.At just about 8.45am on Sunday, Indian Army chief General MM Naravane picked up the phone to inform defence minister Rajnath Singh. Diplomats from the two countries touched base and by evening, they had fixed a quick video conference between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and China’s foreign minister Wang Yi.The conversation went on for about two hours. There were disagreements on who was to blame for the stand-off and the June 15 violence. But they had arrived at agreements on many points. Doval told Wang that Beijing would need to restore the patrolling rights of the Indian army on these four points to ensure peace and tranquillity along the 1,597km Line of Actual Control (LAC).Also read: For Ladakh stand-off, how India readied its fleet of Apache attack choppersAnalysts insist that the litmus test of the success of the Doval-Wang conversation would be the restoration of the Indian patrolling rights on the north banks of the Pangong Lake.Indian officials said the military buildup in the depth areas on both sides of the LAC would continue till the situation at the stand-off points did not settle down. India had mobilised thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, attack helicopters, tanks and artillery guns to respond to the Chinese mobilisation.It was during the disengagement process that violence broke out on June 15, the worst clash between soldiers of the two countries in 45 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phone-call-at-8-45-am-then-a-video-call-the-backstory-of-the-pla-s-pullback/story-3BCkWhrHqLa36tzh7c9xFO.html
07-07-2020||India||For Ladakh stand-off, how India readied its fleet of Apache attack choppers||India fast-tracked delivery of the last batch of the US-built Apache attack choppers after the May 5 stand-off with China in eastern Ladakh to be able to ramp up their presence along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The last batch of five choppers arrived in India last month after the central government exempted Boeing contractors from the mandatory quarantine rules notified due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The team assembled the five choppers that had been shipped to India and quickly had them flown to the Pathankot air base after being flight-tested for deployment in Ladakh.“The military wanted to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. And it was,” a top government official told Hindustan Times on Monday.India had last year inducted 17 of the 22 AH-64 Apache choppers ordered from Boeing that can track 128 targets, prioritise threats and engage 16 targets. The remaining five were to arrive in India by the end of March. But the plan to ship the choppers had to be halted due to the nationwide lockdown enforced in India due to the coronavirus pandemic.India was taken by surprise in early May when China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers adopted an aggressive posture, setting up a stand-off at four locations in eastern Ladakh. As it became clear that the stand-off was probably directed from Beijing, New Delhi started preparing for all eventualities.Over the next few days and weeks, the air force started moving its assets such as the Apache choppers and the 15 heavy-lift Chinook choppers to airbases closer to Jammu and Kashmir.Simultaneously, it also reached out to Boeing to indicate its ability to receive the shipment. Special visas were arranged and formal orders exempting the contractors who would re-assemble the choppers from the mandatory quarantine rule was issued on grounds of national security. By 1 June, the Home Ministry allowed visas to foreign technical specialists travelling for installation, repair and maintenance of foreign-origin equipment.The induction of the two aerial platforms acquired in a $3 billion deal is a game-changer for the Indian military which otherwise relied on Russian Mi-17 medium lift helicopters for rapid induction of forces and an obsolete squadron of Russian Mi-26 helicopters.The Chinook helped the military transport troops, artillery, equipment, and fuel to forward bases. The AH-64 Apache choppers, described by some as the Ferrari of attack choppers, was one of India’s primary counter to Chinese threats on the ground and in the air. Because they have an amazing maneuverability, the Apache is designed to operate in “nap-of-the-earth” flight - that is flying at an extremely low level and using terrain and vegetation to hide from hostile elements.Counted among the deadliest flying machines, the Apache has a 30mm cannon under the nose that can fire 1,200 rounds in less than two minutes. It can also carry 80 rockets besides Hellfire missiles that can identify, track and hunt targets in the dark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-ladakh-stand-off-how-india-readied-its-fleet-of-apache-attack-choppers/story-ozj3NiqeSQw0jA2AGebqwI.html

The police said that the pen was stolen from a professor’s house by Vishal Kumare, who was proudly showing it off.“About half a dozen thefts were committed in Masjid Chowk, Babu Chowk, Suyog Colony and Kalapatha areas in the past six months or so in which thieves stole two wheelers, laptops, mobile phones and other valuables but we were not getting any clue about the criminals. Only recently we came to know through our informers about one Vishal Kumare, a resident of Gyaraspur area who was flaunting a costly pen which hardly suited his personality given his education and background,” said Ganj police station in charge SS Solanki. Kumar is a school dropout.The police officer added that the police kept a watch on Kumare and he was finally arrested on Sunday. “During questioning he confessed to have committed about half a dozen thefts along with his accomplices including a theft committed at Prof BR Khatarkar’s house on June 26 from where they had stolen the pen besides a two wheeler and a laptop. Though the pen looked costly, the professor couldn’t tell about its price as it had been gifted to him by a student,” said Solanki.Kumare’s arrest also led the police to his accomplices.Solanki said that others who were arrested include Sanjay Parte, Umesh Kumare and a minor boy. The police recovered from their possession three two-wheelers, one bike, laptops, mobile phones and the pen. Umesh is said to be the mastermind behind the gang’s operation. Solanki also said that the accused men may have committed other thefts too that will be revealed during interrogation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-arrest-man-flaunting-costly-pen-gang-of-thieves-busted/story-QnJocA7BUe264lY8jOxy7J.html

Maxwell agreed to the remote hearing and the date in a letter to the judge late Monday.Maxwell, who is being held in a federal jail in New York City, was arrested in New Hampshire on Thursday on charges including conspiracy and enticing minors to engage in sex. She is currently at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, said Justin Long, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.Maxwell had rarely been seen in the past year since Epstein’s arrest on charges of sex trafficking in minor girls. In a brief hearing Thursday, she said she wouldn’t fight her move to New York.In a letter to the court late Sunday, prosecutors and Maxwell’s lawyers proposed a schedule that included her submitting a bail request on Thursday and appearing at a hearing Friday. Maxwell was living in a million-dollar home in Bradford, New Hampshire, when she was arrested. Prosecutors say she is a flight risk and have said they will fight any bail proposal.The Brooklyn jail has been criticized as having terrible conditions for its female detainees. US Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak called the conditions there “unconscionable” in 2016. In addition, it has had five inmates and six employees with confirmed cases of Covid-19, according to the lockup’s website.The US attorney’s office in Manhattan, where the case is, responded to requests for comment.Maxwell isn’t in the jail where Epstein was found dead last year, ruled a suicide.

The current West Bengal government has not only ruined education in the state, manufacturing and trade has also been severely affected. For the sake of the country and West Bengal Dr Mukherjee resigned from a position of power, however to the current government in West Bengal only posts matter,” Nadda said.“The state government has adopted the policy of appeasement and violence in the state. It is not even cooperating with the Centre in the fight against the corona pandemic...”Saugata Roy, TMC’s veteran Lok Sabha member, said, “Shyama Prasad never had a deep political base in Bengal...While he enjoyed respect because of being the son of Sir Asutosh Mookerjee, Shyama Prasad was never a freedom fighter and never went to jail.”“BJP is projecting him because it does not have an icon In Bengal. The state’s real icons, such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Tagore, Chittaranjan Das and others spoke of Hindu-Muslim unity and not Hindutva. Nadda does not know the history of the state,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-impediment-to-growth-says-bjp-chief-jp-nadda/story-yPGi92jQspKN2FZ9O2tepI.html
07-07-2020||India||Delhi riots: Court seeks status report on pleas for FIR against Kapil Mishra||A city court has issued notices to the police seeking a status report after three residents of northeast Delhi filed pleas to register FIRs (first information reports) against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra and his associates over their alleged role in inciting communal violence in the area in February, according to the complainants, their lawyer and court records.The residents have alleged the BJP leader was not booked despite their police complaints against him in late February and early March. They approached the Karkardooma court under Section 156 (3) of the code of criminal procedure (CrPC), which empowers the court to direct the police to file an FIR.The court asked the police to respond to two petitions filed in March. Hearing in these cases was affected due to the lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease. The first petition, filed on March 12, is expected to heard on July 20. The second, filed on March 18, will be taken up on August 13. The third petition was filed on Saturday (June 4). No date has been fixed for its hearing.In their response to HT, the Delhi Police said they “meticulously” followed up on all complaints and probed them, stressing that “no discrimination has been made on grounds of community, caste or faith” in a free and fair investigation. Mishra said “some forces” that want to divert attention from the truth are trying to “fabricate false complaints” against him and the Delhi Police.The Delhi Police have filed around 750 FIRs in connection with the riots between Hindus and Muslims that killed 53 persons and left 400 others wounded over four days (February 23-26). An FIR is the first step in launching a formal police investigation.In his court application, accessed by HT, one petitioner who asked not to be named said he was at his godown in Karawal Nagar around 4.30pm on February 24 when Mishra’s men attacked him. This person, who was the first of the three to approach the court, said he filed a police complaint on February 25.Mohammad Jami Rizvi, another complainant and a resident of Yamuna Vihar, said he filed a police complaint on February 23 against Mishra. “We have now approached the Karkardooma court. I know many other complainants on whom pressure is being built to either withdraw the complaint or remove names of Mishra and his men from their complaints,” Rizvi said.The third complainant, who approached the court on Saturday, said she filed a police complaint on May 5. Advocate Mahmood Pracha, counsel for all three complainants, claimed the police did not even file any status report in any of these complaints.Six other residents of northeast Delhi, who have not approached the court have also alleged that their houses and shops were robbed and vandalised by Mishra’s men, according to their complaints in four police stations — Jafrabad, Usmanpur, Gokalpuri and Karawal Nagar —between March 12 and April 29. They have alleged that police did not register an FIR. HT has seen the complaints.On February 23, Mishra visited the Jafrabad metro station and held protests against those who blocked the road (anti-Citizenship Amendment Act, or anti-CAA, demonstrators) that runs underneath the metro station. Mishra demanded that the police remove anti-CAA protesters within three days. The Delhi Police, in their charge sheets, have acknowledged that two groups of pro-CAA and anti-CAA protesters clashed at Jafrabad at the start of the riots. They did not mention Mishra’s name.Mishra told HT that even legal experts have said there was nothing wrong in what he said that day. “What I said is captured in video, and everyone has seen that video (on social media)...Now that the entire conspiracy of Delhi riots is exposed, people such as Tahir Hussain, Khalid Saifi, Shahrukh, Safoora Zargar, and Sharjeel Imam, and the role of Pinjra Tod (a students’ group) are under the scanner,” he said, referring to people held in connection with the riots. He alleged that the violence began in Delhi at the Jamia Millia Islamia in December.“The truth of Delhi riots is out; how long they have planned, their funding and why they especially chose the days of [US President] Donald Trump’s visit [in February-end]; everything is exposed already. I am the only one who actually went out and assisted riot victims, and if you go on ground, you will hear the reality from people,” Mishra said.A Delhi Police spokesperson said a case has been registered at Khajuri Khas police station regarding the incident referred to by the first complainant. He confirmed that the department received court papers on March 18, but also said no complaint was received by the Khajuri Khas police from the first person. However, the matter is being investigated.Responding to Rizvi’s complaint, the official said he gave a wrong address and was not available on phone. “The enquiry has not revealed an iota of truth in his complaint. The allegations laid down by Rizvi are outrightly and vehemently denied..,” he said. “The matter is also under judicial scrutiny in court and necessary action will be taken as per the outcome and directions of the court.”Allegations in the third complaint, too, were found to be “vague, concocted, false and baseless”, the spokesperson said. Senior Advocate Rebecca John, who has represented some of those accused of the Dehi riots (by the police) in the Delhi high court, said the law laid down by the Supreme Court is clear, and the police have no option but to register an FIR if a complaint discloses the commission of a cognisable offence.“If after investigation, the police find the complaint to be false, they have the option of filing a closure report. But that closure report will also be scrutinised judicially and the magistrate need not agree with the view taken by the police. But by not registering an FIR in this first instance, police are avoiding an investigation into cognisable offences mentioned in the complaint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-court-seeks-status-report-on-pleas-for-fir-against-kapil-mishra/story-uBgmdlv2F91IxNEzgHXIeL.html

Covid19. 2. Demonetisation.3. GST implementation,” Gandhi tweeted.Gandhi’s attack came a day after India surpassed Russia to become the third worst-hit nation by the Covid-19 pandemic.

07-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Till Sunday, July 5, India tested 9.79 million people (9,790,387 to be precise – excluding repeat tests) for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). That translates into 7,531 tests per million (taking India’s population as 1.3 billion). India’s Covid-19 dashboard on Sunday night read: 697,284 cases, 19,700 deaths, and 424,596 recoveries. That translates into a positivity rate of 7.12% overall, a case fatality rate of 2.82%, and a recovery rate of almost 61%.But the number of daily cases has been on the rise (as has the number of deaths). On Sunday, 24,422 cases and 421 deaths were recorded. The average number of cases registered last week was 21,180; the average number of deaths, 460. The positivity rate on July 5 was 13.52%; the average positivity rate for the past week was 9.43% (which is a better measure; testing in India seems to fall off on Sundays). Still, given that the positivity rates of the past week have been higher than those overall, there’s clearly some increase, although this is not necessarily a bad thing – as this writer has previously pointed out, positivity rates increase with testing up to a point, then plateau, and finally start decreasing with more testing (as is happening in Delhi). Sure, the system can be gamed (and some Indian states are definitely guilty of this) by going slow on tests, although no one gains in the long term from this.Also read| Keep toll low, suppress Covid-19 transmission: Centre to statesDelhi and Tamil Nadu have been aggressive in testing, and the results are evident – Delhi has actually seen the number of daily cases begin to fall from their June peaks, although they are still high (on Sunday, for instance, 2,244 new cases were recorded in Delhi) and experts are beginning to speak of the city entering a long plateau in terms of cases; Tamil Nadu has seen the number of cases increase (4,150 new cases on Sunday alone), but has managed to keep its positivity rate in the 7-12% band, and lower than previous peaks, indicating adequate testing. The big difference between Tamil Nadu and Delhi is that the latter is carrying out antigen tests, which are administered indiscriminately in so-called containment zones (which means anyone in a containment zone can get tested, not just those who meet the Indian Council of Medical Research’s stringent criteria for testing). Last week, the central government asked states to roll out antigen testing, pretty much on the same basis that Delhi has. This is a good move, and may finally mean India starts testing adequately.Which brings us to the original question: How does one define adequate testing?Russia has so far tested close to 16% of its population, according to worldometers.info. The US has tested 11%, and the UK 15%. India has tested 0.8% of its population. Even Brazil has tested 1.5%. And China, with a population higher than India’s, has tested 6% of its population.India’s policymakers and politicians have been happy to cite per capita statistics to show how India has managed the pandemic well, but point to the country’s size and population when its low testing number is highlighted. If China (the world’s most populous nation) and the US (the world’s third most populous nation) can test 6% and 11% of their population, India can surely do better than 0.8%?Also read: Man infected with Covid-19 kills himself at Delhi hospitalSo, what should India’s target be, when it comes to tests?India should aim for 50 million tests (which would mean testing a little less than 4% of the population).India has increased its testing capacity manifold – but the most tests it has carried out in a single day in the past few weeks is a quarter of a million. Is there a way to increase this to a million? For that would mean hitting the 50 million tests target by August 15.This is the kind of challenge and deadline I’d like to see ICMR set for itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-KDINlXVJ3G9tStgwBkwrXP.html

He has not been named as an accused but figures in the charge-sheet for being in touch with Davinder Singh and terrorists through WhatsApp and other platforms.“Devender Singh was in touch with certain officials of Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi through secure social media platforms. Investigation revealed that he was being groomed by Pakistani officials for obtaining sensitive information,” said Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sonia Narang, NIA Spokesperson in a statement.Apart from Singh, the charge sheet named Hizbul’s commander in Shopian and Qazigund Syed Naveed Mushtaq, alias Naveed Babu; and other HM terrorists Irfan Shafi Mir, Rafi Ahmad Rather, Tanvir Ahmed Mir and Babu’s brother Syed Irfan Ahmad. Singh was arrested by J&K police on January 11 this year at a check-post in Qazigund while he was taking Babu, Irfan and Rafi in his i20 car.The agency stated in its charge-sheet that Davinder Singh had provided safe passage to Babu and his brother in February 2019 as well in his Scorpio car. The agency recovered an AK-47 rifle from his car, a Chinese pistol from his house along with ammunition and some phones which he used for communication with terrorists and Pakistan high commission officials.Sonia Narang said in the statement: “Investigation has revealed that Pakistan based leadership of Hizb-ulMujahideen (HM) namely Syed Salahudin, Amir Khan (Deputy Chief), Khursheed Alam (Operational Head), Nazar Mehmood (Financial Head) and others along with Pakistani establishment is extending support to the cadre and commanders of outfit in Jammu & Kashmir.”The agency said that Irfan Shafi Mir was a key person in the case as he had been to Pakistan four times since 2016 and met Syed Salahuddin.“Irfan Shafi not only met HM leadership in Pakistan but also met Umar Cheema, Ahshan Chaudhary, Sohail Abbas and others of ISI {Inter-Services Intelligence} of Pakistan and he was tasked to identify and activate the new hawala channels for transfer of money for sustaining terrorist activities in Kashmir valley.

07-07-2020||India||Anger after firm assesses own project in Arunachal Pradesh||On June 25, the environment ministry asked the Arunchal Pradesh state government to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the controversial Etalin hydropower project, and also offered to help. The state has since submitted the analysis -- done, not by it but by the developer of the project, Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited . Expectedly, the analysis found the project beneficial. And environmentalists are protesting the conflict of interest in getting a project’s developer to effectively decide on the future of the project.  The 3,097-megawatt project being developed in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang valley entails the loss of 270,000 trees at the junction of the Paleo-arctic, Indo-Chinese, and Indo-Malayan biogeographic regions with luxuriant forests. After environmentalists protested the loss of habitat that te project would entail, the environment ministry called for the analysis to be conducted by the state government . A cost-benefit ratio analysis is a process of working out the best return on an investment based on the costs, resources and risks involved in a project. Guidelines framed in 2017 for such an analysis state that ecological and environmental losses and distress caused to the people who are displaced are weighted against economic and social gains.Senior officials of Arunachal Pradesh’s forest department said they submitted the analysis done by Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture between the Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited, to the Union environment ministry.“The project proponent...has made a cost-benefit analysis which has been sent to the ministry. We haven’t conducted the analysis,” admitted RK Singh, principal chief conservator of forests, Arunachal Pradesh.The Etalin Hydropower Project will involve clearing at least 270,000 trees in sub-tropical evergreen and rain forests in a vital tiger habitat, according to a fact sheet prepared by the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC).In a letter addressed to principal secretary (forests), Arunachal Pradesh dated June 25 (available on the environment ministry’s Parivesh website) the environment ministry asked the state government to submit a cost-benefit ratio analysis and told that the regional office of the ministry in Shillong would assist with the analysis. The state government was also asked to examine all the representations (attached with the letter) thoroughly, take “concrete action” on the matter and submit its response to the ministry.The ministry also asked the Arunachal government to review if trees marked for felling could be left untouched.“The area is rich in bird life (230 species recorded by WII, or Wildlife Institute of India). State government will, therefore, review if trees marked for felling could be left as such, at least in the reservoir area, as dried trees could also be used as bird habitat,” the letter said.Hindustan Times hasn’t seen the cost-benefit analysis.A spokesperson for Jindal Power said in response to queries from HT: ”As desired by Arunachal Pradesh state government, a cost-benefit analysis report was submitted, which was as per guidelines framed by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change. As per the Analysis, the project is definitely beneficial to all the stakeholders like local population / state government / government. of India,”“We expect the cost-benefit ratio analysis to be done by the state government. If not completely, they should be involved in the process. If the state government is satisfied with project developer doing the analysis, we have nothing to say,” said a senior environment ministry official who is communicating with the Arunachal Pradesh government. “We haven’t received the analysis or responses on our queries yet from the state government,” he added, requesting anonymity.The environment ministry, on the recommendation of the FAC, specifically asked the Arunachal Pradesh state government and the regional office of the ministry of environment, forest & climate change in Shillong to submit a “revised” cost benefit analysis in line with the latest guidelines, said Parvish Pandya, director, conservation and science, Sanctuary Nature Foundation which focuses on wildlife and nature conservation.The foundation submitted its representation to the environment ministry citing several concerns with the project.“Jindal, the project proponent, has no role in this process. For a project of this scope and impact it is crucial that this directive is followed, and the previous report prepared by the project proponent is not recycled,” Pandya added.Anoko Mega, a member of the Arunachal Pradesh Wildlife Advisory Board, has also sent a representation against the Etalin project to the National Tiger Conservation Authority. “I am very concerned for my region and my community—the Idu Mishmi people. Since we have many tributaries here, if we allow any large hydropower project, more companies will try to enter the area and use our land, rivers and forests. We are strongly connected to our forests. In my personal opinion the community will not allow any dams here,” said Mega.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anger-after-firm-assesses-own-project-in-arunachal/story-27N1uycoSraaVCpGN0p2gP.html
07-07-2020||India||Pickle hub bears pandemic brunt, prepares for long haul||Pickle manufacturers in Panipat, one of India’s largest hubs, are unable to meet the rising demand following relaxation of curbs as the lockdown curtailed their activities from April to June, the main season for the manufacturing process.As many as 15 to 20 manufacturers said that they are facing at a crisis due to the exodus of migrants and restrictions on transport during the last three months. They said that procurement of fruit was hit due to the lockdown curbs and they have been left unprepared to meet the current demand, which has also put thousands of jobs at stake.They said it would take them a year to return to normalcy, due to challenges in meeting demands across the country, besides exports to the US, UK and other countries.“We depend on migrant labourers, as the locals are not willing to work. We had to shut production for more than two months as most of the workers had gone home for Holi and were unable to return due to the lockdown,” said Pankaj Dhingra, owner of Pachranga Foods.“We are facing labour and transportation problems as train movement remains restricted,” he said, adding that orders have started coming in from international customers.To deal with the situations, manufacturers demanded relief from 12% GST on their products, as workers and farmers working for the industry had been affected by the pandemic. “Pickles are like vegetables for the poor and taste boosters for the rich. Around 50% of our products are consumed locally and 50% is exported to other states and abroad,” said Jitender Juneja, owner of Popular Achar.Om Parkash, who has been in the pickle business since 1984, said government restrictions, including 12% GST, has hit manufacturers, forcing many out of business. “There are problems with raw material procurement as farmers do not sell their products directly to the manufacturers and we have to buy it from traders,” he said.Pickle outlets were also not receiving enough footfall. “Like dhabas, pickle outlets also remained closed for three months during the lockdown. Even now, though the eateries are open, no one stops to eat because of fears of contracting Covid-19,” said Rahul Dahiya, owner of a pickle shop on National Highway 44 near Gharaunda.Chhattardhari, who ran an outlet on Jattal Road in Panipat city and had 14 varieties of pickles in stock, including mixed, mango, lime, green and red chillies, amla, carrot, radish, turnip, onion and garlic, said buyers are yet to turn up. “My two sons are completing undergraduate studies. The younger one is in holding coaching classes in Kota, Rajasthan, as I am finding it difficult to pay their fees,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pickle-hub-bears-pandemic-brunt-prepares-for-long-haul/story-Kt3KfawV4Sj16PujQyn6JJ.html
07-07-2020||India||Some states opt for hard lockdown as coronavirus cases spike||At a time when most of India is in an Unlock phase, some states have selectively opted for a hard lockdown, confining residents indoors, shutting offices and commercial establishments and taking transport off the streets, to stanch the rising number of Covid-19 cases since restrictions began to be eased on June 1.The number of coronavirus disease cases in the country has almost quadrupled to 700,000 from 190,000 since the Unlock guidelines were enforced. Lockdowns were to continue in containment zones and hotspots until July 31, the Union home ministry said, allowing states to identify and demarcate such zones and impose fines on violators.Almost all activities except the opening of educational institutions, cinema halls and metro train services, have been allowed in the Unlock phase.On Monday, Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, went into what the state government said was a triple lockdown with almost all offices, shops and public transport closed. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan worked from his residence, Cliff House. And, at the state secretariat, only the offices of chief secretary, home and revenue secretaries were functional. “The situation is grim,” said Kerala tourism Minister Kadakkampally Surendran, adding that stringent restrictions will continue even after the week-long triple lockdown that was announced on Sunday ends.In the Thiruvananthapuram municipal corporation limits, 100 wards are fully closed and only essential services like banks, automated teller machines, pharmacies, hospitals, the media, milk booths, petrol pumps and gas agencies were functioning with minimal staff. Thiruvananthapuram deputy commissioner of police Divya Gopinath said cases would be registered and vehicles seized if people come out of their homes unnecessarily and violators of the restrictions would have to undergo institutional quarantine.The Kerala government had earlier imposed a triple lockdown in the northern Kasaragod and Kannur districts and in some parts of Malappuram to keep all Covid-19 patients and their primary and secondary contacts inside their houses to prevent community spread of the virus.Kerala’s coronavirus tally has crossed the 5,000 with 2,228 people under treatment and over 3,000 having recovered. On Sunday, the state reported 225 fresh cases, much fewer than several other small states such as Haryana, West Bengal and Odisha, but the government decided to impose a hard lockdown in the state capital, where half the new cases were reported.In Assam, the state government is set to extend the lockdown in the state capital of Guwahati, and the rest of Kamrup Metro district, as the number of Covid cases continue to rise. On Sunday, 777 new Covid-19 cases were reported, the single biggest spike in a day in the Kamrup Metro district, taking the district’s tally for 10 days (between June 24 and July 4) to 2,741 cases, nearly one-fourth the total 11,001 cases in the state.“We have to extend the lockdown in the district for another week as cases continue to rise,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. On June 28, the Assam government had imposed a 14-day hard lockdown in Kamrup Metro district, allowing only pharmacies to operate. States such as Odisha, Tripura and Karnataka have announced weekend curfews or hard lockdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, saw its first weekend curfew on June 5, which would continue till August 2, chief minister B S Yediyurappa announced on Sunday, while ruling out a complete lockdown in the state. All shops and business establishments except those selling essential goods and services are closed during the Sunday curfew. The weekend curfew in Odisha, which started on June 1, has been extended to 18 districts from an earlier 11 for the entire month of July as the number of Covid-19 cases in the state touched 10,000 on Monday. Around half the cases are locals, unlike in the months of May and June, when a majority of the cases detected were among migrant workers returning home from across the country.Some of the Odisha districts have added their own conditions to the shutdowns. In Dhenkanal district, the collector banned the entry of the devotees in various Shiva temples during the month of Shravan. In Koraput district, shops and business establishments can run between 7 am and 2 pm. Ganjam has banned non-essential vehicular movement till July 31. And the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation prohibited labourers belonging to hotspot states or districts from working in the industrial, construction, hotels/hospitality sectors till July 31.“The weekend curfews help us to ramp up collecting swabs and conducting rapid testing,” saida Odisha health department official who didn’t want to be named.Tripura’s capital city of Agartala has been under a weekend curfew since July 5. In an order, the state government has imposed 24-hour lockdown, which it says would continue on all Sundays in July.“Our state is in the Covid-19 stage I. We need to prepare for Stage 2 and 3,” Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb said in announcing the Sunday lockdown. Tripura has reported 1,559 Covid-19 positive cases, of whom 1,199 recovered. Manipur has also imposed a lockdown in Jiribam district, 220 km west of Imphal, till July 15 after 28 police personnel posted at a border check-post with Assam tested positive. Manipur chief secretary Dr J Suresh Babu said only essential services will be allowed. “Passenger coming by vehicles at Jiribam gate (from Assam) after the midnight of July 5 will not be allowed to pass and will be put in institutional quarantine at Jiribam,” Babu said. Jiribam district authorities have declared 17 areas as containment zones. Manipur has reported 1,625 Covid cases, of whom 667 have recovered.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-states-opt-for-hard-lockdown-as-cases-spike/story-yDK549ygghK9Q0pk4DofFP.html
07-07-2020||India||3 more cops suspended on suspicion of links to Vikas Dubey||Police in Uttar Pradesh suspended two sub-inspectors and a constable on Monday over suspicion that they leaked information of an operation targeting dreaded criminal Vikas Dubey, whose accomplices shot dead eight members of the team that went on the late-night raid to Bikru village near Kanpur city.Officials were also probing a purported report by deputy superintendent Devendra Mishra, killed in the failed raid on Thursday night, indicting another sub-inspector suspended earlier in the case over his alleged links with Dubey while also indicating that there could be a deep rot in the system.On another front, police intensified efforts to locate the hardened criminal and his men who escaped in the dark after the chilling 15-minute ambush. Officials put up posters with images of the 48-year-old Dubey at toll plazas amidst apprehensions that he had already left the state, and increased the bounty on him to Rs 2.5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh.“...as soon as he crosses any of these toll plazas, information on his whereabouts can be obtained...Some teams have also been sent to other states. We are expecting news soon,” Mohit Agarwal, Kanpur inspector general of police, said.Uttar Pradesh director general of police HC Awasthy said the police were conducting raids to track down Dubey, who faces 60 criminal cases. An alert has been sounded in all 75 districts of the state and 25 teams from 40 police stations were pressed into action.In Chaubeypur, where an attempt to murder case was registered against Dubey on Wednesday, sub-inspectors Kunwar Pal and KK Sharma and constable Rajeev were suspended over their suspected collusion with the gangster.“A preliminary enquiry has been initiated against the three suspended policemen,” Dinesh Kumar P, Kanpur’s senior superintendent of police, said.Officials believe that Dubey, an influential gangster whose criminal records date back to 1993, had supporters in the police force and that they helped him and his gang have a free run despite cases of murder, attempted murder and abduction against them.Daya Shankar Agnihotri, an aide of Dubey arrested on Sunday, has said in a video statement that a caller from a police station informed the gangster about the raid. Officials suspect that it could be the police station in Chaubeypur, about 14km from Bikru. The team that raided Bikru on Thursday night left from the police station there.Police also said they were investigating reports that Bilhaur circle officer Mishra, who led the raid team to Dubey’s village, told former Kanpur senior superintendent of police that Vinay Tiwari, the Chaubeypur station officer who was the first person to be suspended in the case, was protecting Dubey. HT has seen the report, which was sent on March 14, but cannot independently verify its authenticity.“He [Dubey] killed a man in Shivli police station; I had instructed SO Chaubeypur to initiate strict action against such a hardened criminal. I have already spoken to you [SSP] about the criminal and the case,” a part of the purported report read.Local police officials who did not want to be named said Mishra regularly complained about Tiwari, and asked for a preliminary enquiry against him over his alleged links with Dubey.Tiwari has been suspended though officials have not specified the exact nature of allegations against him. He is under probe.“If the report is true, it is damning,” said Jai Narayan Singh, the Kanpur additional director general. He confirmed that the report was brought to his notice and that he asked for all documents for a thorough examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-more-cops-suspended-on-suspicion-of-links-to-dubey/story-XpWYyrsJacg1cFZpnMn40M.html

The strategies were discussed at meetings last week including an interaction between cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba and state officials, the people said on condition of anonymity.The Centre’s revised strategy to tackle Covid-19 comes at a time when India has overtaken Russia to the third position in the tally of cases, behind only the US and Brazil, and after a careful assessment of the experiences of states such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Haryana and the urban centre of Hyderabad, capital of Telangana.Also read: Thiruvananthapuram under triple lockdown as Kerala’s Covid-19 tally rises to 5,622The Centre has also pointed out that Delhi, which had a positivity rate—or number of positive cases per 100 tests—of 40% a month ago, has reduced to just 10% now. The Centre underlined that Delhi has also doubled its testing from 11,000 per day a month ago to daily 22,000 tests.The states have been told to ensure 72-hour surveillance of at least 80% of close contacts of Covid-19 patients, a measure that can go a long way in reducing the transmission and possibility of spread of the virus. From proper quarantine of suspected Covid-19 patients to setting a target of ensuring a positivity rate of less than 10%, the centre has set a series of doable tasks for the states. Gauba has also said that once the positivity rate declines to less than 5%, the states can feel they are in a comfort zone.All states have been told to conduct minimum of a 14 tests per 100,000 people.While Delhi’s Covid-19 management has improved after the Union home ministry stepped in last month, working out collaborative strategies at joint meetings with the state, a few other states have emerged as a big headache for the Centre.“Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the city of Hyderabad had seen transmission slowing down but again the outbreak gained pace. We have told the states that they initially did a good job but then lost some momentum,” said a senior official involved in the management of the outbreak.In two meeting with the cabinet secretary, lasting two hours each, examples of Kerala, Haryana and Tamil Nadu were given to other states to show how these states were able to keep the death rate or case fatality ratio around 1% or below.To improve the death rate, the Centre has asked states to improve the “speed to care” or speed up ambulance services and less triage time in the hospitals.Also read: Manipur’s recovered Covid-19 cases surpass active cases for 3rd straight day “We had asked states to do an assessment of how many people called for ambulances, how many were rejected and what time it took for the patient to reach hospital in an ambulance,” said another official, “and also ensure that when a patient reaches the hospital he or she should not spend more than 45 minutes in triage.” The states were also told it is critical to “smoothen transition points” which includes test confirmation to hospitalization to ambulance coordination.For suppressing transmissions, the Centre is referring to the detailed guidelines issued by the WHO such as the need for more effective contact tracing, better sealing of hotspots and antibody testing. It also include screening and triage for early recognition of suspected Covid-19 patients, and rapid implementation of source control measures, isolation and cohorting of patients suspected or confirmed to have been infected by the virus and standard precautions like the use of masks and sanitizers The states were also encouraged to hold teleconferences for local doctors with specialists or senior doctors of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and other top hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-toll-low-suppress-covid-transmission-centre-to-states/story-02HbUfjISA3V5L7UyLsYoO.html
07-07-2020||India||Delhi High Court cannot decide Navlakha’s bail plea: Supreme Court||New Delhi: The Supreme Court expunged on Monday scathing criticism of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) by the Delhi high court in connection with the bail application of Gautam Navlakha and set aside the high court’s order asking to examine documents used to transfer the jailed activist from Delhi to Mumbai last month. A bench of justices Arun Mishra and Navin Sinha said only courts in Mumbai, and not the Delhi high court, have the jurisdiction to decide Navlakha’s bail plea. The 67-year-old activist is currently in Mumbai’s Taloja jail facing charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for their alleged links with banned Maoist outfits. “The entire exercise taken by the high court of Delhi was totally uncalled for…..it was the jurisdiction of the Bombay court alone to entertain any application (of bail). The high court of Delhi should not have entertained the application at the threshold, the observations made are hereby ordered to be expunged,” the bench said in its order. “Since the respondent (Navlakha) has been moved to Bombay, he is at liberty to apply before the competent court in Bombay,” the order added.  Also read: European Parliament’s panel on human rights expresses concern at arrest of Indian activistsNavlakha, along with nine other activists, is wanted in connection with the violence that broke out in Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village on January 1, 2018. Police say the activists had Maoist links and fuelled clashes by giving inflammatory speeches at an event called Elgar Parishad held on December 31, 2017. Navlakha surrendered on April 14, after the top court’s order to the effect on April 8, and was taken to Mumbai by train on May 26. On May 27, the Delhi high court pulled up the NIA for taking away Navlakha from Tihar Jail to Mumbai even when his interim bail plea was pending here. Justice Anup Bhambhani had noted there was an “evident haste” shown by the NIA in moving pleas across Mumbai and Delhi over weekends and Gazetted holidays (Eid) and obtaining orders by e-mail, and “whisking away” Navlakha to Mumbai. The HC also sought to examine the documents produced by the agency in support of its production warrant from a special judge in Mumbai. During Monday’s proceedings in the SC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing the NIA, submitted that on May 22, the NIA apprised the Delhi HC that Navlakha will be taken back to Mumbai as soon as the lockdown is lifted. “We did nothing behind HC’s back,” Mehta said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Navlakha, told the apex court that the occasion to approach the Delhi HC arose after Navlakha took ill. Due to lockdown, Navlakha was lodged at Tihar Jail where he faced a high risk of contracting the coronavirus disease, said Sibal.The bench directed Sibal to seek all appropriate remedies before the competent court in Mumbai. Sibal objected to the remarks being expunged as the order was being set aside. But the court felt it necessary as the Delhi HC acted without jurisdiction.Also read- UAPA: When laws turn oppressive | OpinionIt is not routine for the top court to expunge remarks but it has occurred in many cases before.

Of them, 7.1 million did not know that they were infected, the report said.Around 1.7 million people were infected by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in 2019 alone, said the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (Unaids) report, adding that the progress in prevention, diagnosis and treatment was being impacted by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. About 2.8 million people were infected in 1998, when HIV/AIDS peaked.“The response could be set back further, by 10 years or more, if the Covid-19 pandemic results in severe disruptions to HIV services,” the report said. Till date, HIV has infected 75.7 million and 32.7 have died due to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)-related illnesses.In 2019, 690,000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses, and 12.6 million people with HIV were not on life-saving antiretroviral therapy used to treat HIV/AIDS.Also read: WHO halts hydroxychloroquine and combination of HIV drug trials among hospitalised Covid-19 patients“Stigma and discrimination and widespread inequalities are major barriers to ending AIDS...Every day in the next decade, decisive action is needed to get the world back on track to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030,” said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS.Around 62% of the new HIV infections in 2019 occurred among vulnerable sections and their sexual partners, including men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs and people in prison, despite them constituting a very small proportion of the general population.“This is the first time UNAIDS has admitted to a collective failure of countries and multinational agencies in failing to meet the 2020 targets. Countries have not focused enough on prevention, which has gone down. The increasing emphasis in treatment is needed but not at the cost of prevention in key vulnerable populations, who account for 62% of the new infections,” said JVR Prasada Rao, former health secretary and founder director of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).In India, there were 2.14 million people living with HIV at the end of 2017 (the last year for which data was released) with new infections rising in Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Uttarakhand, and declining in Nagaland, Manipur, Delhi and Chhattisgarh. Just eight states accounted for two-thirds of the 87,580 annual new HIV infections in India.Among high-risk groups in India, HIV incidence was the highest among injecting drug users compared to other high-risk groups such as female sex workers, and gay, lesbian, bisexual and tans people, according to NACO data.Also read: Sex workers lack food for taking HIV drugs during Covid-19“The global political shift towards the right has also exacerbated stigma and discrimination with some countries in Africa criminalising behaviours that reduce access to preventive services,” said Prasada Rao, who is also a former special envoy at UNAIDS. In 2019, funding for HIV was 30% short of the $ 26.2 billion needed to respond to HIV. Now, the Covid-19 pandemic has seriously impacted the AIDS response and there could be more disruptions.“We cannot take money from one disease to treat another. Both HIV and Covid-19 must be fully funded if we are to avoid massive loss of life,” said Byanyima.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-hit-hiv-treatment-un-report/story-gSubzpF4qniQ0MdNONiocN.html

The attachment of property in London is the first major overseas act by the investigative agency in the case , which deals with Kapoor’s alleged use of the bank to extend loans in exchange for “kickbacks” as detailed in ED’s May 6, 2020, charge sheet against Kapoor. The agency has identified that a company run by Kapoor’s daughter Rakhi Kapoor , Doit Creation Jersey Ltd, having investment of Rs 83 crore, has three properties in London including an office-cum-guest house at 77 South Audley Street, London worth 11.5 million British Pounds (around Rs 107 crore) and another residential property.Also read: Supreme Court dismisses anticipatory bail plea of DHFL promoters in Yes Bank money laundering caseWithout divulging details of the specific property under the scanner, one of the people cited in the first instance, an officer at the agency said: “One property in Central London will be attached next week under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), for which documentation is already done”.Kapoor’s lawyer Subhash Jadhav declined comment.The anti-money laundering probe agency has identified several expensive properties owned by Kapoor’s family and companies run by them including bungalows, villas, clubs, resorts, apartments, farmland, etc in Delhi, Mumbai, Goa, London, the US , the UK and other places worth several thousand crores, and the people cited in th first instance added that these may have been obtained with proceeds from kickbacks for loans given to undeserving companies.Three of these bungalows are in Delhi’s Lutyen’s Zone alone , 40 Amrita Shergill Marg (worth Rs 375 crore), 18 Kautilya Marg (Rs 195 crore) and 20 Sardar Patel Marg (Rs 175 crore) . Then there is 7.5 acres of prime beach-front land in Alibaug, near Mumbai. ED has already attached properties worth Rs 59 crore in India. “This will be first attachment abroad in Yes Bank scam. More will follow soon,” said the officer cited above.Both ED and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) have already filed chargesheets in May and June respectively against the founder of Yes Bank and his family members.While ED has claimed that Rana Kapoor used Yes Bank as his personal fiefdom to carry illegal activities over the years and that there was a poor credit culture, poor compliance culture, and centralization of power as well as lack of institutionalization in the bank.Also read: YES Bank asks court to restrain Zee stake sale“Rana Kapoor perpetrated the entire scam by firstly taking money out of Yes Bank under the garb of debentures and loans, by abusing his position in the bank and secondly, receiving kickbacks/gratification for the same,” ED’s chargesheet says. The agency has pegged the proceeds of crime at Rs 5,050 crore and says a complex web of at least 100 shell companies was used to channel this money. Loans worth around Rs 30,000 crore given under the tenure of Rana Kapoor (he co-founded the bank in 2004 and was MD-CEO till January 2019) have turned into bad loans and out of these, Rs 20,000 crore have become NPAs (non-performing assets), according to ED.CBI has claimed in its chargesheet last month that Rana Kapoor conspired with Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan of DHFL (Dewan Housing Finance Limited) for benefitting each other using public money.Kapoor is currently in Mumbai’s Taloja jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yes-bank-scam-ed-to-attach-rana-kapoor-s-central-london-property/story-oGAKkHQYaA3CxFu5N0uhMO.html
07-07-2020||India||Tirupati civic staff dumps body of Covid-19 victim in grave||Hyderabad Municipal staff of the temple town of Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district drew ire on social media after a video of them using an earth mover to dump a victim’s body into the grave went viral on Monday.The video showed sanitation staff of the Tirupati Municipal Corporation lifting the body of the Covid-19 victim using the earth mover and dumping it into an already dug pit in the graveyard. The body was that of a 50-year old man, a resident of a village on the outskirts of Tirupati, who was admitted to state-run Sri Venkateshwara Ram Narayan Ruia Hospitals last week. He died of Covid-19 on Monday.The municipal staff, wearing PPE and masks, brought the body in the ambulance belonging to Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) to Harischandra cremation ground. They pulled the body out of the ambulance and placed it on the ground. Then they used the earth mover to dump it in the grave.As the video was telecast by the local television channels, Tirupati municipal commissioner P S Girisha called a press conference to explain the action. “Generally, we cremate the bodies of Covid-19 victims in the electric crematorium. So far, we have cremated 17 bodies without any complaints,” he said.The body of this particular victim was also taken to the electric crematorium, said Girisha. “However, it was very heavy, weighing around 175-180 kgs, and tall; it did not fit on the pyre. As it was being lifted, the wrapping around the body got torn. As part of standard operating procedure, it was again taken to the hospital to be wrapped again,” he said.The municipal authorities then decided to give it a burial instead of cremation. As per the Covid-19 protocol, they had to dig a 14 ft-deep pit using the earth moving machine. “The municipal staff were exhausted as they had already carried the body three or four times. So, they had to use the earth mover to shift the body from the ambulance to the grave, hardly two metres away and bury the body. This was done only after taking the consent of the relatives of the deceased,” Girisha said.He, however, admitted that the municipal staff should not have used the machine to dump the body in such a disrespectful manner. “They should have engaged another five or six more workers to carry the body physically,” the municipal commissioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirupati-civic-staff-dumps-body-in-grave/story-iIRcd7WeaWKLKq3rUcDDOP.html

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the monsoon remains “vigorous” and heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely in parts of Gujarat in the next three days and moderate rains in parts of Maharashtra.Due to heavy rainfall in Gujarat, a nearly 30-year-old bridge over a river in Junagadh district caved in, a local official said, adding that no one was injured.A team of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) was also deployed at the state’s Khambhalia town to meet rain-related exigencies in the area, officials said.Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan received light to moderate rainfall, while heavy rains lashed isolated places in these states.In Delhi, sporadic light rains kept the mercury in check and more precipitation is likely in the next few days. The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded 0.6 mm rainfall and a maximum of 36.2 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the year. The MeT Department has forecast light to moderate rains, thundershowers, and strong surface winds in Delhi on Tuesday. In Assam, one person was killed in the flood at Raha of Nagaon district, officials said.With this, the total number of people losing their lives in this year’s flooding and landslide has gone up to 62 across the state, of whom 38 people were killed by flood and 24 died due to landslides.According to the daily flood report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), over 3.86 lakh people are affected due to floods in Dhemaji, Sivasagar, Biswanath, Chirang, Nalbari, Barpeta, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, Goalpara, Kamrup, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat and Tinsukia districts.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and district administrations have rescued 128 people during the last 24 hours in two districts. After witnessing a spell of heavy rainfall over the past three days, Mumbai and neighbouring Thane in Maharashtra received moderate rains, but the IMD predicted showers will continue in the night in the region.According to the India Meteorological Department, the Santacruz weather bureau (in suburbs) recorded 5.2 mm rainfall, while the Colaba weather station, representative of the island city, reported 1.2 mm rainfall between 8:30 am and 5:30 pm. In eastern Uttar Pradesh, light to moderate rains occurred at many places while heavy showers lashed isolated places in the western parts in the last 24 hours, the Meteorological (MeT) Department said. Thundershowers accompanied by lightning is likely to occur at most places in the state over the next three days, it said.Weather in Punjab and Haryana remained pleasant as the maximum temperatures at both the places hovered close to normal limits.Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, recorded a maximum of 35.4 degrees Celsius.     A yellow weather warning was issued by the MeT Department in Himachal Pradesh for heavy rains, thunderstorm and lightning on July 9 and 10. The state witnessed light to moderate rainfall in several parts. Yellow, the least dangerous of all the weather warnings, indicates the possibility of severe weather over the next few days.Rajasthan received light to moderate rainfall in many parts, while heavy rains lashed isolated places in the state. Ghatol in Banswara district recorded the maximum rainfall of 8 cm during the 24 hours till Monday morning.Mundwa (Nagaur), Shergarh (Jodhpur) recorded 7 cm and 6 cm of rainfall, respectively, during this period.

07-07-2020||India||Bengaluru struggles to arrest spike in Covid-19 cases||On Friday, July 3, a resident of Bengaluru’s Hanumanthanagar neighbourhood, who had been running a fever and had breathing difficulties, collapsed in the middle of the road and died. His family had tried to get him admitted in seven different hospitals, all of which refused to take him in. After he died, his body lay on the road for the four hours it took an ambulance to finally reach. Incidents such as these are giving rise to a perception that after its initial success in curbing Covid-19, the Karnataka government has lost the plot in the battle against the pandemic, especially in Bengaluru.On Sunday, when medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar visited the Jayanagar General Hospital, patients narrated a litany of woes -- from the non-availability of an ambulance to arrive at the hospital to lack of hygiene, and from the poor quality of food to the time taken for Covid testing reports to be provided. Sudhakar admitted that there were issues and promised that 400 additional ambulances (two per ward for the 200 wards in Bangalore) would be provided. As cases mounted, private hospitals that promised to provide 2,734 beds have in fact provided only 116, he said. The minister warned of criminal cases against hospitals that do not provide treatment or turn away patients.A day earlier, Jayanagar MLA Sowmya Reddy, daughter of Congress politician Ramalinga Reddy, tweeted her anger at the government’s mismanagement of the situation. “On the phone calling hospital after hospital,”she wrote as she tried to help with a patient’s hospital admission. “They don’t respond/switched off, if they do they say no beds with oxygen/ICU..So angry..pathetic state of our healthcare.” She was a legislator and this was her experience, she pointed out. “Imagine plight of people who don’t have connections or strings to pull.”The state government’s response has been a mixture of denial and passing the buck. Since the first Covid-19 case in Karnataka was detected on March 8 – a software engineer who returned from the US – the government has been touting its “success” in containing the spread of the coronavirus disease as well as the low mortality rate in the state compared to other states of similar size.As recently as a month back - on June 6 – Bengaluru accounted for a mere 162 of the 3,184 active Covid-19 cases in Karnataka. It then had a mere 5% of the total cases in the state. On Sunday, the city’s tally of active cases was 8,167, accounting for more than 60% of all cases under treatment in the state.How did things spin out of control so quickly? Opposition parties allege gross incompetence and lack of coordination between various ministries. The health and welfare minister is B Sriramulu and medical education minister is K Sudhakar. After the two sparred, the chief minister was forced to nominate the primary and secondary education minister and one of the government’s most articulate spokespersons, Suresh Kumar, to brief the media and give daily updates on the statewide Covid-19 situation. Sriramulu and Sudhakar themselves were accused of violating quarantine norms. After announcing various relief packages, chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who saw that the treasuary was empty, decided to go full throttle in opening up Bengaluru by lifting lockdown regulations . A medical advisor to the Covid-19 taskforce who did not want to be identified said: “The pace at which the opening up of the city took place was probably too fast but the government had made up its mind.”Former Bellary MP and Congress spokesperson V S Ugrappa said a lack of coordination and one-upmanship between various ministers was one of the key reasons for things spinning out of control. “What was the government doing for the last three months? Were they sleeping? Why was infrastructure not put in place? Why are people dying waiting for ambulances and why are patients being turned away without treatment?”A senior official in the health and family welfare department who did not want to be identified said: “I think given the circumstances we have done a good job. The scale of the challenge is humongous. Yes, there might have been some lacunae which we are addressing but remember this is a situation without a precedent. Also, numbers went up as people also did not follow social distancing norms plus the testing has gone up, which all have led to the current situation. Things are under control and it is incorrect to paint a picture of it being otherwise.”On Saturday, as thousands jammed the highways leading out of Bangalore hoping to escape the city and the deadly spread of the virus, Vignesh Gowda, an auto -rickshawdriver who originally hails from Chennapatna, told HT: “I have a 3-year-old son and a wife. My younger brother tills some family land in Byrapatna. Instead of dying here, I would rather go back and take up agriculture until things improve.” A worried CM on Monday appealed to the people not to leave Bangalore. “There is no need to panic. Please cooperate with the government. We have added 10,000 more beds as well as 450 more ambulances and if required will add more. Unfortunately, we have to coexist with this situation as there is no solution for now. Your lives are important and the government is taking all measures to protect you.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/b-luru-struggles-to-arrest-covid-spike/story-uFwz2Ky5raypY6YXwk4GHN.html
07-07-2020||India||Govt flags concerns over issuing summons over WhatsApp chats||The central government told the Supreme Court on Monday that it has reservations about issuing court summons and serving notices to litigants over WhatsApp.Attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal, representing the central government, told the top court that service of notices and summons should be permitted through email and fax in view of Covid -19 ,but not through WhatsApp given that the messaging app does not allow the government to access data even in matters concerning terrorism and pornography.“Union government has reservations regarding WhatsApp. It does not allow (government to) access (data) in cases involving terrorism and pornography”, Venugopal told a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde.The submissions were made in a case relating to extension of the limitation period for filing cases. Limitation period is the deadline to file cases in any court or tribunal in the country. The limitation period is generally prescribed under the Limitation Act. It is also sometimes provided under special laws in certain cases.The Supreme Court had, on March 23, extended for an indefinite period, the limitation period to file cases in any court on tribunal amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The order was passed by the apex court in a suo motu (on its own) case initiated after taking into account the coronavirus threat and the resultant difficulties faced by litigants in approaching courts.The issue of service of summons and notice through WhatsApp came up on Monday during submissions by the central government requesting the apex court to pass further orders allowing summons and notice through email and fax.The matter was eventually adjourned for July 10.Certain high courts like the Bombay high court and Madras high court had allowed service of notice to parties via WhatsApp.The Delhi high court, after taking note of the spurt in coronavirus disease cases, issued a circular on June 9 allowing service of documents, notices and summons through WhatsApp, email and fax.The Bombay high court had, in 2018, held that the service of notices through WhatsApp was valid.AG Venugopal, however, said that the practice should not be allowed for the time being and pointed to a case which is pending before the Supreme Court on the traceability of messages sent over WhatsApp.He was referring to a case from Tamil Nadu involving WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in which the government has pressed for a decryption of messages on social media and messaging platforms in matters involving considerations of national security, law and order etc.That case had started before the Madras high court as a plea for linkage of social media accounts with Aadhaar. Subsequently, the Tamil Nadu government raised concerns about WhatsApp not cooperating with police probes in key cases, citing end-to-end encryption.The matter was transferred to the Supreme Court in October 2019 on a plea by Facebook in August 2019.WhatsApp has maintained that the original sender of a message cannot be tracked because of end-to-end encryption.“For Facebook and WhatsApp to say they cannot decrypt is not acceptable. A terrorist cannot claim privacy”, AG Venugopal told the court in October 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-flags-concerns-over-issuing-summons-over-whatsapp-chats/story-KhNsxKi5N3w073zBS0RNZL.html
07-07-2020||India||Assam wildlife sanctuary upgraded amid row over coal mining||The Assam government on Monday decided to upgrade the Dehing Patkai wildlife sanctuary into a national park amid a controversy over allowing coal mining inside its area.“Our government has decided to upgrade the Dehing Patkai wildlife sanctuary in Assam, which is home to a variety of flora and fauna, to a national park. In a meeting with senior officials today, I have directed them to take necessary steps in this regard,” chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal tweeted.Experts said the state government seemed to have taken the decision to placate public concerns ahead of next year’s assembly polls in the state. Proposed coal mining in wildlife habitats has evoked protests from locals. In April, the National Board of Wild Life (NBWL) had recommended coal mining to be allowed in a portion of the Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve provided it fulfilled 28 preconditions.Spread across 937 sq km, the Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve falls in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts and is located withinthe periphery of the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary, said to be the largest lowland tropical rainforest in India.NBWL allowed Coal India Limited (CIL) to conduct opencast coal mining in 98.59 hectares of the reserve forest. CIL had been carrying out mining in 57 hectares of the reserve and the fresh recommendation allowed it to mine coal in another 41 hectares.Besides elephants, leopards, hoolock gibbons, pangolins and bears, Dehing Patkai is also home to over 200 species of birds, various replies and many species of butterflies and orchids. The habitats of these species as well as the foraging routes of elephants are expected to be affected by coal mining.Following the NBWL move, opposition surfaced against the proposed coal mining. The Assam government also sent forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya to visit the site in May and he held out an assurance that there would be no compromise in protecting the state’s forests and biodiversity.Although the NBWL recommendation was passed in April, a right to information (RTI) query revealed that mining in the area had been underway even before the approval came.The reply to an RTI query by environment activist Rohit Choudhury revealed mining related work had already started in 17 hectares (or nearly 39% area) of the 41 hectares area claimed by CIL to be unbroken. “It was confirmed that about 9 hectare area out of 41.39 hectares has already been broken up and operated and another approximately 7 hectare area has been cleared,” mentioned a November, 2019 site inspection report by the Shillong office of the ministry for environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC).North Eastern Coalfields, a subsidiary of CIL had secured a lease for coal mining in an area of 4 sq miles in the Saleki area of Dehing Patkai for a period of 30 years from 1973. Although the lease expired in 2003, CIL applied for lease/diversion of forest land only in 2012, seeking permission for coal extraction in 98.59 hectares.Taking up a suo motu (on its own) case against a proposed move to allow coal mining, the Gauhati high court issued notices to the Centre, the Assam government, Coal India and others last month.Hearing two public interest litigations (PILs) on the same issue, a division bench of chief justice Ajay Lamba and justice Soumitra Saikia said the court too had taken up the matter suo motu.The court issued notices to the Centre, the Assam government, CIL, NBWL, mines and mineral department of Assam, the home department, Assam Police and others and fixed July 20 as the next date of hearing of the case. All respondents have been asked to file affidavits by July 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-wildlife-sanctuary-upgraded-amid-row/story-WnbNAxVOts3xpMOyXjaWUM.html
07-07-2020||India||Armed with pesticides, Mi-17 choppers fight locust swarms||New Delhi The Union government has pressed the Indian Air Force’s Mi-17 choppers with home-grown technology to control crop-devastating desert locusts, apart from deploying higher-capacity engine-powered drones and sorties by a Bell helicopter in affected states, as swarms continue to breed, officials said. Air force pilots are using an in-house technology to spray atomised pesticides from the air, which has been able to track and kill large armies of locusts, an official said, requesting anonymity. On July 5, Mi-17 air force choppers doused large swarms of locusts in Jodhpur with atomised pesticides, a first in the battle against the pests. “The choppers were needed because they have better manoeuvrability and can target large trails of pests with a special form of the pesticide malathion, which has been indigenously developed,” the official said.“Also, the civil aviation ministry on June 27 relaxed more rules, allowing the use of engine-powered drone of up to 50kg during night times,” a second official said.Also read: Six states on high alert as govt warns of more locust swarmsAn empowered group, led by the agriculture ministry, has decided to deploy more resources to protect robustly progressing kharif or summer-sown crops from the voracious pests.Dozens of countries, from Kenya to Pakistan, are battling the worst locust outbreak in generations. The migratory insects are setting off from the Horn of Africa, where they are breeding in “insurmountable” numbers due to frequent cyclones, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). These cyclones are possibly linked to climate change, according to the FAO. The organisation has already warned the invasions pose a “serious” risk to India’s agriculture.In the intervening night of July 3 and 4 , operations were carried out at 25 places in six districts including Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Nagaur, and Dausa of Rajasthan and in Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi.The farm ministry had signed a contract with the UK’s Micron Group to modify two Mi-17 helicopters for spraying atomized pesticides. The UK-based firm’s supply has now been delayed until September, the second official said. The air force then tasked its “no. 3 base repair depot” in Chandigarh to indigenously design an airborne locust control system for Mi-17 helicopters. “The atomized airborne spraying has been successfully achieved in air through a configuration of nozzles mounted on both sides on external trusses of Mi-17 helicopters,” a statement said.The pesticide malathion is filled in the internal auxiliary tank of 800 litres of the choppers, achieving nearly 40 minutes of spaying duration covering approximately 750 hectare in each mission. One hectare is roughly 2.5 acres.Also read: Interministerial group set up to tackle locust invasion across statesOperations are continuing in six states -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana -- by locust circle offices. “So far, the damage has been limited, of below 10%. But there seems to no control over breeding in Africa, where millions are at risk of food scarcity. So, we can’t let our guard down,” said Pramod Vajpayi, a former entomologist with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-with-pesticides-mi-17-choppers-fight-locust-swarms/story-sYKhnBtek5gKdSlSIkUdUP.html
07-07-2020||India||Gujarat has become ‘epicentre of Chinese investment in India’: Congress||The Congress on Monday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state Gujarat has become the “epicentre of Chinese investment in India” and said there cannot be business as usual with China after its forces killed 20 Indian soldiers. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said Gujarat has signed three major MoUs in the last five years involving Rs 43,000-crore investment, which includes an industrial park for Chinese SMEs (small and medium enterprises). He claimed that business has not stopped in the last 20 days and cargo flights continue to operate between the two countries. “There cannot be business as usual with the country, which is transgressing our territory, to protect which our brave hearts are sacrificing their lives. These are questions that the Prime Minister must answer and respond to,” he asked at a virtual press conference. Khera said there are various methods of applying pressure on a “hostile” nation and since Gujarat has witnessed record investments from China, “now is the time to use that pressure”. “Gujarat has become the epicentre of Chinese investment in India.... On the one hand our brave army is pushing the PLA back from the Ladakh border and on the other hand, PSUs (public sector undertakings) continue to give contracts to Chinese companies.... We see Gujarat is becoming the hub of Chinese investment. We see that the process of Chinese investment in Gujarat continues,” he said. The Congress leader said the prime minister will therefore be asked if he “has a special fondness for China”. “We grant him that, we have no problem, he has invested in the relationship for two decades, we understand that also, provided the country’s borders remain safe, the country’s economy remains safe from China,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-has-become-epicentre-of-chinese-investment-in-india-congress/story-ShZ7j949AfJEYUPQcv8N5H.html
07-07-2020||India||United States, China hashtag battle over carriers in South China Sea||The US Navy and Chinese media exchanged hashtag fire on Twitter over US carrier groups and the Chinese military holding exercises in the South China Sea at the same time. The state-owned Global Times tweeted pictures of Chinese missiles and warships, and warned any US carriers in the sea did so “at the pleasure of PLA)”. The US Navy’s chief of information tweeted back the next day: “And yet, there they are… #USSNimitz & #USSRonaldReagan are not intimidated.” The tweet ended, “#AtOurDiscretion.”PLA is the People’s Liberation Army, the Chinese military. The Nimitz and Reagan are two “supercarriers”, or large aircraft carriers, in the US American fleet.Military exercises with two carrier battle groups are rare. The last one held by the US in the South China Sea took place in 2014, and indicates a deliberate show of military power in waters claimed by Beijing. Also read| South China Sea is not China’s maritime empire: PompeoThe Global Times tweeted pictures of the main gun of the Chinese guided missile frigate Yulin and three long-range anti-carrier missiles, either DF-21Ds or DF-26s. It warned that the “South China Sea is fully within the grasp of the #PLA”, and linked an article criticising the US decision to deliberately hold exercises at the same time China was holding military drills near the Xisha islands in the disputed South China Sea. The US decision showed it was “the real source of potential regional instability”, the newspaper said. On Sunday, another Global Times article described the carrier groups as “nothing more than paper tigers on China’s doorstep”. It claimed the US drills were “a mere show to make up for its loss of face regarding epidemic control” and the loss of its “Hong Kong card” following the passage a new national security law giving Beijing sweeping powers of arrest there. The Chinese drills were originally scheduled to run from Wednesday to Sunday. The US Navy’s started on Saturday.David Larter of defensenews.com noted that whether or not the carriers could be destroyed by Chinese missiles was irrelevant. “The point of operating aircraft carriers in the S. China Sea isn’t to demonstrate American invincibility, it’s to demonstrate that the United States is not deterred by China’s missiles,” he tweeted. The US Pacific Fleet’s twitter account joined the fray on Monday with pictures of a B-52H bomber and fighters from the USS Nimitz flying in formation over the South China Sea. The bomber was flown from a base in Louisiana to show, the US Air Force said, “strategic predictability and operational unpredictability”. Also read: China to supply 4 attack drones to Pak, prompts India to revive Predator-B planBeijing’s response was to call in the diplomats.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Monday accused the US of “ulterior motives by intentionally sending heavy forces into the South China Sea for large-scale drills and flexing its muscles.” He added that Washington was “alienating countries in the region, pushing for South China Sea militarisation and sabotaging peace and stability, and that China holding military drills in waters of Xisha islands was “within the country’s sovereignty”.The Twitter banter over the exercises reflects the deepening and increasingly more overt strategic rivalry between the US and China. Senior US and Chinese officials make statements against each other’s military intentions in the Indo Pacific region every few days. The past few weeks, for example, has seen US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo say the US needs to shift troops out of Europe to take on Chinese military might. The White House cited a “pattern of aggression” by Beijing that encompassed the South China Sea, the Ladakh border clashes and other actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-china-engage-in-a-virtual-war-over-carriers/story-7zwbI7zneeao9aHYHGYFaJ.html
07-07-2020||India||Monsoon in east, northeast may trigger floods||Intense monsoon rains are expected to begin again in east and northeast India from July 8, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday. Many parts of Assam and Bihar have already been impacted by flooding because of extreme rains in these regions from June 29 to July 1.On Monday, the weather office issued an orange category warning for eastern and north-eastern states from July 8 to 10 after forecasts of thunderstorms, lightning and extremely heavy rains.An orange category warning implies that authorities should be prepared for emergencies or rain related disasters.The monsoon trough at mean sea level lies to south of its normal position. “It is very likely to shift northwards towards the foothills of Himalayas from July 9 onwards. High convergence of south-westerly-southerly winds from Bay of Bengal at lower tropospheric levels very likely over northeast and east India from July 9 onwards. Under its influence, widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls very likely over Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Bihar and east Uttar Pradesh on July 9 and 10,” IMD said in a statement on Monday.Extremely heavy rain (≥ 20 cm) is also likely over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim from July 9 to 12. Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura are likely to receive very heavy rains from July 9 to 12.“The normal position of the monsoon trough is between Ganganagar in Rajasthan to Bay of Bengal. But through the monsoon months the trough keeps shifting or oscillating. Even now the trough is slightly south of its normal position passing along Gujarat and over Jharkhand. We are expecting the trough to shift northwards towards the Himalayan foothills in the next few days. Moist winds along with orography (topography of mountains) can bring extreme rains in east and northeast India. Many parts of the region were already flooding because the monsoon trough had shifted northwards around June 30. If the rivers are swollen, they can flood again,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.Meanwhile, under the influence of the well-marked low-pressure area over Saurashtra and its neighbourhood, widespread rainfall activity is likely over Gujarat during the next two days. Extremely heavy rain is also very likely over Saurashtra and Kutch during the next 48 hours. IMD has issued a red category warning for July 6 and 7, which implies that local authorities are supposed to take action against disasters caused by heavy rain.Moderate to intense thunderstorm and lightning is expected over Madhya Pradesh, south Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and north coastal Andhra Pradesh during the next 12 hours.Monsoon rains over the country is 13% excess, It’s 26% excess over central India; 8% excess over east and northeast India; 11% excess over south peninsula; and 5% deficient over northwest India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-in-east-ne-may-trigger-floods/story-ckaa0eLUaIhcLy2dgtQb1M.html
07-07-2020||India||Rahul skips defence panel meetings, says BJP chief JP Nadda||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda on Monday questioned former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s persistent absence from meetings of the parliamentary standing committee on defence and said his recent comments on the India-China standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh demoralised Indian forces.“Rahul Gandhi does not attend a single meeting of Standing Committee on Defence. But sadly, he continues to demoralise the nation, question the valour of our armed forces and do everything that a responsible opposition leader should not do,” Nadda tweeted.The Congress responded by accusing the BJP of resorting to “cheap distractions and stunts to manage headlines” during the India-China border standoff.As per the records on the Lok Sabha’s website, the committee met 11 times between September 2019 and March 2020 and Gandhi did not attend any of the meetings. While Gandhi has been critical of the government over its handling of the crisis, the BJP has accused the Congress of politicising the issue.“Rahul Gandhi belongs to that glorious dynastic tradition where as far as defence is concerned, committees don’t matter, only commissions do. Congress has many deserving members who understand parliamentary matters but one dynasty will never let such leaders grow. Really sad,” he tweeted.The defence committee, headed by BJP’s Jual Oram, has 31 members in all -- 10 from the Rajya Sabha and 21 from the Lok Sabha. Gandhi is not the only member who skipped the meetings. While the first meeting was attended by 20 members, , the subsequent meetings saw lower attendance. BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao sought an explanation from Gandhi for not attending the meetings and also asked why he skipped a field visit to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, which proved to be a very important visit for the committee. “He and his party have nominated him as a member on this very important standing committee which deals with all matters dealing with defence and armed forces. We demand an explanation from Rahul Gandhi as to why he chose to be absent from all the meetings of Standing Committee on Defence, of which he is a member,” Rao said.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala responded in a series of tweets. “Dear Nadda Ji, Daily insidious comments are making you look like a poorer version of malicious BJP spokespersons. Had the BJP & Modi Govt spent its energy in fighting China & supporting our Armed Forces, you wouldn’t need to lie on Chinese transgressions to mislead the Nation,” he tweeted.Surjewala then went to pose questions to the BJP chief on the defence preparedness of the country.“Did the Estimates Committee of Parliament headed by Ex BJP President, Sh. M.M.Joshi submit a report citing that Defence Expenditure was ‘lowest since 1962’-lowest in 56 yrs? Is this Modi Govt’s way of enhancing the morale of our Armed Forces?” he asked in one .“Why did Modi Govt shelve the creation of 90,000 strong “Mountain Strike Corps” to be carved out as a counter measure to Chinese build up on our borders? Why did you deny our Armed Forces this strategic fire power to take on the Chinese forces?” he said in a second tweet.“Why has China committed 2,264 transgressions on our territory since 2015 under Modi Govt (Year 2015-428, Yr 2016-296, Yr 2017-473, Yr 2018-404, Yr 2019-663)? Why did the BJP Govt not act upon this pre-meditated Chinese design?” Surjewala asked in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-skips-defence-panel-meetings-says-bjp-chief/story-QmSoG4AwRvWAdvxc5wPWsO.html
07-07-2020||India||Talcher fertiliser plant work, given to Chinese firm, halted||Work on the Rs 13,277 crore Talcher fertiliser and coal gasification project, which was awarded to China’s Wuhuan Engineering Company Ltd in September last year, has been halted because of technical reasons, people aware of the development said.The Chinese firm is unable to immediately mobilise technicians, equipment and workers at the site because of disruption in air connectivity amid the Covid-19 pandemic and visa issues, they added, requesting anonymity.The recent India-China military standoff at the border may also have some indirect impact on the project, but it is too early to come to a definitive conclusion at this stage on the extent of the impact, the people cited above said. The project is the first in India to employ coal gasification technology for production of urea. Coal gasification is a process that converts coal into synthesis gas or syngas that is a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide..Also read| ‘Ensure expeditious restoration of peace in border areas’: India urges China“The project is on. Any call, if at all, will be taken by the competent authority depending on how India-China border talks unfold. Although the project is important to reduce India’s dependence on imported urea, national interest is supreme,” one of the people cited above, who works in an economic ministry, said. The Narendra Modi govenment last week announced a ban on 59 mostly Chinese mobile applications such as Tik-Tok, UC Browser and WeChat, citing concerns that these are “prejudicial to sovereignty of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.” Imports from China are also facing strict scrutiny at customs check-points and Chinese investments are subject to prior government approval amid security concerns.Also read| ‘Banning Chinese apps a digital strike’: Union minister Ravi Shankar PrasadSindo-Indian tensions shot up after a violent brawl between Chinese and Indian soldiers on June 15 along the Line of Actual Control in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in which 20 Indian army personnel an unspecified number of Chinese were killed.The state-owned Talcher Fertilizers Limited (TFL) awarded the lump-sum turnkey (LSTK) contract project to Wuhuan Engineering on September 17, 2019 after a global competitive bid. TFL is backed by four state-run companies Gail India Ltd (GAIL), Coal India Ltd (CIL), Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd (RCF) and Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (FCIL). GAIL, CIL and RCF hold 31.85% equity stake each in the company and the balance 4.45% is held by FCIL. Email queries sent to TFL, GAIL, CIL, RCF, FCIL, Wuhuan Engineering and the ministries of fertiliser, coal and petroleum did not elicit any response.One person aware of the ground developments said, “The project had been hit by coronavirus pandemic that started in (the central Chinese city of) Wuhan last year in December, hence slow progress. But you can’t judge the outcome of a match in the first few overs. We are hopeful of completing the project by September 2023.”An officer in the fertiliser ministry said the project has already been delayed by almost six months.The Talcher project will produce 1.27 million tonnes per annum of neem-coated urea through gasification of a mixed feedstock comprising of high ash Indian coal and petcoke. TFL has been allotted northern part of the North Arkhapal mine as a captive asset for meeting its coal requirements and petcoke shall be sourced from the Paradip refinery of Indian Oil.SC Sharma, an energy expert and former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission, said, “Coal gasification to urea is not a viable technology in an era of cheap imported gas. Talcher Coal is best used for power generation at pithead where costs could be Rs 1.5 per kWh to Rs 2 per kWh. It’s more important to reduce import of coal for power generation rather than creating another technology which may not turn out to be a competitive option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talcher-fertiliser-plant-work-given-to-chinese-firm-halted/story-SXC2tL3vHcnEM5oQQwfihI.html
07-07-2020||India||Behind the Indo-China border de-escalation||At 8.45am on Sunday, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane called up defence minister Rajnath Singh to inform him that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was moving out troops from the Y-junction of Galwan Valley, towards its base camp in the rear.The same evening, between 5pm and 6pm, National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval, also the Special Representative (SR) on the Boundary Dialogue between the two countries, had a candid conversation with Chinese SR Wang Yi (also the country’s foreign minister). Coming out of more than two weeks of quarantine and indisposition during which he monitored the LAC developments from home, NSA Doval stressed the need to restore patrolling rights of the Indian Army on these four points in order to bring peace and tranquillity along the 1597km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) in east Ladakh.People aware of the matter said that, by Monday evening, the Chinese started moving back at the four contested stand-off points between the two countries — Galwan, Gogra, Hot Springs and Pangong Tso. The PLA and the Indian Army had withdrawn to their respective base camps in the Galwan sector; initial troop withdrawal had begun in Gogra (patrolling point 15) and Hot Springs (patrolling point 17); and the PLA was in the process of dismantling some structures on Finger 4. People aware of the developments said that till such time as the withdrawal is complete, there will be no let up from the Indian forces, which will continue to be deployed, as an “accident” cannot be ruled out.Also read: India-China ties in complex situation, says Beijing after Doval-Wang icebreakerWhile these are the first steps taken towards disengagement on the LAC leading to de-escalation, Doval and Wang agreed that both sides will have patrolling rights on the contested points, but will avoid any friction or clash in the future. While the joint secretary-level Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border issues will meet soon to implement these decisions on the ground, the two SRs are scheduled to hold talks three weeks later, by which time the withdrawal process should have been completed, the people cited above said.The development is a culmination of series of meetings between military commanders and diplomatic officials that began after the PLA took an aggressive posture on the LAC in May. India’s response was handed by NSA Doval under guidance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and in close coordination with Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah and external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who stood in for an indisposed Doval to talk to SR Wang Yi on June 17 after the Indian Army and the PLA clashed at patrolling point 14 in the Galwan sector.The people said it two had a tough conversation, with both sides accusing the other of initiating the border skirmish in which 20 Indian Army soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers were killed.While India will continue to put pressure on China to ensure that the PLA withdraws to its April positions, the country’s national security planners say that the disengagement process will take time, with each point being negotiated by the military commanders on the ground with diplomatic support. While the PLA were at a disadvantage in Galwan, Gogra and Hot Springs in terms of military positions, the situation at Pangong Tso is in favour of the Chinese, as they have built a road up to Finger 4.Also read| No unilateral change to status quo, agree India-China: 10 pointsUltimately, said analysts, it is restoration of Indian patrolling rights on the north banks of Pangong Tso which will determine the success of the Doval-Wang parleys.Although Raisina Hill is relieved at the reduction of tension at the border, it is still foxed at the reasons for the Chinese PLA to initiate military aggression on the LAC at the cost of a nuanced and complex relationship between the two countries achieved with 30 years of careful nurturing. “ Even if we say that PLA was showcasing the power differential between China and India, it does not make any sense strategically as the move to acquire few kilometres of territory not only riled up all India including Opposition parties but also severely hit the economic ties (between the countries),” said a senior government official who asked not to be named.The only explanation to the PLA aggression, according to a member of China Study Group, a government body, is that Beijing expected New Delhi to capitulate much the way some ASEAN nations have when it comes to China’s aggression in the South China Sea.While India has noted the US Navy counter to Chinese Navy’s exercises in the South China Sea, senior officials are at pains to clarify that this has no links to Ladakh withdrawal. “ For the past two months, we were prepared for the worst in Ladakh as PM Modi had decided that India will not back down from any aggression on the borders and surrendering of any territory was unacceptable,” said a senior Cabinet Minister who spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behind-the-border-de-escalation/story-6dDImaSYp1irdBkp0NkrqK.html
07-07-2020||India||China troops pull back from key friction points||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has withdrawn up to 1.5km from friction areas in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, and the Indian Army has pulled back proportionately, acting on an understanding reached last week by top Indian and Chinese military commanders on a phased de-escalation of the ongoing border conflict in the Ladakh theatre, multiple people familiar with the developments said on Monday.A minor thinning of PLA soldiers has also been noticed at the sensitive Finger Area near Pangong Tso, they added.But India is keeping its guard up and advancing with maximum caution as the complex disengagement process begins along the tense and heavily militarised border, an official said on the condition of anonymity.The Indian Army has observed the PLA retreat up to 1.5km (still under verification) from Patrolling Point (PP)-14 in the Galwan Valley — the site of a deadly clash which left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead on June 15 — after removing some temporary structures and tents it had pitched there, a second official said.This stepping back of soldiers in Galwan Valley has created a 3km buffer zone, he added.“Rearward movement of PLA vehicles has been seen in Galwan Valley and the Hot Springs-Gogra post sector (PP-15 and PP-17),” the official said. “Some skeletal withdrawal of PLA troops and vehicles has been observed at Finger 4 but the army wouldn’t categorise it as disengagement while it keeps a close watch on the developments there,” said a third official aware of the matter.The military buildup in Indian and Chinese depth areas, however, hasn’t thinned, with both sides keeping their guard up. The deployment of thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence weapons continues in the region, according to the people cited above.The disengagement process, a precursor to any kind of de-escalation of the border conflict — which entered its third month on Monday — has started under the terms mutually agreed to at the June 30 meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region.It also followed a two-hour video conference between India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and China’s foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official statements by both countries.The two Special Representatives (SR) on the India-China boundary question agreed that “it was necessary to ensure at the earliest complete disengagement of troops along the LAC and de-escalation from India-China border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquillity,” the ministry of external affairs said in a statement.“The two sides welcome the progress made in the recent military and diplomatic meetings between the two countries, and agree to continue the dialogue and consultation, and emphasise that the consensus reached at the level of the two border defence forces commanders should be implemented as soon as possible to complete the process of disengagement of the front-line forces of the two sides as soon as possible,” said the Chinese statement.Explaining the need for maximum caution while dealing with China, the officials cited above said the Chinese PLA was making claims to areas that are up to 800 metres inside what New Delhi considers its territory in Galwan Valley.“The PLA claim has shifted to Nala junction or Y-junction where Galwan river meets the Shyok, which is 800 metres on the Indian side of China’s claim of 1959. In April 2020, the PLA objected to the construction of a bridge at the mouth of Galwan. This area was never contested and that’s why face-offs never took place here,” the officials said.As disengagement progresses, it’s critical to define buffer zones clearly with natural features and ensure that soldiers do not venture into these areas as a step towards reversing the trust deficit created by the Galwan Valley clash, they said.The officials said that the PLA was also creating a dispute at Naku La in north Sikkim by disregarding the watershed principle, an established global norm for border demarcation. They said the PLA was repeatedly carrying out transgressions in the Naku La area, where four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured during a violent face-off involving 150 troops on May 9.Military experts reacted to the development with guarded optimism and underlined the need to proceed with caution, given the trust deficit created by the Galwan Valley skirmish.“It’s a positive sign that some disengagement is taking place. Separation of soldiers lessens the chances of any clash taking place that could vitiate the atmosphere for future diplomatic and military-level talks,” said Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), a former Northern Army commander.A limited military disengagement in the same friction areas — Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra — was initiated last month after the senior military commanders reached an understanding on reducing tensions during their first meeting on June 6. However, the Galwan Valley clash dashed disengagement hopes.“While we need to tread cautiously, at least there does appear to be some desire from both sides to break through the stalemate that has existed along the LAC,” Hooda added.Disengagement involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the complex plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides. It also entails the phased withdrawal of weapons and equipment to a mutually agreed distance, and finally the restoration of status quo ante (early April).At the June 30 meeting, the Indian side reiterated its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from friction points along the LAC and sought the restoration of status quo ante (early April) in key areas such as Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Hot Springs, Gogra and the strategic Depsang plains, apart from emphasising the need for thinning the military buildup in the region.The corps commander-ranked officers previously met on June 22 when they hammered out a consensus on disengaging from friction points along the disputed border. However, the “mutual consensus to disengage” from all “friction areas” neither enabled any disengagement on the ground nor led to the thinning of the military build-up by rival forces in the region, leading to their third meeting on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-troops-pull-back-from-key-friction-points/story-Svod0u2N2ftpNIDpiltwIJ.html
07-07-2020||India||HT Salutes: Assam trio makes face masks, shields||As a non-practising medical doctor, Dipannita Kaushik decided she had to pitch in as the coronavirus pandemic raged across the globe. So the 29-year-old from Guwahati, Assam, who is currently pursuing a Masters in public health, decided to make face shields and masks for workers on the frontline with the help of her mother and her fiancé, reusing old X-ray and projector sheets.“I know what it’s like to not have proper gear, even in ordinary times,” said Kaushik, who has served as a resident at an Apollo hospital and at Pratiksha Hospital in Assam.“During an outbreak like this one, I can’t even imagine the risks. Often the most under-equipped and severely affected are the Asha [accredited social health activists], multipurpose health workers and anganwadi workers who are actually doing the grass root data collection and who act as a bridge between the healthcare community and the population. So I wanted to do this for them.” Watch | HT Salutes: Assam doctor who makes face shields, masks for Covid warriorsKaushik’s mother, Simarekha Bhagowati, 56, a college professor, had plenty of old OHP sheets lying around, leftovers from Math lectures in earlier decades. They dug up a bunch of old X-rays too. They use multiple strips of the stiff X-ray sheets to make each frame; the projector films form the veil.Kaushik’s fiancé, Tuhin Bhuyan, 28, a software engineer, helps put the shields together using craft glue. Her mother pitches in with the masks, on their sewing machine.Their first batch of 40 masks and shields was ready by the first week of April. “The second part of my job was to reach the right people,” Kaushik said. She contacted Dr Santimoyee Barua, the surveillance medical officer at the ministry of health and family welfare in Guwahati, who said she would be glad to have the consignment.The second batch was ready by the middle of May and went to Dr Nabin Bhuyan, medical superintendent at the Morigaon Civil Hospital, a designated facility for Covid-positive cases.“Such quick thinking can be life-saving,” said Barua. “The shields especially, because of the greater protection they offer, are very useful to the Asha and multipurpose workers who are out in the field, tracing suspected Covid-19 infections.”Her third batch, Kaushik said, will go to traffic personnel, street vendors and local shopkeepers later this month. Meanwhile, she has also posted YouTube tutorials to help others make such kits too.“DIY shields could be a vital strategy as we unlock and prepare for life amid the virus,” she said. “The good thing about them is that they can also be sterilised and reused, again and again, until some component gives way. It’s just what we need.”Each kit takes the group of three around 10 minutes to make. And since she has had plenty of time indoors, Kaushik said it’s been a good way to keep busy and make herself useful, outside her regular routine of housework and thesis work.“Her masks more than meet our standards,” Nabin Bhuyan said. “We have used them in the hospital and out in the field. Innovative, cost-effective ventures like these are vital in resource-constrained countries like ours.”Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you 15 stories of HT Salutes.
