After the YSR Congress party government came to power, he had been participating in the temple rituals though his position was not restored.As per the temple custom, the last rites of any hereditary priest have to be held as per a specific procedure associated with the temple. However, in the wake of the present Covid-19 situation, the TTD decided against following the customs.Soon after the death of Deekshitulu, TTD trust board chairman Y V Subba Reddy flew to Vijayawada to have a meeting with chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to discuss the demand from various sections of the TTD for closure of the temple for darshans by pilgrims.Subba Reddy told the reporters last week that 15 out of 50 priests at Tirumala temple had tested positive, apart from 140 TTD employees since the famous temple was re-opened for darshan on June 8.Honorary head priest of the temple A V Ramana Deekshitulu found fault with the TTD authorities for continuing to allow darshans in the temple despite a surge in Covid-19 cases in Tirumala.He alleged that the TTD officials were obediently following anti-hereditary archaka and anti-Brahmin policy of TDP led by N Chandrababu Naidu. “Disaster if this continues. Please take action,” he requested the CM.The TTD Staff and Workers United Front, affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, submitted a representation to TTD Executive Officer Anil Kumar Singhal requesting that darshan at the temple be temporarily suspended in the wake of growing number of positive cases on the Tirumala hills.The TTD staff pointed out that more than 1,000 positive cases of Covid-19 were reported in Tirupati town and around 100 employees of the TTD had tested positive. “These employees can end up infecting devotees when they go up the hill to Tirumala to perform duties. In this context, employees are all very worried,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-former-head-priest-of-tirumala-dies-of-covid-19-ttd-under-pressure-to-shut-temple/story-ItmCA3n3rSWZzoYi7zbYRI.html
20-07-2020||India||Lucknow was a pleasant surprise: Shoojit Sircar||Filmmaker Shoojit Sircar fell in love with Lucknow when he came to shoot for his directorial ‘Gulabo Sitabo’ starring Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana.“Lucknow came as a surprise to me. All I knew about it was Bada Imambara, Rumi Gate, Chota Imambara and La Martiniere. When I came for location-hunting, I discovered Chowk and was charmed. I spent a lot of time walking deep inside the different galis (lanes) in between Akbari Gate and Gol Darwaza and loved eating there. I also discovered the Qaiserbagh area. The people of the city bowled me over with their language and charmed restraint,” said the national award winning director, during a webinar, on Sunday.He shot for almost four months and it was a golden opportunity to walk around different parts of the city. He discovered architectural marvels but is sorry that much of the heritage sites are in such bad shape and neglect. The filmmaker said that he would like to see the architectural beauties in Kolkata and in Lucknow restored to their former glory and taken care of, but he is not sure how to make that possible. “The heritage kothis and havelis must be preserved,” he said.Sircar stayed at hotel Clarks Avadh because Satyajit Ray had stayed there when he came to shoot ‘Shatranj Ke Khiladi’ in the early 1970s. Shoojit said that he worships the work of Satyajit Ray.When asked repeatedly if he would return to Lucknow to film another local story, or make a film on the city’s history, especially the 1857 event, he said he would love to do that if he is inspired by an idea and the opportunity to film in the city come up. He termed his experience of filming ‘Gulabo Sitabo’ as memorable. “I was amazed to see the art of puppetry and feel sorry to see it fading away,” he said.Giving an insight on Big B he said, “Whenever Mr Bachchan shoots in a city, he usually goes to Mumbai and comes back in between but during the entire shoot he did not go even once and probably that was because he likes the city a lot.”He also revealed that shooting the scene when Big B as Mirza falls near a makkhan malai shop at the Chowk Crossing was very tough. “I cannot tell you how we shot that one scene when Mr Bachchan is having kulfi and he collapses. We were fortunate that a lot of people did not recognise him.” He also revealed that initially they were planning to shoot the film in the Jama Masjid area, Delhi.Sircar was all praise for ‘Begum’ Farruk Jaffar and other local actors who excelled in the film. Organised by Citizens of Lucknow, the webinar was hosted by Mehru Jaffar and other senior members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow-was-a-pleasant-surprise-shoojit-sircar/story-YNwBkzupYYeywX9ATAsuzJ.html

These hospitals would, however, treat low to moderate cases only, said a source of the hospital.Kumar said in addition to private hospitals, the government would also increase the number of beds in its hospitals, including the NMCH and the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH).The state government has already asked all its medical college hospitals to have 100 isolation beds for Covid-19 cases. The PMCH was expected to commence the facility in the next couple of days, said sources.The chief secretary, whom the team members met before leaving for Delhi, said the team was generally satisfied with the measures the state had taken, especially during the lockdown, and also curbs imposed in containment zones.The team, however, advised better perimeter control and health screening of people residing within containment zones to contain the spread of the disease.Kumar said the Central team was satisfied with the “open-ended measures” the state had taken to ramp up testing through antigen rapid testing kits.“The state would now not have any testing target, but would conduct testing of all symptomatic patients, who reach our facilities or mobile testing vans,” said Kumar.The Centre had recently sent 10,000 rapid testing kits to the state.Meanwhile, testing facility had begun in 11 sub-divisional hospitals of the state on Monday, said Bihar’s health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh during the media briefing.He said the facility would begin in 27 other sub-divisional hospitals on Tuesday.Singh said there were 2,584 containment zones in Bihar of which 1,931 were in rural areas and 653 in urban areas.He said with the recovery of 938 Covid-19 patients, the total recoveries had gone up to 17,535, with a recovery percentage of 63.87%.A three-member Central team, headed by Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary in the ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) had visited the NMCH to assess its condition on Sunday. Other team members were Dr SK Singh, director National Centre for Disease Control, and associate professor of AIIMS-Delhi Dr Neeraj Nischal.The team also visited the Covid-care facility in Gaya before returning to Delhi on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-in-bihar-surge-to-27-455-central-team-suggests-hiking-bed-capacity/story-oRKrcOb0TOcERRvHDFRKnO.html

Enough is enough. Mr @bhupeshbaghel will be hearing from my lawyers,’’ Omar, a former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister tweeted.I am fed up of the downright malicious and false allegation that what Sachin Pilot is doing is somehow linked to my or my father’s release from detention earlier this year. Enough is enough. Mr @bhupeshbaghel will be hearing from my lawyers. Cc @RahulGandhi @INCIndia @rssurjewala https://t.co/Gojb7vN1V3Baghel in an interview to The Hindu had said, “And as far as Sachin Pilot is concerned, not that I have been tracking the Rajasthan events so closely, but it does make one curious why Omar Abdullah was released? He and Mehbooba Muftiji were booked under the same Sections of the law, while she is still languishing, he is out. Is it because Mr. Abdullah is brother-in-law of Sachin Pilot?”Following Omar’s threat, Baghel took to Twitter to say, “Please do not try to turn this tragic demise of democracy into an opportune moment Omar Abdullah ji. The ‘allegation’ was only a question asked, and we will keep asking it, as will the country.”The tragic demise of democracy began with the imprisonment of the leaders who believe in democracy like Mr. Abdullah, Ms. Mufti and other leaders of Kashmir. The release of @OmarAbdullah is duly welcomed but we shall continue to demand the release of all others. (1/2)The NC leader dismissed Baghel’s comeback saying the Congress doesn’t know its friends from its opponents.“You can send your answer to my lawyers. This is what is wrong with the Congress today, you don’t know your friends from your opponents. This is why you people are in the mess you are in. Your ‘question’ was malicious and will not go uncontested,” he said in another tweet.The National Conference also condemned Baghel comments.“The party has taken note of and expresses strong objection to an interview given by CM of Chhattisgarh Bhupesh Baghel wherein he had maliciously suggested that the release of our Vice President Omar Abdullah from preventive detention was somehow related to Sachin Pilot or the present political situation unraveling in Rajasthan,” the NC said in a statement.‘’The party unequivocally rejects such malicious, false and politically motivated statements that are used for convenient political posturing,’’ the statement said. This statement further said apart from being false and scurrilous the allegation is also defamatory to the reputation of Omar Abdullah. ‘’It is within the province of public knowledge that the release of Omar Abdullah happened after judicial intervention was sought from the Supreme Court and the illegal order of detention of Abdullah was challenged. Given the indefensible nature of the illegal detention order the same was revoked by the Government during the course of the proceedings before the Supreme Court,’’ the statement said.Omar’s sister, Sarah Abdullah is married to Sachin Pilot. She had approached the Supreme Court in February and challenged her brother’s detention under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA) under which he was imprisoned.Later, the government withdrew the Public Safety Act of Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah and they both were freed. Currently only one former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti who is also the PDP president is detained under Public Safety Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omar-abdullah-fumes-after-chhattisgarh-cm-links-his-release-to-sachin-pilot/story-uq57OclVzxTn3ap8ATOGwL.html

The victim’s wife Chadima Roy had filed a petition seeking a CBI investigation.“A single judge bench of the Calcutta High Court has turned down the plea for a CBI probe. We will soon file an appeal before a division bench,” said Chadima Roy’s lawyer Brajesh Jha who filed the plea.The court said that a medical board comprising head of the forensic science division of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital would give a second opinion on Roy’s post mortem report within 14 days. The additional director general of the state’s Criminal Investigation Department would monitor the probe.The Mamata Banerjee administration had earlier handed over the case to the CID which is now probing the case. The post mortem report had hinted that Roy may have committed suicide even though the chemical analysis report is still pending. Police investigation had suggested that Roy committed suicide after he was duped by his business partners. He had invested around Rs 1.5 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-high-court-rejects-demand-for-cbi-probe-into-bjp-mla-s-death/story-GI8EUgaOPUxXesAQdhtUhO.html

In Hyderabad, as many as 30 volunteers have registered with the NIMS for the clinical trials.“Of them, seven more subjects are available and they would be administered the vaccine in the next few days,” NIMS director Dr K Manohar said.Also read: Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate is safe, early results showAccording to an official familiar with the development, the volunteers are being drawn from different parts of the state. These subjects would be administered two doses of the vaccine. There will be three types of vaccines — three micrograms, six micrograms and placebo. Each subject would be given the second dose of the same vaccine after 14 days.For two days after administering the vaccine, the subjects would be monitored by a team of doctors in the Intensive Critical Care Unit (ICCU) before being discharged.“Their health condition will be monitored from time to time. The doctors would also look into the interaction with the vaccine digitally as well as through frequent physical check-ups,” the official said.Meanwhile, King George Hospital (KGH) in Andhra Pradesh’s D, which was also selected by the ICMR for clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine, is yet to commence the exercise.“We have got the approval from the ICMR, but are yet to get the clearance from the state government. We have written to the Director of Medical Education to give the nod for clinical trials and once we get it, we shall start,” Dr K Indira Devi, in-charge superintendent of the KGH, told Hindustan Times.She said the selection of subjects would be done only after getting an approval from the state government. “As of now, we have not identified any subjects,” she said.The first phase of clinical trials would go on for 28 days, after which ICMR and Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) would accord permission for the second phase which will include more subjects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clinical-trials-for-covid-19-vaccine-begin-in-hyderabad-s-nims/story-cphbLJ9sEq5mZwNCV72iRP.html

20-07-2020||India||IAF to induct 5 Rafale jets at Ambala air base on July 29||The Indian Air Force will induct its first batch of five Rafale fighter jets imported from France at the Ambala air base on July 29 if weather permits, an IAF spokesperson said on Monday.“The IAF’s air and ground crews have undergone comprehensive training on the aircraft, including its highly-advanced weapons systems and are fully operational now. Efforts will focus on operationalisation of the aircraft at the earliest,” said Wing Commander Indranil Nandi. A formal induction ceremony will take place next month, he said.The air force is inducting the fighters at a time of heightened military tensions with China. Hindustan Times on Sunday reported that the IAF could deploy its new Rafale fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, where Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a tense border confrontation and disengagement has turned out to be a challenging process.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases.Acting on a special request by the IAF, France has accelerated the deliveries of Rafale fighters to India --- five jets are coming instead of four that were originally planned to be delivered in the first batch.Preparations are currently on to fly the jets to India with a stopover at Al Dhafra air base near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab EmiratesThe French air force will refuel the Indian fighters using its Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft on their way to Al Dhafra from where aerial refueling support is expected to be provided by the IAF’s Russian Ilyushin-78 refuellers.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the IAF’s combat capabilities.The possible deployment of Rafale fighters in Ladakh could be discussed at the IAF commanders’ conference in New Delhi from July 22 to 24 where the air force brass is expected to focus on the ongoing border row with China, the IAF’s preparedness and new purchases that have to be made fast.“During the three-day conference, the discussions would take stock of the current operational scenario and deployments. The plan of action for operational capability enhancement of the IAF in the next decade will also be discussed,” Nandi said. IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria will chair the conference. IAF in the Next Decade is the theme of the conference.According to the original delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) were to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected in April-May 2022. Future deliveries will also be expedited.France handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-to-induct-5-rafale-jets-at-ambala-air-base-on-july-29/story-ioxKxAkNLJeO5ucLE4xiaK.html
20-07-2020||India||‘Worrisome law and order situation’: Bengal Guv reports to Amit Shah||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday told Union home minister Amit Shah about the “worrisome” law and order situation in the eastern state, adding it was on the “edge of a cliff” and cited the healthcare management, nepotism in cyclone relief distribution and the general governance as examples to drive home his point. The governor has been raising these issues on the social media platforms and in his interactions with state ministers and bureaucrats for a long time but this is the first time he met Shah to officially report his assessment. “Worrisome and dangerously deteriorating law and order situation, targeting political opponents and the highly partisan role of police was also discussed. The role of police leaves much to be desired and focused that it was high time exemplary action was taken against senior police officials who act in disregard of the conduct rules,” the governor’s house said in the statement.“Rampant corruption and nepotism in Amphan relief distribution also figured in the discussion. Governor Dhankhar indicated that the relief, rather than benefiting the needy and entitled persons, was unashamedly siphoned off by the members of the ruling party… State has taken no steps in law to deal with this monumental corruption. Cover up of this has been a mere eyewash in the media,” the Raj Bhawan said. It added that nepotism led to widespread unrest and violence.“Governor Dhankhar shared his concern with the Union Home Minister at the alarming Covid-19 situation with figures of Covid 19 deaths and positive cases rising to a higher level day by day and abysmal lack of health facilities for the suffering people, both Covid and non covid. People are in a state of deep worry at this grim scenario,” said the statement.Appointed governor on July 20 last year, the governor’s relationship with the TMC government and chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been marked by acrimony through a chain of events since September 2019.Significantly, Dhankhar’s meeting with Shah took place a day before the TMC chief was preparing to observe July 21 as martyrs’ day in memory of the youths who died in police firing in 1993 in Kolkata during a law violation programme by the state Youth Congress which she led at that time.The day is special for the TMC and Banerjee, especially this year, because she is likely to announce her next political programme aimed at the crucial assembly polls in 2021. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, has set an agenda to win 200 of the 294 assembly seats and capture the eastern state.“This is most unfortunate and I would say the unbecoming of a governor. In my long political career I have not seen a governor like him,” said Tapas Roy, senior TMC leader and minister of state for parliamentary affairs.Prof Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, an expert on the Indian Constitution and former principal of Presidency College, said Dhankhar did his duty and the ruling party should have no reason to criticise him.“As the governor is appointed by the Centre it is his duty to report whatever is happening in West Bengal. He has to send a monthly report to the Union government, practically to the home minister, for which he does not have to take the advice of the state cabinet. He has not done anything wrong by choosing to talk to the home minster,” Mukhopadhyay told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worrisome-law-and-order-situation-bengal-guv-reports-to-amit-shah/story-gttwrUakDoSXYDKL59g0nJ.html

The IBM CEO briefed the prime minister about his company’s huge investment plans in India and expressed confidence in the vision of an ‘Aatma nirbhar Bharat’ (a self-reliant India), the statement said. “The prime minister highlighted that this is a great time to invest in India. He said the country is welcoming and supporting investments taking place in the tech sector.

A huge well done to our brilliant, scientists and researchers at the University of Oxford. There are no guarantees, we’re not there yet and further trials will be necessary – but this is an important step in the right direction.”Scientists involved in the trials have said the vaccine caused minor side effects more frequently than a control group, but some of these effects could be reduced by taking common paracetamol, with no serious harmful effects from the vaccine.Here’s all you need to know about Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate:1. The vaccine has been called AZD1222 and was under development by pharma giant AstraZeneca in collaboration with scientists at Britain’s Oxford University.2. The first human trial of the Covid-19 vaccine has indicated it is safe for use on healthy volunteers.3. The new vaccine is a chimpanzee adenovirus viral vector (ChAdOx1) vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It uses a common cold virus (adenovirus) that infects chimpanzees, which has been weakened so that it can’t cause any infection in humans, and then has been genetically modified to code for the spike protein of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to scientists working with the pharma major.4. The human immune system has two ways of finding and attacking viral pathogens – antibody and T-cell responses. This experimental vaccine is intended to induce both, so it can attack the coronavirus when it’s circulating in the body, as well as attack infected cells.5. The widely-followed clinical trial is currently at an advanced stage, with ongoing trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa.6. Oxford University has tied up with pharma major AstraZeneca and the British government to produce the vaccine on a mass scale if the final results turn out to be positive. 7. The Serum Institute of India is one of the global partners for the production of the Covid-19 vaccine on a large scale, once it gains regulatory approval.8. A lot more research is needed before it can be confirmed that the experimental vaccine effectively protects against the Covid-19 infection and for how long that protection is likely to last in an infected patient..9. AstraZeneca’s is among the leading vaccine candidates against the Covid-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 6,00,000 lives worldwide.10. Some of the other vaccines candidates being developed and in the forefront of the frantic search for an effective one are China’s Sinovac Biotech, another from state-owned Chinese firm Sinopharm, and one from the U.S. biotech firm Moderna. 11. The British pharma giant has signed agreements with governments around the world to supply the vaccine should it prove effective and gain regulatory approval. The company has said it will not seek to profit from the vaccine during the Covid-19 pandemic. 12. There is currently no working vaccine against Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and experts say one will be needed to control the pandemic that has infected millions of people around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/initial-human-trial-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-brings-hope-found-safe-all-you-need-to-know/story-MDaZB7z2i89ZrINDA4y3kM.html

A bulletin issued by Bikram Singh, director, Regional Meteorological Centre, stated, “Heavy to very heavy rainfall with intense to very intense spells is very likely (60% probability) to occur over Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Bageshwar and Pithoragarh districts of Uttarakhand between Tuesday and Thursday.”These districts are likely to experience landslides, boulder fall, overflowing of gushing streams and blockade or a washout of link roads.The IMD authorities advised the district administrations to be on their guard and maintain a strict vigil at settlements such as people living nears banks of rivulets, streams and landslide-prone areas.There is a forecast for heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places in Dehradun, Haridwar, Tehri, Pauri, Nainital, and Almora districts in the Himalayan state between Tuesday and Thursday.Praveen Alok, an official from the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), on Monday, said that in the past 24 hours, over 500 people were evacuated to safer places by alternate route after a road was blocked at Pipalkoti in Chamoli district on Sunday. Eight rescue operations were conducted by SDRF personnel and some are still underway across the hill state.Officials from State Emergency Operations Centre said that National Highway-(NH) 58, which leads to the Badrinath shrine, was blocked near Lambagad, a landslide-prone area till Monday afternoon. The Thal-Munisyari highway was also blocked at three places. Work is in progress to clear the debris.State officials, however, exuded confidence of meeting the annual nature’s fury during monsoon.Ravinath Raman, commissioner, Garhwal Mandal, said regular review meetings with district magistrates (DMs) are being conducted to monitor the situation.“We have instructed all DMs to take precautionary measures and ensure the safety of people in the hilly regions during monsoon. Satellite phones for improved communication; protection equipment such as torches and ropes for rescue have already been provided to all district authorities. Funds are also available with the district authorities to give compensation to anyone affected due to heavy rainfall,” said Raman.Leaves of all field staff engaged in disaster management have been cancelled until September, he added.Officials have also identified cloudburst-prone areas in Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, and Chamoli districts in Garhwal, and Bageshwar and Pithoragarh districts in Kumaon, where DMs have been asked to keep an additional vigil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-issues-red-alert-in-uttarakhand-s-five-districts-for-next-3-days/story-ySdjoWL3InpaoYyJX7h7iN.html
20-07-2020||India||Districts in MP, Bihar, Telangana most vulnerable to Covid-19 pandemic: Lancet study||Districts in Madhya Pradesh may be the most vulnerable to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by those in Bihar and Telangana, according to a study in The Lancet journal which assessed several key indicators like housing, hygiene, and the health system in these states. According to scientists, including Rajib Acharya from the Population Council, New Delhi, vulnerability in the research means the risk of consequences of infection, including spread, morbidity, mortality, and social and economic effects of the pandemic. The study noted that nine of 30 large states -- Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Telangana, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, and Gujarat -- have high vulnerability to be impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. It rated the vulnerabilities of the states to the pandemic on a scale from zero to one, measured using 15 indicators across five domains -- socioeconomic, demographic, housing and hygiene, epidemiological, and health system. “Our index aims to help planners and policy makers effectively prioritise regions for resource allocation and adopt risk mitigation strategies for better preparedness and responses to the Covid-19 epidemic,” the scientists, including Rajib Acharya from Population Council, New Delhi, noted in the study. They identified a number of vulnerable districts in India, which currently do not have large numbers of Covid-19 cases but could be strongly impacted by the pandemic.They said a number of districts in the nine large states -- Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, and Gujarat -- located in every region of the country except the northeast, had high overall vulnerability. According to the researchers, these states also had high vulnerability with respect to most of the five domains. Madhya Pradesh had an overall vulnerability score of one, with Sikkim on the other end with a score of zero, making it the least vulnerable. Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh were two other states on the lower overall vulnerability end of the scale. “Although our intention was not to predict the risk of infection for a district or a state, we observed similarities between vulnerability and the current concentration of Covid-19 cases at the state level,” they wrote in the study. However, the researchers said this relationship was not clear for districts, adding that better data collection at this regional level can help make more refined evaluations of vulnerability in their respective states. They also added that data used in the study are two to five years old and might not have captured vulnerability well in districts in which rapid changes have occurred up to the present day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/districts-in-mp-bihar-telangana-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19-pandemic-lancet-study/story-CGMqwwMzdetzmeen7URfmM.html

20-07-2020||India||Indian, US navies conduct drills in Indian Ocean amid border row with China||A US Navy carrier strike group, led by USS Nimitz, on Monday conducted maritime drills with Indian warships in the Indian Ocean region (IOR), against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff in Ladakh, people familiar with developments said on Monday.The passage exercise involved a total of eight Indian and US warships, said an official. The drills also came at a time when tensions have mounted over China’s activities in South China Sea, where the US Navy just conducted a major exercise that involved two carrier strike groups.“The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group is transiting through IOR. During the passage, #IndianNavy units undertook Passage Exercise (PASSEX) with #USNavy. Indian Navy had also conducted similar PASSEXs with #JMSDF (Japan) and #FrenchNavy in recent past,” the Indian Navy tweeted.The Eastern Fleet of the Indian Navy is currently carrying out manoeuvres near Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the warships that took part in the exercise were from that fleet, said a second official. While operating together, the US and Indian naval forces conducted high-end exercises designed to maximize training and interoperability, including air defence, the US 7th Fleet said in a statement. It said the Nimitz carrier strike group’s operations were designed to provide security throughout the region while building partnerships with friends and allies.The 7th Fleet is the largest of the US Navy’s forward deployed fleets.“Naval engagements such as these exercises improve the cooperation of US and Indian maritime forces and contribute to both sides’ ability to counter threats at sea, from piracy to violent extremism. These engagements also present opportunities to build upon the pre-existing strong relationship between the US and India and allow both countries to learn from each other,” it added.The Nimitz carrier strike group, consisting of flagship USS Nimitz, Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Princeton and Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Sterett and USS Ralph Johnson took part in the drills. India was represented by INS Rana, INS Sahyadri, INS Shivalik and INS Kamorta.“It was a privilege to operate with the Indian Navy,” said Rear Admiral Jim Kirk, commander of the Nimitz carrier strike group.The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group is transiting through IOR.

A significant volume of China’s oil imports passes through Malacca Strait, which is south-east of these islands.The Nimitz carrier strike group entered the Indian Ocean from the Malacca Strait and is on its way to the Persian Gulf.Also read: From Ladakh to Japan’s Senkaku Islands, ‘bully’ China is in an overdrive“A passage exercise is normally undertaken whenever an opportunity arises, in contrast to pre-planned maritime drills. While the Malabar exercise with the US will be conducted later this year, it is always good to exercise with like-minded navies and exchange best practices whenever there is a chance,” said naval affairs expert Captain DK Sharma (retd).The navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. It has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points under its mission-based deployment and the vessels could be diverted for any mission.Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.The nuclear-powered USS Nimitz, one of the largest warships on the planet, is returning from an operational deployment in South China Sea. A carrier strike group led by USS Ronald Reagan was part of the US drills in South China Sea.The US deployment to South China Sea came after China’s People’s Liberation Army-Navy conducted drills in the contested waters, provoking a sharp reaction from neighbouring countries and Washington. The US Navy has said its operations in South China Sea are designed to support a “free and open” Indo-Pacific.The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 17. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year.The formal invitation to Australia is expected to be extended after some time in view of delicate negotiations between India and China on disengagement and de-escalation to end their standoff along the LAC.China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-us-navies-conduct-drills-in-indian-ocean-amid-border-row-with-china/story-SKUxjlWZ7i9jcEZ5LNKG7J.html
20-07-2020||India||HC asks state, NIA if Varavara Rao’s family can see him in the hospital||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday asked the Maharashtra government and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to respond to a plea on whether the family members of Telugu poet and social activist, P Varavara Rao (81), who is an accused in the Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon case, be allowed to see him from a distance at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital following his worsening health condition.Rao, who had tested coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive on July 16 and suffers from old-age related health issues such as neurological ailments, was transferred on Sunday morning to Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital from the state-run St George’s Hospital, whose healthcare facilities are few and far between.The court issued the directions after Rao’s counsel Sudeep Pasbola informed the bench that the undertrial could be “on the verge of death” and his bail application be expedited.The court paid heed to Pasbola’s prayer and directed the state government and NIA to respond by Wednesday and his bail plea will be heard the following day.Pasbola informed a two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices SS Shinde and PV Tavade, that Rao’s health condition was rapidly worsening since he was lodged in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Jail.It had further aggravated after he was shifted to Sir JJ Hospital last week, he added.His counsel said his multiple health issues have flared up since he tested Covid-19 positive. Rao also suffered a head injury following a fall from his bed at Sir JJ Hospital.“Mr. Rao is in an extremely critical condition and it can be said that he is on the verge of death. His wife, through an affidavit filed on July 15, has requested permission to see him at the hospital,” submitted Pasbola.The counsel cited his critical health condition and his wife’s request to pray before the bench that his bail plea must be heard expeditiously. The gravity of Rao’s health condition overtook the issues raised in an earlier plea, filed last week through advocate R Satyanarayan, seeking an inquiry against the superintendent of Taloja Jail, and the matter could not be heard on Monday.The petition has alleged that the jail authorities did not comply with the prescription issued by the doctors at Sir JJ Hospital, when Rao was admitted there on May 28, leading to the worsening of his health condition. He had become delirious and incoherent, which was also corroborated by his wife and daughters, when they spoke to him over the phone on July 11.Additional solicitor-general Anil Singh, who appeared for NIA, submitted that Rao has been accorded the best possible treatment at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital after he suffered the head injury. He is being taken care of as per the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), he added.Singh also cited ICMR guidelines to make the point that the next of kin of Covid-19 patients are barred from any visitation right at a hospital.Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, who appeared for Maharashtra government, submitted before the court that Rao’s family members could interact with him via a video link. Later, both Singh and Thakare informed the court that they would take instructions from their respective authorities and the bail plea will be heard on Thursday.On May 28, Rao was taken to Sir JJ Hospital after he had lost consciousness. Later, he was discharged on June 1. At that time, the family members had alleged that he was hurriedly discharged in a bid to obstruct his bail plea before the special NIA court, a fear that came true on June 26.The NIA, which had taken over the Elgar Parishad case from Pune Police in February, had opposed the bail plea, as Rao was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAAPA), 2019, where there is no provision to grant him temporary bail.Earlier, on January 1, 2018, violence erupted between Dalits and Marathas near the village of Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, where thousands of Dalits had gathered to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon.In the battle, the British Army’s Dalit Mahar soldiers had defeated the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire.The commemoration took place a day after an event in Pune called the Elgar Parishad was held.The Pune Police conducted a preliminary probe and claimed that the violence in Bhima Koregaon was the result of speeches made at the Elgar Parishad event.They alleged that banned Maoist groups organised the event, and a first information report (FIR) was also filed.In June 2018, the Pune Police arrested five activists and lawyers from Pune, Nagpur, and Delhi – Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, and Shoma Sen – for their alleged links to the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), and also for organising the Elgar Parishad event.In August 2018, the police arrested four more activists – Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, and Rao.While Gautam Navlakha and Dr. Anand Teltumbde were arrested on April 14 this year, taking the total number of the accused in the case to 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-state-nia-if-varavara-rao-s-family-can-see-him-in-the-hospital/story-0fvNKwVOqBFf0oZpG5xpTP.html

20-07-2020||India||Row over invitation to PM Modi for Ram Temple bhoomi pujan unwarranted: VHP||The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has defended the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust’s invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the bhoomi pujan on August 5 to mark the beginning of the temple construction in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya amid criticism by the Congress and the NCP for different reasons. It has also asserted that the groundbreaking ceremony will be performed in line with all the laid down protocols for ensuring distancing and safekeeping during the Covid-19 pandemic.On Monday, Alok Kumar, the international working president of the VHP, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh said the controversy over the invitation to the PM who is yet to confirm his presence, is unwarranted.“There is no confirmation on who will be present for the ceremony. The invitations have been sent out by the trust after deciding the names unanimously,” he said. Reacting to Congressman Hussain Dalwai’s comment that former PM Jawaharlal Nehru had refused to attend a similar ceremony for the Somnath Temple which was reconstructed, Kumar said Indian secularism celebrates all religions and does not negate them. “The secularism to us means that the state does not prefer of patronize any religion and treats all of them equally,” he said.He went on to add, “It is a matter of record that PM Nehru had declined to attend the inauguration of Somnath Temple. However this is only half-truth. It must be recalled that Somnath Temple was inaugurated by the then President Dr. Rajendra Prasad. Nehru had sent a letter to Prasad advising that the President of a secular country should not attend the temple function. Dr. Rajendra Prasad had retorted that he was prepared to resign from the Presidency if that was Nehru’s view of the matter. Nehru did not pursue the matter.”Former chief minister and Congress MP Digvijay Singh also questioned the invitation to the PM. Talking to news agency ANI he said If PM Modi lays the foundation stone of the temple on August 5, all Shankaracharyas and Swami Ramnareshacharya ji of Ramanandi sect should be invited to the function and made members of the Nyas. He also objected to the Centre’s decision of not including Shankaracharyas in the Nyas, but filling it up with VHP and BJP leaders.Reacting to Singh’s statement Kumar said, it was the Supreme Court’s decision to allow the central government to appoint the trust.On the allegations that the ceremony is being held in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Kumar said, “We believe that the central government, the government of UP and other governments are engaged in a determined war against Corona and on all fronts. They have successfully contained the endemic. India is progressing in finding a vaccine.”NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had also criticized the timing of the bhumi pujan and said while the Maharashtra government’s priority is to handle the Covid crisis, some feel that the coronavirus pandemic will vanish by erecting the Ram Temple.The VHP hit back saying that the country and its life cannot be put on hold for an indefinite period. “Efforts are being made to resume normal life while taking precautions. The efforts to revive the economy, industry and services are urgently necessary and are being attempted. Similarly all social, religious and spiritual activities must go on,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-invitation-to-pm-modi-for-ram-temple-bhoomi-pujan-unwarranted-vhp/story-cn0vyeTLyOzBYZJr18lPdJ.html
20-07-2020||India||‘More concocted allegations coming’: Sachin Pilot after MLA’s bribe charge||Rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot said on Monday that he was “saddened but not surprised” and called the allegations against him of offering money to a party MLA to switch to BJP as “baseless”. The former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan said this was a clear attempt to undermine his reputation and take the focus away from the substantive issue he has raised against the party leadership of the state.“I am saddened but not surprised to be at the receiving end of such baseless and vexatious allegations being levelled against me. This is done solely to malign me and to stifle the legitimate concerns that I had raised against the party leadership of the state, as a member and MLA of INC. This attempt further aims at defaming me and attack my credibility,” said Sachin Pilot in a statement. Without disclosing the amount offered, Rajasthan Congress MLA Giriraj Singh Malinga said at the talks held at Pilot’s house he was offered money to switch allegiance to the BJP. The MLA said he subsequently told chief minister Ashok Gehlot about the plan. ALSO WATCH | Rajasthan audio tapes row: Congress demands Gajendra Shekhawat’s resignation “I had a talk with Sachinji. He offered me money to join the BJP, but I refused, saying I will not join the saffron party,” Malinga was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Pilot, sacked as deputy CM and president of the Rajasthan Congress unit last week, said more such lies are in the offing to tar his image.“I will be taking appropriate and strictest possible legal action against the MLA who was made to make these accusations. I am sure more such concocted allegations will be thrown at me to cause aspersions on my public image. But I shall be unfettered and remain firm in my beliefs and convictions,” said Pilot.The former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Badi, along with five other legislators of the Mayawati-led party, was inducted into the Congress in September last year. The lawmakers had handed over affidavits to state Assembly Speaker CP Joshi to merge the legislative party with the Congress.Earlier today, CM Gehlot again repeated his charge against his former deputy of being hand in glove with the BJP to destabilise his government. Taking a swipe at the young leader, the CM said who would have believed that a person with an “innocent face” will try and do such a thing. Pilot, who is categorical in his denial of the BJP, has repeatedly called all such accusations of him trying to dislodge the government a false charge. The simmering tension between the two leaders reached its apogee when Pilot was served summons to record his statement by the Rajasthan police’s special team probing an alleged conspiracy to topple the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saddened-but-not-surprised-sachin-pilot-denies-offering-money-to-mla/story-Y9kFbhAihRHhPFBRGhrVMM.html
20-07-2020||India||‘Local community transmission of Covid-19 cases likely happening in hotspots: AIIMS Director||Certain areas of the national capital have hit their peak in Covid-19 cases while certain other areas in the city are yet to reach the peak, said AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria on Monday. He further said that there is not much evidence of community transmission happening at the national level.“Certain areas have hit their peak in Covid-19 cases. Delhi seems to have done so because the cases have declined significantly. Certain areas have yet to reach the peak. Cases are increasing in certain states. They will reach the peak a little later,” Dr Guleria said here while addressing a press conference here.The national capital had witnessed a surge in the cases of novel coronavirus cases over the past one month. However, the number of active cases has seen a dip over the past few weeks.“But there are hotspots, even in cities where there is spike of cases and it very likely that local community transmission in those areas is happening,” he said.The Union Health Ministry said there are a total of 12,2793 Covid-19 cases in Delhi including 16,031 active cases and 3,628 deaths. Over one lakh people have been cured/discharged/migrated in the national capital.On Monday, India’s Covid-19 case tally crossed the 11 lakh mark with the highest single-day spike of 40,425 new cases and 681 deaths reported in the last 24 hours.Further, the AIIMS director said that the mortality rate in South East Asia, including India, is much lower than in European countries like Italy and Spain and even in the United States.“If you look at the data from Southeast Asia, not just India, the mortality rate is much lower than what happened in Italy and Spain or what is happening in the United States,” he said.Two days after announcing that All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) will conduct the human clinical trial of the indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin, Dr Guleria said that the trial will be conducted in three phases.“Phase 1 vaccine trial will be conducted on healthy people aged 18-55 years who have no co-morbidity. A total of 1125 samples have been collected of which 375 people will be studied in the first phase and 750 people between 12-65 years will be studied in the second phase,” said Guleria.“To test the efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccine a trial will be conducted under phase-3. The trail will be conducted in AIIMS,” he added.AIIMS Ethics Committee on Saturday gave its approval for conducting the human clinical trial of the indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin.The country’s top drug regulator had recently given a green signal for human clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin, which has been developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/likely-local-community-transmission-of-covid-19-cases-happening-in-hotspots-aiims-director/story-MzYY7JZi89bpeOLv9orvEL.html

It argued that the high court could not take up such a contempt petition at a time when the matter was pending before the apex court.It may be recalled that the Jagan government had, on April 10, removed Ramesh Kumar from the post of SEC through an ordinance reducing the tenure of the SEC from five to three years and appointed a retired judge in his place.Ramesh Kumar challenged the ordinance in the high court, which struck down the same on May 29. The state government moved the SC challenging the high court order and sought a stay, but the top court refused to grant the same.When the government refused to reinstate him as the SEC, the retired IAS officer filed a contempt petition last week. The high court asked him to approach the governor and posted the case to Friday for next hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-andhra-top-poll-officer-takes-reinstatement-plea-to-guv-jagan-moves-sc/story-uQPelyGkNFyFCbtfs3JXHO.html
20-07-2020||India||‘Phone tapping assault on freedom, bringing down elected govt with money treachery’: Sena on Rajasthan crisis||The Shiv Sena has called the phone-tapping order by the ruling Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan, which is caught in a bitter internal power struggle with the sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s faction of 19 rebel lawmakers, an assault on personal freedom and termed the attempt to bring down a democratically elected dispensation “unconstitutional”.Saamana, the Sena mouthpiece, carried an editorial on Monday that stated the jury is still out on which is a bigger crime – a state government order for phone tapping or a bid to topple a democratically elected government.The Gehlot government has claimed that there has been a concerted bid to dislodge the ruling dispensation following the surfacing of three audiotapes last Thursday evening that quickly went viral on social media.The Congress has accused Jodhpur Member of Parliament (MP) and Union Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat as the villain of the piece in cahoots with two dissident party lawmakers in an alleged plot to oust the Gehlot government. The tapes did make a reference to one Gajendra Singh, which bolstered the Congress, to accuse him of indulging in horse-trading.The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has sought a report from Rajasthan chief secretary over the alleged “illegal tapping of phones”. “Phone tapping is an offence and assault on personal freedom. It is treachery to bring down a democratically elected government by the lure of lucre. However, it needs to be decided which one is a bigger crime,” the editorial said.“There is nothing wrong if the MHA wants to probe the phone-tapping incident. But the key question is: if the Gehlot government has indeed eavesdropped the purported phone conversations, what state of emergency had erupted in the state or the country?” it asked.The Marathi daily made a play for the former Congress president Rahul Gandhi.It said several skeletons would tumble out of the cupboard, if the conversations among power-hungry Congress leaders became public and they reached Gandhi. It cited that the disputes within the Congress’s ranks are unending and a certain section within Gandhi’s party didn’t want him to succeed. “The Rajasthan phone-tapping episode has exposed many. But, a lot of revelation will come to the fore if someone hears the secret conversations among Congress leaders and they reach Gandhi. Some people have been hell-bent on not letting Gandhi work properly. This is hurting the entire opposition,” it said. The editorial said that Gehlot has foiled the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) plans amid the generational war between the Rajasthan CM and his challenger Pilot. “The deal, which was on between the BJP and Pilot, was about an exchange of cash for power. It was decided that the elected Rajasthan government would be brought down by horse-trading through cash inducements,” the editorial alleged.“CM Gehlot exposed Pilot’s rebellion, which was less against injustice, and brought to light by the phone conversations between the sacked deputy CM and BJP leaders. It is both shocking and sensational,” it further alleged.The editorial questioned the BJP’s radio silence over Shekhawat’s alleged role.“Why those who are seeking the President’s rule in Rajasthan have not made Shekhawat resign? First, make Shekhawat resign, atone for poaching of the lawmakers and then point a finger towards the Gehlot government,” the editorial said while adding that phone tapping is not restricted to Rajasthan alone.The Sena also took a potshot at ally-turned-rival BJP.“In the Rajasthan episode, the condition of the BJP is such that they set out to do something, but something contrary happened … games are being played these days to weaken opponents politically, socially and mentally by dislodging them from their governments (across states),” it signed off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bringing-down-elected-govt-with-money-is-treachery-says-shiv-sena-on-rajasthan-political-crisis/story-gjefpQ1GvW0cuLSkhx8AzL.html

20-07-2020||India||Customs grill gunman of UAE consular’s attaché in Kerala gold smuggling case||Customs sleuths probing the Kerala gold smuggling case on Monday questioned the gunman of United Arab Emirates (UAE) consular’s attaché who is recuperating in a hospital after an alleged suicide attempt on July 17, a top official said.He reportedly told them that though he escorted some consignments as directed by consulate officials he never had any idea about the content and he came to know about the concealed gold from media reports.But investigators feel he is an important link in the smuggling racket and the suicide attempt was a drama he enacted to divert attention. They said he will be questioned again after his discharge from the hospital.“Our investigation is proceeding well. Different agencies are involved. Those who are arrested by the customs will be booked under Customs Act sections 112 A, 112 B, 132 and 133. We will go after those who helped them in the offence. We will get to the bottom of the syndicate this time,” said Customs Commissioner in-charge of Kerala and Laksshdweep Sumit Kumar.The Customs had seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. Later the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) but many other central agencies are also involved in the probe. The NIA has arrested four persons and Customs 13 in the case so far.The smuggling racket has forced the Left-front government to sack two high-ranking officials - Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s powerful principal secretary M Sivasankar and his IT fellow Arun Balachandran, for their alleged links with some of the accused.The CPI (M) has called a meeting of staff members of all ministers on July 23 where it is expected to chalk out a strict code of conduct for them. Some parties in the ruling coalition feel that a free hand to some of the bureaucrats led to such a pass that dented the image of the government when assembly polls are just nine months away.Meanwhile state opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has written a letter to CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury drawing his attention to latest developments in the state.“We want to know whether the party condescends to the consultancy raj being promoted by CM Pinarayi Vijayan. Now the NIA is set to widen its scope of investigation including the CM’s office,” he said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-grill-gunman-of-uae-consular-s-attache-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case/story-4duQhGfACfJziwzXqFOM5M.html

20-07-2020||India||Youth accused of rape and murder of north Bengal student found dead, BJP alleges cover up||A day after the unnatural death of a 16-year-old school girl triggered clashes between police and local people in the Chopra area of North Dinajpur district in Bengal, the body of the suspect named in the police complaint by the girl’s family was found in a ditch on Monday morning.He lived in the same village. The girl’s death had prompted the Bharatiya Janata Party to target the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), The girl’s death also sparked clashes between the locals and the police on Sunday.The girl, who recently passed the class 10 state board exams, was raped and murdered as her family supports the BJP, the opposition party alleged on Sunday.The girl’s father made the same allegation in his police complaint on Sunday night after the West Bengal Police said that preliminary report of the post mortem examination pointed at death caused by poisoning and there was no sign of sexual assault.“The body of the youth named in the complaint has been found. An investigation is going on,” Binod Gazmer, inspector-in-charge of Chopra police station told HT on Monday afternoon.Tension was palpable in the area since the girl and the youth belonged to different religious communities. Anticipating trouble, the police stopped a team of senior BJP state leaders and members of the Lok Sabha from visiting the village.“The youth’s body was spotted submerged in water with his face jutting out of the water. It was seen not far from where the girl was found. Most of the youth’s face had turned red. Only post mortem examination can confirm the cause of death,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity. TMC district president Kanaia Lal Agarwal claimed the girl and the youth died by suicide.“The girl and the youth knew each other and went to the same private tutor. They probably committed suicide as they felt that their families might not accept their relationship,” Agarwal said.The girl’s father dismissed Agarwal’s statement and stuck to what he said in his police complaint. He alleged that his daughter was regularly harassed by the youth and he raped and murdered her. The BJP has alleged there was an attempt to cover up the girl’s death.Surajit Sen, vice president of the BJP’s North Dinajpur unit, said, “The TMC and the police are trying to project the deaths as a tragic end to an affair.”Members of the youth’s family did not speak to the media till Monday afternoon.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh alleged that the police engineered Sunday’s arson and set fire to their own vehicles to divert attention. BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha alleged that the incident proved that law and order in the state has collapsed.The West Bengal Police said on Twitter on Monday afternoon that the body of the youth had been sent for post mortem examination and the process would be videographed. The tweets made it apparent that the girl and the youth knew each other and might have been under pressure from their families to snap ties. “Police is investigating both the cases and looking into all possible aspects of the incident including social ostracism, parental pressure and role played by some persons in hiding, misleading and diverting the attention from the actual incident,” the police said in one of the tweets. Earlier in the day, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar also waded into the incident before leaving for Delhi.“Would be discussing with Union Home Minister at noon today West Bengal worrisome situation….,” he tweeted before leaving Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youth-accused-of-rape-and-murder-of-north-bengal-student-found-dead-bjp-alleges-cover-up/story-gBQB1ZZxhOo0lLkEihLHxH.html
20-07-2020||India||HC asks Maharashtra, NIA to respond to plea by Gonsalves and Teltumbde to be tested for Covid-19||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday asked the Maharashtra government and National Investigation Agency (NIA) to respond to a petition filed by activists Vernon Gonsalves and Dr. Anand Teltumbde, who are lodged in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Jail in connection with 2018 Elgar Parishad/Bhima Koregaon case, seeking directions to authorities to make the undertrials undergo coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests.The activists are booked under the stringent The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act (UAPAA), 2019, for their alleged links with the outlawed Communist Party of India (CPI) (Maoist) and for organsing the Elgar Parishad event.They sought to undergo the Covid-19 tests, as they were in close touch with Telugu poet and social activist and a fellow accused in the case, P Varavara Rao (81), who was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, at Sir JJ Hospital on July 16. They stated in their plea that they want to undergo Covid-19 tests for their own safety and that of other inmates.Gonsalves was in close touch with Rao, as he was assigned to take care of him because of his failing health condition. The plea was moved after Rao tested Covid-19 positive.The plea also made a case for Dr. Teltumbde to undergo the Covid-19 test because he, too, was admitted to Sir JJ Hospital.Gonsalves is suffering from multiple health issues, including hypertension. While Dr. Teltumbde has a host of chronic health conditions such as bronchitis asthma, cervical spondylitis, supraspinatus tendinosis and he is susceptible to Covid-19.A two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices SS Shinde and SP Tavade, while hearing the application of Gonsalves and Dr. Teltumbde was informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai that the accused were not seeking interim bail but only asking for permission to get themselves tested for Covid-19, as they were in touch with an infected Rao.The petition, filed through advocate Devyanii Kulkarni, said both the accused are suffering from multiple health issues and they are apprehensive that they might have contracted SARS-CoV-2 from Rao.Additional Solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for NIA, submitted that the investigating agency did not have any objection, if the request was granted, but it had to be done as per the norms laid down by various court orders passed previously.He, however, sought time to take instructions in this regard. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, who represented the Maharashtra government, also sought time for similar instructions.Initially, the bench remarked that the request of the petitioners could be easily complied with, but later it sought to know whether they would be willing to be confined in isolation centres, if they test Covid-19 positive.The court said it would not pass any order and issued notices to the state government and NIA to respond to the plea by Thursday, when the case will be heard next.NIA had taken over the Elgar Parishad case from Pune Police in February.Earlier, on January 1, 2018, violence erupted between Dalits and Marathas near the village of Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, where thousands of Dalits had gathered to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon.In the battle, the British Army’s Dalit Mahar soldiers had defeated the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire.The commemoration took place a day after an event in Pune called the Elgar Parishad was held.The Pune Police conducted a preliminary probe and claimed that the violence in Bhima Koregaon was the result of speeches made at the Elgar Parishad event.They alleged that banned Maoist groups organised the event, and a first information report (FIR) was also filed.In June 2018, the Pune Police arrested five activists and lawyers from Pune, Nagpur, and Delhi – Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, and Shoma Sen – for their alleged links to the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), and also for organising the Elgar Parishad event.In August 2018, the police arrested four more activists –Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira, Gonsalves, and Rao.While Gautam Navlakha and Dr. Teltumbde were arrested on April 14 this year, taking the total number of the accused in the case to 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-maharashtra-nia-to-respond-to-plea-by-gonsalves-and-teltumbde-to-be-tested-for-covid/story-26gZtjuO5EZh5bFM0xtS6N.html

Without naming Pilot, he said some of the young leaders think “they are superior to the high command”.“I’ve always followed the directions of the high command, not just on this issue but on each and every issue. Regarding this matter, all directions will be followed. The ideology and thinking of leaders of my generation has always been to make our party strong. (But a) few young people think their personal interests are bigger than those of the party; that they are superior to the high command. That’s why problems of such kind occur. I believe the party should strictly follow whatever the high command decides for the betterment of the country and the party,” Gehlot said.He also denied that his government furnished any tape and the audio clips in question about purported conversation between Congress MLAs and BJP leaders had already gone viral on social media. “But I know that they (BJP) had been planning to topple the government for at least the last six months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-young-leaders-think-they-are-superior-to-high-command-says-ashok-gehlot/story-cBVXrtqCOjWUPSgiNaKUvI.html
20-07-2020||India||Will see if political social distancing is done: Sena on Ram Mandir bhoomi pujan||Barely days after the date for the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Ram Temple in Ayodhya was finalised, the Shiv Sena said that it will see if “political social distancing” is followed in invitations to various people, including Shiv Sena president and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the Sena chief does not need an invitation to visit Ayodhya.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Ayodhya for the bhoomi pujan ceremony of the Ram Mandir on August 5. Following that there were speculations if Thackeray, whose party has been at the forefront of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement since the late 1980s, would be invited.BJP and Shiv Sena stitched the political alliance in the backdrop of the movement and Hindutva ideology in Maharashtra in 1989. The former allies, BJP and Sena, parted ways late last year after the latter formed a government in Maharashtra with the support of the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party.“I have heard through the media that the date for the ceremony has been decided. The Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas (Trust) has given an invitation to the prime minister. So he will go to Ayodhya on this occasion, we regularly keep going to Ayodhya. They will decide on the invitation, how many people to call, how to maintain social distancing. It is also to be seen if they follow political ‘social distancing’,” Raut said in an apparent jibe at the BJP. He added that the Sena chief has been visiting Ayodhya regularly even before he became the chief minister and will continue to do so.The senior Sena leader added that the party has “paved the way” for the construction of the Ram Temple and it was instrumental in removing “obstacles” for it. “Shiv Sena has a connection with Ayodhya and it will remain eternally. It is not a political connection. Shiv Sena has never gone to Ayodhya for political gains. The road for Ram Mandir was paved by the Shiv Sena. The obstacles to building the Ram Mandir were cleared by the Shiv Sena not for politics, but because of [our] faith and for Hindutva,” he said speaking to reporters in Mumbai.On Sunday, South Mumbai MP and former union minister Arvind Sawant said that the Sena does not bother about an invitation to visit Ayodhya. He added that Thackeray during his last visit donated Rs 5 crore on behalf of the party to the temple trust for the construction of the Ram Mandir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-see-if-political-social-distancing-is-done-sanjay-raut-on-ram-mandir-bhoomi-pujan/story-kBfNk72kDqvSg2cQ7NW4HN.html
20-07-2020||India||Pilot camp is so much hand in glove with the BJP that I doubt they’d come back: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday told reporters that his former deputy Sachin Pilot was acting on behalf of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and was given money, “backed by corporate houses from Mumbai”, to bring down the Rajasthan government. He said he was an elected CM, “not a vegetable-seller”, indicating that he was aware of the alleged controversy for months. Hours before making these comments, he spoke to Vinod Sharma about the thinking in the party, the tapes alleging a BJP hand in the alleged move to topple the government, and the position in the state assembly. Edited excerpts:Are you on the same page as the party high command on Sachin Pilot -- you have accused him of a conspiracy to dislodge your government, but the central leadership seems willing to call a truce if he retraces his steps?I’ve always followed the directions of the high command, not just on this issue but on each and every issue. Regarding this matter, all directions will be followed. The ideology and thinking of leaders of my generation has always been to make our party strong. (But a) few young people think their personal interests are bigger than those of the party; that they are superior to the high command. That’s why problems of such kind occur. I believe the party should strictly follow whatever the high command decides for the betterment of the country and the party.Also read| ‘Who knew person with such innocent face will…’: CM Gehlot roasts Sachin PilotYou have furnished recorded tapes to prove his supporters’ attempts to topple your government. When did you come to know about it? What is the high command’s view on that?I want to clarify that we have not furnished any tape. These audio clips had already gone viral on social media. We also got it on social media. The person who looks after our media sent it to the media to expose the lies of the BJP and its allies. But I know that they had been planning to topple the government for at least the last six months. That’s why at the time of Rajya Sabha elections we had to move [MLAs] to a hotel for 10 days. Had we not done so at that time, what’s happening today would have then happened. Few of them (rebels) had a plan to leave at 2am on June 10 - the day before the death anniversary of late Rajesh Pilot. The rest of them were planning to leave after paying tributes to him at Dausa. I got this information at midnight. I talked to district collectors, spoke to my MLAs and asked them to come to Jaipur. I did not feel good putting up our legislators at a hotel. It was done to save democracy and our government. Their plan ended in failure.ALSO WATCH | ‘With an innocent face...’: CM Ashok Gehlot’s fresh attack on Sachin Pilot Several young Congress leaders have expressed support for Pilot. Why is Gen-X feeling restive? Is it that they don’t see any future in the Congress?People who talk of a ‘Congress-mukt Bharat’ should stop dreaming. Every Congress person who has faith in the party’s leadership and its ideology and policies -- and who can work giving priority to the party rather than self-interests – has a bright future in the Congress. Those who rise from frontal organisations such as the NSUI {National Students’ Union of India) , Youth Congress, Seva Dal, Mahila Congress and have worked at grassroots level cannot feel restive. They know if they’re working hard, with honesty and diligence, the party will look after them; that ample opportunities will come their way. I’m an example of it. I worked in NSUI, was elected as an MP at the age of 28 and became a minister when I was 29. I was PCC {Pradesh Congress Committee} president three times, a central minister three times, and also a party general secretary three times. Now I’m chief minister for the third time with the support and blessings of the people. I want to tell our young leaders that we, too, got chances when we were young but we never thought of disrespecting our seniors and the party leadership. We never promoted groupism or factionalism. I was already three-time president of the state unit when I became CM the first time. Young leaders should have a little patience. The party will give them many opportunities to take their political careers forward.Also read: Check authenticity first: Shekhawat after police notice over audio clipsHave Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi Vadra spoken to you on the prevailing crisis? They appear keen on retaining Pilot in the party -- if that happens, will you restore his position in your government?I’m in touch with the leadership. Any decision taken by the high command in this or any other issue will be followed. But I’d like to add that they (Pilot camp) are so much hand in glove with the BJP that I doubt that they’d come back. In the forthcoming days, you will get to see that. They’re sitting in a BJP-ruled state and enjoying their hospitality. The BJP government [in Haryana] is providing them police protection; its leaders are giving statements in their favour. What more evidence does one need to see that they’re in alliance with the BJP.The Pilot camp alleges that your desire to promote your son Vaibhav (who lost from Jodhpur to the BJP’s Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections) prompted you to marginalise your deputy CM and his supporters.That’s totally absurd. I never placed my own or my son’s interests above the party. Shekhawat is a big face in the Rajasthan BJP. They wanted to make him the state BJP president, but it didn’t happen because of their internal conflict. He’s very close to Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and the RSS {Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh}. Vaibhav’s name came up because there was widespread sentiment that only he could give Shekhawat a good fight in Jodhpur. Had he not fought, it would’ve sent out the wrong message that the Congress wasn’t giving the BJP a tough fight in the CM’s home district. I have never promoted Vaibhav in politics. During the Youth Congress elections, he ran a membership drive and wanted to fight elections. I discouraged him because I was the CM then. In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the AICC committee for ticket distribution recommended Vaibhav’s name for the Tonk-Sawai Madhopur seat. I was again the CM and I suggested that Namo Narain Meena, who was a central minister at the time, had the first right to fight from there. He later contested and won the seat. In 2019, Vaibhav was considered for two-three safer seats where the result could have been different. But the party fielded him from Jodhpur to send a message.Also read: In Gehlot vs Pilot, Congress backs regional leadershipIs it true that Rahul Gandhi brokered a pact in 2018 that Pilot would succeed you as CM before the assembly’s term ends in 2023?In my whole political career, I’ve never heard the leadership promising a post to any leader in future. It was the Pilot lobby’s campaign for the last five years that the high command has promised them the CM’s office. That’s how they promoted groupism and put self-interest above the party’s interest. They’re totally exposed now. He (Pilot) is saying so to gain sympathy and to tarnish the leadership’s image.Can you give the exact number of legislators whose support you have in the assembly?You’ll get to know the exact number when we win the floor test by a thumping majority. This time, every MLA will hear the voice of his conscience and vote. Rajasthan is facing a major crisis of lives and livelihood. In such adverse times, our government has done commendable work. I’ve done 21 hours of video conferencing with all MLAs and MPs representing the state. We got positive feedback across party lines. It’s unfortunate that amid the coronavirus pandemic, BJP is doing horse-trading and trying to topple our government as they did in Madhya Pradesh. People are not supporting them in MP and the people will not support them in Rajasthan.How optimistic are you of sustaining in power for the remaining tenure of the assembly?We will definitely complete our tenure. We have already started preparing for the 2023 polls which I am sure we will win.What is your reaction to the BJP ally, Hanuman Beniwal’s claim that you were helped by Vasundhara Raje in preventing desertions of some Jat legislators?I have never compromised with my party’s ideology. To say that I’m getting support from someone (in BJP) is totally false. Everyone knows about Beniwal’s habit of saying anything about anyone. He has been speaking against Vasundhara Raje for the last 15 years; he’s doing so now to get the blessings of the Modi-Shah duo.How strong is your evidence against Shekhawat in the alleged plot to topple your regime? He has denied playing any role and has questioned the genuineness of the tapes.Anyone who commits a crime does not accept it and tends to deny. As for evidence against Shekhawat or others, including Bhanwar Lal Sharma, who earlier attempted to topple five governments – it’ll be better to ask the SOG {special operations group of Rajasthan Police} or other investigating agencies. The matter is under probe. It’s not appropriate for me to comment at this stage. I believe that truth will prevail.(With inputs from Aurangzeb Naqshbandi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-camp-is-so-much-hand-in-glove-with-the-bjp-that-i-doubt-they-d-come-back-ashok-gehlot/story-62fkQYrnADLXsZzB13wt1M.html

20-07-2020||India||BJP chief JP Nadda accuses Rahul Gandhi of indulging in mudslinging||Training his guns on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda said on Monday his allegations against the Union government are “weak on facts and strong on mudslinging”.In a series of tweets, Nadda said the former Congress president prefers to believe the Chinese army over his own government.“We saw yet another (failed) edition of ‘Project RG Relaunch’ today. @RahulGandhi Ji was, as usual, weak on facts and strong on mudslinging. Attempts to politicise defence and foreign policy matters shows one dynasty’s desperation to wash their past sins of 1962 and weaken India,” Nadda tweeted.His comments came in the wake of Gandhi’s second video on the India-China border standoff, in which he said the Chinese are attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image as they understand that for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of his image.Gandhi also said that if Modi “allowed the Chinese to understand that they can manipulate him because of his image, the prime minister will no longer be worth anything for India”.Reacting to the attack on Modi, Nadda tweeted: “In recent years, be it Doklam or the present, @RahulGandhi Ji prefers briefings from the Chinese instead of believing India’s armed forces. Why does one dynasty want a weak India and a strong China? Many leaders in Congress also disapprove of one dynasty’s shenanigans!”Nadda criticised the Gandhi scion by saying that just as he had tried to allege wrong-doing in the deal for the Rafale combat jets, he was again trying to create a wrong impression about China.He also made a reference to donations received by the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation from the Chinese embassy.“Since the 1950s, China has made strategic investments in one dynasty that has given them rich dividends. Remember 1962, giving away of a UNSC seat, losing lot of land to China in the UPA years, MoU signed with much fanfare in 2008, funds to RGF and more,” Nadda said in another tweet.The BJP and the Congress have been engaged in a verbal duel over the India- China face-off. While the Congress has accused the BJP-led central government of not being transparent about the developments in Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the BJP has retorted by accusing the Congress of lowering the morale of the army and politicising a critical national security issue.“For years, one dynasty has been trying to destroy PM @narendramodi. Sadly for them, PM Modi’s connect with 130 crore Indians is deep-rooted. He lives and works for them. Those who want to destroy him will end up only further destroying their own party,” Nadda said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-accuses-rahul-gandhi-of-indulging-in-mudslinging/story-SIewhJy9H8g61Z2lmP9NyN.html
20-07-2020||India||‘Who knew person with such innocent face will…’: CM Gehlot roasts Sachin Pilot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot turned the heat on his former deputy Sachin Pilot on Monday when he criticised the rebel leader with an “innocent face” for trying to dislodge his government. Gehlot, who in an interview to a TV channel admitted that he was not on speaking terms with his former No 2 for last 18 months, accused Pilot of working in cahoots with the BJP to bring down his government. “He (Sachin Pilot) was conspiring from past six months with BJP’s support. Nobody believed me when I used to say that conspiracy is going on to topple the government. Nobody knew that a person with such an innocent face would do such a thing. I’m not here to sell vegetables, I am the CM,” Gehlot was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Watch l ‘With an innocent face...’: CM Ashok Gehlot’s fresh attack on Sachin Pilot Last week, Gehlot had taken a swipe at Pilot telling mediapersons that “speaking good English, giving good television bytes and being handsome” was not everything in politics. Pilot, who has ruled out joining the BJP, was sacked as deputy chief minister and pradesh Congress committee chief last week over his failure to attend the two Congress legislature party meetings and leading a rebellion against the CM. The 42-year-old leader and his MLAs supporting him have been served a notice by the assembly speaker. They have appealed against the speaker’s notice in the Rajasthan high court. Even though the party has made repeated efforts to reach out to Pilot, credited with leading the Congress’s successful 2018 assembly campaign, CM Gehlot has been taking hits at the rebel leader, accusing him, repeatedly, of trying to topple the government. Contrasting the situation of his MLAs with those in team Pilot, the CM alleged that the latter were held against their wishes and have been calling him. Earlier today, a video surfaced where Gehlot and his MLAs at the resort were seen singing “hum honge kamyab (We shall overcome)”.“Our MLAs are staying without any restrictions but they have held their’s (MLAs) captive. They are calling us and crying over phone while explaining their ordeal. Their personal mobile phones have been snatched. Some of them want to join us,” said CM Gehlot.On Sunday, Congress’s Rajasthan in-charge Avinash Pande said the party would decide on “merit” whether to allow some rebel MLAs back into the Congress fold. Over the weekend, the two MLA of a regional outfit pledged support to the Gehlot government and submitted letters of support to the CM.Sachin Pilot, when the drama began, claimed the support of 30 MLAs, however that number now stands at 18. On the other hand, Gehlot claims the support of over 100 MLAs. In the 200-member assembly, 101 is the majority mark. With 72 MLAs, the BJP has been watching the developments from the sidelines. Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who is named in the conspiracy to topple the state government after audiotapes appeared to give the impression that he was one of the parties in the alleged discussion to destabilise the government, said he ready to face an investigation but the police should first check the authenticity of the audio clips.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-knew-person-with-such-innocent-will-cm-gehlot-roasts-sachin-pilot/story-cFPBvTt1RrAq8jcf4dvt5H.html
20-07-2020||India||Air India’s pilot association says change in wage settlement is illegal||Air India’s pilot association informed the national carrier’s management on Monday that changes in wage settlement would be illegal and such a situation has the “potential to [flare up] to an unprecedented magnitude”.This comes days after Air India approved a leave without pay (LWP) scheme for permanent employees for a period of six months to two years, extendable up to five years,“Any unilateral change by Air India from agreed upon wage settlement would be illegal and will not be in the interest of our National Carrier at this crucial juncture. Such a situation has the potential to [falre up] to an unprecedented magnitude,” the Indian Commercial Pilot Association (ICPA) wrote in a letter addressed to Air India chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal, a copy of which was reviewed by Hindustan Times.“In the interest of the company and due to the Covid scenario, ICPA supports temporary austerity measures at all fronts, only if such a restructuring is done in true spirit of the Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. Flying allowance and flying related allowances constitute 70% of our wages. These allowances remain unpaid since April 2020,” the letter said.“Furthermore, all the wages are being paid with constant delays. The proposal was verbally explained to us without any written true copy...the management cannot and should not unilaterally implement any restructured wage,” it added.In a statement issued on Friday, the airline had said: “Air India is in a very challenging financial situation and is taking recourse to several initiatives with a view to ensuring the continuance of its operations.”It added, “Air India has introduced the Leave Without Pay (LWP) Scheme on July 14, 2020. The scheme primarily enables employees to avail the benefits of proceeding on leave without pay on VOLUNTARY basis. The LWP scheme has been introduced for grant of leave without pay and allowances for permanent employees for a period of six months/two years, which is extendable up to 5 years.”Air India had introduced a similar LWP scheme in September 1998, June 2009 and August 2009. Several hundred employees have in the past availed of LWP, the letter said.The pilot’s body said no negotiations had been held by the management with pilots.“In the press conference by Hon’ble Minister Shri Hardeep Singh Puri dated 16th July 2020, you had stated ‘we are in negotiation with the pilots’, which is far from reality. It was not a negotiation, but the diktat of MoCA which was conveyed to us. We would also like to place on record that the so-called negotiation was ‘not harmonious’ in any aspect,” the ICPA letter alleged.At a news conference on Thursday, Bansal had said the national carrier is working on four fronts to reduce costs by reducing debt, cutting on lease rentals, trimming staff costs and reducing operating costs.“We are trying to increase the topline, and are trying to contain costs,” Bansal said at a news conference along with civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri. “We have cut down staff cost, we have laid off employees working with us post-retirement and we are in negotiations with pilots, cabin crew and other employee categories.”Puri had said airlines across the world are implementing cost cutting measures.The cost cutting drive dovetails with a government plan to sell its stake in Air India amid increasing debt and mounting losses. The Centre started the process in January by releasing an information document for investors and offering access to financial and other data of Air India and its subsidiaries.The government’s stake in Air India, its 100% stake in low-cost subsidiary Air India Express Ltd and 50% stake in ground handling unit Air India SATS Airport Services are on offer.An attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw bids. The airline’s accumulated debt is estimated to be more than Rs 69,000 crore. It posted a loss of Rs 8,556 crore in fiscal 2018-19, against a net loss of Rs 5,348 crore in the previous fiscal.When contacted by HT on Monday, an Air India spokesperson said: “We wouldn’t like to make any comment on these internal issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-s-pilot-association-says-change-in-wage-settlement-is-illegal/story-GQNYdKO9HbS4ToUbs1IKON.html

Villagers suspected the couple of practising witchcraft after about half a dozen people of Nimapali died due to different causes over the last two weeks. The couple was killed in the blaze.Tipu Buliuli, brother-in-law of Basanti said they were not on good terms with other villagers over some reasons. “The villagers used to falsely accuse them of practicing witchcraft,” said Buliuli. Jajpur’s Superintendent of Police Charan Singh Meena said the circumstances under which the couple died are being ascertained. “We have seized the burnt bodies of the couple and sent them to the hospital for postmortem. We are looking into the allegation of the couple being killed over suspicion of sorcery,” he said.This is second such witchcraft-related murder in Jajpur district this month. A few days ago, a woman was also murdered on suspicion of practicing witchcraft.In another incident on Sunday, a woman was admitted to the district headquarters hospital in Malkangiri with burn injuries on her face after a witchdoctor branded her face with hot iron to cast off an evil spirit.Lipika Orao, a resident of MV-6 village under Malkangiri block in the district had been sick for about a week following which locals suspected that she was possessed by an evil spirit. They called for a witch doctor who thrashed the woman, branded her face with hot iron and fed her pig excreta as part of the treatment. The women’s condition turned serious after which they called an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) worker.ASHA worker Laxmi Munda who admitted the victim to the Malkangiri district headquarters hospital said Orao’s condition was critical. “She was already sick before the witch doctor applied his bizarre treatment. The feeding of excreta and beating has turned her health condition critical,” said Munda.The witch doctor is said to be a relative of the woman.“The witch doctor has been arrested,” Malkangiri’s Superintendent of Police Khilari Rishikesh Dnyandeo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elderly-couple-burnt-to-death-in-another-witch-hunt-in-odisha/story-W6N2cDiKunu7vwS4EzEfrJ.html

Beijing also wanted Japan to cancel the resolution passed by the Ishigaki city assembly last month to change the name of the southern Japan area from Tonoshiro to Tonoshiro Senkaku. Japan, as expected, has told off China.Beijing’s latest complaint to Tokyo falls into a pattern and is part of its tactic to push the envelope with its neighbours - one step at a time. In the East China Sea, the demarche was designed to build its claim over the archipelago that includes five uninhabited islands and three barren rocks spread across 7 sq km. It wasn’t just the presence of Japanese military around the islands east of the Chinese mainland that Beijing was going to object to but fishing boats too.Also Read: Donald Trump spotted a pattern in China’s standoff with India. Here are 21 reasonsTo be sure, China has been attempting to expand its territories over the last two decades but it has only been after the latest round of steps, or mis-steps that Beijing has been called out for bullying its neighbours, first by the United States. For instance, it has been laying the ground for the Ladakh adventure nearly 20 years ago.ALSO WATCH | Indian Americans protest in Washington; massive anti-China protest in TorontoFactsAccording to the western sector maps shared by India and China in 2002 on their respective claim line, there are 12 areas of differences in perception of the Line of Actual Control.

But the Chinese side declined to exchange these maps that would have formalised their claims and perception about the LAC. China hadn’t, for example, made claims over Gogra, or the fingers overlooking the Pangong lake.Over the next 18 years, China has been attempting to nibble away territories that it claimed as its own, and the ones that it traditionally hadn’t. Like parts of Galwan valley that China has discovered can be strategically useful after India scaled up its border infrastructure and brought the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie close to the LAC.Indian officials concede that there had been this lurking suspicion about China for years. But there was a belief within Indian diplomatic and military community that with close interaction over the years, the mindset of Han Chinese would change. “This has been a singular big mistake,” a senior official said.But the Indian government isn’t the only one to have gone wrong with its assessment of China.Also Read: US carrier Nimitz to conduct exercise with Indian Navy en route to Middle EastSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has conceded that consecutive US administrations had gone horribly wrong with their policy that deepening ties with China could help democratize the country and the Trump administration was fixing this policy approach.US Attorney General William Barr expanded on the administration’s approach last week, warning US business and academia that China means to co-opt, destroy and eventually replace them altogether.The Trump administration has increasingly been focused on China bullying countries in the region, right from India and Japan to the smaller Southeast Asian countries.China claims almost the entire South China Sea and the islands and reefs that dot it.

Attempts to politicise defence and foreign policy matters shows one dynasty’s desperation to wash their past sins of 1962 and weaken India,” Nadda said in his first tweet.China, he said, has made strategic investments in “one dynasty that has given them rich dividends” since the 1950s in an apparent attack on the Congress’ first family.“Remember 1962, giving away of a UNSC seat, losing lot of land to China in the UPA years, MoU Signed with much fanfare in 2008, funds to RGF and more,” he posted the list.“In recent years, be it Doklam or the present, @RahulGandhi Ji prefers briefings from the Chinese instead of believing India’s armed forces. Why does one dynasty want a weak India and a strong China? Many leaders in Congress also disapprove of one dynasty’s shenanigans!” he posted.The senior BJP leader went on to accuse that “one dynasty” has been trying to destroy PM Modi for years. “Sadly for them, PM Modi’s connect with 130 crore Indians is deep-rooted. He lives and works for them. Those who want to destroy him will end up only further destroying their own party,” he said.The Congress has targeted the Prime Minister since the June 15 clash in the eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Vallery in which 20 Indian Army soldiers were killed, accusing him of giving away Indian territory to China.The attack has mostly been led by Rahul Gandhi and the verbal duel has been on since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weak-on-facts-strong-on-mudslinging-jp-nadda-handles-rahul-gandhi-s-video-attack/story-svo3ColSdfL12ZqnOov6NJ.html
20-07-2020||India||Chhattisgarh govt wants withdrawal of ordinance on farm produce trade||Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has joined his counterpart in Punjab and has drawn Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attention to the farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, promulgated on June 5.He has stated in a letter to the PM that the ordinance is against the agrarian community’s interest and has pleaded for its withdrawal at the earliest.On Sunday, the CM wrote to the PM, claiming the ordinance would reduce employment opportunities and is at odds with the country’s federal structure and the welfare state model.The CM said that Chhattisgarh is an agriculture-dependent state and 70% of its population is engaged in farming and allied activities.Baghel stated that significant progress has been made in the production of paddy, maize, sugarcane, and soybean through the advanced technology, quality seeds, and various schemes of the state government that sought to safeguard farmers’ interest.The state primarily grows paddy, which is procured by Chhattisgarh State Cooperative Marketing Limited in Raipur, on behalf of the Central government-run Food Corporation of India (FCI), at a minimum support price (MSP).Chhattisgarh supplies locally-produced usna (parboiled) rice, which helped the country successfully combat the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, the CM said.He pointed out that the ordinance allows farmers and traders to buy and sell farm produce outside mandi premises, exemption on a fee on the sale of notified agricultural produce, and transactions can also be made by those who don’t even have a licence and a Permanent Account Number (PAN).Baghel joined the issue for a uniform rule, citing that “different types of agricultural produces are produced in various parts of our country, where marketing practices are influenced by the corresponding nature and conditions of the farmers, whose interests are safeguarded under the Mandi Act”.He batted for farmers and said that farm folks are at the mercy of market forces.“The efforts to increase agricultural production are meaningless and unprofitable until the marketing of agricultural produce at a reasonable price can be ensured in the interest of farmers. The Mandi Act has been implemented in a bid to achieve this objective. The Act is periodically amended by the Central government to include single registration, online trading, private mandi premises, direct purchase, single-point market fee, and marketing of livestock. The mechanism seeks to enforce a transparent and competitive system in the private and public sector,” he stated in the letter.Baghel cited that the Mandi Act is rational in its present form. However, if any modification is required, the state government is equipped and open to such a suggestion, he added.The CM warned that the ordinance seeks to make the Mandi Act ineffective and lakhs of farmers in the unorganised sector would be at the mercy of unbridled market forces amid the adverse economic impact of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.At present, the Mandi Act stipulates that a farmer can sell his agricultural produce anywhere outside or inside his native state without paying any market fee.But the ordinance aims to do away with the existing mechanism, much to the dismay of hapless farmers, Baghel added while pointing out the cascading effect such as joblessness to hamals (porters), tulais (those who are engaged in weighing the farm produce) and many others indirectly connected to the mandis, including officials and employees, which don’t augur well for a welfare state like India, the letter stated.He also urged the PM to take note of the proposed closure of an open auction bid at a mandi -- an electronic tender process -- that seeks to ensure competitive price mechanism for agricultural produces that could immensely harm farmers’ commercial interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-govt-wants-withdrawal-of-ordinance-on-farm-produce-trade/story-sHV7pyhEc91BooquYMOyOK.html

Called “Passex” in naval parlance, the basic manoeuvre comes at a time when Indian and China are locked in a tense border confrontation in Ladakh, people familiar with the developments said on Monday. The drills also come amidst mounting tensions in the South China Sea where the US Navy just conducted a major exercise involving USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan. “The Passex is nowhere near Andamans and Nicobar Islands. It is en route to the Gulf Region,” said a senior government official. The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group is transiting through IOR.

20-07-2020||India||Check their authenticity first: Gajendra Singh Shekhawat after police notice over audio clips||Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat reiterated on Monday he is ready to face an investigation but the police should first check the authenticity of the audio clips, which the Congress alleges has his voice during a conversation discussing a plot to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led Rajasthan government.Rajasthan police’s special operations group (SOG) has served a notice to Union minister for Jal Shakti for his alleged bid to destabilise the state government and directed him to record his statement.Shekhawat confirmed he has received the notice through his personal secretary.“In the notice, they have asked me to record my statement and voice sample,” he said.The Bharatiya Janata Party’s parliamentarian from Jodhpur said his “doors are always open for any kind of inquiry” but the police must find out the details.“I first want them to check the authenticity of the audio clips. With whose permission was it recorded? Who recorded it? First, they should come out with its authenticity,” Gajendra Singh Shekhawat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The SOG had registered two separate first information reports (FIRs) on Friday after Congress’ chief whip in the Rajasthan assembly Mahesh Joshi lodged a complaint about three audiotapes that had surfaced the previous evening and quickly went viral on social media.The leaked audiotapes purportedly have conversations between a rebel Congress legislator and others, including a Gajendra Singh, who could be heard discussing strategies to bring down the Gehlot-led government.The FIRs had identified the rebel Congress legislator from Sardarshahar, Bhanwar Lal Sharma, who has since been suspended by the party, and Sanjay Jain, a networker and known for his proximity to politicians cutting across party lines and also the bureaucracy.Jain was arrested by the SOG on Friday night and is being interrogated.The persons named in the FIR have been booked under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code, Rathore said.Shekhawat and Sharma had issued separate statements and denied the charges levelled against them and termed the audiotapes as “fake” and blamed chief minister Gehlot for the trump-up charges.“The voice on the audiotapes is not mine. I am ready to face any investigation,” Shekhawat had said last week.The Congress, on its part, has demanded Shekhawat’s resignation, reiterating its allegation that he is involved in a plot to topple the state government.Shekhawat has no moral authority to continue in office and he should resign to ensure that the probe is not influenced, Congress leader Ajay Maken said on Sunday.Ashok Gehlot is locked in a power tussle with former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who has the backing of 18 Congress legislators and three Independents. These MLAs are believed to be camping in a resort in Gurugram, while those in the Gehlot camp have been lodged in a luxury hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/check-their-authenticity-first-gajendra-singh-shekhawat-after-police-notice-over-audio-clips/story-im4QlQQP2dwIE37osExRcI.html
20-07-2020||India||Air India Pilots’ Association says not consulted on leave without pay scheme||The Air India’s Pilot Association (ICPA) has written to the national carrier complaining that the leave without pay scheme, which Air India calls a ‘win-win’ for both’, was finalised without consulting the pilots.“In the press conference by Hardeep Singh Puri dated July 16, you had stated “we are in negotiation with the pilots” which is far from reality. It was not a negotiation, but the diktat of MoCA which was conveyed to us. We would also like to place on record that the so called negotiation was ‘not harmonious’ in any aspect,” the letter by the Indian Commercial Pilot Association alleged.In an order last week, Air India said it has begun the process of sending some employees on leave without pay ranging from six months or two years that can also be extended up to five years. The scheme is applicable to permanent employees of the company.Defending the arrangement, Air India had said it will give the employees freedom to engage themselves with another employer for the said period, the airline too will be able to save its cash flow on the other hand.In an earlier statement, the airline said that in a challenging financial situation, it is taking recourse to several initiatives with a view to ensure that its flight operations continue.The cost-cutting drive dovetails with a government plan to sell its entire stake in Air India amid increasing debt and mounting losses. The Centre, in January, started the process by releasing an information document for investors and offering access to financial and other data of Air India and its subsidiaries.The government’s entire stake in Air India, its 100% stake in low-cost subsidiary Air India Express Ltd. and 50% stake in ground handling unit Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited. are on offer.An attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw any bids. The airline’s accumulated debt is estimated to be more than Rs 69,000 crore. It posted a loss of Rs 8,556 crore in financial year 2018-19, as against a net loss of Rs 5,348 crore in the previous financial year.When contacted by HT on Monday a spokesperson for Air India said, “We wouldn’t like to make any comment on these internal issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilots-association-writes-to-air-india-saying-leave-without-pay-scheme-was-finalised-without-consultation/story-Ka0kul9qwMm5EkYDkdhAfP.html

20-07-2020||India||‘Can’t spare SC judge for Vikas Dubey encounter probe’: Court to Uttar Pradesh||The Supreme Court on Monday ruled out sparing a sitting top court judge to be part of gangster Vikas Dubey’s encounter probe committee, advising the state of Uttar Pradesh to employ the services of an ex-judge of the very court and a retired police officer for it.“We cannot spare a sitting top court judge to become part of the inquiry committee,” said the apex court.The court also said that the retired SC judge should be from the state as other judges are unwilling to go to Allahabad due to the Covid situation.Appearing for the UP police, senior advocate Harish Salve agreed to bring notification of persons to be included. The Court will consider and approve the same on Wednesday. The court also reminded the state that it is duty bound to uphold rule of law.Commenting on the lapses in the system, the court observed: “We are appalled at the fact that such a person [Vikas Dubey] was released on bail. As an institution we have failed to keep a person behind bars. The Committee must examine this aspect too.”UP police received a lot of flak when it demolished the gangster’s family home and his cars after it failed to nab him. In its defence, the police said it was trying to find the stolen arms. There have also been several questions about the Dubey encounter - following the car accident while he was being brought back to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh. On Friday, the UP government categorically denied before the court that the gunning down of history-sheeter Vikas Dubey on July 10 was a “fake encounter”.The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) filed an application highlighting how encounters have increased in UP since 2018. The court asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta appearing for the state government to look into this aspect as well. The bench said, “What is at stake is not one incident in UP but the whole system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-spare-sc-judge-for-vikas-dubey-encounter-probe-court-to-uttar-pradesh/story-majnQiMsTZaIKNr7GcEm0H.html

The Congress has accused the BJP of indulging in horse-trading to bring down the Gehlot government. The BJP has rejected the allegations.The Congress government in Rajasthan continues to be in turmoil after the simmering differences between Sachin Pilot and Ashok Gehlot came out in the open.Pilot was sacked from the posts of Rajasthan deputy chief minister and state unit president last week. The 42-year-old leader and 18 MLAs who are supporting him, were also issued disqualification notices by the speaker of the state assembly.The battle has now reached Rajasthan High Court, where a two-judge bench is hearing petitions filed by Pilot and 18 MLAs challenging their disqualification notices.On Friday, the high court had directed that no action be taken against Pilot and the other rebel Congress MLAs until Tuesday and had deferred the hearing of their plea challenging the speaker’s notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antakshari-movies-cooking-lessons-for-congress-mlas-amid-rajasthan-crisis/story-YFRDfQkRfuoHgFj6f1MjPM.html

The two navies will conduct a passage exercise near the islands to hone interoperability, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. USS Nimitz has transited the Malacca Strait and is on its way to the Persian Gulf, they said.“A passage exercise is normally undertaken whenever an opportunity arises, in contrast to pre-planned maritime drills. While the Malabar exercise will be conducted later this year, it is always good to exercise with like-minded navies and exchange best opportunities whenever there is a chance,” said naval affairs expert Captain (retired) DK Sharma.There was no official word from the Indian Navy on the exercise with the Nimitz carrier strike group.The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are more than 1,200 km from the mainland. A significant volume of China’s oil imports passes through Malacca Strait, 350 km from these islands.The nuclear-powered USS Nimitz, one of the largest warships on the planet, is returning from an operational deployment in South China Sea. A carrier strike group led by USS Ronald Reagan was part of the US drills in South China Sea.The US deployment to South China Sea came after China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy conducted drills in the contested waters, provoking a sharp reaction from neighbouring countries and Washington. The US Navy has said its operations in South China Sea are designed to support a “free and open” Indo-Pacific.The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 17. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year.The formal invitation to Australia is expected to be extended after some time in view of delicate negotiations between India and China on disengagement and de-escalation to end their standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-us-navies-to-conduct-drills-off-andamans-amid-border-row/story-GU1r3rCGb1BT7EzAN03DWI.html

At least 24 of the state’s 33 districts are affected due to floods triggered by heavy monsoon shower.“Over 70 lakh people have been affected due to Assam floods. People, as well as animals, are being rescued from the affected areas and being shifted to relief camps and safer locations,” chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal told news agency ANI.“On one hand, people are troubled due to Covid-19 and on the other hand, there are challenges arising out of Assam floods. Still, the people of our state continue to fight the battle. Central and state governments are providing all kinds of assistance to the people,” he added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Sonowal on Sunday to take stock of the flood, erosion and Covid-19 situation in the state.“The PM said that the central government was keeping a close watch and standing closely with the people of Assam during these difficult times,” said a statement from the chief minister’s office.According to a Central Water Commission (CWC) bulletin, most rivers in the state continue to be in spate. The Brahmaputra, Dhansiri, Jia Bharali, Kopili, Beki, Kusiyara and Sankosh flowed above the danger mark at several places.The latest alert from CWC on Monday said that the Brahmaputra is expected to rise more by Tuesday evening. The river had burst its banks two weeks ago, swamping more than 2,500 villages. Goalpara is the worst-hit district with over 4.53 lakh people affected, followed by 3.44 lakh in Barpeta and 3.41 lakh in Morigaon.Personnel of the State Disaster Response Force, district administrations and locals have rescued 366 persons during the last 24 hours, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said. Over 50,000 people uprooted by floods have taken shelter at 521 relief camps.The rapidly rising water level has also inundated the Kaziranga National Park, home to the world’s largest concentration of one-horned rhinoceros, with an estimated 2,500 out of a total population of some 3,000 of the animals.“Nine rhinos have drowned and over 100 other animals have been killed,” said Assam’s agriculture minister Atul Bora. Sixty other animals (36 hog deer, eight rhinos, three wild buffalo, one python, seven wild boar, two swamp deer, one Sambar and two porcupines) have so far died due to drowning, according to state government.Assam, famous for its tea plantations, is hit by flooding every rainy season despite flood-control efforts.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-devastated-by-floods-during-covid-19-cm-says-70-lakh-people-affected/story-I7piE129hTY2ksdvKHF0JN.html

20-07-2020||India||Chhattisgarh CM writes to PM requesting supply of iron ore to Bastar steel industries at 30% concession||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to make iron ore available to steel industries in the underdeveloped Bastar region at a 30% concession rate through National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), a central government-run undertaking.In the letter written on Sunday, the CM said that the concession would help the steel industries to operate on a larger scale, make them profitable, and would also create employment opportunities for local youth.The concession would accelerate remote Bastar’s development and economic growth, he said.The state government has also sent a similar proposal to NMDC, he added.The CM pointed out to the PM that the mineral-rich Bastar held a special place in the country.“Bastar region is more abundant in mineral and forest resources than other parts of the country. However, economic activities are limited in Bastar due to dense forest cover and in strict compliance with the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The growing unemployment can be attributed to the rise of Left-wing extremism activities, which have further hindered the region’s growth. However, the launch of the district mineral foundation (DMF) scheme in 2015 aims to alleviate the condition of the families, who have been affected by indiscriminate mining in the region,” the letter stated.The CM drew the PM’s attention to NMDC’s mining activity in the Dantewada district for over 50 years and pleaded for a 30% concession for iron ore for Bastar’s growth and development.“Steel industries have not become a profitable venture for private entrepreneurs, despite the abundance of iron ore. If NMDC provides iron ore to Bastar-based steel industries at a 30% concession, they will soon become profitable and can create more job opportunities for the region’s youth,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-writes-to-pm-requesting-supply-of-iron-ore-to-bastar-steel-industries-at-30-concession/story-C4sNDrvnBELrKNyKkiK5vK.html

I have offered prayers asking for the long life of my husband as Parvati did for Shiva, according to Hindu beliefs.”“A wife offers prayers for the well being of her husband. It is believed that if a woman follows these rituals, her husband will be immortal,” said Sarita Pandey after tying a raw yarn 101 times around a Banyan tree.Pandey said, “Women offer prayers for the well being and long life of their husbands.”Shravan, the fifth month in the Hindu calendar, is considered to be the most auspicious month of the year.

20-07-2020||India||In renewed attack on border row, Rahul Gandhi connects PM’s image and China’s plan||In one of the sharpest attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the India-China border standoff, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said the Chinese are attacking the premier’s image as “they understand that for him to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’ (56-inch)”.He contended that if Modi “allowed the Chinese to understand that they can manipulate him because of his image, the Prime Minister will no longer be worth anything for India”.Gandhi on Monday released the second of his series of short videos on the India-China face-off. Through the videos, he wants to share his thoughts on national issues.Also read: Has Modi government accepted Chinese occupation in Ladakh? asks CongressIn his first video on Friday, Gandhi had said the “troubled economy, foreign policy and neighbourhood” prompted China to take an aggressive stand against India.Titled “China’s Strategic Game Plan”, the second video of two-and-half-minutes focuses on how the Chinese have used the border issue to put pressure on Modi.“And they (Chinese) are thinking of putting pressure in a very particular way. And what they are doing is that they are attacking his image. They understand that it in order for Mr Narendra Modi to be an effective politician, in order for Mr Narendra Modi to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’. And this the real idea the Chinese are attacking. They are basically telling Mr Narendra Modi that if you do not do what we say, we will destroy the idea of Mr Narendra Modi as a strong leader,” Gandhi said.The former Congress president asked how Modi will react to the situation: “Will he take them on? Will he take on the challenge and say absolutely not, I’m the prime minister of India. I do not care about my image, I’m going to take you on. Or will he succumb to them?”He further said: “It is simply not a border issue. The worry I have is that Chinese are sitting in our territory today. Chinese don’t do anything without thinking about it strategically. In their mind they have mapped out the world and they are trying to shape the world. That’s the scale of what they are doing.”He added, “That’s what Gwadar is, that is what Belt and Road is. It is a restructuring of the planet. So when you’re thinking about the Chinese you have to understand that that is the level at which they are thinking.”Also read: Galwan braves get a pat on the back from Rajnath Singh in Ladakh’s LukungAt the tactical level, Gandhi said, the Chinese are trying to improve their position. “Whether it is Galwan, whether it’s Demchok or whether it is Pangong Lake, the idea is to position themselves,” he said.Gandhi said the Chinese are disturbed by a key Indian highway in the area and want to make it redundant. “And if they are thinking larger scale, they want to do something with Pakistan in Kashmir. So it is not simply a border issue. It is a border issue designed to put pressure on the prime minister of India.”The Congress leader has repeatedly targeted Modi and his government over Chinese transgressions and said the prime minister isn’t being transparent on the issue. The Congress has been demanding that status quo ante should be restored at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and Chinese troops be pushed to their side.He alleged that Modi has succumbed to China’s pressure and refuted claims that Chinese troops are occupying Indian territory in Ladakh.“The worry I have so far is that the prime minister has succumbed. The worry I have is, the Chinese are sitting in our territory today and the prime minister has said publicly they are not, which to me tells me that he is worried about his image and defending his image,” Gandhi said.“And if he allows the Chinese to understand that they can manipulate him because of his image, the Indian prime minister will no longer be worth anything for India,” he said in his concluding remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/idea-of-narendra-modi-as-a-strong-leader-rahul-gandhi-s-fresh-attack-over-china/story-SO3dCPxs98zpnlrfQQyNBN.html

The Bombay high court (HC) has restrained a Mumbai-based businessman and his parents from creating any third party rights in the movable or immovable properties held by them either independently or jointly after he had failed to clear his pending dues of interim maintenance to his estranged wife and minor daughter.Last Friday, a two-member division bench, comprising Justices Prasanna Varale and Milind Jadhav, also directed the owner of an elevator-manufacturing firm to submit an inventory of all the movable and immovable properties belonging to him and his parents.The directives were issued following a petition filed by the estranged wife complaining about non-compliance of an order passed by a metropolitan magistrate court in Mumbai on June 30, 2018, directing the businessman to pay monthly interim maintenance of Rs 75,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh to his minor daughter and the estranged wife, respectively.The order was passed by the magistrate on a complaint lodged by the petitioner invoking provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (DV) Act, 2005.In the petition, filed through advocate DP Singh, the petitioner had complained that her husband had not complied with the magisterial order, and as of June, he had not paid arrears of over Rs 44 lakh.Advocate Amogh Singh, the petitioner’s counsel, pointed out that on June 9 another division bench had also directed the Andheri-based businessman to clear the arrears by the next date, but he has not complied with the HC order.The businessman responded to the petition and cited that he had paid Rs 15 lakh to his wife so far. However, he expressed his inability to pay the balance amount on account of partial closure of business because of coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown restrictions.He offered to deposit Rs 5 lakh in his estranged wife’s bank account in a week.The offer, however, failed to impress upon the bench. It took note of the reference made by the petitioner to certain movable and immovable properties held by her husband and his parents in her application under provisions of the DV Act and issued the restraining order.The HC has also observed that the non-compliance on part of the businessman may amount to a wilful breach of its order, inviting action for contempt of the court, and has kept the issue pending for future consideration.The court will hear the case next after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-freezes-family-properties-of-businessman-who-failed-to-pay-maintenance-to-wife-daughter/story-m41we4KPhJYiejH9XZm04O.html

20-07-2020||India||PAC files application in HC to become part of plea filed by Pilot camp MLA||Jaipur: Public Against Corruption (PAC), a civil society group that fights against graft, has filed a plea in the Rajasthan high court (HC), urging its name to be added among those of the respondents in the petition moved by rebel Congress lawmaker PR Meena, a supporter of sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and a challenger to assembly Speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notices. Last Thursday, the Pilot faction, which is locked in a bitter power struggle with the Ashok Gehlot-led government, had challenged the disqualification notices under the anti-defection law that pertains to the 10th Schedule of the Constitution.The writ petition has argued that the dissident members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) have not done or said anything that would indicate that they were snapping their ties with the Congress.The MLAs argued that they had neither given up their membership of the assembly nor did their failure to attend the two Congress legislature party (CLP) meetings, held on July 13 and 14, make them liable for disqualification on the grounds of defection.Senior advocate PC Bhandari, general secretary, PAC, through an application requested the HC that the petitioner is a registered society formed to fight against corruption with the object to fight against graft in various social sectors. It reasoned that the petitioners have challenged in its prayer clause 2(1)(a) of the 10th Schedule read with Article 191 of the Constitution to be declared as illegal, which will give a fillip to horse-trading and corruption in society and across states.The plea stated that “… all public dealings in various government offices have been put on hold and the public is feeling cheated to whom they voted for.”It added: “The PAC wants to be a party in the present petition in a bid to put public grievances before the court and get them redressed.”A division bench of the HC is expected to hear the plea of the 19 rebel MLAs, including Pilot, who were served show-cause notices last week, on Monday.Earlier on July 15, the show-cause notices were served on the dissident lawmakers on the petition of chief whip of the assembly Mahesh Joshi, Speaker Joshi had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pac-files-application-in-hc-to-become-part-of-plea-filed-by-pilot-camp-mla/story-2wB07YciVU3C26mNFbg87J.html

Earlier, he was booked under six different cases in Ashok Nagar. On Thursday, Vikas was roaming in grain market where some shopkeepers raised suspicion that he was trying to steal a packet of pesticide. They beat him up and dragged him with a piece of cloth around his neck on the street. Vikas got injured in the incident,” said Singh.“We are investigating whether he was stealing some thing or not but we can’t allow people to take law in their hands to punish someone. We have lodged an FIR against eight unidentified people under section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 294 (using obscene words) and 506 (criminal intimidation),” said Singh.The Opposition has launched an attack on the government. MP Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “The law and order condition in MP is deteriorating due to indifference attitude of BJP-led state government. People are losing trust in law enforcement machineries. Poor people from SC/ST and OBC communities are being targeted and harassed unnecessarily.”BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Congress is unnecessarily trying to give a political angle to every incident. Swift action is being taken against miscreants and wrong doers by the state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-thrashed-dragged-by-neck-over-suspicion-of-stealing-pesticide-in-madhya-pradesh-s-guna-police/story-stlUGJlSLjKUbHhEvS52DN.html
20-07-2020||India||Tribal dies in Madhya Pradesh, family members allege harassment by forest officer||Villagers in Dhana area of Sagar district in Madhya Pradesh staged a road blockade on Sunday morning and placed the dead body of a tribal on the road, the police said.They accused a forest range officer Devesh Gautam of subjecting the tribal, Maniram Gond, to harassment in connection with a seizure case. The 40-year-old, was a resident of Didohniya village in the district, which is a part of the Bundelkhand region.Public Works Department (PWD) minister Gopal Bhargava joined the villagers’ protest demanding FIR against the forest department officer, who allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 1 lakh from Gond to free his seized tractor-trolley.After the protest of the minister, Chief Conservator of Forest (CCF), Sagar division Amit Dubey suspended Gautam for not handling the case properly. An inquiry has also been ordered for allegedly demanding bribe from the tribal. Sagar district collector Deepak Singh also ordered a magisterial inquiry.Gond’s younger brother Mukesh said, “The tractor-trolley of my brother was seized by forest personnel accusing him of encroaching upon forest land and promoting others in encroachment. My brother requested them not to take tractor-trolley with them as it is the time to sow seeds and he has taken a contract of farming of 5 acre land but they didn’t listen to my brother’s request. Later, forest range officer Devesh Gautam demanded a bribe of Rs 1 lakh.”Gond also lodged a complaint at Dhana police outpost 15 days ago.Gond’s wife Ashok Rani, who is a sarpanch of Belai Mafi panchayat, said, “On Saturday evening, my husband requested the forest officer to free the tractor. He called him at forest range office. He went to meet the ranger Devesh Gautam with Rs 30,000, the amount he could arrange but the officer refused to accept less than Rs 1 lakh. The officer scolded him. While returning he suffered cardiac arrest and died.”“My husband was mentally disturbed and couldn’t bear the trauma,” she added.Talking to media, minister Bhargava said, “I requested forest officer many times to leave the tractor but he didn’t listen. I also approached district forest officer (DFO) but he also didn’t pay attention to my request. Being a minister when they are not listening to me, I can understand how they are harassing tribals. That’s why I joined the protest against the officer of forest department. Suspension is not enough, we want FIR against him.”Meanwhile, DFO, Sagar south range MS Uika said, “Gond had encroached upon two acre forest land in Dhana range. He was sowing crop on the encroached land with tractor when the range officer Devesh Gautam seized his tractor. Minister Gopal Bhargava called me and I explained the matter to him but I was not aware that Gautam was demanding bribe.” Sagar Superintendent of Police Amit Sanghi said, “Police are investigating the matter. Further action would be taken after magisterial inquiry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribal-dies-in-madhya-pradesh-family-members-allege-harassment-by-forest-officer/story-obbDOl54Vd0A6agjv2fkVO.html
20-07-2020||India||Rajasthan HC resumes hearing on Sachin Pilot, 18 other rebel Congress MLAs’ plea||A two-judge bench of Rajasthan High Court on Monday resumed hearing on petitions filed by former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident Congress MLAs challenging their disqualification notices from the state assembly speaker.Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice Prashant Gupta started hearing the case in Court No 1 as Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Speaker CP Joshi, resumed his arguments.Senior counsel Harish Salve and Mukul Rohtagi, representing Sachin Pilot and other MLAs, have completed their side of arguments.On Friday, the high court had directed that no action be taken against Pilot and the other rebel Congress MLAs until Tuesday and had deferred the hearing of their plea challenging the speaker’s disqualification notices.Speaker Joshi had on Friday assured the court that he would not act till 5.30pm on Tuesday on the notices issued to dissident legislators over their failure to attend two Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meetings on July 13 and 14.The MLAs had moved the court challenging the notice issued to them by Joshi on July 14 seeking an explanation on why they should not be disqualified from the assembly.They had told the court that ruling party legislators’ disagreement with the manner of functioning of the chief minister cannot be seen as indicating their intention to leave the party so as to trigger the anti-defection law.They said that criticising the party leadership is an exercise of freedom of speech and cannot be a ground to disqualify a lawmaker on the grounds of defection.The petitioners through their counsel contended that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session and that airing of grievances against party leadership cannot be construed as voluntarily giving up party membership under 2 (1) (a) of the Tenth schedule of the Constitution.The petition challenged the speaker’s notice, which was based on a complaint by Congress’ chief whip Mahesh Joshi, that the MLAs should be disqualified from the Rajasthan assembly for defying the whip.Mahesh Joshi sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under Clause 2 (1) (a) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, which provides for disqualification of MLAs if they “voluntarily” give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.Mahesh Joshi cited the absence of the dissident MLAs in two Congress legislature party meetings despite specific direction to attend them along with hostile and prejudicial conduct against the party, as an indication of the dissidents’ intention to leave the party.Sachin Pilot, the 42-year-old leader credited with leading the Congress’ successful 2018 assembly election campaign, has categorically ruled out joining the BJP, asserting that attempts to link him to the opposition party were a ploy to tar his image.If the rebel MLAs are disqualified, the majority mark in the 200-member assembly will come down, making it easier for chief minister Ashok Gehlot to win a floor test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-hc-to-resume-hearing-on-sachin-pilot-18-other-rebel-congress-mlas-plea-today/story-M3msm3P6Xl0odq7Upc1H5O.html

He said the BJP was playing this “game for long and contacted me few months back. They were active but failed”.Gudha said, “We supported chief minister Ashok Gehlot in his last and this government without any conditions. It is unjustified to make attempts destabilize the government, especially during when the country is suffering from Covid-19.” BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek questioned Gudha about the timing of his “revelation”. “Why was he quiet for eight months? There was an assembly session; he could have raised it in House,” he said.A political crisis has erupted in Rajasthan as CM Gehlot is locked in a power tussle with former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who has the backing of 18 Congress legislators and three independents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanjay-jain-offered-to-arrange-meet-with-vasundhara-raje-mla/story-WQIeE5ZEcCdaTfyBVazA5N.html

20-07-2020||India||Delhiwale: A head that wears the forest||His face is almost invisible under the huge load of goat fodder he is carrying on his head. All that you see are glimpses of his glinting eyes and flashes of his nose and lips. The young man is dressed in a green T-shirt and black shorts printed with the word “TikTok”. He’s walking along a central Delhi alley.“These are leaves from the gular trees,” he says, introducing himself as Kalu. His voice seems to be coming out of the green bundle, as one cannot see his mouth.Kalu is in his late teens. A labourer, he says he does whatever assignment comes his way. “Right now I’m transporting fodder from a supplier to a stall in the bazaar,” he informs. Kalu has never been to a school. He frees his right arm and flicks his palm, in synchronisation with his speech. “Mummy Papa gone.”Kalu was very young when his parents passed away, he says. Without being prompted, he discloses that he is not from some far-off part of the country, but from this very city. “I was born in Delhi.” His half-hidden lips spread into a very visible smile, revealing his paan-stained teeth.So who does he live with?Kalu’s eyes continue to sparkle as he shakes his head. The bundle is almost like a mini-jungle in itself, and moves with him. He explains that he is alone in the “duniya”, the world.He sleeps on the footpath nearby, outside the closed shutters of a motor pump shop. “Many other labourers sleep there.”And who cooks his meals?He again shakes his head, more vigorously. “I have nobody, I myself look after my food.” He doesn’t cook, because he explains he has no stove. “I eat outside, in the dhabas.”Kalu says he doesn’t feel alone, though. He has many friends who are like his brothers and sisters. “When I fall ill they look after me... once they even took me to a doctor.”Besides, he doesn’t find time to feel lonely. In his free time, he watches movies and music videos on his cellphone, though right now it’s not with him. He has left it in his bag, a bag he keeps safe in the custody of one of his friends, close to where he sleeps at night.While Kalu’s days are hectic, he does avail himself a few hours of rest in the afternoon. These days, he spends it watching film bits starring Shah Rukh Khan on YouTube. “He is better than Salman (Khan),” Kalu observes. “Shah Rukh dances better, though he doesn’t have as much muscle as Salman.” The boy is talking of both the superstars very casually, and uses only their first names, as if he were on friendly terms with them.But now Kalu politely asks to be excused. He quickly wants to complete his assignment so that he can rush to the dhaba he frequents for his breakfast — bun with butter, and a glass of “doodh chai”. He walks away, his face hidden under his load. It’s a surreal sight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-a-head-that-wears-the-forest/story-yuoiIDsNN2mkju8wHgMrdM.html
20-07-2020||India||In Gehlot vs Pilot, Congress backs regional leadership||It’s a long-held perception that the will of the Congress high command is the final word for everyone in the party. While the composition of the high command has transitioned from Indira Gandhi’s and Rajiv Gandhi’s teams to those of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, this rule has remained a constant. The Ashok Gehlot versus Sachin Pilot fight in Rajasthan is another instance, and maybe even mark a trend of the high command realizing that it is better to go with the regional leader than impose its own favourites on a state unit.That Sachin Pilot is a favoured face is undeniable. Pilot and Rahul Gandhi both belong to the 2004 batch of first- time members of Parliament. As young MPs, they formed a clique that would, among other things, attend live music concerts at Blue Frog (a now defunct club) where their colleague Milind Deora would be playing the blues. As Rahul Gandhi became party general secretary, Pilot also grew, becoming a minister of state in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. They both went to St. Stephen’s College, although Rahul Gandhi didn’t complete his degree there, but they also shared other, deeper commonalities. Both had fathers who were trained pilots and both lost them too early in life.Also read: Buzz grows over Rajasthan special session, floor test And yet, a week after Pilot’s rebellion against Gehlot, the message to him is unequivocal: he is welcome to come back, but it won’t be by undermining his boss. Gehlot has proved he has the numbers and while Pilot may have genuine complaints against him, they cannot afford to upset a man who commands the maximum number of legislators in Rajasthan. This despite the fact that Pilot has Priyanka Gandhi’s ear. The two have spoken at least twice in the course of the week. Rahul and Sonia have also conveyed to mediators that they would like him to stay, but not at the cost of overriding party discipline.It’s as if things have come a full circle in Rajasthan since 2014. That’s the time when the same high command handpicked Pilot to lead the party in Rajasthan after its worst-ever performance of winning just 21 seats out of 200 in the 2013 assembly elections. Pilot took on that assignment after eliciting a promise that Gehlot wouldn’t interfere in the state. And for two years or so, Gehlot held no real position other than being part of a screening committee for Punjab polls in 2016. In 2017, he was made a general secretary in Delhi, which meant that Pilot got full credit for winning the three crucial by-polls in early 2018. Despite chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia holding helm in the state, Pilot delivered the Lok Sabha seats of Ajmer and Alwar and Mandalgarh assembly seats with record margins. His word would now be the last word in the state.Also read: Rajasthan ‘horse trading’ probe: Jain had Rs 100 crore budget to buy 3 MLAs, claims police That’s the reason why a contentious rule brought by Pilot for ticket distribution in the assembly polls that year was enforced despite major opposition. According to that rule, all those who had lost the elections twice would not get a ticket. Many like general secretary in charge Avinash Pandey opposed it, arguing that it was unfair as many contenders had lost in 2013 due to a wave in favour of Narendra Modi. But Pilot’s insistence on that rule led to the alienation of many Congress politicians in the state. Alok Beniwal, Laxman Meena, Mahadeo Khandela, Sayam Lodha and Deep Chand Kharia were all denied party tickets so they contested as independents and won. Zubair Khan got his wife to contest and she won, Richpal Mirdha’s son contested and won; there are several other such names. This decision became one of the major factors behind the Congress’s lukewarm win (99 out of 200 seats). When Ashok Gehlot was installed as chief minister and Pilot only as his deputy, it was after feedback that the older man would be able to command a larger group of people during a crisis. It also helped that Gehlot had won over Rahul Gandhi’s trust during the 44 days they spent together in Gujarat. Incidentally, Rajasthan’s independents now form a chunk of the support base for Ashok Gehlot.A recap of these circumstances is perhaps necessary to understand the bewildering sequence of events in the week gone by. It explains why we’ve constantly been hearing two voices. That of Ashok Gehlot mocking his “good-looking, English-speaking” challenger while Randeep Surjewala (the voice of the high command) encourages him to come back; The Gehlot-led legislature party issuing a show-cause notice and removing him as deputy chief minister while Surjewala says “the doors of the party are always open.” At one point, it would have been unimaginable to hear two voices; the high command’s would drown out all else. Whatever happens to Pilot, this change in the emergence of regional power is here to stay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-gehlot-vs-pilot-congress-backs-regional-leadership/story-94VKTXugoooWvXKaYaKIEI.html
20-07-2020||India||ED files new charge sheet to aid Mehul Choksi’s extradition||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a charge sheet against fugitive jeweller Mehul Choksi, elaborating how he allegedly ran an organised racket to cheat customers and lenders in India, Dubai and the US, including top financial institutions, by dealing in “lab grown diamonds” and selling off properties, details accessed by Hindustan Times reveal.The charge sheet is aimed at bolstering India’s extradition request for Choksi to Antigua and Barbuda sent under the UN Conventions against Corruption in March 2019. An official said on condition of anonymity that the charge sheet was filed a “few weeks back”. He, however, did not give a specific date.Choksi, a key accused in the Rs 13,500-crore Punjab National Bank fraud case along with his nephew Nirav Modi, became a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda under a programme in which a certain quantum of investment entitles an individual to citizenship. While investigators say Choksi fled the country to avoid arrest, he claims he left India in January 2018 to undergo a bypass surgery, and not to avoid prosecution. ED previously filed a charge sheet in 2018 to underline the role of Choksi and others in the PNB fraud case.Also read: ED brings back jewels owned by Nirav Modi, Mehul ChoksiThe new charge sheet, relying on statements of several top executives of companies based in the US, UAE, Hong Kong and India, reveals how “lab grown diamonds” were being sold in the garb of natural diamonds through Choksi’s companies M/s Shanyo Gong Si Ltd in Hong Kong and M/s Voyager Brands and M/s Samuels Jewelers Inc in the US. The factory for lab-grown diamonds was run in Surat, where large-scale production took place, personally monitored by Choksi, the charge sheet says. These diamonds appear similar in size, quality and colour when compared to natural diamonds, it adds.According to the charge sheet, in December 2017, Choksi called a meeting of his top employees in Hong Kong, informing them that “coming two-three months would be very tough for Gitanjali Group companies as they would be facing forensic audits”, while directing them not to travel to India during this time. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) initiated a probe into the PNB fraud on January 31, 2018.In January 2018, Choksi tried to dispose of his company Gitanjali Infratech Ltd’s “Tatva Project” in Borivali (Mumbai) by transferring its development rights to one Laxmi Infra Developers Ltd, a Surat-based company owned by Vasant Gajera, according to the charges. Gajera has been charge-sheeted by ED along with Choksi.After the CBI filed a case in January 2018, Choksi and Gajera signed an agreement, according to which, the latter was allowed to develop the project against the transfer of 50 unsold flats to Gitanjali Infratech apart from a payment of over ~30 crore, ED has said. Quoting a February 2019 report of a US Bankruptcy Court-appointed examiner John J Carney, which is now part of the ED charge sheet, the agency has said that Texas-based Samuels Jewelers Inc was used by Choksi for circulating money taken from PNB.Also read: Govt sets up panel to probe 3 Gandhi family-run trusts “Choksi and an international web of co-conspirators used Samuels and a series of puppet vendors to create the false appearance that Samuels was purchasing and/or selling jewellery to and from unrelated third parties. In fact, Samuels and related entities – were secretly selling inventory and laundering money themselves at the directions of Choksi and individuals under his control” the charge sheet says.ED has stated that there were transactions worth $121 million in the form of purchases and sales from Samuels.The primary goal of this, according to the charge sheet, “was to fraudulently induce Samuels’ primary lenders, Wells Fargo and Gordon Brothers, to authorize tens of millions of dollars of credit in advances which were ultimately funnelled outside the US to Choksi-controlled entities in India, Dubai and Hong Kong”.The agency has alleged that puppet vendors in Hong Kong such as Shanyo Gong Si Ltd and Taipingyang Trading Ltd were established by Choksi by providing false paper and monetary trails, which allowed Choksi to use Samuels’ US affiliates as shipping hubs for inventory purchases from Gitanjali affiliates.The agency has recorded a statement of a US national – Curtis Alan Lowrey – who previously co-owned M/s Independent Gemological Laboratories Inc; the firm was later bought by Choksi. Lowrey said that when he pointed out that lab-grown diamonds were being sold as natural diamonds, Choksi called him and directed him not to discuss such matters with anyone except him.Former CEO of Samuels, Farhad K Wadia, also sent a “sworn affidavit and statement” to ED by post, now part of the charge sheet, in which he said that Choksi asked him to rebrand the whole business of Gitanjali in the US under the name of Voyager Brands and told him that his son – Rohan Choksi – was the boss of the group business in the US.According to Wadia’s statement to ED, Choksi’s sister Neena Seth, daughter-in-law Snagda Talera and son Rohan Choksi would oversee Voyager Business in Austin and both Rohan and Snagda worked as his “eyes and ears”. Reacting to questions on the charge sheet, Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said: “Evidence is very weak. It shall not stand judicial scrutiny. Reverse burden of proof under fiscal laws doesn’t mean that prosecution need not prove even bedrock facts.” Calls made to Laxmi Developers could did not go through. An email query remained unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-files-new-charge-sheet-to-aid-mehul-choksi-s-extradition/story-gFGXZyKikbi0QxKc2PcQqO.html
20-07-2020||India||Buzz grows over Rajasthan special session, floor test||Amid the political crisis in Rajasthan following a rebellion by ousted deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 of his followers in the state assembly, the government ’s intention of calling a special session of the House may be to gain the moral high ground, political experts said on Sunday.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot called on governor Kalraj Mishra on Saturday evening for a “courtesy meeting” to brief the latter on the Covid-19 pandemic and the state’s efforts to control it.A state government official said, requesting anonymity, that the CM also gave the governor a list of 103 MLAs in the 200-member assembly supporting his government and discussed the possibility of holding a special session so he can face a floor test to prove he has a majority. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has not demanded one.“The CM has gone ahead and suggested a floor test to attain the high moral ground,” said political commentator Narayan Bareth. He said the meeting was also aimed at removing any doubt in the mind of the state’s constitutional head about the government being in a minority.Prakash Bhandari, another Jaipur-based commentator, said the list that the government gave to the governor doesn’t have names of the 19 Congress MLAs— that of Sachin Pilot and his 18 followers. “The government wanted to give out a message that it was ready to face the House without these rebel MLAs,” he said.BJP leaders said the government should have opted for a floor test much earlier if it actually had the numbers. “If they have the numbers, they should not have herded their MLAs and put them in a hotel for a week,” said Rajendra Rathore, deputy leader of the opposition in the assembly.Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi didn’t rule out a special session next week for a floor test. “If a session is called, we will take all MLAs supporting us in buses from the hotel to the assembly,” he said.The Rajasthan high court will resume hearing on joint petitions by 19 rebel MLAs against the disqualification notices served on them by speaker CP Joshi. The speaker has given them until 5.30 pm on Tuesday to reply to the notices.Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Gulab Chand Kataria on Sunday said only a floor test can decide whether a government has the required numbers to stay in power or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/buzz-grows-over-rajasthan-special-session-floor-test/story-GCpKTci7g6Sff5sGlVxgmO.html
20-07-2020||India||How BJP tackles infighting, revolt||When four National People’s Party (NPP) lawmakers withdrew support to Manipur’s N Biren Singh-led government on June 17 and threatened to bring it down, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s central leadership quickly swung into action. Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda immediately met the disgruntled lawmakers and NPP chief Conrad Sangma to deal with the crisis. The crisis blew over by June 25 when Singh shook hands with his detractors. Similar intervention in February helped resolve a potential crisis in Karnataka, where several BJP leaders were upset over the denial of cabinet berths. The grievance redress mechanisms of political parties in such situations have been in the focus again as the Congress government in Rajasthan faces a rebellion by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’ and his followers. The fresh crisis for the Congress comes months after its government was toppled in Madhya Pradesh when 22 lawmakers resigned to pave the way for the BJP’s return to power. In both cases, rebels have expressed dissatisfaction over the party’s grievance redress system.BJP general secretary Anil Jain, who is the party’s Haryana and Chhattisgarh in charge, said the party has multiple systems for addressing issues. “...decisions are taken collectively; it is the party’s position, not an individual’s choice. So clashes do not occur. Our party is not an individual or a personality-centric party; it is based on an ideology,” said Jain, who was instrumental in sorting out differences between Haryana chief minister M L Khattar and his cabinet colleague, Anil Vij.Bhupinder Yadav, BJP’s general secretary and Bihar in-charge, echoed Jain. “...there is a mechanism for addressing issues and decisions are made in a democratic manner. The other difference is that while in the BJP, the highest decision-making body is the Parliamentary Board, in Congress, it is the Gandhis.”A third BJP leader, who did not wish to be named, said tensions and disagreements are expected and all parties have safety valves to prevent spillovers. “Differences or clashes between personalities is not a new phenomenon. We have seen this happen between Sardar Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru, between L K Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In such cases, these leaders used to supplement each other or even surrender to the other leader,” the third functionary said. He said Advani had to show deference to Vajpayee, who was seen as a mass leader. In the BJP, there is also a third authority, which is sometimes seen to serve as the safety valve—its ideological fount, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. “The RSS can be described as a friend, philosopher and guide. People can share their views with the [RSS] functionaries and also seek advice,” this leader said.To be sure, not all disagreements were amicably solved. Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh, who served as finance and external affairs ministers in the Vajpayee government, had a bitter parting with the BJP after complaining of being sidelined. Shatrughan Sinha, Kirti Azad and Navjot Singh Sidhu, who also quit the BJP, made public their disagreements with the party’s leadership. Congress leader Pranav Jha rejected the suggestion that his party does not have a proper redress system and said the BJP not only irons out but steamrolls and eliminates differences. “From L K Advani to Uma Bharti and Sushma Swaraj, [these] are all examples. We, on the contrary, are a democratic party of living individuals, who aspire and compete like it happens all across the world.”Ashoka University assistant professor Neelanjan Sircar said it is the very construct of the Congress’s structure that is not based on ideology and makes it vulnerable to defections. “A fundamental challenge for political parties in India is how they prevent defection and how they engineer defection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-bjp-tackles-infighting-revolt/story-8hHsl6Kyg9z1kQsy7x3IHO.html
20-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency authorisation, its first for the use of pooled testing in the country, on July 18, as the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases continued to rise, and with many states struggling to meet demand for testing. The 7-day average of new cases in the US, on July 18, according to the New York Times database, was around 66,000.Pooled testing isn’t a new concept, and even in the current context of Covid-19, there has been talk of using it in India to boost testing capacity (Hindustan Times wrote about this in the early days of the pandemic here). Pooled testing is simply about pooling samples into lots, testing the lots and then testing individual samples in lots that test positive for the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes the coronavirus disease. India has been an early adopter of antigen testing, and the Indian Council of Medical Research has now asked states to aggressively use rapid antigen tests, HT reported late last week. It should consider pooled testing too, for this will increase testing capacity. India, as I’ve said time and again in the column, should be testing a million people a day. It does around 300,000 a day on average currently.India registered 37,774 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, taking its total tally of infections to 1,076,479 (according to the Hindustan Times dashboard). Of this, 26,812 people have died and 677,565 have recovered — resulting in 372,102 active cases. The number of new cases continues to rise (there’s a new daily record almost every other day) and India is on course to add another million cases before August 15. Now, imagine daily cases not rising but beginning to come down, perhaps two weeks from now.That’s well within the realm of the possible.Last week, in a speech and then an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, said the disease could be controlled in four to eight weeks if “we could get everyone to wear a mask right now”, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. Redfield cited research in the US on health care workers that showed that universal masking significantly reduced infections passed on by patients even in this high-risk group. Yet, despite universal masking rules that many US states have imposed, law enforcement agencies indicate that they probably will not be actively enforcing the rule. The general opinion seems to be that it is a little disproportionate to penalise someone for something as trivial as not wearing a mask (although, in current circumstances, a person not wearing a mask is probably as dangerous as one waving a gun).Yet, when things head south, the first thing administrators do — the most recent case being Melbourne over the weekend — is to make the wearing of masks mandatory. Masking and social distancing are the only guaranteed ways to prevent infections.There are a variety of reasons why people do not wear masks but all of them can be traced back to plain stupidity. There can be no medical reason for the majority of people not to wear a mask. Research has shown that wearing a mask (or actually multiple masks) does not affect oxygen intake in any way — although the exhalation does cause glasses to mist up. If India continues on its current trajectory, it may well be seeing at least around 75,000 cases a day by the middle of August. The US is the only country to have seen those levels (it recorded a little less than 75,000 cases on July 17). Now, imagine a scenario where India isn’t seeing 75,000 cases by August 15, but a much lower number. Universal masking can make that happen — provided the federal government and the states get serious about enforcement.Can India and Indians, famed for the inability to maintain queues (or understand the concept of personal space) in good times do better than the US in bad times?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-MRJ5Ekd2Ejk1cYHeZDOqIL.html
20-07-2020||India||Rajasthan ‘horse trading’ probe: Jain had Rs 100 crore budget to buy 3 MLAs, claims police||Sanjay Jain, the man arrested on charges of offering money to MLAs to topple Ashok Gehlot government, was given a budget of Rs 100 crore to buy out three MLAs, the Special Operations Group (SOG) claims to have found in its investigations.Jain was arrested on Friday night and is currently in four-day remand of the SOG. “The money game was being controlled from the National Capital Region (NCR),” said police officers, who are part of the investigations.The SOG is investigating three cases of alleged sedition and conspiracy, including the two based on the audio tapes, in which three people--Jain, Ashok Singh and Bharat Malani – have been arrested. “Singh was tasked to give Rs 25 crore to an Independent MLA,” one of the officers mentioned above alleged.The three arrested men were middlemen, he claimed.SOG claims that its preliminary probe into the three cases suggests that Jain was a small link to a long chain trying to lure members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) with crores of rupees to topple the government. “Both Jain and Singh have strong financial background and political links,” one of the police officers said.State BJP spokesperson Pankaj Meena however refuted the claims calling it a trap laid by some senior Congress leaders to defame BJP. “Jain has been block president of Congress in Bikaner in past and has nothing to do with our party,” Meena said.Reacting to the allegations of BJP, Archan Sharma, spokesperson of Congress party highlighted that the audio tape which has surfaced clearly reveals that Jain was acting as middlemen between central leadership of BJP and Sardarshahr MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma to topple the government. “Jain has been office bearer of BJP and this case it is clear that an attempt was made by him with some central leadership of BJP to topple the government,” Sharma added.A top police official related to the probe claims that other than Jain, there were at least three to four other chains of people including businessmen and politicians, who were trying to negotiate with Independents and Congress MLAs. The police are trying to trace the chain of links to the handlers behind the alleged attempt to topple the government.“There have been definite attempts to induce the independents and Congress MLAs and the police has obtained messages and recording to prove that. Messages which talked about arranging money in crores of rupees have been obtained. We are trying to find out the main source of the entire game plan. People like Jain, who was arrested on Friday night, Malani of Ajmer and Singh of Banswara, arrested on July 11, are just the middlemen of different chains,” the police official quoted above added.On Saturday along with the SOG, crime branch and city police were also roped in to investigate the different aspects of the case.Jain was called at the SOG on Thursday night for interrogation followed by registration of an FIR on Friday that named him, Sardarshahar MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma and a person identified as Gajendra Singh.The FIR was registered against the trio on the basis of three audiotapes of purported conversations relating to alleged attempts to destabilise the Gehlot government.In one audiotape, one of the MLAs can be heard purportedly speaking to another agent discussing the plot.In another tape, Jain is allegedly introducing one MLA to Singh and one person is heard saying that more legislators are needed to dislodge the Gehlot government and another person responds exuding confidence that the current dispensation would not last long.In a claim made in a conversation, recorded in another audio clip, one person says Gehlot government is unlikely to last more than 10-15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-horse-trading-probe-jain-had-rs-100-crore-budget-to-buy-3-mlas-claims-police/story-TExP12eUurnxd3w5JaP1TL.html

20-07-2020||India||Congress MLA says middleman contacted him with offer to meet Vasundhara Raje, BJP leaders||Amid the ongoing political turmoil in Rajasthan, Congress MLA Rajendra Gudha said on Sunday that Sanjay Jain, the middleman arrested on charges of sedition and conspiracy to topple the Ashok Gehlot government, contacted him a few months back and offered to organise meeting with former CM Vasundhara Raje and other BJP leaders.“Jain approached me around eight months back and wanted me to meet Raje in Delhi but I refused,” Gudha said. He said the BJP has been playing this game for a long time and contacted him a few months back. They were trying but they failed.The Congress MLA said, “We supported Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot in his last and this government without any conditions. It is unjustified to make attempts to destabilize the government, especially when the country is suffering from Covid-19.” BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek questioned Gudha about the timing of his “revelation”. “Why was he quiet for eight months? There was an assembly session; he could have raised it in the House, he said.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has claimed that the rebel MLAs were acting in tandem with the BJP to bring down his government.But rebel leader Sachin Pilot has refuted the allegations and denied that he was joining the BJP.On Friday evening, there was a lot of drama at the hotel in Manesar where the dissident Congress MLAs are staying after an SOG team was not allowed to enter the premises by the Haryana Police. They were eventually allowed to enter the hotel later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mla-says-middleman-contacted-him-with-offer-to-meet-vasundhara-raje-bjp-leaders/story-5ulcf9nX8VDga6lQlP5HTL.html
20-07-2020||India||India’s fatality rate lower than global average: Govt||Fewer patients are dying in India from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) compared to the rest of the world, with the case fatality rate (CFR) falling below 2.5% for the first time in five months, according to data shared by the Union health ministry on Sunday.CFR is the ratio of confirmed deaths and confirmed Covid-19 cases. The global CFR as of July 18 was 3.41%.The highest CFR that the country has seen so far since first death was reported on March 12 was 3.23%, and that was reported around mid-May. Since then, the CFR had largely been hovering around 2.8%, one of the lowest in the world.“With effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardized clinical management protocols based on holistic standard of care approach, the case fatality rate has significantly dipped. The Case Fatality Rate is progressively falling and currently, it is 2.49%. India has one of the lowest fatality rates in the world,” the health ministry said in a statement.Also read | Coronavirus in India: Highest single-day spike of 40k pushes count past 1.1 millionCertain states are managing the disease quite well and have not reported any deaths due to Covid-19. States such as Manipur, Nagaland, Sikkim, Mizoram and the Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a zero case fatality rate.There are at least 29 states that have a CFR of below the national average currently, and there are about 14 states that have a CFR of less than 1%.“It’s a good sign that people are getting better and our mortality is low. Most positive cases do not require hospitalization, and those needing intensive care is actually a minuscule number. Most people in hospitals have moderate disease with good chances of recovery. The need is to take care of our old and vulnerable population with co-morbidities that is at high risk of developing severe illness,” says Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant, department of internal medicine, Max Healthcare.Those with a CFR below the national average include Tripura (0.19%), Assam (0.23%), Kerala (0.34%), Odisha (0.51%), Goa (0.60%), Himachal Pradesh (0.75%), Bihar (0.83%), Telangana (0.93%), Andhra Pradesh (1.31%), Tamil Nadu (1.45%), Chandigarh (1.71%), Rajasthan (1.94%), Karnataka (2.08%) and Uttar Pradesh (2.36%).“Being able to aggressively test, track and treat cases has been one of the key reasons for effective management of cases as infected people are being picked up early. Early case detection is an absolute must for controlling any disease of epidemic proportions successfully,” said a senior official in the ministry of health who did not wish to be identified. Also read | ‘Some think Covid-19 will vanish by building Ram Temple’: Pawar ahead of PM’s likely Ayodhya visitThe past 24 hours also saw a sharp increase of 23,672 patients recovering. The gap between recovered patients and active cases has widened to 304,043. The total number of recovered patients is 677,422, with the current recovery rate being 62.86%, government data shows.Integrating services of both the public and private sector has also led to effective handling of the cases. “Many states have conducted the population surveys to map and identify the vulnerable population like the elderly, pregnant women and those with co-morbidities. This, with the help of technological solutions like mobile apps, has ensured keeping the high-risk population under continuous observation, thus aiding early identification, timely clinical treatment and reducing fatalities,” the health ministry said.At the ground level, drafting of frontline health workers like Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Auxiliary Nurse Mid-wives (ANMs) has been effective in conducting door-to-door surveillance, and to create awareness within the community, especially in managing the migrant population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-fatality-rate-lower-than-global-average-govt/story-lQ9v0HH4fVw4XtQjxP7eQL.html
20-07-2020||India||230kg gold smuggled via diplomatic route: Probe||A multi-agency team probing the seizure of 30 kg of gold from the Thiruvananthapuram airport cargo terminal on July 5 found that at least 230 kg of gold has been smuggled into the country in similar fashion, using some employees of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) diplomatic mission in the Kerala capital over the past year, a senior officer familiar with the investigation said.The gold was contained in a carton with an assortment of pipes, taps, and door handles, food and electronic items. The 24-carat gold — the best quality — estimated to be worth at least Rs 15 crore was hidden inside the pipes. “At least 13 such consignments came to the country in one year, and they all passed without any check due to diplomatic immunity. Some of them were heavier than the latest consignment, which weighed 70 kg. We are also probing some events organised by state government departments,” the officer cited above sai on condition of anonymity, adding that all people whose names cropped up during the questioning will be summoned. This include chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s deposed secretary M Sivasankar and former information technology fellow Arun Balachandran. Last week, customs officers questioned Sivasankar for nine hours. The team is also likely to question a minister in the Vijayan government whose number appeared in the call list of former IT consultant Swapna Suresh, which was leaked to the media. Suresh is the second accused in the case; the first was P. Sarith Kumar, who went to the cargo terminal to pick up the consignment Meanwhile, reports from Dubai on Malayalam TV channels said that the third accused in the case, Faizal Fareed, was arrested in the city and he will be extradited soon. On the request of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) , Interpol issued a blue corner notice against Fareed. A resident of Thrissur, he is a key operative in the smuggling racket, according to the NIA. He is reportedly running a gym and garage in Dubai.The NIA has arrested four people and the customs department 13 in connection with the case. The team has also started a massive operation to trace the smuggled gold and seized 10 kg from two jewellers in Kozhikkode on Saturday, the officer cited above said adding that once the investigation gathered speed, many who were part of the smuggling syndicate had come up with voluntary disclosures. But he admitted that it was difficult to trace all smuggled gold. The team has conducted raids in last two days including two apartments belonging to Suresh and a business establishment of the third suspect, Sandip Nair, in the state capital and seized documents.The NIA filed a first information report (FIR) on July 10 against Sarith Kumar, who was arrested by customs officials on the day the gold was seized. Five days later, Suresh and Nair, a friend of hers, were arrested from a hideout in Bangaluru. A a Malappuram-based businessman, K T Rameez, was held by the customs on July 15 and NIA issued a blue corner notice against Fareed. All five were charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act . Chief minister Vijayan’s powerful secretary was suspended after reports surfaced that he was close to Suresh.State opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on Sunday asked investigating agencies to question CM Vijayan. “Involvement of his two key aides (Sivasankar and Balachandran) surfaced. Now he can’t wash off his hands. He will have to be grilled for more details,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/230kg-gold-smuggled-via-diplomatic-route-probe/story-1AlRKATMbyUVLBpeA4xMaO.html
20-07-2020||India||Coronavirus in India: Highest single-day spike of 40k pushes count past 1.1 million||Daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) surpassed the 40,000 mark for the first time since the outbreak on Sunday, taking the national tally of infections past 1.1 million, with the latest 100,000 cases being reported in three days.India reported 40,118 new cases and 675 deaths on Sunday, taking the total number of cases to 1,116,597, and deaths to 27,487.While the spread of the virus, Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, is beginning to show signs of plateauing in some urban epicentres of the contagion such as Delhi, other regions such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Bihar have started showing spikes in daily new cases.Nearly half the new cases on Sunday came from three states, Maharashtra (9,518), Tamil Nadu (4,979) and Andhra Pradesh (5,041) – all record single-day highs. Several states and UTs such as Uttar Pradesh (2,211 new cases), West Bengal (2,278), Bihar (1,412), Rajasthan (934) and Jammu and Kashmir (701) reported record single-day case spikes on Sunday.Also read: PM Modi takes stock of Covid-19 situation in seven statesDelhi reported 1,211 new cases, Karnataka 4,120 and Telangana 1,296, according to respective state bulletins.In the past week, until July 19, India recorded more than 34,000 new cases a day on average, compared to 26,000 a week before — a statistic that highlights the rate of cases growing in the country. The doubling rate of cases — the number of days it takes for infections to double — is currently 20.2 days.Experts have said that the focus of the battle against the virus now needs to shift to rural parts of the country that traditionally have been beyond the reach of adequate health care mechanisms, and where new hot spots are now feared to surface.The number of recovered Covid-19 patients in India has crossed 700,000, with the recovery rate standing at 62.7%.In graphics: Coronavirus Live TrackerAs of Sunday, the country had 388,786 active cases and the case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of people who have died among known infections — was 2.5%, against the global average of 4.2%. The US, which has 3,859,590 cases and 143,042 deaths, has a fatality rate of 3.7%; and Brazil, with 2,076,635 cases and 78,871 deaths, is at 3.8%.Amid an increase in the number of new cases recently, several states such as Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh have announced reimpositions of lockdowns of various degrees in several districts to curb the spread of the outbreak.Also read | ‘Some think Covid-19 will vanish by building Ram Temple’: Pawar ahead of PM’s likely Ayodhya visitThe Union ministry of health and family welfare said on Sunday that India’s CFR is “progressively falling” and is one of the lowest in the world, crediting the country’s “efficient clinical management of hospitalised cases”. Proactive measures such as aggressive testing and timely diagnosis of the central, state and Union territory governments have helped in detecting cases early, the ministry said in a press statement. “Effective clinical management of the moderate and severe cases through a well executed standard of care protocol has ensured high rate of recovery among the Covid patients,” it said.Testing has been ramped up across the country in the past few weeks. According data released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country has tested 300,000 samples every day over the past week. This is a two-fold increase from the average 150,000 samples being tested every day a month ago.Experts said that India’s low mortality rate points to the country’s effective management of infections. “There may be a rise in cases but the good thing is that our mortality rate is low, meaning we are losing fewer patients to Covid-19. It speaks a lot about how we are effectively managing our positive cases. Our health care system isn’t at all overwhelmed so we are able to provide treatment to everyone who needs it,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-single-day-spike-of-40k-pushes-count-past-1-1-mn/story-eTLElMrU8idNSMuxiXmVYK.html
20-07-2020||India||AIIMS to start Covaxin trial this week||Five healthy volunteers are likely to receive the first shot of Bharat Biotech’s anti-coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine candidate, Covaxin, by this weekend at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi.AIIMS, one of the 12 approved sites in the country for conducting early human clinical trials on vaccine candidates, on Saturday received approval of the institute ethics committee to begin the trial.“The ethics committee has granted its approval for the trial. Recruitment of healthy volunteers will begin from Monday,” confirmed Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS.In just 24 hours after having sought applications from people willing to be volunteers for the trial, the hospital received 1,000 applications against its requirement of 100 volunteers.“The response has been tremendous. Our phone has not stopped ringing since we publicized the number, and of the 1,000 applications 400 queries have come just through emails. We have already replied to each email but people also connected through text and WhatsApp messages which will take longer to reply to. We have stopped taking applications and have started inviting people for the screening process,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine, AIIMS.Dr Rai is the principal investigator for the study in AIIMS.“We applied for the ethics committee’s approval on June 30; they suggested a few things and raised a few concerns for safety that needed minor changes to be made in the trial protocol. Those gaps were addressed and we finally got the approval on Saturday. The registration and screening process of the volunteers will begin from Monday. The entire subject recruitment process is likely to finish in about two weeks,” said Dr Rai.The applications will need filtering, and applicants will be made to undergo a battery of tests before qualifying for the trial, as the volunteers need to be healthy adults between 18 and 55 years.“We have called a select number of people on Monday to take their naso-pharyngeal swab and blood sample, to ensure they are Covid-19 negative. Also, they should have no co-morbidities (known or unknown) such as hypertension, diabetes, abnormal kidney or liver function etc. for which we would require them to undertake certain tests. After first screening is complete and test results are out, we should be able to inject the first batch any day between Thursday and Saturday,” said Dr Rai.The investigators intend to inject at least five selected people in a day.“Five is what we are looking at, but it will not go beyond 15 volunteers in a day. It will be too premature to say when the results will start showing. The process takes its time,” said Dr Rai.Covaxin has been jointly developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech International Limited.The virus strain for Covaxin was isolated at ICMR-National Institute of Virology in Pune, and transferred to the company on May 9.The Drugs Controller General of India granted approval for Phase I and II human trials for safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate on June 29.“…. Covaxin initiated phase-1 clinical trials across the country on 15th July 2020. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 375 volunteers in India,” the company said in a statement on Saturday.Apart from Covaxin, the other indigenous vaccine candidate, ZyCov-D, that has received drugs controller’s nod for early human trials is from pharma company Zydus. The human trials for ZyCov-D began last week. Experts say eventually it is a vaccine that will work in breaking the Covid-19 transmission cycle.“Government has taken several steps such as bringing in lockdown to ensure the disease spread is curtailed. The vaccine, however, is going to be the ultimate tool in our fight against the disease. A good vaccine is the most cost-effective way of preventing a disease,” said Dr Amita Jain, head, microbiology department, King George’s Medical University, Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-to-start-covaxin-trial-this-week/story-VyEWHfghVVmRtdLZAIEyjP.html
20-07-2020||India||No intention of new land transfer: Jammu and Kashmir||The Jammu and Kashmir government on Sunday clarified that it had no intention of transferring any new land to the armed forces or declare land outside military cantonments as strategic.The clarification came after the union territory (UT) administration’s decision to notify some locations as “strategic areas” for the armed forces to enable construction activity there. The decision triggered outrage among political parties who have termed it an attempt to disempower the people and turn the UT into a military establishment. The UT’s administrative council on Friday approved the proposal to amend the Control of Building Operations Act, 1988, and the J&K Development Act, 1970 to provide a special dispensation for carrying out construction in strategic areas.“The decision has nothing to do with the transfer of any land to the armed forces. The transfer, both acquisition or requisition, continues to be governed by the existing law and the norms on the subject. There is no decision to either transfer any new land or declare areas outside cantonments or army land as strategic. In fact, it is the stated policy of the Government to regulate and harmonize the requirement of land by the armed forces to meet the competing demands of development and internal security, “ an official spokesman said on Sunday. The National Conference, People’s Democratic Party and People’s Conference have been critical of the amendments. “A few political parties are deliberately misleading people as if land is being transferred to armed forces and entire J&K is being turned into a military establishment. It is being alleged that new areas are going to be declared as strategic where laws regulating development will not prevail. All these are baseless comments being made without reading facts, “ the spokesman said.The spokesman said that keeping in view the strategic importance of constructing infrastructure within a defined timeframe, it has been felt that a special mechanism needs to be put in place for such strategic infrastructure needs. “It simply means that in the so called notified “strategic areas”, within existing armed forces land, the responsibility of ensuring that construction activities are undertaken as per the developmental control regulation of the master plan and all environmental safeguards are observed, has been delegated to the Armed Forces themselves, “ the spokesman said. The political partie alleged that notifying ‘strategic areas’ was an attempt to unrecognisably alter the destiny of the people of Kashmir and construction activities in strategic areas is ruse to allow “demographic change.”The spokesman said that adequate safeguards have been kept to ensure that the provisions are not misused. “Only an army authority, not below the level of a corps commander, could make a request to the government for earmarking such area as strategic only for direct operational and training requirements of armed forces. Additionally, the government will satisfy itself about the reasons cited for declaring the areas as strategic area and will have such area notified accordingly, to the extent and with such conditions as may be required, “ the spokesman said. It said that the special dispensation neither gives any powers to the armed forces to acquire more land in the Jammu & Kashmir, nor does it allow them any unbridled powers without observing environmental safeguards and development control regulations.“ It only facilitates fast tracking of the construction of strategic assets, in the overall national interest, while observing all norms”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-intention-of-new-land-transfer-j-k/story-N4dyqsCjnAdYG2ce8kwy3J.html

On the prime minister’s call sheet were the chief ministers of states such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Bihar, which have logged nearly 300,000 cases between themselves, Assam, where devastating floods have displaced 2.5 million and killed 85, and the Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.In Uttarakhand, PM asked chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat about the condition of soldiers infected with the virus and discussed ways to curb its spread, said a top state government official. On Sunday, Rawat announced that 110 army personnel had tested positive for the virus. “PM Modi spoke to CM Rawat in the afternoon in which he enquired about the health condition of the army personnel affected by Covid-19 virus. During the conversation, he [Modi] asked him [Rawat] to provide every possible help to the army personnel in treatment with proper coordination between the state government and army,” said the official quoted above on condition of anonymity. Rawat assured the PM of all possible help to the soldiers and said, according to the official, “We are in constant touch with the army authorities and providing them all the facilities required in treatment.”Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal said Modi assured all support to the north-eastern state in dealing with the floods and landslides. The PM also inquired about the Covid situation and the ongoing efforts to douse the blaze at Oil India’s Baghjan gas well that has been burning for six weeks, the CM added.“Hon’ble PM Shri @narendramodi ji took stock of the contemporary situation regarding #AssamFloods2020, #COVID19 and Baghjan Oil Well fire scenario over phone this morning,” Sonowal tweeted. “Expressing his concern & solidarity with the people, the PM assured all support to the state,” he said. The state has around 22,000 coronavirus infections. The conversation between Modi and Tamil Nadu chief minister Edapaddi K Palaniswami centred around Covid, which has infected 170,000 people in the state. During the phone conversation, Palaniswami apprised Modi that the state was conducting 48,000 tests daily – the highest in the country – an official release said.The PM was briefed about infection prevention measures and information related to treatment for people who test positive.

20-07-2020||India||Hyderabad encounter: Judicial panel moves Supreme Court for more time||A judicial commission, which the Supreme Court has set up to investigate the alleged encounter killings of four rape-murder accused on the outskirts of Hyderabad in December 2019, has filed a plea seeking more time to complete the probe that it said was impacted due to Covid-19 and the lockdown announced in March-end to contain its spread.In its application filed on July 16, the three-member commission headed by retired Supreme Court judge Justice VS Sirpurkar requested the top the court to extend the deadline by six more months. As things stand now, the deadline ends on September 3.“Even though the work of the commission is continuing, the same could not be completed because of the prevailing pandemic situation…Therefore, the inquiry commission is constrained to apply for an extension of time of six months from the date the commission is able to function with physical hearings, spot inspections etc.,” the application said.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde set up the panel on December 12 after two lawyers — GS Mani and Pradeep Kumar Yadav — approached the apex court seeking an independent probe into the killings of the four men accused of raping and murdering a 26-year-old veterinarian on the outskirts of Hyderabad on November 27.The court asked the panel, also comprising former Bombay high court judge Rekha Baldota and former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director DR Karthikeyan, to complete its probe and submit a report within six months from the date of its first sitting. The commission held its first sitting on February 3 and the deadline, as per the Supreme Court order, for submitting its report will expire on September 3.The commission was scheduled to meet on March 23 and 24, but the meetings were cancelled in view of the pandemic and the lockdown. India announced a nationwide lockdown on March 25, and it continued in different phases for 68 days.The plea also pointed out that the commission has its office within the Telangana high court complex and that the high court’s regular administrative and judicial work has been put on hold due to Covid -19.“These circumstances hindered the sittings of the commission since the three members of the commission reside in different cities and the place of enquiry is in a wholly different city,” the plea said.“The Government of India has extended the lockdown from time to time, severely affecting the inter-state movement. Though the lockdown restrictions have been relaxed now, the situation in Hyderabad has further deteriorated. Several persons working in the premises allocated to the commission were found to be Covid positive. There are no other premises available for the commission to hold hearings. Travel between states is still not feasible because of the increasing rates of infection,” the application said.The commission, however, clarified that though its sittings were affected, its functioning was not completely halted. The collection of records, documents and evidence continued, the plea said.The commission’s lawyer, K Parameshwar, declined to comment.Lawyer GS Mani, who approached the top court demanding an independent inquiry, said: “The lockdown due to Covid-19 was unforeseen and a reasonable extension of time can be given to the commission to complete the probe. It is up to the court to decide how much time should be given to finish the inquiry. My only concern is there should be speedy justice.”Officials in Telangana have insisted that the four men — Mohammed Areef, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen Kumar and Chintakunta Chenna Keshavulu — were killed in an exchange of fire on December 6 after they snatched weapons from policemen after they were taken to the crime scene for the reconstruction of the incident. The killings created uproar with various rights groups and members of the legal fraternity calling it a fake encounter and demanding an independent probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-encounter-judicial-panel-moves-sc-for-more-time/story-5TJADyiK2ctfaydPPnjBXJ.html
20-07-2020||India||In a first, law student gets mother’s name added to degree certificate||A law student has succeeded in getting her mother’s name added to her provisional degree certificate after the private university, from which she graduated, originally provided her with a certificate that carried her father’s name alone.The student, Samrita Shankar, who graduated with a BBA LLB (Hons.), originally received her provisional certificate on July 10 carrying her father’s name alone as is the common practice.The certificate read, “This is to certify that Samrita Shankar, the ward of Shankar Narasimhan....”.Shankar requested the examinations officer to include the names of both her parents, but she was informed that it would not be possible since the practice until then was to mention the father’s name alone. Shankar then wrote an email to the dean of the university the same day, highlighting the issue. “When I first received my provisional degree, I noticed something odd in it; it included only my father’s name and not both my parents’ names. Considering that this was a special milestone in my academic life, I wanted to see both my parents’ names because they have been equal contributors in the successful completion of my law degree. Upon doing some research on this, I found out that this was a practice adopted by most universities in India. It is easy to look over such rules and practices as harmless, but they may actually have a huge impact on how gender equality is perceived in society. In the war against gender inequality, fighting the smaller battles is as important as fighting the bigger ones”, Shankar told HT.The dean responded to Shankar’s email within half an hour, thanking Shankar for drawing the attention to the issue, and also said that he had already given instructions to university officials to make necessary changes and to issue her a revised certificate with Shankar’s mother’s name as well.Shankar got her revised certificate within five days on July 15.“I am extremely thankful to my university administration for immediately implementing these changes. I hope other universities also take note of this and bring about the necessary changes in all academic procedures”, Shankar said.In her letter to the dean, Shankar also pointed to a directive issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 1998 after taking note of the discriminatory nature of the practice of including the father’s name alone in the degree certificate of a student. The directive stated that all universities and affiliated colleges must clearly include the student’s name, the father’s name and the mother’s name in all academic testimonials.The letter also said the archaic practice was a blow to efforts to achieve gender equality.“In today’s world, mothers are equally working hard and contributing (financially and otherwise) towards their child’s development and education. Therefore, continuing with an anachronistic practice such as only including the father’s name in educational procedures and certificates is not only a step-back in achieving gender equality, but also disrespectful to single/unwed/divorced mothers and their children”, she wrote in her letter.Shankar requested the University to change the practice and to give students the option to decide whether or not the degree certificate should bear the names of both parents.“Yes, Samrita, you are absolutely right and we have already changed this practice. I have told the Controller’s officer to correct this grave error and ensure that we re-issue a revised provisional certificate immediately. Thank you for bringing this to our notice, a problem that we decided to address in the last few days”, the dean said in his response to Shankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-law-student-gets-mother-s-name-added-to-degree-certificate/story-3LYGPX4n5R1RRuCKugAYoO.html
20-07-2020||India||Indian railways to introduce private trains in phases||Indian Railways plans to introduce private trains on its network in phases, with the first dozen due to start running in the 2023-24 financial year and all 151 by 2027, officials aware of the plan said on condition of anonymity.According to the railway ministry’s projections, the transporter will select the companies that will run the private trains by April 2021; the first 12 are expected to start plying by 2023-24, followed by 45 more in FY 2024-25, the next 50 in FY 2025-26 and the last 44 by 2026-27.“It may be noted that private trains are slated to run from March 2023 only. Tenders will be finalised by March 2021 and Trains will operate from March 2023,” the railway ministry said in a statement on Sunday.The railway ministry on July 1 began the formal process of allowing private trains on 109 routes -- a process that aims to, for the first time, to open up one of the government’s most prominent enterprises that has in recent decades been outpaced by the demands of a rapidly growing economy.The ministry issued what is known as a request for qualification (RFQ) private companies to run 151 trains spread over these routes, laying down specific conditions that will need to be met in a move that is meant to “introduce modern technologies and world class services” for one of India’s most popular modes of transport.The railway ministry plans to run the trains along 12 clusters across Indian Railways’s network. It has planned two clusters each it Delhi and Mumbai, and one cluster each in Secunderabad, Chennai, Howrah, Jaipur, Prayagraj, Chandigarh, Bengaluru, and Patna. According to the ministry, the planned investment will come to around ₹30,000 crore, and a majority of the rakes (70%) will have o be manufactured in India; private entities cleared to run the train services shall be responsible for financing, procuring, operating and maintaining the trains.“The investment by private sector will enable Indian Railways to spend its existing resources for accelerated development of railway infrastructure in the north-eastern states, other socially, economically backward regions and also upgrade its existing infrastructure for running more trains and at higher speed,” an official said.The trains will be designed to run at a maximum speed of 160 kmph. The ministry expects a reduction in journey time by around 10-15% at 130 kmph and around 30% at 160 kmph. Initially, they will run at 130 kmph and are slated to run at 160 kmph by March 2024.“The private entity shall pay to Indian Railways fixed haulage charges, energy charges as per actual consumption and a share in gross revenue determined through a transparent bidding process. Railways is expected to receive total haulage charges of around Rs. 3,000 crore per annum from operation of these 151 trains,” the official cited above added.Railways is currently operating in losses in the passenger segment, and the national carrier aims to meet its expenditure through a minimum guaranteed cost that the private train operator will have to pay to the national carrier.Fares will be based on competition with other modes of transport in the same segment, including airfares and fares of air-conditioned buses.“Railways have been progressively moving towards having a greater role for private sector. This move of getting the private sector to run 151 trains is an excellent development, with not only private capital moving into railways, but also the benefit of fresh talent and expertise being injected into the railways. However, Railways needs to commit to service-level agreements (SLAs) to the private players so that the private players can in turn provide dependable services,” said Jaijit Bhattacharya, president of the Centre for Digital Economy Policy Research (C- DEP), a think tank||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pvt-trains-to-be-introduced-in-phases/story-DxeVrUhn7uT97DvHYQKSBO.html
20-07-2020||India||After row, Bulandshahr violence accused removed from NGO||A key suspect in the 2018 mob violence in which a police inspector was killed in Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr has been expelled from an organisation that oversees the prime minister’s welfare schemes.Shikhar Agarwal’s expulsion on Saturday from the Pradhan Mantri Jan Kalyankari Yojna Jagrukta Abhiyan came after a photograph showing him with a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader went viral. In the photograph, he was purportedly being felicitated by Bulandshahr BJP president Anil Sisodia at an event on July 14.Agarwal and five others are accused in the 2018 Bulandshahr violence in which police inspector Subodh Kumar Singh died after he was attacked by a mob armed with firearms and sharp weapons. The officer had gone to the area to restore calm after violence had erupted over rumours of cow slaughter. The accused is currently out on bail.“I came to know from media that Shikhar was an accused in the violence that killed inspector Subodh. The matter was discussed with the organisation’s senior officials and Shikhar has been expelled. Now, he has no association with the organisation,” said Priyatam Kumar Prem, district president of the Jan Kalyankari Yojna Jagrukta Abhiyan, Bulandshahr. Prem also claimed that BJP’s Bulandshahar district unit president Sisodia was present at the function as chief guest and the PMJYJA had no links with the BJP. Other BJP leaders also distanced themselves from Agarwal after widespread criticism.Interestingly, names of members of advisory panel of the body overseeing implementation of the PM’s welfare schemes belie the claims of BJP leaders that the organisation and the party had no links.It includes names of senior party leaders and ministers like Shyam Jaju, Ramesh Pokhariyal Nishank, Narendra Tomar, Giriraj Singh and Dharmendra Pradhan, among others.Congress leader and member of party’s strategic and planning committee Imran Masood said, “Appointing a violence accused to an important post was an attempt to glorify him, which can’t be accepted”. Agarwal was associated with the youth wing of the BJP in Syana town of Bulandshahar and was named one of the accused in the Bulandshahr violence along with Yogesh Raj of the Bajrang Dal and other leaders of Hindu organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-row-bulandshahr-violence-accused-removed-from-ngo/story-xEqgTlXhS3LFBzTTJMUivM.html
20-07-2020||India||Rajasthan cops reach Haryana to quiz rebel Congress legislator||A team of the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police reached Haryana’s Manesar on Sunday night to quiz rebel Congress legislator Bhanwarlal Sharma, who has been booked in connection with an audio tape related to an alleged plan to topple the Rajasthan government, officials said. The team went to a resort where it suspects the rebel Congress MLAs are staying, but was allowed to enter the premises by the hotel management, according people aware of the developments. The team was asked to come back in the morning.“Acting on a tip-off, a team has been sent to Manesar to quiz Sharma. A notice has been sent to the residence of Sharma in Churu and Jaipur,” said Ashok Rathore, additional director general of police, SOG. “Important details have been obtained from [alleged middleman Sanjay] Jain. We are verifying that,” Rathore added.Jain was arrested on Friday night on charges of offering money to Congress and independent MLAs with an aim to dislodge the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan. A court in Jaipur remanded Jain to four days in police custody on Saturday.He received Rs 100 crore from an unidentified mastermind to lure three lawmakers, said an official of SOG, which is probing the case.The SOG official said Jain, Ashok Singh and Bharat Malani – all suspected middlemen — were arrested in the case. Another police officer said: “Messages which talked about arranging money in crore of rupees have been obtained. We are trying to find out the main source of the entire game plan.”SOG has filed three FIRs. On Saturday, three officers from the crime branch of the state and one from Jaipur city police were roped in to investigate the case along with SOG.BJP spokesperson Pankaj Meena said the Congress laid a trap to defame the BJP. “Jain had been block president of the Congress in Bikaner and has nothing to do with our party,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cops-reach-haryana-to-quiz-rebel-congress-legislator/story-NRzwPi5weBrFpmisbvYHlO.html
20-07-2020||India||Congress demands Shekhawat’s resignation, BJP hits back||The Congress demanded the resignation of Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat over the political crisis in Rajasthan on Sunday, reiterating its allegation that he is involved in a plot to topple the state government.Shekhawat, a BJP parliamentarian from Jodhpur, has no moral authority to continue in office and he should resign to ensure that the probe is not influenced, Congress leader Ajay Maken said.Rajasthan’s ruling Congress says Shekhawat’s voice can be heard in audio tapes purportedly recording conversations detailing a plot to topple the state government. Shekhawat denies the charge and says he is ready for a probe.At a press conference, Maken, who is visiting Jaipur as a Congress observer, said Rajasthan Police’s Anti-Corruption Bureau has registered a case over the audio tapes and named Gajendra Singh, rebel Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma and alleged middleman Sanjay Jain, who has been arrested. Separately, the police’s Special Operations Group (SOG) has filed three first information reports, or FIRs, in connection with the case.“If Union minister Gajendra Singh claims that it is not his voice [in the clips], and the reference in the audio clip is to some other Gajendra Singh, then why is he afraid of giving voice sample?” Maken asked.One of the FIRs filed by the SOG does not identify “Gajendra Singh” as Union minister Shekhawat.Maken also alleged that the police in Haryana and Delhi were giving protection to rebel Congress MLAs from Rajasthan.CM Ashok Gehlot is locked in a power tussle with former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who has the backing of 18 Congress legislators and three independents. These MLAs are believed to be camping in Gurugram.Maken also asked why a team of the Rajasthan Police was “stopped by the Haryana Police” on Friday while trying to take voice samples of Congress MLAs Sharma and Vishvendra Singh at a Gurugram hotel.Maken, who has come to Jaipur as a Congress observer, said it is the betrayal of people’s mandate and the murder of democracy if an elected government is toppled with money power.“If the BJP has no role in it, then why the MLAs took shelter in the party-ruled Haryana?” he asked.While the BJP has sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into what it called a “saga of illegalities and concocted lies”, the Congress says the demand amounted to “admission of guilt”.Hitting back, BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the Congress has no right to ask for Shekhawat’s resignation.He said the state government “violated the Constitution” and illegally tapped phones, adding that there is no question of giving a voice sample when the audio tapes are illegal. “The government should prove its mandate and stop misguiding people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-demands-shekhawat-s-resignation-bjp-hits-back/story-v8GtkklWVkxrtonbRuNnfK.html
20-07-2020||India||Confident that PM Modi will come for bhumi pujan: Nritya Gopal Das||Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust chairman Mahant Nritya Gopal Das’s long wait for construction of the Ram temple to begin will end with the bhumi pujan ceremony likely to place on August 5. Das wrote an emotional letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, requesting him to visit Ayodhya for the ceremony. It was after this letter that the Prime Minister’s Office sought tentative dates from the trust for PM Modi’s Ayodhya visit for the bhumi pujan. Now, with the PM likely to visit Ayodhya on August 5 for the ceremony, Das is close to seeing his dream being fulfilled. The Mahant wants a bhumi pujan on lines of the one performed for the Somnath temple in Gujarat.A day after the trust, formed to construct the Ram temple in Ayodhya, held a meeting, Das, who heads the trust, spoke in an interview with Hindustan Times. Excerpts from the interviewYou always wanted a grand bhumi pujan for the Ram temple. But will the Covid-19 pandemic keep the ceremony low-key?We had planned a grand bhumi pujan for Ram temple like the one organised for the Somnath temple. Then President of India Rajendra Prasad and home minister Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel attended the Somanth temple bhumi pujan. The ceremony continued for three days. It was a grand and elaborate event. We wanted something like this. But due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this is not possible now. After much effort, we were able to get the PM’s consent to attend the bhumi pujan.The tentative date for bhumi pujan is August 5. But if due to some unavoidable circumstances, the PM is not able to visit Ayodhya, what will the trust do?We are confident that the PM will definitely come to Ayodhya for the bhumi pujan.However, if due to some unavoidable circumstances and national issues, the PM is not able to come to Ayodhya on August 5 for bhumi pujan then, in the nation’s interest, we will delay the ceremony and will wait for the PM’s visit. Finally, has the trust agreed to make changes in the existing model of the proposed Ram temple?The Ram temple model prepared by VHP (Vishva Hindu Parishad) in 1989 will not be changed. It will remain the same. Ram temple will be constructed on the existing model. But some additions have been made to the temple’s model and that is what saints had been demanding. Now, the temple’s height will be 161 metres instead of 128 metres. The number of domes has been increased from three to five. Ram temple’s chief architect Chandrakant Sompura has approved these changes. A grand Ram temple will be constructed. In the meeting (Trust meeting on Saturday), we also discussed these changes.Will stone slabs lying at Shri Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas Karyashala be used in construction of the Ram temple?Yes. All stone slabs carved at the Karyashala will be used in construction of the Ram temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/confident-the-pm-will-come-for-bhumi-pujan-nritya-gopal-das/story-TfN1iXjjsFkmXrPXkNOpMM.html
20-07-2020||India||Ayodhya gears up for 3-day rituals to start temple work||Hindu religious figures in Ayodhya plan to organise three days of Vedic rituals starting on August 3 and ending with the bhumi pujan on August 5 that will mark the start of construction of a Ram temple in the holy town.Prime Minister Narendra Modi may lay the foundation stone for the temple at around 12.15 pm on August 5, the religious figures said.“Timings for foundation laying ceremony for the Prime Minister has been decided according to Hindu calendar and the most auspicious time (12.15 pm) on August 5 has been selected,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, heir to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, formed to oversee the temple construction. An official communication from the Prime Minister’s Office on his Ayodhya visit is yet to be released, he added.Vedic rituals for bhumi pujan will start on August 3 with a special puja to Lord Ganesha. According to Hindu belief, every auspicious ceremony begins with offerings to Lord Ganesha. Next day, the priests will perform the Ramacharya puja. An 11-member team of priests (Acharya) from Varanasi and Ayodhya will perform the three-day rituals. In the entire ceremony, priests from Varanasi, which is parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Modi, will play a prominent role.On his visit to Ayodhya, Modi is likely to remain in temple town for two hours.“PM’s visit will be short and will only be confined to bhumi pujan,” said Mahant Nritya Kamal Nayan Das, who was also present at the Trust’s meeting in Ayodhya on Saturday.On the occasion, chief minister Yogi Adityanath will also be present. Only a select few will be present at the bhumi pujan because of the Covid-19 pandemic.According to members of the Trust, PM Modi is also likely to announce projects for Ayodhya worth several thousand crore during his visit to Ayodhya.Chief minister Adityanath has already instructed senior officials of the state government to prepare a proposal for Ayodhya’s development which will be forwarded to the Centre.Ram temple construction committee chairman Nripendra Misra, who is also considered the PMO’s emissary on Ayodhya, was in the temple town for three days to discuss essential matters related to the construction of the temple ahead of what will be Modi’s maiden visit to Ayodhya .Misra reached Ayodhya late on July 15 evening. He left on Sunday morning after paying obeisance at the Hanuman Garhi temple.“During his stay in Ayodhya, Nripendra Misra examined pre-construction activity carried out at the Ram Janmabhoomi till date. He also discussed all important aspects related to construction of Ram temple and PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Ayodhya for bhumi pujan of the Ram temple,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das.Engineers of Larsen and Toubro, the company that will construct the Ram temple, and Nikhil Sompura, son of chief architect Chandrakant Sompura, were also present in Ayodhya.

The PLA warships also enter the Indian Ocean through Malacca Straits and operate in the international waters.After the Galwan flare-up in East Ladakh, the Indian Navy’s forward posture has ensured that three PLA Navy warships have taken to safe waters in Gulf of Aden, off the coast of Djibouti and three other warships have exited through Malacca Straits to home base. “A Chinese warship which was entering through Indonesia towards the Indian Ocean also turned back as the Indian forces were fully prepared for any contingency,” said a senior commander.Also Read: Apex China Study Group reviews East Ladakh: Key stand-off points record withdrawalThe PLA Navy has acquired a string of ports in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran and east Africa to not only contain the Indian Navy but also challenge the presence of US Central Command forces as well as French and British Navy. Beijing has 70 per cent stake in Kyaukpyu port in Myanmar, which sits in the Bay of Bengal, Hambanthota port in South Sri Lanka dominates the Indian Ocean, Gwadar port in Pakistan sits on the mouth of Gulf of Oman and the port of Jask in Iran is located on the edge of Persian Gulf. While the countries in which these ports are may justify the Chinese tie-up due to push by the US, fact is that all these ports have been acquired through huge infusion of cash and muscle. With the PLA Navy moving full speed to acquire blue water navy status, it is only a matter of time that the global trade will be at mercy of the Chinese warships.Also Read: US backs ASEAN on South China Sea, challenges China’s predatory world viewWith a clear understanding of the Chinese posture, the Indian national security planners are working towards building of advance landing grounds in some of the 1062 islands under its sovereignty. Rather than buy more aircraft carriers, the Indian plan is to totally upgrade the military facilities in Andaman Nicobar Islands on eastern seaboard as well as Lakshadweep on western seaboard. To counter the Chinese threat, the plan is to have a network of Indian airbases on these islands in both Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal so that freedom of navigation and overflights is maintained and not restricted like in South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-navy-s-forward-posture-against-pla-aggression-in-ladakh-muscles-out-chinese-threat-on-high-seas/story-mRYUXdkrCmGQznQod5lWFK.html
