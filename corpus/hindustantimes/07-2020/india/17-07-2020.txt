The question is whether the week-long festival can be organized with pomp and grandeur as it provides livelihood to lakhs of people. We are being optimistic and have prepared the guidelines with the presumption that the festival will be held,” said Saswata Basu, general secretary of the Forum for Durgotsab and general secretary of one of the big-budget pujas in north Kolkata.Out of the 4,500-odd community pujas held in the city, the forum has under its banner more than 370 of the most prominent and biggest pujas, including the ones that are patronized by some senior ministers of the ruling Trinamool Congress government Even Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was apparently keen on organizing the festival this year despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Lakhs of people hit the streets every day during the festival hopping from one pandal to another. “Durga Puja is coming. We have to organize it. For that we have to stay fit from now,” she had said on Wednesday while addressing local clubs to ensure that every citizen wears masks so that the virus could be checked.This year Durga Puja begins on October 22 and ends on October 26. Mahalaya, an occasion that usually precedes Puja by a week, falls on September 17 this year. “The 17-point code prepared by the forum also calls for offering only whole fruits to the goddess, less of interior decoration and more airy pandals which can be seen from outside, thermal guns and sanitizers to be kept at pandals. No visitors would be allowed without wearing a face mask,” said Partha Ghosh, a member of the forum’s executive committee and general secretary of one of the prominent pujas in south Kolkata. The forum members will soon approach the state government with the proposed guidelines but believe that it has already reached the Chief Minister as she had expressed her keenness on organ sing the festival a day after the guidelines were circulated among the members of the forum.“It is too early to say and forecast anything on how the situation could pan out in October-end. Situations are evolving very fast and Covid-19 cases are rising,” said a senior official of the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/durga-puja-organisers-frame-norms-on-how-to-hold-week-long-festival-amid-covid-19/story-VR9csRIP1QHT1JCAJZVrJM.html
17-07-2020||India||SC, high court nod for demolition of Telangana secretariat building complex||The Telagana government’s plan to demolish the existing secretariat building complex in Hyderabad cleared all legal hurdles on Friday with both Supreme Court and state high court dismissing the public interest litigation petitions challenging the demolition.In the morning, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition filed by Congress MLC T Jeevan Reddy challenging the demolition of the old secretariat buildings and construction of new official complex in their place at a cost of around Rs 500 crore.The apex court made it clear that the construction of the secretariat was a prerogative of the state government and it would not interfere in the policy matter. “The verdict comes as a slap on the faces of those who are opposed to the construction of a new state-of-the-art integrated Secretariat complex,” an official release from the chief minister’s office said.In the afternoon, the state high court also gave the green signal for the demolition of the existing secretariat buildings by dismissing a PIL filed by activists P L Vishweshwar Rao and Cheruku Sudhakar.A division bench of the high court comprising chief justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and justice B Vijayasen Reddy did not agree with the argument put forth by the petitioners that the government had not taken the environmental clearance from the Centre for demolition of the secretariat buildings.The petitioners argued that the demolition was causing huge environmental pollution, posing threat to the lives of the people in the present coronavirus pandemic situation.On behalf of the central government, assistant solicitor general N Rajeshwar Rao submitted an affidavit to the court stating that the state government did not require prior environmental clearance to demolish any buildings, but required permissions only for new constructions.Telangana state advocate general B S Prasad submitted to the court that the state government would take all necessary permissions while taking up construction of new buildings.The division bench, which heard both the arguments, agreed with the assistant Solicitor General that there was no need for clearance from the Union environment ministry and upheld the decision taken by the state cabinet.While giving the approval to the government to go ahead with the demolition of the secretariat buildings after taking all the permissions, the high court bench, however, cautioned the authorities to continue the works keeping in view the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the city.The new secretariat complex is expected to cost Rs 500 crore and will be equipped with state-of-the-art connectivity and other features.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-high-court-nod-for-demolition-of-telangana-secretariat-building-complex/story-PAicdRSz9tsvcMMjwSZVML.html
17-07-2020||India||Political blame game over flooding of Osmania General Hospital begins||The inundation of the 110-year old Osmania General Hospital on the banks of Musi river in Hyderabad two days ago causing innumerable hardships for patients led to a political slugfest between the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the opposition parties on Friday.Even as hospital authorities shifted several patients to the first floor and the hospital sanitation staff and the GHMC personnel cleaned the wards and sprayed disinfectants, political leaders and their followers swarmed the hospital to take stock of the situation on Thursday and Friday.Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy, Bharatiya Janata Party state president Bandi Sanjay and TRS minister T Srinivasa Yadav were among those who visited the hospital and spoke to the patients about the difficulties they faced due to heavy rains.Health minister Etala Rajender blamed the opposition parties for the sorry state of affairs in Osmania Hospital. He reminded that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had proposed to construct a state-of-the-art multi-storeyed hospital complex in place of the existing old structure.“He had personally visited the hospital and observed that the century-old structure was in a dilapidated state, posing danger to the patients. But the same opposition parties, who are now raising a hue and cry over rainwater entering the hospital premises, had stalled the proposal,” Rajender said.The minister said the demolition of the old building was stonewalled by environmentalists and heritage conservationists as a result of which the proposal was dropped. “We had no option but to continue the hospital in the same building after undertaking some repairs,” he said.Rajender explained that the rainwater had entered into OGH premises due to a block in the storm water drain connecting Begum Bazar with Musi passing beneath the hospital building. “We have cleared the block and are now finding a permanent solution to see that the problem does not recur,” he said.PCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy held the chief minister responsible for the pathetic conditions at the OGH. “The submergence of wards, especially during the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, reflects the attitude of the KCR government towards public health,” he said.He said the estimates and blue print for construction of a new building in the same OGH complex at a cost of Rs 500 crore have been pending for approval since 2017. “The chief minister should drop the plan for demolition of the state secretariat complex and start constructing a new building for the OGH while protecting the heritage structure,” he said.BJP’s official spokesman K Krishna Sagar Rao said the inundation of OHG with rain and sewerage water reflected the mis-governance and criminal negligence of the TRS government.“It was true that the opposition parties and many civil society organizations obstructed the demolition of the 110-year old heritage building, but the BJP had neither objected nor would ever object, if the state government were to build a new building elsewhere for relocation of Osmania General Hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-blame-game-over-flooding-of-osmania-general-hospital-begins/story-v6ZnIsurDFafqkxsgsBgRM.html
17-07-2020||India||Unlock 2.0: Pet salons and vets call for caution, avoid crowding||Pet parents living in zones where the access to pet parlours and veterinarian services are allowed, had started thronging the parlours as soon as they reopened post lockdown. But then the influx of pet parents lead to overcrowding of these places. Now, most of the pet clinics and grooming salons, which are operational, have decided to take to strict precautionary measures. “To avoid over crowding, we have been asking all our clients to make prior appointments. No walk in is being entertained, unless it’s an emergency. Additionally, it’s also the responsibility of people to check their temperatures and ensure that they don’t come out from a hotspot just to visit a groomer,” says veterinarian Santosh Kumar who has clinics in Gurugram and Delhi. In the present phase of unlock, when most are expected to stay indoors and avoid the spread of Covid-19, many pet parents — who are tired of grooming their pets by themselves in the last three-four months — are visiting pet salons in desperation. The grooming salons that are open, have resorted to strictly practising social distancing. Akshay Mahendru, owner of a pet salon, says, “We are doing grooming on appointment basis only, and allotting slots for each pet parent, who can get the service done and move out without coming in contact with another person. Only the pet goes inside, and the parents can wait in the car or go buy groceries. We don’t want them to wait in the facility.” Pet groomers have also been advising pet parents to clean their pets clean before they venture out for a salon visit. “When you leave your home, wipe your dog’s collar and leash with an antibacterial wipe or soapy water and then make them get into your car. When you reach the salon or clinic for your dog’s appointment, ensure that you are the only client being allowed inside. Avoid getting inside if there are customers waiting for the place to be vacant. Ensure that you and the clinic staff are wearing masks and gloves at all times, and sanitizer is available for use,” advises Preeti Sood, a Delhi-based pet groomer, adding, “For grooming, it’s advisable to leave your dog in the care of your groomer and come back to pick up once the grooming is over. Upon returning, don’t go inside the salon and wait for the staff to get your dog to the car. Use digital payment options to avoid contact.”Kumar opines, “Dogs haven’t been proved as biological carriers of coronavirus. However, we need to ensure to dab a little bit of sanitiser and run it through our pets’ body and their paws, each time you are back from your visit to the vet or groomer. Ensure that you also wipe down the leash and the collar again.”Follow more on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/unlock-2-0-pet-salons-and-vets-call-for-caution-avoid-crowding/story-YXBQ1AGGkXu59MkN8I6cdP.html
17-07-2020||India||Air India defends decision to implement leave without pay, calls it a ‘win-win’ one for staff||Defending its decision to implement ‘leave without pay’ (LWP) for its employees due to the Covid-19 pandemic, national carrier Air India on Friday referred to its scheme as a ‘win-win situation’ for both parties. It said that the while the scheme on the one hand gives freedom to its employees to engage themselves with another employer for the said period, the airline is able to save its cash flow on the other hand.This comes after the national carrier was flooded with letters of criticism from its employees from all sections.The airline said that in a challenging financial situation, it is taking recourse to several initiatives with a view to ensure that its flight operations continue. The LWP scheme was introduced on Tuesday and according to the airline enables employees to avail the benefits of proceeding on leave without pay on voluntary basis. “It has been introduced for grant of leave without pay and allowances for permanent employees for a period of six months/two years, which is extendable upto 5 years,” the airline stated. Recalling previous instances, Air India said that it had brought out similar LWP schemes in September 1998, in June 2009 and in August 2009 and employees had availed of the LWP scheme. However, this time the addition in this scheme as compared to the earlier LWP scheme is that the airline management can pass an order requiring the employees to go on compulsory leave for a period of six months to two years, which is extendable upto five years.The airline spokesperson said, “In the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, there may be employees who are unable to attend their office duties in person on account of personal reasons. The LWP scheme enables employees to take a break from their office responsibility for a defined period of time with the approval of the management, while retaining their employment with the company. They will continue to avail facilities such as passage, medical and housing at specified rates.”As on April 2020, Air India had over 14,000 employees that included around 1,800 pilots and around 4,000 cabin crew. Justifying the scheme, the spokesperson also said that the LWP scheme provides opportunity to employees to take up alternative employment with the approval of the management during the period of the said leave. “The LWP scheme is a win-win situation for both the management as well as employees as it provides flexibility to employees and simultaneously reduces the wage bill for the company. The Covid-19 outbreak has very seriously impacted the aviation sector and currently, the airline operations of the company are a small fraction of the prior Covid-19 level operations,” said a senior AI official. Disagreeing with the management, a senior airline official said, “LWP scheme is to save money for the company not a weapon to settle scores with employees. This is going to affect the livelihood of many. Why doesn’t the airline make every employee of AI take LWP a few days every month? This way the burden can be shared. The motive of the top management is to save their money by snatching money from lower employees.” The airline, however, assured to use the scheme sparingly and with complete fairness, and said that the selected names of employees that can be sent on mandatory LWP will be implemented after assessing their performances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-defends-decision-to-implement-leave-without-pay-calls-it-a-win-win-one-for-staff/story-lTa8Kksic8tpTJfUAdIC7I.html
17-07-2020||India||PM Modi calls for ‘new type of human-centric globalisation’ at UN event||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday pressed member states of the United Nations to use the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic to reform the global multilateral system to enhance its relevance and effectiveness to make it the basis for a “new type of human-centric globalisation”.The United Nations was born 75 years ago to deal with the “furies” of the Second World War, the prime minister said addressing a high-level meeting of the UN Economic and Social Council. “Today the fury of the pandemic provides the context for its rebirth and reform. Let us not lose this chance.”As an incoming member of the UN Security Council, India will play its role in full support of the UN agenda, “with our deep commitment to maintaining global harmony, to improving socio-economic equity, and to preserving nature’s balance”, the prime minister in his virtual speech in English.This was the first time Modi had addressed UN members after India’s thumping victory in the June 17 election to the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member for a two-year term starting next January. India will get into the UNSC loop for documents and papers starting August, purely in an observer capacity to prepare it for its upcoming term.India has called for reforming the global multilateral system to reflect the changed realities of the contemporary world. It has campaigned for the reform of the UN Security Council to expand its permanent membership with a seat for itself. And it has also sought the reform of the IMF and other global bodies to make them more contemporaneous.“Today, while celebrating 75 years of the United Nations, let us pledge to reform the global multilateral system to enhance its relevance, to improve its effectiveness to make it the basis for a new type of human-centric globalisation,” Prime Minister Modi said renewing India’s call for reforms with an added emphasis on people, to make them more “human-centric”.The theme of the High-Level Segment of the ECOSOC, on the 75th Anniversary of the founding of the UN, was ”Multilateralism after COVID19: What kind of UN do we need at the 75th anniversary”. It was in tune with India’s continued for the reform of the UN system and priorities for the upcoming term at the Security Council: ’reformed multilateralism’ in a post-COVID-19 world. India had held the inaugural Presidency of ECOSOC (Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, in 1946), and Prime Minister Modi had delivered the keynote address virtually at the 70th anniversary of ECOSOC in January 2016.In his Friday address, PM Modi recalled India’s support to the ECOSOC and the UN’s developmental work, and how they are tied to India’s own domestic agenda. “Today, through our domestic efforts, we are again playing a salient role in achieving Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. India is also supporting other developing countries in meeting their Sustainable Development Goals,” he said.The prime minster went on to say, India’s motto of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwas” resonated, for instance, with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind. And he spoke at length efforts made in India to expand access to sanitation, bring about gender parity in elementary and higher education, and empowering women through financial inclusion.Modi said it was India health care system that had helped it fight the Covid-19 epidemic. India had the best recovery rate in the world, as a result, he added.On fighting climate change, the prime minister spoke of India cutting 38 million tonnes of carbon emission annually and went on to highlight its role in the setting up of the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.Modi also spoke about India’s role in the region as a “first responder”. India has extended medical and other assistance to over 150 countries in the fight against Covid, and had set up a SAARC Covid emergency fund for the neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-un-event-pm-modi-calls-for-new-type-of-human-centric-globalisation/story-vMI2uGlhp4N5RjuaWh0izJ.html

The ITBP has its presence on forward posts in Badahoti and Mana Pass.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat agreed to the requests and committed to work in coordination with ITBP for realization of the above stated objectives, according to an ITBP official.Officials in Uttarakhand CM’s office, who did not wish to be named, said that Rawat has cleared Rs 10 crore under chief minister border areas development project while instructing officials to ensure the state complemented the national developmental schemes for the region.“The CM told officials that creation of infrastructure and facilities will help in stopping migration from border areas. He added that stopping it was important from the point of view of the country’s security,” the officials quoted above said.Several defense and strategic experts have recently spoken about the need for increasing human settlements and tourism activities in border areas which could act as the second line of defense.The chief minister also instructed officials to urgently draft a project to provide power connection to ITBP posts in remote border areas in the state. He said the Central government will be requested to help set up mobile towers in these regions for uninterrupted communication. He also instructed the Dehradun district magistrate to make available 15 acre land for setting up of ITBP’s frontier headquarter, added officials.Chief minister assured ITBP DG that the government will make effective moves to increase people’s access to remote areas apart from taking measures to stop their migration.For promotion of adventure tourism in the area, the CM asked for creation of a working group including ITBP and state tourism officials that could work in tandem with the winter tourism cell of the state. The officials added that ITBP chief pointed out that civilian settlements in border areas become a big source of convenience for the forces. He underlined the fact that neighbouring countries have developed access to areas on their side of the border and India, too, should grant increased access using inner line permits. Currently permits are issued only for grazing of cattle in grasslands in these areas.The shepherds and herders are considered the second line of defence in parts of the border district and are crucial to the internal security.Last month, there were reports of the Chinese objecting to the efforts on the Indian side to improve infrastructure in the Lipulekh area near the border. Nepal, too, has raised objections to the new road to the Lipulekh pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itbp-chief-meets-uttarakhand-cm-with-second-line-of-defense-in-border-areas-in-mind/story-FCwmtE3BTWnohz0MLwJ2pM.html
17-07-2020||India||Stage set for Australia to be part of next Malabar exercise with India, US, Japan||The stage is set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the US and Japan, with people familiar with developments saying the wargame’s expansion will complement growing strategic and security cooperation among the four countries.The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, indicated Australia’s inclusion in the trilateral exercise is only a matter of time, given burgeoning security and defence ties between New Delhi and Canberra. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year.However, the formal invitation to Australia is expected to be extended after some time in view of the delicate negotiations between India and China on disengagement and de-escalation to end their standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the people said. They noted there is still some time to go for holding the exercise.It has also become clear that Australia will join the exercise if it is formally invited, one of the people cited above said.When India and the US initially sought to expand the Malabar exercise in 2007 by inviting Australia, Japan and Singapore to participate, the move had not gone down well with China. That was the first and only time Australia joined the naval drills, which were begun in 1994 to increase interoperability between the Indian and US navies and enhance cooperative security relations between the two sides.China has also been wary of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad that was revived in late 2017 by India, the US, Australia and Japan, and these suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level last year.At a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart Scott Morrison last month, India and Australia elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed the crucial Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) for reciprocal access to bases, medical and training facilities, spares and fuel.In light of these developments, experts say inviting Australia to join the Malabar exercise will be a welcome step. Rear Admiral (retired) Sudarshan Shrikhande, a military affairs expert, said the Quad is getting greater traction from member countries in the face of China’s growing belligerence in the western Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean and Himalayas.“We shouldn’t be worried about China’s sensitivities. We should be mindful of our own interests. Beijing doesn’t care for anyone’s sensitivities,” he said.The people cited above noted that defence and security forms a key part of the India-Australia relationship and both have zeroed in on the joint goal of promoting peace, security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. The bilateral AUSINDEX naval exercise, started in 2015, has also grown in complexity, and the third edition held last year was a “very complex” drill involving warships, submarines and aircraft from both sides.“This type of exercise indicates a very high level of comfort in operating together,” said another person who declined to be named.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said: “China sees such developments about the Malabar exercise as the four countries ganging up against it. But it is the Chinese who have given us a strong reason to include Australia in this exercise.“Besides, if the China factor doesn’t propel the four countries to come together, I don’t know what else will propel them to work more closely together in the region.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stage-set-for-australia-to-be-part-of-next-malabar-exercise-with-india-us-japan/story-bkfdSV0Vyk9qdoOIU6ztvO.html

We are mindful of our weight and responsibility. We know that if India succeeds in achieving its development objectives, it will go a long way in achievement of global goals. And so we have taken ‘whole-of-society’ approach- by engaging our States, our local governments, our civil society, communities and our people,” the PM said. UN general assembly had adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to be achieved by member nations by 2030.“India also contributed to shaping the ECOSOC agenda, including the Sustainable Development Goals. Today, through our domestic efforts, we are again playing a salient role in achieving Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.

In two areas, Poonthura and Pulluvila, community transmission has happened” said the CM.He said in Poonthura when 50 people were tested randomly, 26 tested positive, while in Pulluvila, 28 out of the 57 tested were found to be positive.The CM’s Kerala admission came on a day when the state reported another highest single-day spike of 791 new cases, taking the total infections so far since January 30 to 11,066. Of the infected, 6, 029 are active cases while 4,971 have recovered. The state has reported 40 deaths so far.Community transmission means that the disease is in its third stage and the source of its origin is not known. It is now present in the community and can infect people with no history - either of travel to or contact with infected people and areas. At this point, everyone is susceptible to catching it.Experts also say that in random testing, if more than half of the people test positive, then it can be called a community transmission.Kerala increased testing for the coronavirus disease only recently, but even now its rate is one of the lowest in the country. Till date, it has done less than four lakh tests while neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have reported triple the number.The state has tested 16,642 samples in the last 24 hours, said the CM on Friday.The chief minister also announced that triple lockdown will be imposed in coastal hamlets from Saturday to check further spread of coronavirus infection.“The coastal belt is facing a dire situation with the disease spreading very fast. We need to mobilise all our resources to deal with the situation,” he said. Of the new cases reported on Friday, 532 were through local transmission, the CM said during his evening briefing.“The number of locally-transmitted cases is increasing by the day because of negligence on the part of people. Going by the trend, one assessment is that disease control can only be achieved by the end of this year,” he said.As many as 1.78 lakh people are under observation, while 6,124 are in various hospitals, including 1,152 admitted on Friday.There are 285 hotspots in the state as of now.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-kerala-cm-confirms-community-transmission-of-covid-19/story-zGoyjgiUYmP521n0xKLTCM.html

17-07-2020||India||Karnataka CM rules out extending lockdown in Bengaluru as Covid-19 cases spiral||With Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru continuing to spiral - despite the state government imposing a week-long lockdown which began on July 14 - several leaders including BBMP Mayor Goutham Kumar of BJP and Congress working president Eshwar Khandre have sought an extension of the lockdown. Both of them said that the lockdown should be extended at least for two weeks to contain the current rapid spread of the virus.On Friday, Karnataka recorded 3,693 new Covid-19 cases taking the tally to 55,115 including 20,757 discharges and 115 deaths. Bengaluru recorded yet another day of more than two thousand cases in a single day taking the total active cases in the city to 20,623. The number of active cases in the capital city is nearly two-thirds of the total number of active cases in the state.Bengaluru Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao also earlier in the day had tweeted that he would undergo home quarantine for a period of four days before undergoing his fifth Covid-19 test in the last three months after his driver tested positive for the virus.However, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa who met ministers-in-charge of the eight zones of Bengaluru regarding Covid-19 management immediately ruled out an extension of the lockdown in the capital. “That (lockdown) is not a solution to contain Covid-19 and there is no such proposal to extend lockdown in the city,” he clarified.At the meeting with cabinet colleagues and officials, the CM directed them to remove all obstacles in the admission of infected people to hospitals. He also directed them to ensure the availability of treatment to Covid-19 as well as non- Covid-19 patients in private hospitals according to government guidelines.Meanwhile, JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy said that the government should immediately step in and address the demands of around 2000 contract Ayush doctors who have threatened to resign if their demands are not met. The Ayush doctors who are working on contract say that they are being paid Rs 20,000 a month against allopathic doctors who are being paid Rs 60,000 a month. The government has said that it is looking into their demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cm-rules-out-extending-lockdown-in-bengaluru-as-covid-19-cases-spiral/story-70nfjGINscSH3dpvSLuaOP.html
17-07-2020||India||Another Congress MLA quits in Madhya Pradesh, party blames the BJP||Another Madhya Pradesh Congress MLA Sumitra Devi Kasdekar (36), resigned on Friday from the state legislative assembly, becoming the second party MLA to quit within a week, taking the total number of Congress law-makers who have resigned since March to 24.Earlier, Pradyumn Singh Lodhi (52), who represented Malhara assembly constituency in Bundelkhand region, resigned on Sunday last. Like Lodhi, Savitri Devi is a first-timer legislator in the state assembly. She represents Nepanagar (ST) state assembly seat in Burhanpur district, according to the state assembly secretariat.Though Lodhi joined the BJP after quitting from the state assembly and was immediately appointed chairman of Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation by the BJP government in the state, there is no information about Savitri Devi’s next move.Also Read: In Rajasthan tangle, Congress names central minister, 2 FIRs filedState assembly principal secretary AP Singh confirmed the Congress MLA’s resignation.“MLA Sumitra Devi from Nepanagar (ST) state assembly constituency submitted her resignation at 3 pm today. The (protem) speaker has accepted the resignation with effect from July 17, 2020. Thus, the assembly seat has fallen vacant,” said Singh.Despite efforts, the MLA couldn’t be contacted for her comments. Her mobile phone was constantly found to be switched off.The state Congress, while admitting that Sumitra Devi had quit the party and resigned from the assembly, accused the BJP of indulging in the politics of horse trading.Also Read: Infighting in HP Congress: Disciplinary panel to decide fate of dozen leadersState Congress president Kamal Nath’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Sumitra Devi has left the party and resigned from the state assembly. This is all a result of dirty politics and horse trading done by the BJP leaders as they know that they can’t win the state assembly bypolls to be held for 24 assembly seats in the state in the coming months. That’s why they are trying to create such a situation that even after BJP loses in the bypolls, it could still maintain the majority in the House on the basis of the effective strength of the state assembly.”State BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, the party was aware that Savitri Devi had resigned from the state assembly and added that she has not joined the BJP.-Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-mp-mla-quits-congress-says-bjp-insuring-against-losing-bypolls/story-J4K2ZoGdxKRwdcwiWRXw0I.html

17-07-2020||India||Supreme Court rejects plea, clears deck for new Telangana Secretariat||The Telangana government’s decision to build a grand, state-of-the-art Secretariat got a boost on Friday after the Supreme Court refused to hear a PIL questioning the decision as a waste of public money.The High Court for the state of Telangana situated at Hyderabad had dismissed a bunch of PILs on the same issue on June 29. One of the petitioners – senior Congress leader T Jeevan Reddy, approached the apex court against the HC verdict.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah found the High Court to be right in dismissing the petitions. It said, “The reports quoted by the High Court say there are several deficiencies in the buildings. We would not like to interfere.”For the petitioner, senior advocate Satyam Reddy argued that the existing buildings of the Secretariat intended for demolition are set in more than 25 acres. “These buildings were constructed in the years from 1966 to 2012. Two blocks constructed in the year 2012 are state-of-the-art buildings having a life span of 70 years. The new Secretariat will cost more than Rs 1,000 crore which will amount to wastage of public money.”Reddy submitted that on the one hand the state government has claimed of not having enough money to pay salaries of employees and pensioners and yet was willing to spend lavishly on such projects.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who appeared for the Telangana government informed the Court that the High Court had decided the petitions on merit and nothing was left to be decided by the apex court. The bench too was satisfied that the HC had examined all aspects and there was nothing remaining for further judicial review.The total constructed area in the present Secretariat building is 9,16,681 square feet and the North Block and South Block of the Secretariat were constructed in 2012 over an area of more than 1,40,000 square feet. The Secretariat Complex served the undivided Andhra Pradesh and after the bifurcation continued to serve as the common Secretariat for the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The decision to have a new Secretariat complex was the brainchild of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. In 2016, the state government proposed to construct the building in Secundrabad. But the proposal was shot down by the Centre as the project plan was on defence land. On June 18, 2019, the state Cabinet decided afresh to construct a new Secretariat complex at the existing premises by demolishing the present buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-plea-clears-deck-for-new-telangana-secretariat/story-5bfh1BgyjOFAqx2jLJRQjN.html
17-07-2020||India||Jaishankar responds to 9 barbs from Rahul Gandhi on Twitter, then hurls his dart||Foreign Minister S Jaishankar on Friday delivered a sharp comeback to Rahul Gandhi after the Congress leader accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “blunders” that he said “had weakened India”. Jaishankar responded to the barbs, one by one, in 9 tweets. The minister’s 10th tweet was his counteroffensive.In the 10th tweet, Jaishankar reminded Rahul Gandhi that he appeared to have glossed over Pakistan in his video message.“And #Pakistan (that you skipped) surely notes the difference between Balakot & Uri on the one hand, and Sharm-el-Sheikh, Havana & 26/11 on the other. Ask yourself,” Jaishankar said, his counterpunch to the Congress leader.The reference to Balakot and Uri are a reference to the 2019 airstrikes at a terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot after the Pulwama bombing and the surgical strike at terror camps across the line of control after a terror attack on soldiers in Uri in 2016.Jaishankar’s tweet compared these two instances of cross-border action against terrorists to the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks - that went unpunished due to the lack of political will by the UPA-1 leadership - and the two agreements signed by the Congress-led UPA government with Pakistan in 2006 and 2009 which, many strategic experts had contended, weakened India’s position. .@RahulGandhi hs questions on Foreign Policy. Here are some answers:•Our major partn’ships are strongr & internat’l standng higher.Witness regular summits&informal meetngs wth #US #Russia #Europe & #Japan.India engages #China on more equal terms politically.Ask the analysts. https://t.co/GPf17JWSacIt was in the 2006 Havana joint statement that India, for the first time, recognised Pakistan not just as a perpetrator of terrorism but also a victim. In a newspaper article back in 2006, Ajit Doval, now the National Security Adviser, had then described the joint statement as India’s “first strategic setback in the fight against terrorism”.At another meeting three years later, PM Manmohan Singh agreed to let Pakistan slip in a reference to terrorism in Balochistan in the joint statement issued after his 2009 meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani in the Red Sea Resort of Sharm El-Sheikh.“Both leaders agreed that the two countries will share real time credible and actionable information on any future terrorist threats… Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information on threats in Balochistan and other areas,” the joint statement said. From Pakistan’s perspective, it was seen to imply that India had a role in violence in Balochistan.Jaishankar, responding to Rahul Gandhi’s attempt to fault the government’s foreign policy, said India’s major partnerships are stronger and international standing higher than before. This is why India has regular summits and informal meetings with the US, Russia, Europe and Japan. “India engages #China on more equal terms politically,” Jaishankar said, adding that he could check with the analysts for more.On Rahul Gandhi’s criticism over China, Jaishankar - who was a career diplomat before joining the government - said the government speaks its mind more openly now than it did in the past, alluding to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Belt and Road Initiative, South China Sea and on UN-sanctioned terrorists.The government, Jaishankar continued, was also addressing the border infrastructure imbalance legacy, pointing that the budget on border infrastructure had gone up by 280% between 2014-20 and 2008-14, road building by 32%, bridges by 99% and tunnels by 6 times. On Rahul Gandhi expressing concern over Sri Lanka giving a port to the Chinese, Jaishankar reminded him that the Hambantota Port agreement between #SriLanka and China was concluded in 2008. “Ask those who dealt with it,” Jaishankar said in his riposte.India had transformed ties with Maldives that had been in a difficult phase because India had watched President Nasheed being toppled in 2012 when the UPA was in power.“A settled land boundary (2015) with #Bangladesh; opens path to more development and transit. And terrorists no longer find safe haven there. Ask our security,” he said. On Nepal, Jaishankar kept the focus on improving people to people ties. “Nepal after 17 years is getting Prime Ministerial visits. And a swathe of developmental projects: power, fuel, housing, hospital, roads, etc. Ask their citizens,” he said, before going to refer to better relations with Bhutan and Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-responds-to-9-barbs-from-rahul-gandhi-then-a-crisp-counteroffensive/story-wM9vIw5EE7vQnoZEekjJIP.html
17-07-2020||India||Sachin Pilot’s petition is not maintainable says Rajasthan speaker: All details here||Speaker of the Rajasthan assembly has told Rajasthan High Court that Congress rebel Sachin Pilot’s petition questioning the Tenth Schedule of constitution pertaining to the anti-defection law cannot be entertained since it may render all related judgments of the Supreme Court useless if allowed.Senior advocate and Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who is representing speaker C P Joshi, also argued that his client was within his remit while taking into account dissidents’ speeches and activities even outside the House to decide a disqualification petition. He made the arguments while asking the court to allow Joshi to join the proceedings in the case filed by Pilot and his associates. Sachin Pilot and his team, represented by senior advocate Harish Salve, have questioned the anti-defection law and if it can be applied on incidents outside the assembly, alleging that permitting so would allow its misuse by political parties against elected members. Pilot’s legal argument also cites infringement of freedom of speech if such a wide berth is allowed for action against elected representatives. Singhvi argued that the Speaker’s consideration of “allegations of speech and activities outside the House” is not mala fide and within the contours of the Constitution. He claimed that assembly speakers across state legislatures have done so in a manner consistent with the Tenth Schedule and in cases “identical” to the current one.The core legal debate in the case revolves around the application of the Tenth Schedule of the constitution which has been challenged by Salve.Also Read: Congress suspends Sachin Pilot camp’s Bhanwar Lal Sharma, Vishvendra Singh from party over leaked audio tapesSinghvi, however, argued that the challenge to its constitutionality was not maintainable.“If the challenge to constitutionality of the Tenth Schedule is allowed, all judgments of the Supreme Court [including the landmark decision in Kihoto Hollohan (1992)] would be rendered useless by the High Court. Their argument is unsupported by law and is based on implausible leaps of imagination,” he submitted to the court.On the issue of sufficient notice period, Singhvi argued that a decision on this is the sole prerogative of the speaker of the house. He elaborated that there is no “constitutionally prescribed period” for the notice period and it is merely “directory” in nature and therefore it can’t be claimed as a matter of Constitutional right.Singhvi also stated that it was “bizarre” for the defendants to oppose the speaker’s application for becoming a party to the case since he is the decider of the proceedings of disqualification.“It is bizarre that the Petitioners oppose such addition. It is done with an obtuse intention of preventing the Court from questioning the maintainability of the Petition, which he would’ve done,” Singhvi argued in the court.19 MLAs were served notices for disqualification on Tuesday and given time till Friday to reply. The notices were served on the recommendation by Congress chief whip who accused Pilot and 18 other MLAs of anti-party activities citing they had failed to attend two Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meetings, held on Monday and Tuesday and given alleged anti party statements.The Pilot camp, however, argues that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.The arguments will resume when the court reconvenes on Monday. The matter is adjourned to July 21 for further hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-s-petition-is-not-maintainable-says-rajasthan-speaker-all-details-here/story-jHxZzXGkLfSNrFCeIFlGAI.html

Made to wait at the gates, the cops were finally allowed to enter the hotel.Earlier today, the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police registered two first information reports (FIRs) against two incriminating audiotapes in which a Congress lawmaker is purportedly talking to a middleman and a person named Gajendra Singh about toppling the Ashok Gehlot-led government.The FIRs were registered on the basis of the complaint filed by Mahesh Joshi, the Congress chief whip of the Rajasthan assembly, after audiotapes surfaced on Thursday evening and went viral on social media amid the political turmoil in state. The Congress has repeatedly accused Sachin Pilot of being in cahoots with the BJP to topple the state government.In another development, the Rajasthan High Court on Friday asked assembly speaker CP Joshi to hold off on action against Sachin Pilot and the 18 lawmakers who were issued disqualification notice this week. The court, which was hearing Pilot’s challenge to the disqualification notice, will resume hearing the case on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-police-team-not-allowed-to-enter-haryana-hotel-where-sachin-pilot-rebels-are-camping/story-FX2ZkG1iV9Y94OLpHp3LJM.html

The note, which has been issued by his PS Sushil R. Gaikwad on June 25 and accessed by Hindustan Times, states that the minister had taken cognizance of “officers visiting his residence without being called” and “officers entering his chamber without his permission or being called for”.The note further adds that Naik “desires that decorum be maintained at his office and residence”. “Officers will visit the residence only when called to attend official work, if any,” states the note. “Whenever the RRM (Rajya Raksha Mantri or MoS defence) is in office, officers are expected to (be) seat(ed) in their respective chairs. They will enter RRM’s chamber only when called, with prior permission.”It also states that “not all officers are required to attend meetings with the RRM”. “They will attend meetings only at the instruction of the RRM, otherwise they are expected to remain seated in their office,” states the note. According to officials in the ministry, this is an internal matter for the office of the Minister of State and not an umbrella policy. “Keeping in mind the need for social distancing in the wake of the Conid-19 pandemic, the instructions have been issued,” an official in the Defence Ministry said. “The RRM wants to minimize contact due to the pandemic.” Last month, defence secretary Ajay Kumar had tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visit-home-only-when-called-junior-defence-minister-in-note-to-officers/story-B5EDyGlukWzme4M7qP7uPO.html
17-07-2020||India||P Varavara Rao: NHRC issues notice to Maha, seeks health report within two weeks||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has taken cognizance of a complaint filed by Maja Daruwala, special monitor, NHRC, about the deplorable health condition of P Varavara Rao (81), an acclaimed Telugu poet and social activist and an accused in the 2018 Elgar Parishad case.The commission on Friday issued notice to the state chief secretary, Sanjay Kumar, and SN Pandey, the director-general (DG), prisons, Maharashtra, and directed them to submit a report about Rao’s health condition within two weeks after the undertrial tested Covid-19 positive a day ago.The complaint mentioned that Rao is suffering from multiple old-age-related health complications and also tested Covid-19 positive on Thursday, which has further aggravated his condition.NHRC observed that the right to life and medical care are one of the basic human rights. The commission said the onus is on the state to provide to a prisoner, who is in its custody, appropriate medical care in a bid to ensure that there is no danger to his life.NHRC has also directed the state government to constitute a medical board to examine Rao’s health condition and ensure that the treatment being provided to him is appropriate.The commission has said the board is required to decide whether Rao should be admitted to a government-run or private hospital that could provide him the best possible treatment.Pandey denied receiving any notice from NHRC.Meanwhile, Rao’s bail plea could not be heard by Bombay high court (HC) on Friday due to lack of time.His lawyer R Sathyanarayan said that he would move a praecipe for the bail plea to be heard on an urgent basis on Monday.Rao had moved the HC appealing against the order of the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court, which had rejected his interim bail application on June 26.Rao had sought interim bail on the grounds of failing health and susceptibility to Covid-19 amid the viral outbreak in Maharashtra’s prisons and correctional homes.On May 28, Rao was taken to Sir JJ Hospital after he had lost consciousness. Later, he was discharged on June 1.At that time, the family members had alleged that he was hurriedly discharged in a bid to obstruct his bail plea before the special (NIA) court, a fear that came true on June 26.On July 13, Rao was again admitted to Sir JJ Hospital after his health condition worsened and he showed signs of delirium.On Thursday, he was shifted to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)-run St George’s Hospital, whose healthcare facilities are few and far between, after he tested Covid-19 positive and amid the protestations of his family members.The NIA, which had taken over the Elgar Parishad case from Pune Police in February, had opposed the bail plea, as Rao was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, where there is no provision to grant him temporary bail.NIA had submitted that the jail authorities could be directed to ensure that Rao was provided proper medical attention, whenever required.Earlier, on January 1, 2018, violence erupted between Dalits and Marathas near the village of Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, where thousands of Dalits had gathered to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon.In that battle, the British Army’s Dalit Mahar soldiers had defeated the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire.The commemoration took place a day after an event in Pune called the Elgar Parishad was held.The Pune Police conducted a preliminary probe and claimed that the violence in Bhima Koregaon was the result of speeches made at the Elgar Parishad event.They alleged that banned Maoist groups organised the event, and a first information report (FIR) was also filed.In June 2018, the Pune Police arrested five activists and lawyers from Pune, Nagpur, and Delhi – Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, and Shoma Sen – for their alleged links to the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), and also for organising the Elgar Parishad event.In August 2018, the police arrested four more activists – Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, and Rao.While Gautam Navlakha and Dr. Anand Teltumbde were arrested on April 14 this year, taking the total number of the accused in the case to 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/p-varavara-rao-nhrc-issues-notice-to-maha-seeks-health-report-within-two-weeks/story-cwiaoXxkkPoKPFJia5fwoL.html
17-07-2020||India||Of 3.42 lakh active Covid-19 cases in India, less than 1.9% are in ICU, says govt||The Union health ministry said on Friday that less than 1.94 per cent of the 3.42 lakh active Covid-19 cases in India are in ICU, 0.35 per cent on ventilator support and 2.81 per cent are being given oxygen, while the recovery rate has improved to 63.33 per cent.It said the actual caseload of Covid-19 cases in the country as on date is 3,42,756, while more than 6.35 lakhs patients have recuperated from the disease.India, the second-most populous country in the world with 1.35 billion people, has 727.4 cases per million population, which is four to eight times lower than some European nations, the ministry said.Also, according to it, the country’s case fatality rate at 18.6 deaths per million is one of the lowest in the world.“It is also notable that less than 1.94 per cent of the cases are in ICU, 0.35 per cent cases are on ventilators and 2.81 per cent cases are on oxygen beds,” the ministry said, adding that 63.33 per cent of the total cases have recovered.On Thursday, the recovery rate was 63.25 per cent.The collaborative efforts of all states and Union Territories in house-to-house survey, contact tracing, surveillance of containment and buffer zones, perimeter control activities, aggressive testing and timely diagnosis have resulted in early identification of the infected persons. This has helped in early treatment too, the ministry said.India has followed a standard of care protocol for differentiated categorisation of Covid-19 patients -- mild, moderate and severe -- as clearly formulated in the Clinical Management Protocol of the health ministry.Effective clinical management strategies have shown to yield positive results. Almost 80 per cent of the asymptomatic and mild cases have been advised home isolation under medical supervision, the ministry said.

The members of the group, who made a video of the incident, also wrote “Jai Sri Ram” on his scalp.After the video made by the group went viral on social media, Nepal’s ambassador Nilamber Acharya spoke to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath on Friday and raised the matter of ensuring the safety and security of all Nepalese citizens in the state, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.“We have raised the matter with authorities in India. People’s safety is important,” one of the people cited above said, without giving details.The people said Nepal’s envoy was given an assurance about the safety of Nepalese citizens in the country. The two sides also agreed such matters shouldn’t have an impact on bilateral relations, they said.Oli sparked a controversy with his recent remarks that the “real” Ayodhya is in Nepal and that Lord Ram was Nepalese. He had also said Nepal had “become a victim of cultural encroachment” and its history was manipulated.“Although the real Ayodhya lies at Thori in the west of Birgunj, India has claimed the Indian site as the birthplace of Lord Ram,” Oli was quoted as saying by the media.The Nepal government subsequently clarified Oli’s remarks reflected the many myths about Lord Ram and highlighted the need for further research on the “vast cultural geography” of the Ramayana. It also clarified the remarks “are not linked to any political subject” and there was “no intention at all to hurt the feeling and sentiment of anyone”.The controversy came close on the heels of a border row between India and Nepal, which erupted after New Delhi opened a new road to Lipulekh on the Tibet border and Kathmandu published a new map showing Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory.Meanwhile, police in Varanasi have registered a first information report (FIR) against Vishwa Hindu Sena chief Arun Pathak, who acknowledged in a Facebook post that members of his group had tonsured the Nepalese man over Oli’s remarks.Vishwa Hindu Sena had also put up posters in Varanasi that said Nepal’s prime minister should stop “acting at the instance of China”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-envoy-raises-safety-of-citizens-with-up-cm/story-iD01hG0MGtDfHL0GorzhyN.html

Hailing from Osmanabad in Maharashtra, the young man revealed that he had travelled nearly 1200-odd kilometres to meet a girl from Shah Faisal town in Karachi, Pakistan.Siddiqui Mohammad Zishan had befriended the girl on Facebook and both of them had been in constant touch on social media via Facebook and Whatsapp. He wanted to go to Pakistan and had tried to use Google Maps for navigation, the young man said. He was found by BSF personnel in a dehydrated condition and revealed that he had fainted while trying to cross the Rann of Kutch. An ATM card, and other documents like Aadhaar and PAN card helped the security personnel to identify him.During the search operation, the BSF found a bike which the youth had abandoned when he reached close to the border. He had used the bike to travel from his hometown in Maharashtra. The young man was apprehended about 1.5 kilometres away from the Indo-Pakistan international border based on information shared by the Crime Branch of Maharashtra Police. The Maharashtra Police had informed the Gujarat Police about a missing complaint that had been lodged by the parents of the youth. The Gujarat Police in turn sought help from the Border Security Force personnel and after tracking his mobile phone, the young man was traced in an area near Dholavira.The BSF personnel have handed over the young man to the police for further investigation and so that his story can be verified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-yr-old-attempts-to-meet-girlfriend-in-pakistan-gets-caught-by-bsf-near-border/story-jemrKPSpD0p7V2h9PdabQP.html

17-07-2020||India||Rajasthan HC asks speaker to hold off on action against Sachin Pilot, 18 Cong MLAs; to resume hearing on Monday||Two judges of the Rajasthan High Court on Friday asked assembly speaker CP Joshi to hold off on action against Sachin Pilot and the 18 lawmakers who were issued disqualification notice this week. The court, which was hearing Pilot’s challenge to the disqualification notice, will resume hearing the case on Monday.The interim order of the high court came minutes before the deadline set by speaker CP Joshi’s office for responding to the notice was to expire.Sachin Pilot’s group had on Thursday challenged the disqualification notice under the anti-defection law, contending that they hadn’t done or said anything that would indicate that they were parting ways from the Congress.In their writ petition, the legislators argued that they had neither given up their membership of the House nor did their failure to attend the two Congress legislature party meetings make them liable for disqualification on the grounds of defection. The Pilot camp termed the notices under the Tenth Schedule a way to stifle their “freedom of speech” and to impose the “majoritarian views of the party on them”.Forty two-year-old Pilot, credited with leading the Congress’ successful 2018 assembly election campaign, has categorically ruled out joining the BJP, asserting that attempts to link him to the opposition party were a ploy to tar his image. If the rebel MLAs are disqualified, the majority mark in the 200-member assembly will come down, making it easier for chief minister Ashok Gehlot to win a floor test. In another development, the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police has registered two first information reports (FIRs) against two incriminating audiotapes in which a Congress lawmaker is purportedly talking to a middleman and a person named Gajendra Singh about toppling the Ashok Gehlot-led government.The SOG is also investigating another case related to sedition against two persons, who have been arrested, on the basis of intercepts of two mobile phones that pertain to an alleged bid to oust the Gehlot government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-asks-speaker-to-hold-off-on-action-against-sachin-pilot-18-cong-mlas-to-resume-hearing-on-monday/story-7Cm5uONNxaTqR01kMd2jAN.html

The only way to curb it is by creating a gap and as a result, we have decided to implement state-wide lockdown on Saturday and Sunday.”For Coronavirus Live UpdatesHe, however, said that guidelines for the same would be decided in a high-level meeting later on Friday.“We would soon issue the guidelines for it, which will include who would be allowed to enter the state and who would be not.

17-07-2020||India||Cop killed gangster Vikas Dubey ‘in defence’, UP police tells SC, claims encounter was genuine||Uttar Pradesh government has refuted the allegations that Kanpur gangster Vikas Dubey and five of his associates were killed in staged encounters in its detailed reply submitted to the Supreme Court on Friday.UP police maintained that Vikas Dubey was killed in an encounter when he opened fire at the special task force team which was pursuing him when he attempted to escape while being taken to Kanpur from Ujjain.In its affidavit filed before Supreme Court on Friday, the Uttar Pradesh government said that the vehicle in which Dubey was being brought to Kanpur overturned when it tried to avoid hitting a herd of cattle which was crossing the road.“All the four police persons in the vehicle got seriously injured and lost consciousness. Accused Vikas Dubey snatched a pistol from Inspector Rama Kant Pichauri and escaped through the backdoor of the police SUV,” the affidavit said.The STF team reached the spot and a team led by DySP TB Singh pursued Dubey. Dubey then fired indiscriminately at STF.“In defence, the STF fired six shots at Vikas Dubey. Three shots hit him. He was then rushed to the hospital where he was declared dead”, the affidavit said.Also Read: ‘Who should we reward for catching Vikas Dubey?’ UP Police ask MP PoliceThe Supreme Court had indicated on Tuesday that a judicial probe could be ordered into the killings while it asked the Uttar Pradesh government to submit its response to a bunch of petitions demanding an independent investigation into the matter.The police’s claim has been contested widely, with experts alleging that their version was unconvincing. Politicians, former police officers, and rights groups have demanded a probe in Dubey’s killing and also of five others linked to Dubey, who were killed between July 3 and July 9.The Supreme Court had also set up a judicial probe in the Telangana encounter case earlier this year and it said on Tuesday that a similar approach could be undertaken in this case. It even asked the petitioners to suggest the composition of the judicial inquiry committee to probe the encounters.However, the three judge bench headed by the chief justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde had ruled out monitoring of the probe.The matter was posted for hearing on Monday, by when the UP government has been asked to file a status report in the case.The SC bench is hearing three petitions including one by Ghanshyam Upadhyay, a lawyer, who had filed a petition before Dubey was killed fearing he will be ‘eliminated’ like his accomplices.Anoop Prakash Awasthi, another petitioner, has sought a probe into the alleged police-politician-gangster nexus behind Dubey and his gang members’ killings. He has alleged the state police consider themselves to be above the law and hence “their excesses” in this case should be subject to a court-monitored probe either by central agencies or a panel headed by a retired judge.Dubey and his men were hunted down within a span of seven days in an intense operation by Uttar Pradesh special task force after eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra, were killed in an ambush laid out allegedly by Dubey and his men in Bikru village of Kanpur. The police team had gone there to arrest Dubey in another case, when they were trapped and killed by a hail of bullets fired by the gangsters’ men. Some of the policemen’s bodies were even mutilated after they died.The STF nabbed Dubey in Ujjain, where he was spotted by locals at the famous Mahakal temple. He had reached there after giving police the slip in Haryana’s Faridabad. Police claim he snatched the revolver of a police officer before fleeing after the road accident in Kanpur on July 10. They claim that when cops tried to catch him alive, he opened fire at them, forcing retaliatory fire from the cops, in which he received fatal injuries.The opposition has alleged that Dubey was killed to cover up a gangster-police-politician nexus in Uttar Pradesh.Dubey and five alleged members of his gang have so far been gunned down in separate encounters in Kanpur, Hamirpur and Etawah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-killed-gangster-vikas-dubey-in-defence-up-police-tells-sc-claims-encounter-was-genuine/story-96otuADFTSSfXpvu6cNE4M.html
17-07-2020||India||Election Commission to hold meeting with political parties from Bihar today||The Election Commission will be meeting political parties from Bihar this afternoon via video conferencing. The development follows after a host of parties from the state, in a joint letter to the poll body, underlined the concern among the electorate and the parties that the Bihar “poll exercise does not become a super spreader event”. They highlighted that the coronavirus cases in the state saw an “alarming exponential surge”.“It is safe to assume that there are many more infected people who are either asymptomatic or have not yet been tested in the state, making their public movement a risk for others around them. It is also projected that infections would cross a million in Bihar by the tentative election schedules in October-November,” the parties argued in the letter and urged upon the EC to review if polls can be held in such a situation.On Thursday, the EC said it has decided not to notify the law ministry’s amendment to the Representation of People Act, 1951, that would have allowed those over the age of 65 to use postal ballots in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections. The move was welcomed by political parties.The commission cited “the field situation and logistics of operationalization” as the rationale behind its decision to not allow postal ballots.The Bihar assembly lapses in November this year and chief election commissioner Sunil Arora had told Hindustan Times in an interview on June 27 that state elections will be held when they are due.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-to-hold-meeting-with-political-parties-from-bihar-today/story-X4gwokNzlB7GKLkrtiIpeL.html

This will be the third consular access to Jadhav.Confirming the development, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that they have agreed to India’s demand to not have a security personnel during the meeting.However, Qureshi said that the Indian officials who came to meet Jadhav on Thursday left without hearing him out. “[Jhadav] kept asking the Indian diplomats to talk to him and they left,” claimed Qureshi.Also read | It’s a farce: MEA on Pak claim that Kulbhushan Jadhav refused to file review petitionCalling the behaviour of the officials “astonishing”, Qureshi said that if the Indian diplomats didn’t want to talk to Jadhav, why did they ask for consular access.“They had objected to the glass that had been placed in the middle so we removed it. They had also objected to audio and video recordings so that was also not done. We fulfilled all their requests, but still they left,” said the Pakistan foreign minister.New Delhi had accused Islamabad of breaching its assurance of providing unimpeded access to Jadhav during the consular access.On Thursday, Pakistan provided consular access to Jadhav for the second time since he was detained in March 2016. But when two Indian consular officials went to meet him, they found Pakistani officials with “an intimidating demeanour” near Jadhav and a camera being used to record the conversation, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said.Also read | ‘Obstructive and insincere’: India roasts Pak after meeting Kulbhushan JadhavThe Indian officials met Jadhav to discuss filing a review petition in Islamabad high court against his death sentence by the deadline of July 20, and required privacy to talk about the matter.“The consular officers could not engage Jadhav on his legal rights and were prevented from obtaining his written consent for arranging his legal representation,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.“In the light of these circumstances, the Indian consular officers came to the conclusion that the consular access being offered by Pakistan was neither meaningful nor credible. After lodging a protest, they left the venue.”Meanwhile, the spokesperson of Pakistan’s foreign office Aisha Farooqui reiterated the country’s offer to file an appeal in the Islamabad High Court against Jadhav’s conviction and subsequent death sentence by a military court.The statement added that Pakistan remained committed to fully implementing the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) judgement of July 17, 2019. “It is hoped that India will cooperate with the Pakistan court in giving full effect to the said judgement.”Consular access to Jadhav was first provided in September 2019, while his mother and wife had been allowed to meet him in December 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-offers-third-consular-access-to-kulbhushan-jadhav-says-its-official-won-t-be-present-in-meeting/story-RTbmU4756V1Htn2OX4bFNN.html

Under the process, all the departments have been asked to give a list of employees who could be asked for compulsory retirement, said officials on Friday.A letter was sent by Vinod Kumar Suman, additional secretary (AS), secretariat administration, to all the additional chief secretaries, secretaries in-charge and heads of the department concerned on the matter to screen the names of employees and give the list to the screening committee for further action, said officials.“In May, a meeting led by the chief secretary was held in which a screening committee was formed and a letter was sent to all the departments for the same,” said an official privy to the development on condition of anonymity.“Under the process, all those employees who are above the age of 50 and are often absent in work due to some reason or the other will be screened out and considered for compulsory retirement. In this process only, a reminder was sent by additional secretary Suman two days ago to all the departments,” said the official.Meanwhile, Suman said that the process has ‘nothing to do with the pandemic’ as it is an annual process being carried out in the state departments.“It is not a new thing and is an annual exercise held in all the states since last about 40-45 years during the month of June-July only. All those employees who remain absent from work in the whole year due to prolonged illness or are not interested in work, are screened for compulsory retirement,” said Suman.He said that ‘usually the numbers in this exercise are very less like two or three only.’“Only those employees are screened out who are not much interested in work or have themselves asked the government for compulsory retirement as per the norms and regulations of the Centre. We have initiated the process and are sure other states are also doing the same. It has nothing to do with the ongoing pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retire-those-over-50-and-absent-at-work-says-uttarakhand-govt/story-y9zEfOUDFh77pTnNwze9SL.html

The SOG and ACB and other agencies are being misused to defame leaders. If they have the guts then why don’t they parade their MLAs? Why not get the entire episode investigated by the CBI?” he said.He said the entire series of events was an attempt by chief minister Ashok Gehlot to save his chair.“It’s strange to see someone flashing a victory sign when one’s own house is crumbling. The BJP is being used as a pawn in what is essentially an internal fight of the Congress. They should worry about their own party instead they are making allegations against the BJP and central leaders,” said Poonia.He also hit out at the state government for being non-existent during the time of the Covid-19 crisis.“At a time when people are reeling under the growing menace of coronavirus, the government is under lockdown in a resort and playing football. This is unfortunate. The entire government machinery has come to a standstill even as the infection is continually rising,” he said.Poonia said it is the people of Rajasthan who have lost out and are feeling betrayed by the Congress whom they had voted to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-refutes-congress-claim-of-horse-trading-in-rajasthan-says-audio-tapes-are-fake/story-tbOfPgIhabvDtNpWfd9dUN.html

Reports have said Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case, called him several times the day 30kg of gold was seized from a consignment addressed to an official of the consular office in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5.There was an attempt to smuggle the gold through diplomatic baggage, which according to the Vienna Convention is not checked by customs officials.Ghosh was rushed to the medical college hospital and doctors said he was out of danger.A senior police official said preliminary reports suggest it may be a suicide bid and that Ghosh is not in a position to record his statement. Police started a search after his last call was traced near his house on the outskirts of the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram.Ghosh’s boss, the UAE consulate attache Rashed Khamis Ali Musaiqri Alshemeli, had slipped out of the country three days ago amid reports he was called back by his country. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken over the gold smuggling case and several other central agencies are also probing it.NIA filed a first information report (FIR) on July 10 against P Sarith Kumar, who was arrested by customs officials on July 5, and Swapna Suresh, Sandip Nair and Fazil Fareed, an alleged smuggler from Ernakulum but based in the UAE, and charged them under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). It added the name of an alleged gold smuggler KT Ramees to the FIR on July 15.The Kerala government on Thursday suspended chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar for violating service rules.Vijayan said the action was taken on the basis of an inquiry report that pointed to lapses on Sivasankar’s part. The inquiry was conducted by a two-member panel headed by chief secretary Viswas Mehta.The senior Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer was removed from the post of the CM’s principal secretary last week after allegations that he was close to Suresh, one of the key accused in the gold smuggling case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-uae-consular-attache-s-missing-gunman-found-with-slit-wrists/story-ttblrZIzpEIeCQle5ZaR5J.html
17-07-2020||India||Assam: Two jail officials arrested in separate cases of sexual assault||Assam Police has arrested two jail officials for their alleged involvement in two separate cases of sexual assaults.In the first case, Mrinmoy Dawka, the superintendent of Tezpur Central jail in Sonitpur district, was arrested on Thursday following complaints of sexual assault by two women.“There were two complaints against the accused. He had allegedly sexually assaulted the wife of an inmate on the promise of releasing her husband. The second case is of him outraging the modesty of the wife of a jail warden,” said Mugdhajyoti Dev Mahanta, superintendent of police (SP), Sonitpur.“The first incident had occurred a month ago and came to light, when the woman disclosed the matter to her husband, who is lodged in the jail. The second incident was more recent,” he added.Based on both the complaints, the police arrested Dawka on charges of criminal breach of trust, assault or criminal force to outrage the modesty of a woman and intercourse by luring inducements under Sections 354 (A), 409 and 376 (C) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Dawka was produced before a court on Thursday and has been sent to judicial custody for five days. Further investigations into both the complaints are on.In the second case, a jailer of the district jail in Dhemaji was arrested on Thursday on charges of sodomising a male inmate with the promise of securing an early release of the latter.“The jailer Dulal Das was arrested following a complaint filed by the mother of an inmate who alleged that her son was sodomised thrice in 2019 by the accused,” said Dhananjay P Ghanawat, SP, Dhemaji.The 20-year-old victim, who’s in jail in connection with a child sexual assault case, was reportedly in trauma due to the assaults and allegedly attempted suicide once.“Because of his mental trauma, the victim is undergoing treatment at the Assam Medical College Hospital in Dibrugarh. We have lodged a case under Section 377 of the IPC for unnatural sex. The magisterial inquiry into the incident has also been ordered,” said Ghanawat.The accused was produced in court on Thursday and was remanded to judicial custody for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-two-jail-officials-arrested-in-separate-cases-of-sexual-assault/story-MwUrLypSmHE77ucj81sU9K.html

But over the passage of time, the training is forgotten and they do not take care of their health. They then suffer from health issues such as high/low blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. Any person with such comorbid conditions is at a high risk because of Covid-19. We might even see some new kind of virus attack in the future and have to be prepared for any eventuality,” said Sarangi in his notice to over 7,000 policemen of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.Sarangi said height and weight of all cops will be measured to calculate Body Mass Index. Those with more than 30 BMI would be guided on what measures to follow to have a healthy lifestyle. If by November, a staff’s BMI is still above 30 then they would have to mandatorily attend a six-week refresher course.The commissioner said those who don’t take the order seriously may face a cut in increment and compulsory retirement.Incidentally, in 2017, union ministry of Home Affairs had issued a circular to all the states for making it compulsory for all cops to adhere to the norms of SHAPE – 1, the highest physical fitness standard for cops. As per MHA, SHAPE-1 is an acronym for S – Psychological, H – Hearing, A – Appendages, P – Physical Fitness and E – Eye Sight. The 2017 circular had also clearly advised states not to recommend obese cops for police medals.The Odisha Police Association welcomed the move saying it was necessary, but added that the cops need time to exercise regularly. Referring to the Status of Policing in India Report-2019 by Common Cause and Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, OPA president Satyajit Mishra said about 60 percent police personnel in Odisha work for more than 16 hours and 22 percent work for more than 13 hours a day.“The policemen need enough time. During the lockdown, the work hours of policemen have been very hectic. All policemen want to come back to shape. It’s just that the work burden is way too much,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shape-up-or-ship-out-bhubaneswar-police-commissioner-s-sermon-to-city-cops/story-BWNTTMQ4anmVFhPro8gUXK.html

There are 387 active cases in the state, 153 people have recovered from the infection and three patients have died so far. Until May 23, the northeastern state had remained free from the coronavirus pandemic. Dr L Jampa, the state surveillance officer, said of the new infections, 42 were reported in the Capital Complex Region, seven in East Siang district and three in Upper Subansiri.“The detection of 52 patients is the second-highest single-day spike of Covid-19 cases in Arunachal Pradesh as 75 people had tested positive for the disease on July 15,” he said.Of the fresh patients found in the Capital Complex, two had returned to the state recently and 40 were detected from various areas of the region. The three new patients from Upper Subansiri district also came back to the state recently, Jampa said.Jampa added 35,430 samples have been tested in the state so far.The Capital Complex region, which consists of Itanagar, Naharlagun, Nirjuli and Banderdewa areas, registered 247 cases and is the worst-hit by Covid-19, followed by Changlang with 33 cases and Namsai with 30 infections so far.Jampa also said that seven ITBP personnel deployed at the Advance Landing Ground (ALG) at Pasighat, the East Siang district headquarters, were found to be infected with Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes Covid-19.The state government has imposed a total lockdown in the Capital Complex Region till July 20 with a view to contain the spread of Covid-19. The state government on Thursday had announced that it will proceed with an extensive sero-survey in the region for tracing the primary and secondary contacts of infected patients, including vulnerable groups. P Parthiban, Arunachal Pradesh’s health secretary, said rapid antigen tests began last week in the Capital Complex region after the state witnessed a spurt in the coronavirus cases. Authorities have conducted 968 antigen and 1,867 ELISA tests in the areas so far.The health department will conduct more such tests and rapid response teams have already been formed for the purpose, Parthiban added.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-52-new-covid-19-cases-arunachal-pradesh-s-tally-reaches-543/story-PcMuJy6y6hqYar3BqVlaAK.html
17-07-2020||India||‘Can’t guarantee to what extent talks will resolve border row’: Rajnath on China||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that the ongoing negotiations with China should help resolve the border dispute but he couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation would be resolved, in another confirmation of the complex nature of the military and diplomatic negotiations between the two nuclear powers.Addressing soldiers at Lukung near Pangong Tso during his visit to Ladakh, Singh assured the country that no power in the world could grab even an inch of Indian territory.His comments come a day after India on Thursday said the complex disengagement process with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is specifically aimed at preventing “face-off situations”, and any unilateral attempts to change the status quo on the disputed border won’t be accepted.In his speech, Singh said India had neither attacked any country nor grabbed anyone’s territory. He said India would not tolerate anyone hurting its self respect and would give a befitting reply. He said the country was led by a Prime Minister who was capable of taking strong decisions.The minister is visiting Ladakh two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled visit to the sector on July 3. The PM then declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China about India’s determination to defend its borders.Earlier in Leh, the minister witnessed an exercise by soldiers including some battle drills by troops of the Ladakh Scouts. He was also briefed on the situation including the actual position of the troops on both sides, people familiar with the developments said on Friday.The exercise showcased application of integrated combined force in high altitude terrain with newer generation helicopters and special forces, said one of the officials cited above. A special assault drill by the Ladakh Scouts was also showcased. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane are accompanying the minister.Two days after corps commanders from both sides met at Chushul to discuss the road map for easing tensions on the LAC, the Indian Army on Thursday said complete disengagement is an “intricate process” requiring “constant verification”.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the statements from the external affairs ministry and the army pointed to difficulties and suspicions involved in the disengagement process, and the need to draw a distinction between de-escalation and New Delhi’s stated aim of restoring status quo ante on the LAC.Singh will also visit forward areas in Kashmir. The military is keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-guarantee-to-what-extent-talks-will-resolve-border-row-rajnath-on-china/story-smPDFYKa9ib285QodbVORM.html

The Indian Army had deployed six T-90 missile-firing tanks and top-of-the-line shoulder-fired anti-tank missile systems in the Galwan Valley sector in June. The army’s decision to deploy the T-90 Bhishma tanks was taken after the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had strengthened its positions on the river bed with armoured personnel carriers and troop tents. He also interacted with the personnel of the Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in Lukung post near Pangong Lake where Indian and Chinese troops are in the process of disengagement.“Talks are underway to resolve the border dispute but to what extent it can be resolved I cannot guarantee. I can assure you that not one inch of our land can be taken by any power in the world,” he said.“If a solution can be found by talks, there is nothing better,” he said emphasising on finding a diplomatic solution to the standoff. “Recently what happened between troops of India and China at PP14, how some of our personnel sacrificed their lives protecting our border. I am happy to meet you all but also saddened because of their loss. I pay my tributes to them,” he added. The defence minister will go to Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday.Singh was scheduled to visit Ladakh on July 3 but his visit was deferred. “Leaving for Leh on a two day visit to Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. I shall be visiting the forward areas to review the situation at the borders and also interact with the Armed Forces personnel deployed in the region. Looking forward to it,” the minister had tweeted in the morning.On July 3, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made an unscheduled visit to a forward post in Nimu in Ladakh earlier this month and interacted with the troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-rolls-out-t-90-tanks-armoured-vehicles-during-defence-minister-rajnath-singh-s-leh-visit/story-DfJbFcib2UsEW5ILHbQi4J.html
17-07-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi releases video attacking Modi govt, says China’s actions prompted by India’s disruption over 6 years||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi stepped up his attack on the government over Chinese transgressions in Ladakh, claiming that “troubled economy, foreign policy and neighbourhood” prompted Beijing to take an aggressive stand against India.On Friday, Gandhi released a video on the India-China border stand-off in Ladakh as part of his move to share his thoughts on national issues through a series of short and incisive videos.“The question is why have Chinese chosen this particular time to move? Why have Chinese chosen to violate the LAC (Line of Actual Control) with India at this point in time? What is it about India situation that has led China to act in such an aggressive way? What is it about this moment in time that has allowed the Chinese to have the confidence they can move against a country like India?” he asked a flurry of questions to the Narendra Modi-led Central government.“To understand that you have to go into multiple spaces. Countries are protected not by one particular thing but by a confluence of forces, by a confluence of systems. A country is protected by its foreign relationships, it is protected by its neighbourhood, it is protected by its economy, it is protected by the feeling that its people have, the vision that its people have,” he added.Gandhi has been critical of the government on its handling of the border stand-off with China and has repeatedly asked it to come clean on the alleged intrusion by Chinese forces in Ladakh and also on the disengagement process.“And what has happened over the last six years is that in all those areas India has been disturbed and disrupted. And I’ll cover each one of them,” he said.Gandhi attacked the government over its foreign policy and the “soured” relationship with neighbouring countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, claiming the ties have become transactional.“Let’s start with foreign policy. Our relationship with the outside world used to be with multiple countries. We had a relationship with America, strategic partnership with America I would say. That is very important. We had a relationship with Russia. We had a relationship with Europe. And these countries used to help us manoeuvre in the world,” he said.“Today, our relationship has become transactional. We have a transactional relationship with the United States. We have disturbed our relationship with the Russians. We have a transactional relationship with Europe,” added Gandhi.Talking about the neighbourhood, he said earlier Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka were India’s friends and except Pakistan, the entire neighbourhood was working and partnered with New Delhi.“Today, Nepal is angry with us. If you go to Nepal and you speak to the Nepalese people they are furious with what has happened. Sri Lankans have given a port to the Chinese. The Maldives is disturbed. Bhutan is disturbed. So, we have disrupted our foreign partners, we’ve disrupted our neighbourhood,” the Congress leader claimed.He also took on the government over economy and unemployment amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“Now let’s come to the economy. Our pride, something that India used to go to the rest of the world and talk about and boast about. We have the worst economic growth in 50 years no end in sight, absolute disaster. Unemployment is the highest in 40-50 years. So, our strengths have suddenly become our weaknesses,” he said.Gandhi said his party had repeatedly urged the government to inject money into the economy and announce a financial package for the small and medium businesses, but no action was taken.“We told the government that look, please realise that we are becoming vulnerable. All these things are connected. They’re not separate. When you look at a nation you have to look at all these factors and you have to act, taking into account all these factors,” he said.“We told them to listen; for God’s sake inject money into the economy. Fire the economy and do it immediately; protect the small and medium businesses. They refused to do it,” claimed Gandhi.He claimed that a weak economy, troubled foreign policy and disturbed neighbourhood prompted China to take an aggressive stand against India over the past few months.“So, today you have a country which is economically in trouble; in trouble as far as foreign policy is concerned; in trouble with its neighbours; and that’s why the Chinese have decided that this is possibly the best time to act and that is why they have acted,” he said.Later, Gandhi tweeted: “Since 2014, the PM’s constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened India and left us vulnerable. Empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics.”Earlier, while announcing that he would release videos on different issues, Gandhi had said: “Today a large part of the Indian news media has been captured by fascist interests. A hate-filled narrative is being spread by television channels, WhatsApp forwards and false news. This narrative of lies is tearing India apart. I want to make our current affairs, history and crisis clear and accessible for those interested in the truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-releases-video-attacking-modi-govt-says-china-s-actions-prompted-by-india-s-disruption-over-6-years/story-GXpFC5d4vq1Y7eSn7hQIcL.html

Low-cost carrier IndiGo, under its newly introduced “6E double booking scheme”, will allow fliers to book air tickets for twin seats from the airline’s website, starting July 24.Earlier in July, Vistara, a full-service carrier, had announced a similar facility without any additional charge except for the ticket cost for a second seat.IndiGo clarified that this scheme would not be available for bookings made through travel portals, IndiGo call centre, airport counters, or if a customer initially books a single seat and then seek to upgrade to a twin-seat.The budget airline, too, will charge only an airline component and Goods and Services Tax (GST) and there will no additional airport charges. According to the airline, the second seat will be priced at a lower rate than the total fare paid for the original booking. “The charges for the extra seat will be effectively up to 25% lower than the original booking cost. The offer is effective from July 24,” IndiGo stated.The seat-selection charges, under this scheme, will be applicable for both seats.Sanjay Kumar, chief strategy & revenue officer, IndiGo, said, “Even though air travel is the safest mode of travel at this point, we understand the passengers’ emotional need for safety. We had been receiving such requests and are happy to introduce the option to book two seats for a single passenger to ensure additional safety. 6E double-seat will provide a stress-free flying experience to our customers. We are constantly working towards measures and services to strengthen air travel as the safest choice for travellers. We are confident that this option will enhance a passenger’s comfort and trust, augmenting the overall demand for air travel”. The airline said any kind of changes and cancellation charges -- based on the type of fare -- would be applicable on the extra seat. “The extra-seat booking will not be entitled to additional baggage allowance for customers. The extra seat can be used by passengers, who are carrying a large musical instrument, or a child’s car seat, or for more space needed due to personal comfort, size, or disability,” IndiGo added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-vistara-indigo-gives-option-to-book-two-seats-for-single-passenger/story-mVkBzpgF1HUraa4sddb8iP.html

M. Venkaiah Naidu, chairman, RS, has decided to proceed with the oath-taking ceremony keeping in view the resumption of meetings by the department-related parliamentary standing committees of both the RS and Lok Sabha and the interest expressed by the new members to participate in such meetings, Naidu’s office said in a statement.A Member of Parliament (MP) can participate in the meetings and other house proceedings only after being administered the oath or affirmation; even though they are eligible to draw salaries and other benefits.For the first time, the oath-taking ceremony will be carried out in the chamber of the House during inter-session because of the unprecedented coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. “Subscribing to oath or affirmation is usually done either during the session or in the chamber of the RS chairman, if the House is not in session,” the statement said.Among the MPs, who will be administered the oath or affirmation, are Dr. K. Keshava Rao (Telangana Rashtra Samithi) and Tiruchi Siva (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam), who chair parliamentary committees, and cannot convene the meetings of their respective committees unless they are administered the oath.A total of 61 members from 20 states, who have been elected to the Upper House, will be administered the oath in the chairman’s chamber while complying with Covid-19 induced social distancing norms and only a family member, or a guest will be allowed to accompany the newly elected MP.The MPs were informed of the decision by the RS secretary-general and those who fail to turn up will be administered oath or affirmation during the monsoon session, which is likely to begin after August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newly-elected-members-of-rajya-sabha-to-take-oath-on-july-22/story-Ojxfc0LOQYO2pIAxkHXgdJ.html

The letter further underlined the fear among the electorate and the parties that the “poll exercise does not become a super spreader event”.Congress, RJD, CPI, CPI(M), RLSP, CPI(ML), HAM were signatories to the letter that was sent to the poll body. The parties said that Covid-19 pandemic has affected the state badly and the cases may be much more than the reported figures as testing is still not as intensive as it should be.“It is safe to assume that there are many more infected people who are either asymptomatic or have not yet been tested in the state,making their public movement a risk for others around them. It is also projected that infections would cross a million in Bihar by the tentative election schedules in October-November,” the parties argued in the letter. The parties asked how will the EC ensure physical distancing in a state with a population of 13 crore with 7.5 crore eligible voters. The two yard distancing has been repeatedly advocated by WHO, Indian Council of Medical research and also Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“People need explicit clarity so that wholesome participation of majority of voters is not adversely impacted. People also expect the commission to ensure and satisfy the people that entire poll exercise does not become a super spreader event,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-elections-should-not-be-a-super-spreader-event-congress-rjd-others-write-to-ec-to-review-if-polls-can-be-held/story-mjFaLmsnVLODrWzSSPbAdJ.html

He had a medical condition, as he had undergone a bypass surgery around seven years ago,” said Tanaji Pol, superintendent of the children’s home.The home is run by the Children’s Aid Society and comes under the Maharashtra government’s women and child development department.The facility has a sprawling campus, including a staff colony on its premises.Earlier, three staff members, including the guard, had tested Covid-19 positive, said an official.The home houses 130 children, who have been rescued by the police or non-governmental organisatons (NGOs) from various factories indulging in child labour, or are victims of child trafficking rackets. Some of the inmates are street urchins and runaway kids.“The children are panic-stricken and anxious after they came to know about the guard’s death,” said the official. However, Pol maintained that there was no cause for concern.“The children are safe and they need not worry, as the deceased guard didn’t come to work for the past 13 days. We are taking all precautions for the kids’ safety,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-guard-posted-at-mankhurd-children-home-dies-of-covid-19-sets-panic-among-children/story-674k928spZdKpVCR5thevJ.html
17-07-2020||India||In a video, Rahul Gandhi weighs in reasons behind India-China border standoff||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday gave three reasons behind China’s aggressive stance against India as both the neighbours have clashed on its border in eastern Ladakh in the last few months taking their ties to a new low.Rahul Gandhi talked about several aspects of the government’s policies that he said the Centre has destroyed over the last six years and resulted in the present action by the Chinese.“Since 2014, the PM’s constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened India and left us vulnerable. Empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics,” Gandhi tweeted on Friday. Watch: Rahul Gandhi explains why China felt confident to move against India The former Congress president also posted a video to talk about the reasons he said have allowed the Chinese to have “the confidence that they can move against a country like India”.Gandhi explained in the 3:38-minute video that countries are protected not by one particular thing but “by a confluence of forces and by a confluence of systems”. “A country is protected by its foreign relationships, it is protected by its neighbourhood, it is protected by its economy, it is protected by the feeling that its people have and the vision its people have. What has happened over the last six years that on all those areas India has been disturbed and disrupted,” he said.Talking about the government’s foreign policy, he said India’s relationship with the outside world used to be with multiple countries. India, he said, had a strategic partnership with the United States and a relationship with Russia and Europe.“These countries used to help us manoeuver in the world. Today, our relationship has become transactional… We have a transactional relationship with the United States. We have disturbed our relationship with the Russians and we have a transactional relationship with Europe,” Gandhi said.The Congress leader then slammed the government for disrupting the country’s relationship with its immediate neighbours like Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka among others.“Our neighbourhood other than Pakistan was working with India and saw itself as being partnered with India. If you speak to the Nepali people, they are furious with what has happened. Sri Lankans have given a port to Chinese. The Maldives is disturbed. Bhutan is disturbed,” he said.He also talked about India’s economy, which is said is now “an absolute disaster”, in the video interspersed with graphics and news reports.“Our pride. Something that India used to go to the rest of the world and talk about, boast about. Worst economic growth in 50 years, no Indian site, an absolute disaster, unemployment is the highest in 40-50 years,” said Gandhi.“Our strengths have suddenly become our weaknesses.” He said the Congress party urged the government to “please realise that we are becoming vulnerable”.“We told them and said for god’s sake inject money into the economy, fire the economy and do it immediately. Protect small and medium businesses. They refused to do it,” he said.“Today you have a country which is economically in trouble, in trouble as far as foreign policy is concerned and in trouble with its neighbours. And that’s why the Chinese have decided that this is possibly the best time to act,” he said.Earlier this week the Congress lawmaker from Kerala’s Wayanad had said he will launch a video programme on current affairs and history and make them “accessible for those interested in the truth”.“I want to make our current affairs, history and crisis clear and accessible for those interested in the truth. From tomorrow, I’ll be sharing my thoughts with you on video,” Gandhi had tweeted on July 13.Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party have been critical of the government over the handling of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) situation with China after 20 Indian Army soldiers, including an officer, were killed on June 15 by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.

The animal had killed two people earlier this month, including a one-and-a-half-year-old child, which had enraged the locals.With this, two of the three leopards declared ‘maneaters’ by the forest department in last one month, have been eliminated.Sanchita Verma, range officer, Almora forest range, confirmed the killing of the leopard.According to the forest department, one-and-a-half-year old Harshit was killed by the leopard when he was playing in courtyard of his house in Udal village in Almora on July 6. Following protest by angry villagers, the leopard was declared ‘maneater’ the very next day by chief wildlife warden Uttarakhand on the request of Almora forest division. Two days after this incident, a mangled body of 70-year-old Anandi Devi also was recovered from Petshaal village of the same block on July 8. Forest officials claimed she was also killed by the same leopard.After declaring the animals ‘maneater’, forest officials invited three hunters - Nawab Saifi Asif of Bijnor, Rajeev Solomon of Moradabad (both in Uttar Pradesh) and Harish Dhami of Nainital (in Uttarakhand) - for killing the leopard. The hunters reached Almora on July 8 and had started searching for the animal.“We reached Almora on July 8 and since then were tracking the leopard. We spotted it on Friday but within seconds, it disappeared,” said Solomon.“Saifi, Dhami and I were sitting and waiting for the leopard on a scaffolding (machaan) on Thursday evening. Suddenly the leopard appeared just 50 metres away from the spot where it had killed the child. On sighting it, we took the aim and opened fire. The leopard fell and didn’t move,” he added.Saifi, another hunter, said, “Three shots were fired on the leopard with .375 magnum rifle and with .12 bore guns. The leopard died on the spot.”Forest officer Sanchita Verma said, “Leopard was a 9-year-old female around 6.10 feet long. Its one tooth and a claw of the front paw were broken. Her claws were worn out and it is likely this is what made it to attack humans.”After the killing of the ‘maneater’ leopard, the villagers of the area heaved a sigh of relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopard-which-had-killed-woman-and-child-in-uttarakhand-shot-dead/story-DMD64K69V86fqVFYK8vTBP.html

However, Singh underlined that not an inch of our land can be taken by any power in the world.India and China have held many talks over the past few weeks, even activating the Special Representatives Group to resolve the issue. “Talks are underway to resolve the border dispute but to what extent it can be resolved I cannot guarantee. I can assure you, not one inch of our land can be taken by any power in the world. If solution can be found by talks, there is nothing better,” said Singh.On Thursday, reflecting on the disengagement process between the two armies along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the army said it is an “intricate process” and “requires constant verification”.“The senior commanders reviewed the progress on implementation of the first phase of disengagement and discussed further steps to ensure complete disengagement,” army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said yesterday.The disengagement effort involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides.The government’s high-powered China Study Group (CSG) on Wednesday reviewed the latest developments in eastern Ladakh, with focus on the next stage of disengagement between the two sides.The tension between the two countries has been going on for months, but flared up after 20 army soldiers were killed in a violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops on June 15.“Recently what happened between troops of India and China at PP14, how some of our personnel sacrificed their lives protecting our border. I am happy to meet you all but also saddened because of their loss. I pay my tributes to them,” added the minister. Singh arrived in Leh as part of his two-day visit to Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir. He will go to J&K on Saturday.Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and Army Chief General MM Naravane are accompanying the defence minister.Singh witnessed para dropping while interacting with the soldiers in Stakna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-underway-but-to-what-extent-it-can-be-resolved-cannot-guarantee-rajnath-singh-on-border-row-with-china-in-ladakh/story-2vT6sMm7psmfOsNgUx7JOO.html

Kamrup Deputy Commissioner Kailash Kartik along with police rushed to the facility in Changsari on Thursday and asked the patients to clear the highway and return to the centre so that the matter could be resolved through discussions, they said. Tension prevailed in the area, however, after assurance the patients returned to the centre, an officer said. The patients alleged that they were not being provided with food and water and the condition of the beds was also not up to the mark as 10-12 of them were being kept in a single room. The deputy commissioner assured them that their allegations will be looked into and efforts made to address them, the officer said. Health and Family Welfare Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said if the patients are not happy at the Covid care facility, they can opt for home quarantine. “We have brought them to the facility so that they can be cured and they do not infect others. If they are not happy there, they can sign the undertaking and go under home quarantine,” he said at a press conference. The health workers are on duty day and night and there may have been some delay as they are overburdened, he said. “In other states, even the testing is conducted on payment but in Assam, the entire expenditure -- from testing to their stay and food -- are borne by the state government,” Sarma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-100-patients-break-out-of-covid-care-centre-block-highway-over-food-water/story-KnKsDFUXQOEnfFIStldupL.html

He cited audio clips in which Bhanwar Lal, who belongs to the sacked deputy CM and Gehlot challenger Sachin Pilot’s camp, is alleged to have conspired with the BJP leaders.Shekhawat, who has been at the forefront of lashing out at the Gehlot government for blaming the BJP for the Congress’s internal power tussle, denied that the purported voice on the tape as his.The minister also denied that he had a telephonic conversation with an intermediary called Sanjay Jain, whom the Congress alleged that has also been caught speaking on tape.Surjewala said the Congress has demanded that the SOG (Special Operations Group) of the Rajasthan Police should file an FIR (first information report) against Shekhawat, Lal, and Jain.The BJP has been vehemently denying that it instigated the bid to ensure the fall of the Gehlot government or engineered defection by colluding with Pilot and a bunch of lawmakers, who are supporting him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-crisis-ready-for-probe-says-union-minister-shekhawat/story-mzfTNlTwU24qD7a60NKjEK.html
17-07-2020||India||Rains begin to reach deficient parts of NW India, to intensify over the weekend: RWFC||Some parts of north-west India, including Haryana and Delhi-national capital region (NCR), were lashed by rains, as the monsoon trough is shifting northwards amid worries over rain deficiency in the region.In Delhi, only some neighbourhoods in south Delhi received light rains on Friday morning.The Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) said that rains would intensify over the weekend.At present, Delhi has a -52% deficiency and the corresponding figure for north-west India is -16%.“The monsoon trough (line of low pressure) has started moving northwards and is likely to bring widespread rains to the north-western region until Monday,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, RWFC.The highest deficiency is in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh at -59% and -66%, respectively; -34% in Himachal Pradesh; and -14% in Uttarakhand.Under the influence of strengthening of lower-level easterlies over north-west India and the monsoon trough, widespread rain with some heavy falls is likely over the plains of northwest India between Friday and Monday, with maximum intensity and distribution of rainfall on Saturday and Monday, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its Friday morning bulletin.In view of likely shifting of the eastern end of monsoon trough towards foothills of the Himalayas from Sunday, widespread and very heavy rain is likely over the north-east and adjoining eastern India from that day onwards.Extremely heavy rain, measuring over 20 centimetres (cm), is likely to occur over Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam and Meghalaya on Monday.Due to a strong convergence of south-westerly winds parts of Mumbai received over 20 cm of rain between Thursday and Friday. Intense rains are likely over Mumbai on Friday as well.A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector on which at least 700 million people in India are dependent for a livelihood.The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country, where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rains-begin-to-reach-deficient-parts-of-nw-india-to-intensify-over-the-weekend-rwfc/story-AsDetEbt6ZIa1DEDcBfeoK.html
17-07-2020||India||Assam: Kaziranga tigress rescued from floods released into the wild||A tigress (2) was released into the wild on Friday by the authorities of Assam’s Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR), two days after she was rescued amid the flood fury that has submerged 85% of the park, the largest habitat of one-horned rhinos in the world.The tigress was brought in a cage on a vehicle and released by forest personnel, which was captured in a telling video that showed the animal running into the wild after a few seconds of initial hesitation.The tigress was one of the two big cats that had strayed out of the park on Tuesday to escape floodwaters. While one tiger was driven away to higher locations in adjoining Karbi Anglong district, the tigress moved to a nearby village and spent the night in a thatched hut’s kitchen.The forest officials and veterinarians tranquilised the tigress on Wednesday afternoon, as they were apprehensive about its safety because of the widespread monsoon-induced inundation in the area and shifted it to the Centre for Wildlife Research and Conservation (CWRC) located at Borjuri near the park.“The decision was taken to tranquilise and rescue the tigress because it had not moved out of the village on its own. The animal was kept under observation at CWRC for two nights,” said P. Sivakumar, director KNPTR.Veterinarians and CWRC personnel conducted a thorough health check-up of the tigress and decided to release it back to the wild after they were convinced that the animal had not suffered any injury and would be safe on nature’s lap.“I thank all forest personnel, who were involved in the rescue and release of the animal, and hope it will thrive in the wild,” said Dr. Shamshul Ali, a wildlife veterinarian.Earlier on Monday, another male tiger had come out of the park to escape floodwaters. The animal moved back inside the park after spending a few hours outside.Kaziranga, which is spread over 430 square kilometres, is home to 121 Royal Bengal Tigers — one of the highest densities of the species anywhere.This monsoon, 86 wild animals, including five rhinos, four of which due to drowning, have died in and around the park, while 125 other animals, including a one-year-old female rhino calf, have been rescued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-kaziranga-tigress-rescued-from-floods-released-into-the-wild/story-2zZY8xkHFGSORxw0gbcAsK.html

They have been identified as members of the terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), according to news agency ANI, which quoted Jammu and Kashmir Police chief Dilbag Singh.“Three terrorists were killed in a joint operation launched in the wee hours of Friday by the Central Reserve Police Force’s (CRPF) units, Army and the Kulgam Police on a credible input about the presence of terrorists in village Chimmer,” Singh said.The DGP said that the terrorists were given instructions by their Pakistani handlers and were responsible for a large number of attacks.Out of the three terrorists, one has been identified as Walid, a Pakistan national. He was active in Jammu and Kashmir for past one and half years, the police said. “He had escaped our cordon four times and was the most wanted terrorist,” said Vijay Kumar, Inspector General of Police, Kashmir.The DGP said that Walid was a top IED expert.Three soldiers were injured in the encounter, which began early in Friday after the security forces got inputs about the presence of terrorists in the Nagnad-Chimmer area. A search and cordon operation was launched, and when the security forces reached the area the terrorists opened fire and the gunfight began, the police said.The injured soldiers have been admitted to the army hospital.Incriminating materials including arms and ammunition have been recovered from the terrorists, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-jaish-terrorists-killed-in-kulgam-encounter-top-ied-expert-among-them-police/story-b0bVZThBKlQpivw0InC0YN.html
17-07-2020||India||10 years on, family of Odisha cop killed in landmine blast yet to get land||The family of an Odisha policeman, who was killed a decade ago in an attack by Maoists, has said it has not got the land the government had promised for all personnel killed in areas affected by the insurgency.Bibhisana Sahu of Pandiapali village in Sonepur district was killed in 2010 along with 10 other troopers of the Special Operations Group, an anti-Maoist specialist force like the Greyhounds of Andhra Pradesh, when the Maoists triggered a landmine in Boipariguda area of Koraput.The policemen were travelling in a vehicle to Malkangiri district from Baipariguda in Koraput district on road clearing when the blast occurred. Eyewitnesses said the impact of the blast was so severe that the vehicle was blown up at least 25 feet in the air before falling into a ditch below. Severed parts of the policemen’s bodies, including those of the 24-year-old Sahu, were found on trees.Though his family received the financial assistance and his younger brother Pankah got a job in the police department, his family is yet to get the 10 decimals land that the government had announced for all the slain policemen in Maoist areas.“I have been running to government offices for getting the patta of the 10 decimals of land that the government had announced, however, I am yet to get it,” Sahu’s father, Baikuntha, said.“I have provided all necessary documents to the government, but have not succeeded. How long would we have to run around for a piece of land? Don’t the families of the police martyrs deserve respect?” he asked.Sonepur district collector Monisha Banerjee said she has recently gone through all the documents of the case and ordered for the speeding up of the process.“I don’t know as to why the process was delayed. We should be able to give the land to the family in the next two months,” Banerjee said.The state government has claimed major gains in its fight against the Maoists by announcing exclusion of five districts from the list of affected ones.Last week, Odisha’s director general of police (DGP) Abhay said the state has recommended to the Union ministry of home affairs to exclude five districts from the list of those get funding from the Centre’s Security Related Expenditure (SRE) scheme for fighting the Maoists. Abhay said with Maoist situation improving in the state and more rebels surrendering due to aggressive police action, Odisha has now recommended to the Centre to drop Angul, Boudh, Sambalpur, Deogarh and Nayagarh.Once the Centre excludes these districts, Odisha would have 10 districts under SRE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-years-on-family-of-odisha-cop-killed-in-landmine-blast-yet-to-get-land/story-ujvKqPoLghtnQrLWS2IkqO.html
17-07-2020||India||June saw India make its first trade surplus in 18 years. But this isn’t good news||India’s trade balance went into positive territory in June . The last time this happened was in January 2002. In normal circumstances, a trade surplus generates tail winds for economic growth. Exports are demand for domestic goods by foreign buyers, whereas imports constitute a leakage of domestic incomes on foreign goods, and the surplus -- the difference between the two -- turning positive is usually good news. Many people including Piyush Goyal, the union minister of commerce and industry have celebrated the trade account turning positive. “Rapid Turnaround of Exports: Realising PM @NarendraModi ji’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, for the first time in 18 years, India records a monthly goods trade surplus in June!”, Goyal tweeted on 15 July.However, under the current circumstances, a trade surplus might actually be bad rather than good news. Here’s why.The world economy today is characterised by global value chains. A large part of trade flows are driven by derived demand. For example, if mobile phone factories were importing batteries and motherboards for the final product, a fall in production of mobile phones will lead to a fall in import of batteries and motherboard. In this case, a sudden fall in imports might be symptomatic of fall in domestic economic activity rather than gains on the import substitution front, which is what the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign seeks to achieve..A large part of India’s import requirements fall squarely in the derived demand nature. According to the World Bank’s WITS database, almost 90% of India’s imports is made up of raw materials, intermediate goods or capital goods i.e. means to undertake domestic production activity. The share of consumer goods in Indian exports is much higher. India had the highest import to export ratio in the raw material category, a proportion that is skewed by crude oil imports. Unfortunately, the WITS analysis is only available up to 2018. However, it is unlikely that India’s domestic production and import structure have changed radically after this period.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();It is useful to analyse the June 2020 trade surplus in this background.A comparison of June 2020 and June 2019 trade statistics shows that both exports and imports have fallen in comparison to last year.This analysis uses information from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database to classify imports and exports into useful categories. Exports are divided into petroleum and non-petroleum exports while imports are classified into petroleum, gold and silver and other imports. The biggest fall in absolute terms is in the non-petroleum and non-gold and silver import category. This, as has been pointed above is most likely a result of a fall in derived demand for intermediate and capital goods arising from a fall in domestic production. This is not good news for the economy. In proportional terms, petroleum imports have more than halved thanks to a reduced demand and low crude prices.Experts agree. The “surprise trade surplus...could be reflective of weak domestic demand, relative to global demand; the weakness in imports was spread across investment and consumption goods”, said a note by Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/june-saw-india-make-its-first-trade-surplus-in-18-years-but-this-isn-t-good-news/story-yhThGOLNr9qkDu7cRxicHN.html

And with such an increase in demand, it is an opportunity to grow the domestic market as well as increasing the prospects of exporting to other countries, helping boost the Indian economy,” Arvind Jala, co-director of Aditi Toys told ANI.“In the next three-four months we hope that we would make more than 100 products and in one year, we would make more than 200 products so that we would be able to fulfill the demand of the Indian market.”Jala opined that there are very few toy entrepreneurs but believes that this industry can be a potential one for entrepreneurs to tap into.“There are very few toy entrepreneurs in the country at the moment making it a good opportunity for entrepreneurs to delve into. The competition too is also low and compared to other industries, there are more employment opportunities over here,” he said.Subhash Jala, the co-director of the toy company said that with anti-China movements across the country taking place wherein people have been boycotting Chinese products, there has been a demand for made in India products these days.“The anti-Chinese movement has made people demand made in India products these days,” he said.On June 15, twenty Indian soldiers were killed during combat with Chinese forces in Galwan valley, leading to tensions between both nations. Chinese soldiers subsequently started moving back following dialogues between two countries through the military level and diplomatic level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-made-in-india-toys-increase-in-gujarat-s-rajkot-amid-chinese-products-boycott/story-w20QG1a3XZTYham0TZa9TP.html

BSF’s probe has revealed that the stranded people belong to Bangladesh’s Comilla district. “On July 11 at about 6 pm, 12 people, including a man, four women, and seven children, were traced near border pillar No. 2039/12-S. They revealed to a BSF patrol party that they are residents of Harikula village under Chandina police station of Bangladesh’s Comilla district. They were directed to go back to Bangladesh’s territory,” stated a BSF press release issued on Thursday evening.However, BGB personnel has refused to take them back, as they allegedly don’t have valid documents to prove their Bangladeshi nationality.Initially, a flag meeting was held between BSF and BGB personnel on July 11, where the latter made their stand clear.Three days later, another flag meeting was held, where the BSF personnel handed over the documents of the 12 stranded people, including photographs, home addresses, family tree chart and a compact disc (CD) containing a video clip that depicted a purported conversation between Kulsum Bibi and her son in her native Bangladesh, to BGB authorities,“ ... as per the understanding between the BSF and BGB personnel, women and children apprehended at the International Border have to be handed over/accepted by BGB/BSF, subject to confirmation of their nationality, immediately after apprehension, and treating them as victims of human trafficking,” the release added. BSF authorities have alleged that their Bangladeshi counterparts are deliberately delaying the process of ascertaining the nationality of the 12 people, who are stranded on the Indo-Bangla border since July 11.The BSF is providing basic amenities to the stranded people on humanitarian ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-bangladeshi-nationals-including-7-children-stranded-on-indo-bangla-border-for-six-days/story-wu2dXrAsfHXM39dRNplMVN.html

17-07-2020||India||Man accused of raping 6 minors brought to Bhopal, will be produced before court on Friday||A 68-year-old man, accused of raping six minor girls in Bhopal in the past few years, was brought to the Madhya Pradesh capital on Thursday. He was arrested in Srinagar on Wednesday.The accused will be produced before a court on Friday, the police said.He had been on the run since Sunday after five of the six girls lodged an FIR against him. The man was arrested from a hotel in Srinagar with the help of Jammu and Kashmir Police.“Besides the crime related to rape we are also investigating if he was a part of a drug peddlers’ racket as we have gathered information in this regard,” said a police officer, who is part of the investigation, on cindition of anonymity.A resident of Shahpura locality in Bhopal, the man runs a small vernacular newspaper and was a state-level state government accredited journalist. He was also allotted a government bungalow which was later cancelled.Additional Director General (ADG) of Police, Bhopal, Upendra Jain said, “After the incident of rape came to light, he fled to Mumbai in a taxi and later reached Srinagar by a flight via Delhi. Police got the information on Tuesday that he was staying in a hotel in Srinagar.”“Police are interrogating him to know why did he go to Srinagar and who are the other accomplices in his crime. Two years ago, the police had arrested the friends of his son in connection with drug peddling. Now, police have got information that the rape accused has a strong connection with drug peddlers. We are trying to verify the information,” said Jain.“Police have also written to Income Tax department and Enforcement directorate as he has amassed huge wealth disproportionate to his source of income,” he added. Meanwhile, the advocate of the accused claimed that his client was a victim of political conspiracy. “He was not arrested from Srinagar but fact is he surrendered before the police,” said the lawyer Wahid Khan.The man’s daughter said, “My father is suffering from prostate cancer and he is being targeted by some politicians. After police had taken the girls to the police station my father had approached the police personnel to prove his innocence but he was not allowed to do so. Had he been an accused in any crime, the police should have arrested him immediately. But it was not done and the entire story was fabricated. Police demolished his legal properties as a part of a conspiracy.”A joint team of district administration, Bhopal municipal corporation (BMC) and police razed a marriage hall and a three-storey apartment owned by him in the city. The buildings were allegedly built by him illegally on government land, as per administrative authorities.Notably, the five teenager girls were spotted in an intoxicated state by a police patrol team in Ratibad area in Bhopal in the wee hours on Sunday. During counselling by the Childline, the girls narrated their ordeal about repeated rape with them in the past few years by the accused. Later on Monday, one more minor girl came forward and registered a case of rape against him, said police. He faces three FIRs lodged with Shahpura, Koh-e-fiza and Shyamla Hills police stations under sections 366 (a) (procuration of minor girls), 376 (2) (n) (repeated rape), 120 b (criminal conspiracy) and sections 5/6 and 14 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Wildlife Protection Act and under relevant sections of SC/ST (Prevention of atrocities) Act, said the DIG of police. As of now, police have arrested four people including two women, who were working as his aide for luring the girls and shifting them from one place to another, according to police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-accused-of-raping-6-minors-brought-to-bhopal-will-be-produced-before-court-on-friday/story-55G19lBnIjvpf7LMijAfnO.html
17-07-2020||India||Covid-19 rears head during Madhya Pradesh govt’s ‘Kill Corona’ campaign||The Madhya Pradesh government’s much talked about campaign to tackle the coronavirus pandemic has seen the situation worsening in the state, driving authorities in several districts to clamp curfews and lockdowns or amend orders to reschedule opening of markets.When the “Kill Corona” campaign began on July 1, there were 13,593 Covid-19 patients in the state and of whom 572 had died. On July 15, when the campaign ended the number of patients stood at 19,643 and the death toll at 682.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn comparison to the period earlier, the number of Covid-19 cases increased by 200% during the fortnight. During the campaign, as many as 6,050 new Covid-19 patients were identified across the state and 110 died.On average, 400 new patients were identified and more than seven died every day during this period in comparison to 133 Covid-19 cases and more than five people dying every day in over three months prior to the campaign.The major contributors to the Covid-19 cases during this fortnight were Bhopal (993 cases), Gwalior (876), Indore (787), Morena (734) and Jabalpur (242). The new cases from these five cities accounted for more than 60% of the 6,050 new cases identified in the first fortnight of July. A seven-day curfew has been clamped in Gwalior since Tuesday while a complete lockdown has been imposed in Morena. In Indore and Bhopal, the opening of markets has been rescheduled. When the campaign was launched, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said the government and the society will work together in all districts during the “important campaign of controlling the virus and to generate health awareness”.“A meaningful message will be conveyed by this unique and major campaign to other states too,” Chouhan had said in an official meeting as per the state government’s official communiqué.“About 14,000 women and men health workers of the state will be entrusted with the important responsibility of survey work… Now, the task of identifying the suspected patients quickly and treatment will become easier through the door to door survey in the state. We have to work with a strategy for total control on the virus,” he had said.Interestingly, when the campaign ended on Wednesday the chief minister, as per another official communiqué, said in a meeting, “Positive cases are emerging due to reasons such as organising marriage ceremonies and parties at the social level, hence action should be taken to control it at both government and social level with alertness.” “Social distancing, use of masks and precautions must be continued. The causes behind the emergence of positive cases must be eliminated,” he said.Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said the Kill Corona campaign was to address the gaps in identifying the Covid-19 cases with special attention to the vast rural areas in the state. “The government’s strategy continues to remain the same—identifying cases, isolation, test and treatment. However, what we have seen during this campaign is more and more cases coming from urban areas which were already on the radar of the government. Hence, the government can’t say now that the cases in these cities increased due to more testing under the campaign,” Nidhi said. Nidhi said, “The government must increase the number of Covid tests and labs while strictly enforcing compliance of safety norms including lockdown restrictions. But the fact is there are crowds of people on streets and in markets. There are political activities in view of by-polls with hardly any respect for social distancing norms. Markets are being opened and run as per the wishes of politicians.”State government data shows 11,703 survey teams had conducted the health survey of 75% of the state’s population and 93,000 samples had been taken during the Kill Corona campaign till July 14, out of which 1,611 or 1.72% of the total samples taken tested positive.“When the government’s data itself is self-explanatory that when there are an insignificant number of patients identified under campaign the problem lies somewhere else,” SR Azad, a public health expert, said.“The government must admit that it has either failed to address the reasons or is not looking into the same for any reason,” Azad added.State home minister Narottam Mishra, who headed health department as well till a few days back, said the coronavirus pandemic is spreading fast not only in India but the entire world. “The Kill Corona campaign was aimed at increasing the number of tests and identifying the patients early. The number of tests was enhanced significantly. If a patient is identified early and treated it will reduce the number of deaths,” Mishra said.“Any death is unfortunate for us and the state government is making all-out efforts to prevent deaths caused by Corona. We have succeeded also in our efforts,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-rears-head-during-madhya-pradesh-govt-s-kill-corona-campaign/story-SbK2Y8bpADaFOywCzqbSXN.html

The defence minister visited Stakna forward areas after landing in Ladakh where the troops showed him paradropping skills of the armed forces. Leaving for Leh on a two day visit to Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. I shall be visiting the forward areas to review the situation at the borders and also interact with the Armed Forces personnel deployed in the region. Looking forward to it.The defence minister is on a two-day visit to Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir. While he is in Ladakh on the first day of his visit today, the defence minister will go to Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday.Singh’s visit comes at a time when there is military tension between India and China in the sensitive sector.Both the sides recently held the fourth round of talks on disengagement in eastern Ladakh. In the talks between corps commanders of the Indian and Chinese armies, that started on Tuesday and stretched into the early hours of Wednesday, both sides discussed the roadmap for further reducing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The focus of the latest round of military talks was to hammer out a consensus on easing tensions in the Finger Area near Pangong Tso and Depsang plains as well as pulling back weapons and equipment from friction points in other sectors, said people aware of the developments.The previous attempts to reduce tensions along the contested border were made on June 6, June 22 and June 30.Singh was expected to visit Ladakh in early July but his tour was deferred. The defence minister will be visiting Ladakh two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled visit to the sector on July 3. The PM then declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China about India’s determination to defend its borders.The military is keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 2.The tension along the LAC began after 20 Indian soldiers were killed during a face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh’s Galwan valley on June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-leaves-for-ladakh-will-visit-forward-areas-meet-indian-soldiers/story-naVGBKu9ckI4V5G5GtwRLN.html

But that hasn’t helped in bringing down the number of cases.Guwahati, as well as rest of Kamrup Metro, has been witnessing nearly 500 cases every day for the past few days. On Thursday, Assam recorded 892 new Covid-19 cases of which 598 were from Kamrup Metro alone. Till Thursday, the state had recorded 50 deaths—26 of them were from Kamrup Metro. “We have been getting around 500-600 cases on an average daily since the past 10 days. The situation continues to be alarming. We were expecting that the Covid-19 curve would flatten, but that hasn’t happened yet,” Biswajit Pegu, deputy commissioner of Kamrup Metro, said.“Our policy is to detect as many cases as possible and the good thing is we are detecting them. People are coming voluntarily to the screening centres and getting tested. We have tested over 50,000 people in the 31 screening centres in Guwahati and also did door-to-door tests in some localities,” he added.Nearly 200 new cases are getting detected at the screening centres daily. But cases are also emerging from the Raj Bhavan, the state secretariat, hospitals and the central jail.According to officials, around 200 inmates of the jail, which houses nearly 1,000 convicted and under trial prisoners, have tested positive for the coronavirus disease. The most prominent of them being peasant activist and founder of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) Akhil Gogoi, who is at present undergoing treatment.Reports say nearly half a dozen senior bureaucrats posted at the state secretariat have tested positive and over 600 Assam Police personnel including two senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officials have also got infected.Unconfirmed reports say around 30 doctors, posted in government and private hospitals, in Guwahati have also tested positive. Earlier this week, a senior doctor at Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) succumbed to Covid-19.“A total of 45 people have been detected in Raj Bhavan till date but not all are staff members. Some are from security, intelligence, fire services etc. Governor Jagdish Mukhi and his wife had undergone tests, which came out negative,” Lucky Biswas, Raj Bhavan spokesperson, said.Besides the six government hospitals treating coronavirus disease patients, the district has over a dozen Covid care centres (CCCs) where asymptomatic cases are being kept. New CCCs are being opened frequently to accommodate the rising number of cases.Health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Thursday in order to bring down infections in Kamrup Metro, the state government will conduct around three lakh tests by the end of August.“Till now we have conducted around 1.10 lakh tests, we plan to complete another 1.90 lakh by next month. To achieve that we will employ 150 lab technicians and set up 60 more Covid screening centres besides the 31 we already have. Testing and tracing are keys to reducing numbers,” he said.Sarma said the ongoing lockdown measures will be relaxed in a gradual manner over the next weeks to ensure there is no fresh spurt in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-raj-bhavan-secretariat-jail-record-covid-19-cases-as-kamrup-metro-sees-spike-in-infections-despite-lockdown/story-jLTfsA9xfOv5qMo6YhY3BJ.html

Its lower share of deaths (compared to cases) and higher share of those recovered means the country hasn’t done too badly (relatively), but as a friend, with whom I shared this sentiment, said: “Try telling that to the 25,000 people who have died – or their families.” Numbers, unfortunately, can’t capture the pain.Six months is all it has taken for Covid-19 to upend all plans for 2020, disrupt lives and livelihoods, and prematurely usher in a future for which not everyone is ready, and which comes with its own set of inequalities. Still worse, its impact on people is directly related to current inequalities – most notably around income, class, and gender. The poorest and the most vulnerable have been hit the hardest, and there are fears that millions may slip back into the poverty from which they emerged only recently. Even among businesses, it is the smaller ones, already weakened by the rush to formalise the economy over the past four years, that have borne the brunt.Around 55.7% of India’s first million cases are from Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. That trend is already waning, though. On Wednesday, only 44% of the new cases came from the two states and the Capital. On Tuesday, only 43% did. And on Monday, a little less than 43% did. While it is true that we are still seeing the first wave of infections at the national level, and cases could spike again in Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, I believe what we are beginning to see now is the end (or the beginning of the end) of the first phase of the virus’s run in India. Since April, the two states and the Capital have accounted for a large proportion of the cases in India. In early April, the three accounted for 50% of new cases, a proportion that fluctuated sharply that month, but then rose again to around 50% by the end, then hovered between 50% and 70% (yes, it went that high) in May and June. On June 22, the two states and the Capital accounted for 69.3% of new cases. That was the peak. Since then, the share of the three in daily new cases has been falling. It was around 60% in early July.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Eight states are in line to take over: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Together, they accounted for 42% of the new cases on Wednesday. This is a proportion that has been the rise since July 1, when they accounted for just 29.3% of new cases.Together, they also account for around 55% of India’s population.Could the run of the coronavirus disease through these states mark India’s second phase?It could, and that should raise red flags everywhere. The quality of public health care in some of these states (as reflected in their development indicators) is a cause for concern. But this group is problematic for another reason – it has states that have the worst record when it comes to testing, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, even Gujarat. As they start testing more, they will discover new cases, which means their share of the daily new cases could rise even more and even faster – at the current doubling rate, India could reach two million cases in the second week of August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-UKXfFvUat8ipxTevfrjuSK.html

Johari sought a two-month bail citing co-morbid conditions that posed a grave risk to his health in jail. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde remarked, “You are the brain behind it” as the court refused to accept the argument by Johari’s lawyer senior advocate Kapil Sibal that he was just an employee of the company.The SFIO arrested Johari in May 2019 and filed a charge-sheet the same year claiming that while as CFO, Johari fraudulently obtained letters of credit from banks worth nearly Rs 20,000 crore by furnishing false documents. SFIO further alleged in the chargesheet that during 2016-17, Johari inflated the inventory of raw materials to avail enhanced working capital from lenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bhushan-steel-cfo-s-bail-plea-rejected/story-jDvL8jkE1XWPMSFuz78kVK.html

Only personnel involved in essential services permitted by the Deputy Commissioner, Jiribam, will be allowed,” said the order signed by Dr J Suresh Babu, state chief secretary and chairman, state executive committee. The Jiribam district which borders southern Assam had been under complete lockdown since July 5 after a sudden spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases.Meanwhile, the state recorded 64 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, said Dr Khoirom Sasheekumar Mangang, additional director and spokesperson of the state health department in a press release on Thursday night.The cumulative number of positive cases in the state now stands at 1,764.The number of active and recovered cases is 635 and 1,129 respectively.With the discharge of 49 persons in the last 24 hours, the recovery rate in the state rose to 64 percent on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-complete-lockdown-extended-in-manipur-s-jiribam-district-for-7-days/story-JUAYGRPxxltdyQy9EYwu2K.html
17-07-2020||India||‘Didn’t get free access to Kulbhushan Jadhav’: India slams Pakistan||A meeting between Indian officials and Kulbhushan Jadhav on Thursday ended inconclusively, with New Delhi accusing Islamabad of breaching its assurance of providing unimpeded access to the former naval officer sentenced to death in Pakistan for alleged involvement in espionage.Pakistan provided consular access to Jadhav for only the second time since he was detained in March 2016. But when two Indian consular officials went to meet him, they found Pakistani officials with “an intimidating demeanour” near Jadhav and a camera being used to record the conversation, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said.The Indian officials met Jadhav to discuss filing a review petition in Islamabad high court against his death sentence by the deadline of July 20, and required privacy to talk about the matter.“The consular officers could not engage Jadhav on his legal rights and were prevented from obtaining his written consent for arranging his legal representation,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.“In the light of these circumstances, the Indian consular officers came to the conclusion that the consular access being offered by Pakistan was neither meaningful nor credible. After lodging a protest, they left the venue.”Srivastava said India had taken up Pakistan’s offer of consular access only after receiving an assurance regarding “unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional access”.Thursday’s developments added another twist to the case of Jadhav, 50, as only four days remain under an ordinance promulgated by the Pakistan government to file a review petition in the Islamabad high court. Srivastava said India made more than 12 requests for consular access to Jadhav over the past year. “This consular access is of utmost importance, as it is the basis for a process of effective review and reconsideration ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in July 2019 of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav by a Pakistani military tribunal,” he said.The Pakistani ordinance, promulgated ostensibly to comply with ICJ’s order, envisages an Indian consular official filing the review petition. Any conversation between Jadhav and the consular officials “must necessarily take place in privacy and without the presence of any Pakistani official or recording by Pakistan”, Srivastava said. It was evident Jadhav had been “intimidated repeatedly in the past, including in being made to express his alleged disinclination to seek a review”, he added. India’s latest request for consular access included several conditions — Pakistan was asked to ensure the meeting was held in an “atmosphere free from fear of retribution”, without the presence of any Pakistani official, and without any video and audio recording.“After extensive discussions, the Pakistan side conveyed that they were ready to organise consular access on July 16. We were assured this consular access would be unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional,” Srivastava said.“Regrettably, however, neither the environment nor the arrangements of the meeting were in accordance with the assurances of Pakistan,” he added. Jadhav was “visibly under stress” and indicated this to the Indian officials.Srivastava described Pakistan’s approach as “obstructive and insincere”. He added, “It has not only violated its assurance to the ICJ to fully implement the 2019 judgment, but also failed to act in accordance with its own ordinance.” External affairs minister S Jaishanakr apprised Jadhav’s family of the developments even as the Indian side reiterated its commitment to ensure his safe return to India.Consular access to Jadhav was first provided in September 2019, while his mother and wife had been allowed to meet him in December 2017.Pakistan on Thursday reiterated its accusations that Jadhav was arrested in Balochistan province on March 3, 2016, and had “confessed” to his involvement in terror activities. India has already dismissed such charges and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani intelligence operatives from Iran’s Chabahar port, where he was running a business.ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention, and stayed his execution while calling on Islamabad to take all steps for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence, including “enacting appropriate legislation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/didn-t-get-free-access-to-jadhav-india-slams-pak/story-1TeCpZjEoyWBx9hQAIfnkL.html
17-07-2020||India||1 million Covid-19 infections in India, toll nears 25,600||India on Thursday became only the third country in the world — after the United States and Brazil — to hit a million Covid-19 infections, with 36,247 new cases taking the country’s tally to 1,004,652, and 690 new fatalities putting the disease death toll in the four-and-a-half months of the outbreak at 25,594. Experts estimate the next million to take less than a month — the doubling rate stands at 20.6 days — and say the focus now needs to shift to rural parts of the country that traditionally have been beyond the reach of adequate health care mechanisms, and where new hot spots are now feared to pop up.On Thursday, India had 343,268 active cases and the case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of people who succumbed to the illness from among known infections — was 2.5%. The US, which has 3,648,250 cases and 140,518 deaths, has a fatality rate of 3.9%; and Brazil, with 1,978,236 cases and 75,697 infections, is at 3.8%. India’s journey to a million cases took 137 days, and half of these were in a hard nationwide lockdown announced in the early days of the outbreak — a strategy that officials and experts said bought the country precious time to set up isolation centres, add hospital beds and beef up testing infrastructure. With crippling economic costs piling up, the country began unlocking in June, when the outbreak was on a sharp upward trajectory. Click here for complete coronavirus casesIn the last week, however, India has added an average of 30,076 cases a day, up from 23,895 a day in the seven-day period before that. At least two states, Bihar and Assam, announced they will be reimposing lockdowns while Uttar Pradesh — the state with the highest population — said it will follow a weekend shutdown.At this rate, Covid-19 infections are on track this year to surpass the roughly 2.4 million tuberculosis infections recorded in India in the 12 months of 2019, and lead to a comparable number of deaths. TB, widely regarded as the deadliest infectious disease in India, led to the deaths of around 79,000 people, according to the Union government’s India TB Report 2020, although the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates this number to be over 400,000. “With nearly 400,000 active Covid-19 cases, we will never be able to have a long enough lockdown to get the cases to 100s,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, the head of biostatistics at University of Michigan, among a team of academics from three American universities that predicted India would hit 1 million cases by July 15 after the lockdown began to lift.Mukherjee stressed on the need to step up testing and closely analyse real-time data in order to head off the outbreak. “It is important to identify states and metros at nascent stages of growth and impose strong measures, including punctuated modulated lockdown. This cannot be done when infections are already leading to large case-counts. What you are seeing today happened two weeks ago,” she added. A second expert said that increasing testing in places where coverage has been limited will now be crucial. “There’s no doubt that the disease is widespread, with even community transmission obvious in certain states. The way ahead is to test as many people as possible, to be able to track and isolate those people who are infected so that the disease spread is contained. If you isolate them in time then the spread in the community will be curtailed,” said Dr Jacob John, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore.India’s average weekly test positive rate has risen from 7.7% in mid-June to 10.1% at present, but the aggregate level statistics mask sharp differences in testing performance across the country. Maharashtra, the state with the highest number of infections at 284,281, has a test positive rate close to 20%, while for Uttar Pradesh, this number is less than 4%.WHO identifies 8-12% as the ideal range for test positive rate in a country with an active outbreak. A number too low or too high implies that volume as well as targeting of Covid-19 testing is inadequate to accurately detect the spread of the disease. Three states have a test positive rate in this range. Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have a positive rate of 8.7% and 9% but experts have expressed scepticism on the numbers due to the other parameters reported from these region. Tamil Nadu has a CFR of 1.4% while for Gujarat, this number is 4.7%.Delhi is the only other region with a test positive rate of 8.1%, as well as the highest per population testing numbers across the country. The national capital has recorded a sustained decrease in new cases for the last six days at least, and a dashboard by Mukherjee and her team estimates that the rate of transmission in the Capital is now below 1 — a threshold below which an outbreak can potentially be halted.“Only two states, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, constitute 48.15% of country’s total active case load. Of the total 36 states and UTs, only 10 states constitute 84.62% of the total active case load,” the Union health ministry said in a statement on Thursday, adding that “targeted measures have contributed to a steady decline in the number of active cases”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-million-infections-in-india/story-POhE9MvLix1MFFwPeKr2oO.html
17-07-2020||India||234 universities to hold exams in August -September||Over 180 universities have conducted exams while another 234 are planning to hold them online in August and September, according to the University Grants Commission (UGC). UGC, the higher education regulator, wrote to 640 universities seeking the status of examinations after it issued guidelines for conducting them on July 6. The guidelines made it mandatory to hold exams for the final year students.UGC on July 6 asked universities and colleges to hold their final-year, or final-semester examinations, by September 30. The direction came as the Union home ministry’s approved the conduct of these tests.The examinations can be held either online, or offline (pen and paper), or using a combination of both. For students other than those in the final year, universities and colleges can choose their own exam method to close the academic session. Colleges and universities have been closed in the country since March 16 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Over 450 have written to UGC saying they have either conducted the exams or were planning to do so. According to UGC data, accessed by HT, 182 universities have conducted exams either online or offline while 234 others planned them over the next two months. Around 30 universities are awaiting directions from their statutory councils before holding the exams.According to information available with the regulator, 177 universities are yet to take a final call on holding the tests. In the case of 27 private universities set up in 2019-20, they do not have final year students yet and do not have to hold the exams.UGC’s advisory asking universities to hold exams was based on recommendations of a committee led by Central University of Haryana vice-chancellor R C Kuhad.UGC has said holding exams was important to retain the Indian education system’s credibility and that it would be in the interest of students.States like Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi had expressed their inability in conducting the exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Delhi government had said it was in favour of cancelling all exams.Officials said the Punjab government also wrote to UGC asking it to reconsider its suggestions. The regulator is learnt to have asked it to find a suitable way of holding the exams. The Union Human Resource Development ministry has also released guidelines on how exams can be held. Officials said the ministry feels that even state and private universities should abide by the UGC guidelines as the regulator is entrusted with maintaining educational standards. “UGC sought data from various universities. In what is a positive sign, a large number of them have either held exams or are in the process [of holding them]. UGC believes that holding exams for final year students would be greatly beneficial to their long-term prospects,” said an official.Institutions like Delhi University have tried to conduct exams but have faced opposition from students and parents with some citing digital divide in case of online tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/234-varsities-to-hold-exams-in-aug-sept/story-LySDvlFT6sdNSrNVNOJ8qJ.html
17-07-2020||India||No postal ballots for those aged over 65 in Bihar polls||The Election Commission on Thursday said it has decided not to notify the law ministry’s amendment to the Representation of People Act, 1951, that would have allowed those over the age of 65 to use postal ballots in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections and by-elections due in the near future, in a move welcomed by political parties. The law ministry, on the recommendation of the Commission, had decided to allow people over 65 to vote remotely in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The provision was supposed to be an enabling one. Five key opposition parties wrote to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora to reconsider the move which some of them said would unduly benefit the ruling Janata Dal (United), or JDU-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) alliance in Bihar. The Bihar assembly lapses in November this year and Arora had told Hindustan Times in an interview on June 27 that as of now, the elections will be held when they are due. It will be the first assembly election since the pandemic began. According to EC officials, there are also nearly 50 by-elections that the Commission is gearing up to conduct. The Commission has cited “the field situation and logistics of operationalization” as the rationale behind its decision to not allow postal ballots. “Before every election, we have our field officers evaluate the practical situation on the ground,” a poll body official said on condition of anonymity. “Their assessment suggests that it may not be feasible to have postal ballots.”The EC official added that the Commission had listened to and evaluated the representations made by the political parties, but that wasn’t the reason behind the decision. “We heard all of them and their various objections to the postal ballot. The decision, though, has not been taken on the grounds that they made,” the official said. The official added that the amendment to the RP Act would still hold. “If we want to use it, we can notify it ahead of the election. That is how it was done in Delhi and Jharkhand.” The facility of optional postal ballots to electors who are above 80 years of age, persons with disabilities , voters engaged in essential services and voters who are Covid-19 positive or are suspected to be carrying the virus and quarantine (home/institutional) will be extended in these elections.Among the dissenting political parties were Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Trinamool Congress (TMC), Communist Party of India (CPI)and Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M). CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury was among the first to raise concerns about postal ballots favouring the ruling party. This was followed by a representation by the Congress that said that the step would violate the secrecy of the vote. TMC, CPI and RJD also wrote to the Commission stating that no political parties had been consulted before the decision was taken. The Commission, in a detailed reply to Yechury mentioned that Bihar’s chief electoral officer had held consultations with various political parties. Yechury said that while they may not have notified the use of amendment for the polls, the change in the RP Act has already been made. “It is the constitutional mandate of the Commission to provide a level playing field,” said Yechury. “They have decreed the amendment, the EC can use it. All parties should have been consulted before the amendment was made. That has not been done.”Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Modi was among the first to welcome the EC’s decision to drop the idea of postal ballots, as did the opposition parties. “Postal ballots could have been misused by parties like the RJD and Congress,” Modi told Hindustan Times. “RJD in any case has a culture of looting votes. Moreover, there would have been logistical issues. The EC would have to amass enough manpower to collect postal ballots from nearly 30,000 people in every constituency.”According to Modi, nearly 10% of Bihar’s population is above 65. There are over 70 million voters in Bihar. “There were concerns raised about the secrecy of postal ballot and also the safety of voters. The decision was hasty and without due application of mind. We welcome today’s decision of the EC and hope appropriate measures will be taken to safeguard the health of voters,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said. According to Derek O’Brien, Trinamool’s Parliamentary party leader in the Rajya Sabha, the decision was an undemocratic one.“Trinamool had written to the Commission giving compelling reasons why they were ill-advised to be pushed into taking a decision that was completely illegal, undemocratic and was arrived at without consulting any political parties. So that is that,” O’Brien said. West Bengal is scheduled to go to the polls in the first half of 2021. RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha also stressed that by not notifying the amendment, a free and fair election would be ensured in the state. “We are glad that the EC has decided to not notify the amendment. Any change whatsoever in the peoples representation act should only be done by engaging through wider consultations. The commission should always remember that the idea of free and fair election as well as ensuring level playing field is not simply rhetoric,” RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-postal-ballots-for-those-aged-over-65-in-bihar-polls/story-hDN7xVxrRSMU3uS2TOvlKK.html
17-07-2020||India||Goa governor holds meeting with CM, asks state govt to plug ‘shortfalls’||Goa governor Satya Pal Malik asked the chief minister and other senior officials to plug the “shortfalls” of the state administration in fighting the spread of Covid-19, in an extensive meeting at the Raj Bhavan on Thursday.The meeting is seen as a run-in between the governor and the chief minister over the handling of the crisis. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who is under fire from opposition parties as well as civil society, also found himself under the scanner, with the governor questioning the “error of judgement” in not locking down Vasco da Gama, the epicentre of the virus in the state, due to which the entire state is under threat. “I have raised several issues during the meeting. Wherever they have done a good job, I commended, and where they have fallen short, I have also pointed it out. Wherever there was a need like food supply, the quality of food, menu, the cleanliness of the Covid centres — bathrooms are overflowing — shortage of ambulances, the shortfalls were discussed. To a great extent, the health secretary has spoken and clarified what steps are being taken,” Malik said, addressing a local TV station. “As far as the tests are concerned, Goa is doing very well, management is fine too. But what happened here is that we became satisfied too early when we shouldn’t have. We relaxed the lockdown, and now, when the cases are rising, we are locking down again. When people were saying that Vasco should have been locked down, we didn’t do it. It has grown a lot and now we are doing it. There was an error of judgement,” Malik said. The governor had called for a meeting with the chief minister, chief secretary, health secretary and other officials due to the rise in number of cases, deaths as well as reports in the media over poor condition of Covid Care centres. The governor’s comments are in sharp contrast to the chief minister’s, who said the governor told them that the realised he was misinformed by media reports. “He was getting wrong information from the media and social media and we have given him the right information. In fact, he told us that what we are doing is very good. Social media, print media and electronic media are showing the wrong picture. That’s what he said. He said that the good side should be shown,” Sawant said. The governor, however, refuted the statement. “It is definitely wrong to say that I have blamed the press. The issue of the press (coverage) didn’t come up (during the meeting). I have definitely not criticised the press. The press is our strength, through which we get feedback and only then can we go forward. The CM has said that I have said this, but I haven’t. He shouldn’t have said that. I definitely didn’t say that,” Malik said.This isn’t the first time there were “perceived differences” between the Goa governor and the chief minister. In May, the governor was forced to clarify as being “in bad taste” news reports which he said “portrays differences and divergences between him and the chief minister in handling the crisis.”Goa has seen a spike in cases of the coronavirus and deaths with nearly 3,000 cases and 19 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-governor-holds-meeting-with-cm-asks-state-govt-to-plug-shortfalls/story-sIYTjwZe5YFRLQi9jbSl1K.html
17-07-2020||India||10 cities account for half of India’s active Covid-19 infections||As India crosses the 1 million mark for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, here is the most important statistic of the disease’s run through the country : at least half the 330,725 active cases in the country as of Wednesday night were reported from just 10 cities, with a third of all such cases in one state , Maharashtra.A district- and state-wise analysis of active coronavirus infections by HT shows that urban centres, or city districts, are significantly more affected by the virus and account for a majority of the active cases; just the 10 cities account of 52.7% of all active cases in the country.Active cases -- those still under treatment -- is a crucial metric because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in any region. It is calculated by subtracting the number of recovered patients and deaths from the total tally. As of Wednesday night, of the 968,405 total Covid-19 cases reported in the country, 330,725 (34.2%) were active, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.To be sure, most states do not release city-specific data, so the analysis has relied on district-wise numbers from states to zero in on the worst-hit cities in the country. Among the 10 districts with the highest number of active cases, eight are city-districts or districts that constitute a single city. Most major metropolitan cities in the country are districts among themselves (with the exception of Delhi, which consists of 11 revenue districts). Raigad (5,192 active cases) and Palghar (4,916 active cases), both in Maharashtra, are the only two districts in the top 10 that are not entirely urban. Three of the five worst-hit cities in terms of the total number of active cases are in Maharashtra (Chart 1), a fact that highlights the overwhelming numbers emerging from the spread of the virus in the western Indian state. Thane has 34,721 active cases – the highest in the country – with Pune at the third spot with 25,510 active cases and Mumbai at the fourth spot with 22,888 active infections. Hyderabad, which has the second highest number of active cases in the country, appears with stand-out numbers with nearly 99% (28,783) of the 29,111 cases reported in the city currently active -- a clear indication of how things have suddenly turned bad for the southern city. Among the top 10 cities based on active cases, Delhi has the lowest proportion of active cases – 15.2% – followed closely by Ahmedabad (at 10th spot) with 15.4% of cases active. Click here for complete coronavirus coverageIn terms of states, Maharashtra continues to have the highest number of active cases with 112,099 active infections (40.7% of the total Covid-19 cases in the state) as of Wednesday. This means one-third of all active cases in the country are in Maharashtra, which is not surprising as it is the state with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths and accounts for 28% of all cases in the country.For perspective on the high active case count in Maharashtra, the state has more active cases than the combined total of such cases in the next four states on the list — Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka and Gujarat.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that taking cognisance of the lack of availability of beds, especially ICU beds in some cities in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) the state has ramped up health infrastructure to deal with this rise in active cases. “With the help of community participation and new interventions like antigen tests involving private doctors, the state will contain the spread in MMR and other parts of the state too.” Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of Mumbai-based KEM hospital and member of the expert committee appointed by the state to recommend steps to curb the spread, said that he expects active cases to come down in a few weeks. “Comparing the total number of cases in the country, Maharashtra’s share has come down drastically; it used to be almost half one point of time. It’s now less than a third of the national total. Even Mumbai’s number of active cases has improved in the last few weeks and we expect it to come down to 15000 in the next couple of weeks,” he said.With 59% of all cases active, Karnataka has the highest proportion of active cases to the total caseload. The state, which on Tuesday replaced Gujarat as the fourth worst-hit state in the country, has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past two weeks. This recent spike in cases in the state is also responsible for the high number of active cases – with two-thirds of its caseload appearing in just the last two weeks, the state’s recoveries are yet to catch up.This trend of states with fast-rising caseloads having a high proportion of active cases is also visible in other states such as Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal (Chart 2) – all of them have a higher proportion of active cases than the national average (34.2%).With inputs from Surendra P Gangan in Mumbai||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-cities-account-for-half-of-india-s-active-infections/story-jA9UvWLUfC2hzBoZkytaaP.html

The report shows that 65 out of 75 countries studied significantly reduced their multidimensional poverty levels between 2000 and 2019.In China, 70 million people left multidimensional poverty between 2010 and 2014, while in Bangladesh, the numbers declined by 19 million between 2014 and 2019.Alkire said: “Covid-19 is having a profound impact on the development landscape. But this data – from before the pandemic – is a message of hope…The MPI – with its information on both the level and composition of poverty – provides the data needed to pinpoint where and how poverty manifests itself”.The report adds that addressing each challenge requires a different approach, many of which need to go beyond improving income, particularly in the light of UNDP’s work encouraging societies to take the opportunity to rethink development pathways and ‘build back better’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-lifted-270-million-people-out-of-poverty-in-2005-15-finds-study/story-1Ck6ZTy92wBHJx6QF4GbJP.html

Eight fire engines, two rescue vans and around 10 ambulances were pressed into service. The rescue operation was going at the time of going to press.Prabhat Rahangdale, chief fire officer of Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB), said, “People are trapped under the debris and some are stranded inside. Five have been rescued and sent to hospital, of whom two are dead.

17-07-2020||India||SC seeks Centre, Kerala replies on plea against ban on animal sacrifice||Hearing a plea challenging the validity of a Kerala law that prohibits animal sacrifice for appeasement of deity in temples, the Supreme Court on Thursday said that there was an apparent contradiction in our laws which allow killing of animals for consumption but prohibit such killing when it comes to offering the meat as sacrifice for deity and then consuming it.Heading the three-judge bench, Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said,“There is a dichotomy in law. Killing animals and consuming is allowed. But killing animals, offering to deity and then consuming is not permissible.” Killing of animals for consumption of their meat is allowed as per the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. However, the law which is under challenge in the present case, the Kerala Animals and Bird Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1968 (Act), prohibits killing of animals for appeasement of deity in temples and temple precincts even though such meat is later consumed by humans.The court issued notice to the Kerala government, central government and Animal Welfare Board in the plea. The case is now likely to be heard on August 10 along with similar cases from Himachal Pradesh and Tripura concerning validity of animal sacrifice in temples.The Kerala Animals and Bird Sacrifices Prohibition Act was challenged on the ground that it violates right to equality guaranteed by Article 14 and the right to practice religion and manage religious affairs under articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution.The petitioners, who are followers of Shakthi worshipping tradition, claimed that appeasing deity through animal sacrifice is an essential religious practice mandated by religious texts and scriptures followed by them and they should, therefore, be permitted to do the same.“In Shakthi worship as per its scriptures and practices popularly known as “pramanas”, animal sacrifice is essential and unavoidable for the propitiation of the deity”, the petition filed through advocate A Karthik stated.The Act was earlier challenged before the Kerala high court, which on June 16 dismissed the plea. The Act imposes ban on sacrifice of animals and birds in temples for propitiation of deity and criminalises the same. Violation of the law attracts jail term of upto 3 months and fine of Rs. 300.The petitioners claimed that the Act violates right to equality because identical practices by other religious communities are not prohibited by the Act.Further, it was also contended that the Act only penalizes killing of animals for propitiation of deity and animal or bird sacrifice for all other purposes including personal consumption within temple precincts is not prohibited.“If the object of the law were to ensure preservation and protection of animals, it would demand its uniform application across all religious communities”, the petition stated.The petitioners also submitted that the law enacted by the central government to prevent cruelty to animals, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960 specifically permits sacrificing animals as ritual in Hindu temples throughout India.“Kerala Animals and Birds Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1968 is repugnant to the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 insofar as the Act operates in the same entry and criminalizes an act which the Union Legislation chooses explicitly not to criminalize”, the plea added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-kerala-replies-on-plea-against-ban-on-animal-sacrifice/story-zjn1yLLJbXrLbDamMrhvYI.html

There is also a conversation that it would take 10 to 15 days to topple the government.Newly appointed Rajasthan Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasara tweeted saying the audio tapes exposed the BJP’s plan to topple a democratically elected government. “The tapes clearly show the role of BJP in the present bid to topple the Congress government,” he said.Also read: Congress ready for a ‘face saver’ for Pilot, he keeps them on the edgeBJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the tapes running on TV channels didn’t seem authentic. “Even they (channels) aren’t verifying the authenticity.

India showed the largest reduction in number of poor, the study shows.Based on an index developed at the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), the data released on Thursday by the United Nations Development Programme and the university’s centre suggests that this progress is at risk due to the coronavirus disease pandemic.OPHI director Sabina Alkire, who led the development of the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) in 2010, said: “India remains the country that has the largest reduction in number of poor, with over 270 million persons leaving poverty 2005-6 to 2015-16.”“However, the report also soberly finds that on average, poverty levels will be set back three to 10 years due to Covid-19, unless action is taken to prevent or swiftly redress the rise of under-nutrition and children leaving school,” Alkire said.“Our hope is that this global MPI report will incite action in solidarity with the poor, so that the immediate crisis is not as deep as feared, and that we ‘build back better’ into a radiant India with permanently less disadvantage and human poverty,” she added.The report shows that 65 out of the 75 countries studied significantly reduced their multidimensional poverty levels between 2000 and 2019.In China, 70 million people left multidimensional poverty between 2010 and 2014, while in Bangladesh, the numbers declined by 19 million between 2014 and 2019.Alkire said: “Covid-19 is having a profound impact on the development landscape.

17-07-2020||India||Sachin Pilot camp moves HC, plea to be heard today||Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and his team of 18 lawmakers on Thursday approached the Rajasthan high court’s Jaipur bench to seek cancellation of the disqualification notice served on them by assembly speaker CP Joshi, insisting that the anti-defection law could not be invoked against them for disagreeing outside the House with some government decisions and policies.The petition will be heard on Friday by a two-member division bench of the high court at 1pm.Pilot’s decision to move the Rajasthan high court is seen by Congress leaders as a signal that he intends to pursue his battle with chief minister Ashok Gehlot, and underlines his growing distance with the party that removed him on Tuesday as the head of its state unit and as deputy CM of Rajasthan after differences came to a head last weekend.The hearing was deferred after Pilot’s camp – represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi -- filed an amended petition in the evening, incorporating additional grounds of challenge to its earlier plea filed before a single-judge bench.Also read: The tale of Rajesh and Sachin Pilot, writes Rajdeep SardesaiIf the Pilot camp is disqualified, it would reduce the strength of the assembly and place Gehlot on a stronger footing in a House with reduced strength until elections are held to fill their seats. The battle in the court is important from the point of view of the numerical strength in the assembly, which will matter in the event of a no-confidence motion against the government.The joint petition was taken up by the high court’s justice Satish Sharma on Thursday afternoon, when Salve sought time to amend the petition to broaden its scope.Justice Sharma resumed the hearing a few hours later at 5pm. The amended plea challenged the Constitutional validity of a key provision in the 10th Schedule of the Constitution: Clause 2(1)(a). This states that a lawmaker will be liable for disqualification on the ground of defection if he voluntarily gives up membership of the political party on whose ticket he was elected.Also read| Sachin Pilot, disqualification and the Tenth Schedule: An explainerThe petition said that clause 2(1)(a) is very wide, since previous judgments have even construed the expression of opinion or views by lawmakers against party leadership as conduct falling within its contours. Therefore, the petition argued, that the clause violates freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.The Congress maintained that the action of the speaker was justified and within the ambit of the provisions. “Everyone needs to follow the party’s whip. The speaker has full rights to send notices to MLAs,” state transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said.Differences between the CM and his former deputy were seen to be simmering for months, and the acrimony became public in the last two days after Pilot was sacked from his party positions. On Wednesday, Gehlot said Pilot was part of a conspiracy to topple the government and that “traits such as looking good and speaking fluent English” did not matter in public life. Pilot, earlier in the day, said Gehlot had humiliated him and kept him out of key decisions. As things stand, the numbers still remain slightly tenuous for Gehlot. He appears to have the support of 101 members — same as the majority mark in the 200-member state assembly (though this does not include speaker CP Joshi). Pilot has 18 other Congress MLAs and three independents in his camp. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. One Congress MLA, Bhanwarlal Meghwal, is indisposed, though he is said to be close to Pilot. Pilot’s primary argument was that his missing two meetings of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) did not amount to defection. According to the Constitution’s 10th Schedule, the anti-defection provisions kick in if a member voluntarily gives up membership of the political party or votes contrary to the party’s direction in the assembly.Pilot also said speaker Joshi may act under the influence of chief minister Gehlot.It is evident that the 10th Schedule of Constitution is sought to be used as a guise to impose the majoritarian view on the members and to stifle their freedom of speech and fair play in democratic setup, the petition stated.Elected representatives who disagree with certain policies or decisions of some members of the party cannot be counted as acting against the interests of the party; a healthy discourse on the pros and cons of policies of a political party cannot be inferred to imply voluntarily giving up membership under the anti-defection law, the petition said. It added that they had never spoken about quitting the Congress or trying to pull down the Gehlot government.The complaint against them was therefore “based on assumptions and surmises” and were without a factual basis to support such concerns, the petitioners argued.It contrasted the speaker’s inaction on a disqualification complaint against Bahujan Samaj Party legislators who crossed over to the Congress with Joshi’s July 14 notice that was issued within hours of a complaint by the Congress chief whip.The petition by 19 lawmakers also said that there would be “dangerous consequences” if an elected member is deprived of membership “merely on the whims and fancies” of party leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-18-mlas-move-hc-against-disqualification/story-nCRGtDnVIGSl739yiVobpM.html
17-07-2020||India||174 Indians challenge US suspension of H-1B visas||Washington President Donald Trump’s temporary suspension through a June 22 proclamation of non-immigrant work visas such as the H-1B, L-1, H-2A and J has been challenged by 174 Indian nationals, including seven minor children, in a federal court in Washington DC.The lawsuit filed by Wasden Banias, a law firm, has asked the court to direct the state department to decide on the plaintiffs’ H-1B and H-4 (for H-1B dependents) applications, direct the department of homeland security to not refuse entry to the plaintiffs, and strike down the restrictions. On June 22, President Trump issued a proclamation suspending most non-immigrant work visas, including the H-1Bs till December 21 ostensibly to ensure Americans have the first shot at jobs that become available as the economy emerged from Covid-19-related lockdowns and layoffs.Indians hired by US firms and US-branches of Indian firms are the largest recipient of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 issued annually. There are fears that the temporary suspension could lead to more lasting changes and restrictions, based on reported plans of the administration. The president is said to be working on an executive order overhauling legal immigration system, to move it towards merit-based from family-based.The June 22 proclamation does not impact H-1B visa holders already in the United States, but those with approved petitions and those applying afresh. The lawsuit cited the cases of a family, which was on H-1B visa with a pending clearance for immigrant visa. They traveled to India recently and wanted to renew their H-1B or H-4 visas but there had been no progress on their applications. More than 70% of the 85,000 H1-B visas issued annually go to Indians.HT has reported how the restrictions has separated families -- with mothers and fathers stuck in India, separated from their children. Many of the H1B visa holders have built lives in the US; in many cases, their children were born in that country and are US citizens. The June 22 proclamation also extended the suspension of immigration, and the issuance of Green Cards.The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday. The same day, several lawmakers wrote to the labor secretary Eugene Scalia to end the H-1B restriction. “Throughout this administration, the president has continued to lament the alleged abuses of the immigration system while failing to address the systemic problems that have persisted and allowed businesses and employers to exploit and underpay immigrant workers, guest workers and American workers,” the lawmakers wrote as reported by PTI.“This misguided attempt by the president to scapegoat immigrants for policy failures during the pandemic not only serves to hurt immigrants, but dismisses the true problem of a broken work visa program that is in desperate need of reform,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/174-indians-challenge-us-suspension-of-h-1b-visas/story-HqntqTjcZvOawO53Vjg9rM.html
17-07-2020||India||Kerala CM’s former principal secretary suspended||Thiruvananthapuram:The Kerala government on Thursday suspended chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer, for violating service rules. Making the announcement, the CM said the action was taken on the basis of an inquiry report that pointed to lapses on Sivasankar’s part. “Inquiry report pointed out that there are some lapses on his part and he violated all-India service rules,” said the CM.The inquiry was conducted by a two-member panel headed by chief secretary Viswas Mehta. Sivasankar was removed from the post of the CM’s principal secretary last week after allegations that he was close to Swapna Suresh, one of the key accused in the gold smuggling case. He was questioned by the customs department for several hours on Wednesday. However, officials found some discrepancies in his statement and he has been called in for questioning again, people familiar with the matter said. He is likely to be arrested soon, the people said. The customs department seized 30 kg gold from a consignment which came in the name of an official of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on June 5. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken over the case and several other central agencies are also probing the case.Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs has cancelled the passport of Faisal Fareed, the third accused in the case, who is reported to be in the UAE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-s-former-principal-secretary-suspended/story-MA87Zz4UII1qj7kmGRHTiP.html
17-07-2020||India||25 Cong MLAs appointed to various posts by C’garh govt||Raipur: The Chhattisgarh government has appointed 25 Congress legislators as parliamentary secretaries and to various posts in statutory bodies, boards, and commissions in the last three days, sparking criticism from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that linked the appointments to infighting within the ruling party and the ongoing turmoil in Rajasthan.On Tuesday, the Congress appointed 15 MLAs as parliamentary secretaries to assist 12 cabinet ministers. On Wednesday, six more lawmakers were named as chairmen and vice-chairmen of two development authorities. And, on Thursday, four legislators were appointed to state boards and commissions. With this, 38 of the Congress’s 69 legislators in the 90-member assembly now hold ministerial berths or other government posts. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has a 12-member cabinet. BJP leader Brijmohan Agrawal said the government hurriedly made the appointments as it fears a political crisis like the one in Rajasthan, where former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and MLAs close to him rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot. “There is a huge discontentment among Congress legislators. The ruling party decided in a hurry to appoint them as parliamentary secretaries. This is a fallout of what happened in Madhya Pradesh and might happen in Rajasthan. The Congress is afraid...” Agrawal said.The Congress returned to power in 2018 after 15 years of BJP rule. Congress leader RP Singh dismissed Agrawal’s comments, saying the BJP has only 14 members in the state assembly and the party needed to understand where it stood. He said the list of these appointments was prepared before the Rajasthan crisis. “It is a coincidence that it has been announced now.”Another BJP leader, Ajay Chandrakar, said a growing rift between Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh is well known. Shailesh Nitin Trivedi, Congress’s communications head, said Chandrakar and Agarwal’s are two major factions in the BJP since 2000. “Now, they are talking about rift and infighting. They need to first get their house in order.”Political commentator Parivesh Mishra said using posts in government-owned corporations and bodies to placate the disgruntled people has been a practice common across party lines in various states. “In Chhattisgarh, the appointments were long due. The timing coincided with political events in Rajasthan...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-cong-mlas-appointed-to-various-posts-by-c-garh-govt/story-reeyVuiykDnKBirZodgfVI.html
17-07-2020||India||In gold smuggling case report to NIA, Kerala cops point to ‘terror angle’||The Kerala police have sent a report to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and asked it to investigate the “terror angle” in all major gold smuggling cases in the state, two officials aware of the matter said. The Kerala police suspect that some smugglers and hawala operators have terror links, one of the two officials told HT. Hawala transactions worth over Rs 1,000 crore annually on an average, have been taking place in the state, he added.The request comes as the NIA took charge of the probe of the seizure of 30 kg of 24-carat gold from Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5. An attempt was made to smuggle the gold through diplomatic baggage, which according to the Vienna Convention, is not checked by Customs officials. “Since NIA is investigating the Thiruvananthapuram gold smuggling case under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), it might want to look at other cases and their link,” a Kerala police officer told HT over the phone, requesting anonymity. “We have given a report to the Centre and NIA on our cases. More reports are being prepared on similar activities.”On July 10, the NIA filed a First Information Report (FIR) against four persons: P Sarith Kumar, who was arrested by Customs officials on July 5, and three others, Swapna Suresh, Sandip Nair and Fazil Fareed, an alleged smuggler from Ernakulum but based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and charged them under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). On July 15, it added one more name to the FIR, an alleged gold smuggler named KT Ramees.A team arrested Suresh and Nair who have been sent to judicial custody till July 21. They are currently being interrogated by the investigation agency. The NIA has also approached Interpol for a blue notice against Fareed. A blue notice is issued for additional information about a person’s identity, location, or activities in relation to a crime. The agency found that Fareed forged the UAE seal and emblem to ensure diplomatic protection for the baggage.On Wednesday, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar was grilled in connection with the smuggling case.NIA last week said gold smuggling into India from offshore locations threatens the country’s economic stability, national security and amounts to terrorism as per UAPA’s Section 15. In a statement, it added the fresh smuggling case has national and international linkages. NIA cited its initial probe and added it has revealed that the proceeds of smuggled gold could be used for financing terrorism in India.Apart from NIA and Customs, Research and Analysis Wing and Intelligence Bureau are also coordinating with the agencies to unearth the gold smuggling and hawala networks in Kerala, a second official said in Delhi.The Customs department has arrested 12 people in relation to gold smuggling and detained four since this case came to light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-report-to-nia-kerala-cops-point-to-terror-angle/story-Dm4SyQzWBiZtlt9o7MwDyH.html
17-07-2020||India||Panel formed to review J&K internet curbs: Govt tells Supreme Court||The Central government told the Supreme Court that it did, as ordered to by the court on May 11, set up a committee to review curbs on 4G internet connections in Jammu & Kashmir, but not taken a decision yet because of a high number of terrorist attacks. The committee is headed by home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, it added. This is the first time the government has shared information about the committee -- and it came in the course of a contempt petition by the Forum for Media Professionals that the court’s May 11 order on forming such a panel wasn’t complied with. Attorney general KK Vengugopal also said that the committee met twice, on May 16 and June 10, and spoke of “20-page minutes” of the meetings. He said he was even willing to place the minutes of the two meetings in a sealed cover before the Court.He added that the committee sought details from the J&K administration on what steps could be taken to ensure that right to life, right to education, right to business and right to free speech and expression of J&K citizens is not hampered, and that it decided to meet after two months. In the midst of the pandemic, residents in the union territory continue to live without high-speed mobile internet, affecting education, work, and life. A lot of activities have moved online in the wake of the coronavirus disease. High-speed internet and all mobile services were suspended on August 5 last year when the government abrogated Article 370 that gave the state special status. While mobile telephone services have been restored, 4G mobile internet has not been. Responding to Venugopal, the bench of justices NV Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and BR Gavai asked the Centre to explain whether a decision had been taken on its May 11 direction mandating a periodic review of orders suspending telecom services in Jammu and Kashmir, and why the decision wasn’t in the public domain.  “Nothing is in public domain yet. What is the problem in informing public that there is a Committee and they are looking into this issue?”Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, who argued the contempt petition, pointed to an alleged fallacy in the attorney general’s submission that terrorist attacks in J&K had increased. He produced a statement made by home minister Amit Shah that the number of terrorist incidents reported in J&K have been the lowest since the scrapping of Article 370 in August last year.Ahmadi said the contempt was clearly made out as the direction of the Court mandated the special committee to review the suspension of telecom services every week, consider alternatives suggested by the petitioners, and place its decisions in the public domain. “At a time when the entire nation has easy access to internet, people in J&K are being denied this access. They can’t attend online classes, connect through internet or attend Court hearings through videoconferencing. This itself is violation of their Article 14 right,” Ahmadi said, referring to the pat of the Constitution that promises all Indians equality before the law. The court asked Venugopal to submit a response in one week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-formed-to-review-j-k-internet-curbs-govt-tells-sc/story-r0XBXBUyd4Hvtzmhrz4qnJ.html
17-07-2020||India||Saga of an audacious gold smuggling bid in Kerala||On July 3, P. Sarith Kumar walked into the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport to collect a rather heavy carton addressed to an official working at the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consular office in the city. The bespectacled 39-year-old Kumar claimed to be a Public Relations Officer with the consulate who had come to collect the carton for an attaché. Two days later, he was arrested by Customs officials for attempting to smuggle gold into the country. After receiving the nod from the ministry of external affairs, officers of the Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate opened the 70-kilogram carton in the presence of the acting in-charge of the UAE consulate. The sight that greeted their eyes may not have been what they expected: the carton had an assortment of pipes, taps, and door handles amidst food items and other electronics, according to news website The Lede. The pipes, however, weren’t hollow. At least 30 kilograms of 24-carat gold — the best quality — estimated to be worth at least Rs 15 crore, were hidden inside them. Since January, seven air cargo consignments, some heavier than 30 kg, had reportedly arrived in the state. Preliminary investigations by the Customs officials found that P. Sarith, who had worked for the UAE consulate but wasn’t currently employed with them as he claimed, had received multiple such consignments. Officials suspect that at least 300 kg of smuggled gold flooded the yellow metal market already. Last week, Kerala chief minister Pinnarayi Vijayan wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting a probe by central agencies. “Every link of this crime should be unravelled,” he wrote. “The case has serious implications as this undermines the economy of the Nation. In fact, it has more than one angle warranting a thorough investigation,” he wrote on July 8. On July 10, the National Investigation Authority (NIA), which usually tackles terror-related cases, took up its first gold-smuggling related case. It filed a First Information Report against four: Kumar, who was already under arrest, and three others — Swapna Suresh, Sandip Nair and Fazil Fareed, an alleged smuggler from Ernakulum but based in the UAE — whose names were revealed during interrogation. On July 15, it added one more name to the FIR: an alleged gold smuggler named KT Ramees.The NIA charged all of them under Sections 16, 17, and 18 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), which is usually invoked to deal with terrorists and those who pose a threat to the integrity of the nation. The suspected offence: Conspiracy and commission of terrorist act by raising funds through gold smuggling to threaten the economic security and monetary stability of India. On Wednesday, the NIA moved the Interpol to extradite Fareed from the UAE, as a Kochi court issued an arrest warrant against him.A multi-agency probe monitored by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is underway which includes the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), the Intelligence Bureau (IB), and Enforcement Directorate (ED) besides the NIA and Customs (Preventive) Division.Suspects tracked downOn Saturday, the NIA arrested Suresh and Nair from a hotel in Bengaluru, and brought them to Cochin on July 12. The two have been remanded to NIA custody by a special court till July 21.Suresh worked at the UAE consulate general’s office before she joined as an operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT Ministry in 2017. It was likely at the consular office that Suresh and Kumar came to know each other, and even after they stopped working at the consulate, they remained in touch with each other.Suresh, in her early forties, claims to hold a Bachelors in Commerce degree from Maharashtra’s Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University. However, the university clarified that it didn’t offer such a course. The controller of examinations at the varsity, Dr. Vivek S Sathe, said her degree was fake. Her estranged brother Bright Suresh, based in the United States, told local television channels that she had not passed her matriculation.However, Suresh is known to be fluent in Arabic, English, Hindi, and Malayalam. She also played a key role in many programmes such as the Loka Kerala Sabha in 2020, a global meeting of non-resident expatriates from the state.Kerala assembly speaker S Sivaramakrishnan told media channels that he had inaugurated an automobile workshop owned Sandip Nair — whom he did not know — three months ago, at Suresh’s request. “I never knew about her past and I thought she is a high-ranking official,” the speaker said.Soon after she was named in this case, Suresh went underground.Last week, she applied for bail at Kerala High Court— her case was to come up on July 15. She also circulated an audio tape to a news channel in which she claimed that there was a concerted move to target the Kerala government ahead of the assembly elections next year and she had been made a scapegoat. She also claimed that she made a call to the Customs on July 3 to release the consignment because she was asked by the UAE consular office to do. She said she feared for her life.Since Suresh was arrested, the anticipatory bail hearing now stands infructuous.A political stormThe seizure of gold smuggled through the cover of a diplomatic channel has set off a political storm in Kerala as opposition party members have demanded chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s resignation, claiming that he had knowledge of the wrong-doing. Soon after she was named, customs officials raided Suresh’s house. During their investigation it was revealed that the chief minister’s principal secretary M Sivasankar was a frequent visitor to her house. In a series of swift political moves, Sivasankar was removed from his post on July 7, the chief minister denied the involvement of his office in Suresh’s appointment in the IT ministry body, Suresh was sacked from her job, and on July 8, Vijayan wrote the letter to the PM seeking a probe by central agencies.However, the Opposition wasn’t willing to let go and members protested, calling for his resignation. “Almost a week passed since the case came up. Not a single FIR was filed against Swapna Suresh though many cheating incidents against her surfaced including fake certificate. We suspect she is getting protection from higher-ups,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on July 11.Though the CM welcomed the NIA probe — he said that such a probe would worry many people — the party is wary because it fears that his office may also come under the ambit of inquiry. “Nobody can browbeat an elected government. The union government announced the probe as sought by the CM. Let them investigate but we will not allow any victimization in this regard,” said Anathalavattom Anandan, senior leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).The Customs department questioned M Sivasankar at their office in Thiruvananthpuram for nine hours, till the wee hours of July 15. A day later he was suspended. “It is a big setback to the CM who is trying for a second term riding on the so-called Covid success story,” said political observer Sunnykutty Abraham.Meanwhile, the MEA has also had to ensure that diplomatic relations between the two countries are not affected because of this case. The Gulf is home to millions of Indian expatriates with a range of work profiles; at least 1.8 million belong to Kerala. The UAE has ordered a probe into this matter and said that it will assist the ongoing probe by Indian agencies, in a brief statement. Last week, the MEA minister of state V Muraleedharan also clarified that the baggage was not in the diplomatic baggage category and the Customs department had only sought the ministry’s nod to open the package due to the rules stipulated under the Vienna Convention, a framework on diplomatic relations between countries.Meanwhile, the MEA has also made a request to the UAE embassy in Delhi to meet a few employees at the consular office in Thiruvananthapuram for more details. The acting in-charge of the UAE consulate, who present during the opening of the consignment on July 5, left the country this week.Yellow metal marketIt started with innocuous looking packets of cookies, noodles and dates sent from the United Arab Emirates to its consular office in Thiruvananthapuram, which raised the suspicions of customs deputy commissioner Rama Murthy.Since January, seven such consignments flew in including door knobs, water taps and even shower caps. The trouble was that the packages which came as air cargo addressed to the consulate, enjoyed diplomatic immunity. In Kerala, the trade of illegal gold is a thriving business as it is cheaper in the Gulf. What’s more with an import duty of 12 % and an additional GST of 3 %, smuggled gold often costs Rs 8-10 lakh per kilogram lesser than legally imported gold.“The state tops in the country in terms of gold seizure. During the last financial year, 550 kg gold was seized from four airports of the state. At least half of this quantity is from Kozhikode international airport,” Sumit Kumar, Customs commissioner in-charge of Kerala and Lakshadweep region, said.Dates, bra straps, belt buckles, shoe soles, and sausages are few the ingenious methods used to smuggle gold into the country.“It is a fact, that a good quantity of smuggled gold is present in the market. We have to change our flawed import policy to check this. Tax evasion is also high in the industry, which gives employment to 60 lakh people directly and indirectly,” says Malabar Group Chairman M P Ahmed, who runs one of the largest jewellery store chains in the country.According to DRI officials, who spoke anonymously to HT, the union government was waiting for an opportunity to intervene, as they suspected that much of the smuggled gold also funded terror activities and hawala operations.“Custom and DRI have limitations in a foreign land. NIA can intervene here effectively and dig into the plush network. Invoking terror sections will really help to unearth the well-entrenched syndicate,” said the senior DRI official in Kochi.But this case has also given other agencies a filip to get tough on smuggling. Customs commissioner in-charge of Kerala and Lakshadweep Sumit Kumar, on Wednesday, issued an ultimatum to smugglers to surrender. At least six persons in connection with gold smuggling have been arrested.“We have a list of regular offenders and we are out to break their syndicate. The multi-agency probe is going as planned,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saga-of-an-audacious-gold-smuggling-bid/story-NNHIsiPOwMk8GTTylNq7mN.html
17-07-2020||India||Attack on Dalit couple: 6 police personnel suspended in Madhya Pradesh||Six police personnel, including a sub-inspector, were suspended on Thursday for beating up a Dalit couple for resisting an anti-encroachment drive in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna district on Tuesday. The couple also consumed pesticides in protest and are in hospital, where the district administration said they are out of danger. The incident provoked outrage after a video went viral. “An ugly situation was created due to Rajkumar Ahirwar and his wife [Savitri] consuming pesticide during anti-encroachment drive initiated by the revenue department on July 14. Sub-inspector Ashok Singh Kushwah was sent to maintain law and order. However, a video went viral regarding the use of force by the police team. Hence, the police personnel who were present on the spot are being suspended given their suspected role in the use of force,” Guna police superintendent Tarun Nayak said in an order, a copy of which has been seen by HT. Apart from Kushwah, the others suspended were Rajendra Sharma, Pawan Yadav, Narendra Rawat, Neetu Yadav, and Rani Raghuvanshi, , all constables at the Cantonment police station, Guna.The police personnel also assaulted Ahirwar’s brother, Shishupal. Ahirwar’s mother, Geeta Bai, said they repeatedly requested the police team to let them stay until they harvested their crop. She said police did not listen to them, abused, and beat them.The district administration says the four-acre land was earmarked for a government college and the state government released Rs 12 crore to begin the building’s construction a year ago. But a local strongman, Babbu Pardi, encroached upon the land and rented it out to the Ahirwars for farming illegally. The Ahirwars say they took a loan of R3 lakh and paid Pardi to grow crops on the land. The state government on Wednesday announced a high-level inquiry into the incident and transferred Guna collector S Vishwanathan, Nayak, and inspector general (Gwalior zone) Raja Babu Singh. Vishwanathan had earlier defended the police action, saying the local residents resisted the police’s anti-encroachment drive. Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia tweeted: “The Guna SP and Collector have been removed, and inquiry has been sought into the incident. I am confident that action will be taken against all those who are responsible for this heinous act.” In a tweet on Wednesday, Scindia said: “Guna incident is unfortunate. I had a discussion with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and requested him to take action against insensitive and irresponsible officials. Taking a serious note of the incident the CM has ordered shifting of Guna collector and SP.”The opposition Congress attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government as the video of the assault went viral on social media on Wednesday. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi posted the video on Twitter and said: “Our fight is against this ideology and injustice.”The Congress said a party delegation will visit Guna on Friday and submit a report on the incident to state party chief Kamal Nath. The delegation will gather facts about the incident, said Congress leader Chandraprabhash Shekhar. He added the delegation will include former minister Bala Bachchan.Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati condemned the incident and demanded immediate action against the guilty. “Forcing a Dalit couple to attempt suicide by destroying their crops is extremely cruel and extremely shameful. The state government must take strict action against the guilty.”State home minister Narottam Mishra said the law and order situation is fine in the state. “We immediately removed the IG, SP, and collector when we came to know about the incident. A high-level inquiry is going on. The state government will also provide all possible help to the family.”(With input from Yogendra Lumba in Guna)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attack-on-dalit-couple-6-police-personnel-suspended-in-mp/story-trCBtIqT1wsdqsIAE67CNK.html
17-07-2020||India||Extreme rainfall from July 19 may trigger more floods in NE : IMD||Northeastern states, including flood-hit areas like Assam, are likely to receive extremely heavy rains from Sunday that will trigger further flooding in the region, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday. Widespread and heavy rain is also expected in the northwestern plains, including Delhi, from Friday to Monday, it added. Delhi has received 52% less rainfall this season while northwestern India has a 16% rain deficiency.National Weather Forecasting Centre senior scientist R K Jenamani said the monsoon trough, which had moved to the foothills around July 8, moved back to its normal position around July 14. Jenamani added it is likely to move northwards again. “The western end of the monsoon trough will move to northwest India, where it will bring heavy and widespread rains while the eastern end will move to the Himalayan foothills bringing extremely heavy rainfall to the eastern and northeastern states. These states should be prepared.”IMD director general M Mohapatra said extremely heavy rains can trigger flooding once again in these regions.The death toll from floods in Assam rose to 66 on Wednesday as six more people drowned. The deluge has affected over 3.5 million people and submerged around 90% of the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve.The Central Water Commission on Wednesday said 52 stations in Bihar, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Arunachal Pradesh have reported severe flood and above normal flood situation. Severe flood is declared when water levels touch or exceed the danger level but are below the highest level.Parts of Maharashtra and Konkan have been receiving very heavy rain since Tuesday with some places recording over 20 cm rain over two days.Tillari Dam in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur district has filled up to 80% of its full capacity. Since heavy rain has been predicted in its catchment, water releases from the dam as per standard operating procedure should be made, the commission said. There is also a possibility of urban flooding in Mumbai, according to Central Water Commission CWC) . Sudden rise in water levels was expected amid very heavy rains and high waves in the range of 3.5-3.7 metres until Friday along the Maharashtra coast from Malvan to Vasai and cause flooding, according to CWC. Nine states have recorded excess rains—20 to 59% above normal--until Thursday. As many as two have received large excess—over 60% above normal. Eighteen states are in the normal category— (-19% to 19%) and seven in deficient (-59% to -20%). One state is in the large deficient category (-99% to -60%).The country has overall received 10% excess rains during the ongoing monsoon season till Thursday. The monsoon is key to India’s farm output as around 55% of the country’s arable land is rain-fed. Moderate to severe thunderstorms and lightning were also very likely over places like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh on Friday. HT on July 5 reported that at least 315 people have been killed due to lightning strikes this year since May 15 mainly in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Lightning incidence has increased by 20% over the last 20 years, according to an analysis of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) based on satellite data from 1995 to 2015. “It is in part due to climate change, which has led to high moisture availability because of the higher ocean surface temperatures,” said S D Pawar, an IITM scientist, who specialises in atmospheric electricity..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extreme-rainfall-from-july-19-may-trigger-more-floods-in-ne-imd/story-NJvUpingyN5oDcqTscBJ5I.html
17-07-2020||India||Air India seeks to cut costs ahead of privatisation||Air India is seeking to reduce costs and lower its dependence on the government by cutting debt and aircraft leases/rentals and trimming staff and operational expenditure, chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal said on Thursday.The cost-cutting drive dovetails with a government plan to sell its entire stake in Air India amid increasing debt and mounting losses. The Centre, in January, started the process by releasing an information document for investors and offering access to financial and other data of Air India and its subsidiaries. The government’s entire stake in Air India, its 100% stake in low-cost subsidiary Air India Express Ltd. and 50% stake in ground handling unit Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited. are on offer.“We are trying to increase the topline, and are trying to contain costs. We are looking at measures of containing cost by reducing debt, reducing staffing cost, operating cost and aircraft rentals,” Bansal said at a press conference with aviation minister Hardeep Puri. “We have cut down staff cost, we have laid off employees working with us post-retirement and we are in negotiations with pilots, cabin crew and other employee categories.”An attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw any bids. The airline’s accumulated debt is estimated to be more than Rs 69,000 crore. It posted a loss of Rs 8,556 crore in financial year 2018-19, as against a net loss of Rs 5,348 crore in the previous financial year.To Bansal’s comment that Air India wanted to reduce its dependence on the government, Puri said the government may not be in a position to extend financial backing to the national airline “due to the current situation.”“We don’t have a choice, we will have to be persistent with the privatisation effort,” the minister said.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic that has taken a heavy toll on the aviation industry, the government in June extended the deadline for submissions of bids for Air India to August 31, the third extension since the process began in January. Indian airlines will face a revenue loss of Rs 1.3 trillion between fiscal 2020 and 2022 because of the pandemic, according to rating agency Crisil.Earlier this week, the national airline’s board of directors approved a leave without pay (LWP) scheme for permanent staff ranging from six months to two years, extendable to five years. Air India has 9,426 employees on its rolls, out of which 4,200 are on contractual terms, according to the civil aviation ministry.On Thursday, the Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association (ICPA), the pilots’ union of Air India ,wrote to Bansal, alleging that a proposed pay cut for pilots amounted to almost 60% of gross emoluments, adding that pilots had not been paid 70% of their salaries since April.“We have expressed our willingness to negotiate a pay cut in line with the current market conditions. We were told by the ministry officials that we are being compared to one of the leading low cost private carriers, it was then explained to the MoCA {ministry of civil aviation} officials how the worst conditions of these private airlines were being cherry-picked to our disadvantage.,” ICPA said in the letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times.“The proposed cut for pilots is almost 60% of gross emoluments. It is hilarious to note that the top management has proposed a meagre 3.5% cut on its own gross salary. For eg; the Director, Personnel takes a minuscule cut of 4% on gross pay while a co-pilot who is paid less than the market is given a cut of 60%. How is this justified? Doesn’t this amount to unchecked greed and selfishness,” the letter added.When contacted by HT, a spokesperson for Air India said: these were internal issues on which the airline wouldn’t like to make any comment.“The entire civil aviation industry world over is doing cost cutting. We have to face the reality,” Puri said at the press conference.The global aviation industry has suffered heavy losses because of lockdowns imposed by several countries to curb the spread of the coronovirus disease. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines in the Asia-Pacific region will be the hardest hit by the Covid-19 crisis, with losses expected to be around $29 billion for 2020. This is more than a third of the $84.3 billion industry losses globally. In India alone, IATA expects passenger demand in 2020 to shrink by 49% compared to last year. Potential jobs impact in aviation and sectors dependent on aviation will be felt by more than 3 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-seeks-to-cut-costs-ahead-of-privatisation/story-BRUPvOHNoV3qP8X7v12oOP.html
17-07-2020||India||Neowise comet sighting likely this week||As anyone who watched the first season of Game of Thrones knows, a comet means different things to different people. In the case of Neowise, which makes its way across Indian skies this week, the sightings are eagerly anticipated. Even tempered with clouds of potential disappointment, they’re drawing amateur astronomy buffs, students, professors and philosophical stargazers to terraces across the country, for a glimpse of a celestial body that last passed by Earth 6,800 years ago.Incidentally, Neowise is visible to the naked eye around sunset; the best dates for viewings are July 22 and 23 (next Wednesday and Thursday), at which point it will be just 200 times as far from us as the moon is.In Chennai, branding and marketing professional and avid birdwatcher AM Aravind hopes this will be the celestial sighting to beat the Ikeya Seki, the Great Comet of 1965, which his father remembers seeing and still brags about. “It was one of the best comet sightings of the last century,” Aravind says. “People tend not to realise how rare it is to be able to see one, particularly with the naked eye.”Aravind, 38, has been tracking celestial events since the Hale-Bopp comet visited in 1995. He tracked the transit of Venus in 2012, the transit of Mercury in 2016 and has witnessed several eclipses.This time, it’s different. In the lockdown, he can’t head to a hill station or the beach at dawn or dusk for a better view. Light pollution in residential areas, now that everyone’s home, makes it harder to observe the night sky. “I did try to see it in the morning a few days ago but it was too close to the sun and it was too bright to see anything,” he says.For Jayshree Kumar, 22, Indore resident and history student on a break before her MA, it’s not about whether we see Comet Neowise, but how it sees us. “Six thousand years ago, when the comet last visited, humans were inventing the written word,” she says. “Now I’m texting my friends on WhatsApp because we can’t get together to watch it on someone’s terrace.”She’s never seen a comet before, but remembers checking out the Super Blood Moon in 2019. “We’re hoping the skies are clear this week. We’re tracking Neowise online via TheSkyLive, which is another way life on Earth has changed,” she says.Varun Bhalerao, 36, has peered further into space than most. The assistant professor with IIT Bombay’s physics department was a principal investigator on India’s first robotic telescope, set up just outside Leh in 2018.“But it’s been forever since I saw a comet,” he admits. “We almost never look through a telescope in our line of work. There’s always a camera or some recording software. I miss looking at the stars the way Sachin Tendulkar might miss playing galli cricket.”Sky gazing, he says, is a level playing field and he remains cautiously optimistic about spotting Neowise in Mumbai’s cloud-laden skies. “A 10-minute window is all you need to sight it, and in any case, we need the rains more than we need comets.”Kumar, in Indore, has a different view in more ways than one. “At a time when the world has lost control over so much,” she says, “Neowise is a reminder that somewhere out there, some things are moving according to plan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neowise-comet-sighting-likely-this-week/story-JpkU6R0QbwbMQ8dVgLqQ0K.html
17-07-2020||India||Pending issues holding up participation in Chabahar-Zahedan rail project: India||New Delhi India on Thursday said technical and financial issues yet to be finalised by Iran were holding up New Delhi’s participation in the Chabahar-Zahedan railway project, a key component of the trade and transit hub centred round the Iranian port. Reacting to media reports suggesting that Iran had dropped India from the railway project that will link Chabahar port to Zahedan, along the border with Afghanistan, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said New Delhi was waiting for Tehran to “nominate an authorised entity to finalise outstanding technical and financial issues”. He didn’t give any more details. India sees the port in the Gulf of Oman as key to its strategic plans to access both Afghanistan and Central Asian states. Though the US issued a waiver in 2018 sparing Chabahar from sanctions imposed on Iran, Indian entities and foreign financial institutions have been reluctant to back either the port or the railway project.The leadership of India, Afghanistan and Iran signed a tripartite agreement on the development of the port during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Tehran in May 2016. At the same time, India’s Ircon and Iran’s Construction and Development of Transportation Infrastructure Company (CDTIC) signed a MoU for building and financing the Chabahar-Zahedan railway link at an estimated cost of $1.6 billion.Srivastava said Ircon was tasked by the Indian government to assess the feasibility of the project, and had completed site inspection and review of a feasibility report. “Detailed discussions were thereafter held on other relevant aspects of the project, which had to take into account the financial challenges that Iran was facing.” These issues were also reviewed at the India-Iran Joint Commission meeting in Tehran last December.An Iranian official, who declined to be named, said Tehran had decided to construct the railway project with Iranian funding and engineering capacities “in the absence of an active Indian engagement and partnership”.Chabahar port and the railway link to Zahedan are part of the International North-South Transit Corridor and it was expected India could play a “more crucial role in funding and constructing this strategic transit route from Chabahar to Zahedan and from Zahedan to Sarakhs at the border with Turkmenistan”, the Iranian official said.Srivastava said Chabahar port has made significant progress “despite the difficulties posed by the sanctions situation”. An Indian company, which has operated the port since 2018, has scaled up traffic. “Since December 2018, 82 vessels have been handled there, including 52 in the last 12 months alone. The port handled 1.2 million tonnes of bulk cargo and 8,200 containers,” he said.“Proactive measures are currently underway to increase the usage of Chabahar port, both for Afghanistan and Central Asia,” he added.Srivastava also clarified that Iran informed India in January that Tehran would develop the Farzad-B gas field on its own and would involve New Delhi “appropriately at a later stage”. He added, “This matter remains under discussion.”India’s ONGC has been involved in negotiations in the discovery stage of Farzad-B gas field. “Follow-up bilateral cooperation was, however, impacted by policy changes on the Iranian side,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pending-issues-holding-up-participation-in-chabahar-zahedan-rail-project-india/story-N5jw6NiSwe0Ssnxd7PAcdP.html
17-07-2020||India||Total disengagement on LAC a complex process: Army||India on Thursday said the complex disengagement process with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is specifically aimed at preventing “face-off situations”, and any unilateral attempts to change the status quo on the disputed border will not be accepted.Two days after corps commanders from both sides met at Chushul to discuss the road map for easing tensions on the LAC, the Indian Army, too, said complete disengagement is an “intricate process” requiring “constant verification”.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the statements from the external affairs ministry and the army pointed to difficulties and suspicions involved in the disengagement process, and the need to draw a distinction between disengagement and New Delhi’s stated aim of restoring status quo ante on the LAC.Officials and experts indicated the army is preparing for the long haul as de-escalation isn’t likely in the short term. Rebuilding trust after the brutal skirmish at Galwan Valley on June 15, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, will not be easy and will take time, said an official who declined to be named. More engagements at military and diplomatic levels will be needed to make headway, said a second official.During a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava described the disengagement process in Ladakh sector as complex and said it was “specifically aimed at addressing face-off situations and close-up deployments of troops along the LAC”. Also read| Apex China Study Group reviews East Ladakh: Key stand-off points record withdrawalBased on an understanding between the corps commanders, both sides “have agreed at specific points to redeploy towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC”, Srivastava said.“These are mutually agreed reciprocal actions to be taken by both sides,” he said, adding the “mutual redeployment should not be misrepresented”.“There is absolutely no change with respect to India’s position on the LAC. We are fully committed to observing and respecting the LAC. Any unilateral attempts to change the status quo along the LAC are not acceptable,” he added.Indian Army spokesperson Col Aman Anand said the corps commanders reviewed progress in the first phase of disengagement and “discussed further steps to ensure complete disengagement”.Anand added: “The two sides remain committed to the objective of complete disengagement. This process is intricate and requires constant verification. They are taking it forward through regular meetings at diplomatic and military level.”India’s high-powered China Study Group (CSG) on Wednesday reviewed the latest developments in eastern Ladakh, with the focus on the next stage of disengagement following the 14-hour meeting between the corps commanders during July 14-15.The disengagement involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours.Following the July 5 phone conversation between the Special Representatives on the boundary issue – India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and China’s state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi – both sides held further meetings at the military and diplomatic level.The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on the border met virtually on July 10 while the senior military commanders held their fourth meeting at Chushul during July 14-15, and the two sides agreed on complete disengagement of troops and de-escalation in border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquillity in line with bilateral agreements and protocols.The focus of the current military talks is to hammer out a consensus on easing tensions between the two armies in Finger Area and Depsang plains, as well as pulling back weapons and equipment from friction points in other sectors.A fifth meeting between delegations led by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, commander of Leh-based 14 Corps, and Maj Gen Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, is expected to be held in two weeks to take things forward, said one of the officials cited above.As disengagement is discussed at the highest echelons of the government, defence minister Rajnath Singh will visit Ladakh on July 17 for a security review. Singh will fly to Srinagar on Friday afternoon and is expected to travel to forward areas in Jammu and Kashmir on July 18.Indian Army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane will accompany Singh. In Leh and Srinagar, Singh will be briefed on security matters by commanders of 14 and 15 Corps, respectively. He will visit Ladakh two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled trip to the sector on July 3. Modi had then declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “Nobody is claiming that India is sitting on the Chinese side. The Indian side is the one with a grievance and the Chinese are sitting on our side of the LAC, as perceived by us.We should recognise this process is going to take longer and India needs to acquire some leverage. But at the same time, pressure on China from players such as the US and the UK is growing and the outcomes of the India-EU Summit were significant. These developments are cause for optimism and India should derive some comfort from them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/total-disengagement-a-complex-process-army/story-bQHQ9i54TXY6SkpcsiDFNL.html
17-07-2020||India||Central Vista redevelopment will not harm landmarks: DDA||The redevelopment of the Central Vista area in the National Capital will not harm any heritage buildings in the area and historical landmarks like the Rashtrapati Bhawan, the North and South Blocks, the Parliament house and the National Archives will be conserved, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has told the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear the matter on Friday.The Central Vista is being redeveloped after taking into account the present needs of the city and will be carried out with “extreme sensitivity” to preserve the area’s heritage, a counter-affidavit filed before the top court on July 4 stated. HT has reviewed a copy of the affidavit.The Supreme Court is hearing two petitions which challenged the redevelopment project that aims to create a new Parliament house and 10 administrative buildings for all the government ministries, convert the North and South blocks into museums, and develop the Central Vista avenue that connects Rajpath to India Gate. “While making the recommendations, DDA has ensured that no heritage building is /will be harmed during the process of redevelopment,” the affidavit said.Many of the buildings on the Central Vista, including the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Parliament and the North and South Blocks, as well as India Gate, were designed by British architects Edward Lutyens and Herbert Baker in the 1920s and ’30s and are Grade 1 heritage buildings.DDA also stressed that there will be no loss of green area due to the project, saying open spaces in the Central Vista will be kept intact by adequately compensating the loss of 9.5 acre of green cover in the district park by adding 5.64 acre of green area along Rajpath and another 3.9 acre in the C-Zone.The district park is the plot on which the new Parliament building is expected to come up, and currently houses a reception area, parking and other service infrastructure for the Parliament house. It is marked as a district park in the Parliament house complex. The entire Central Vista precinct falls within Zone D. The C Zone refers to the Civil Lines zone, which includes features like the Roshanara Bagh from Mughal times, and the old Secretariat Complex from the colonial period.“The present District Park area of 9.5 acre has been compensated by providing 5.64 acre in D Zone (Central Vista) and 3.9 acre in C Zone, thereby keeping the green spaces intact. It is pertinent to mention that as per modified plan, the green area along the Rajpath will increase by 5.64 acre,” the affidavit said.The redevelopment project proposes to do away with the encroachments along the avenue and increase the green cover on either side of the path.Advocate Rajeev Suri and Lt Colonel Anuj Srivastava filed petitions in the Delhi high court in February, following which the court ordered that the DDA should approach it before notifying the proposed changes in the land use.A division bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice C Hari Shankar, however, stayed this order prompting Suri to move the Supreme Court.The top court had on March 3 transferred the entire case to itself from the Delhi high court on the ground that the issue involves larger public interest. The case will be heard by a three-judge bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar on Friday.Suri’s petition stated that the DDA did not have the power to notify changes to land use and standards of population density.“The change in land use is in the direction of aligning the existing land use with the proposed Central Vista Development / Redevelopment Plan and it is not going to alter any fundamental character or historicity of this area. It is only a readjustment / reorganization of the Central Government Ministry offices”, the DDA said in its affidavit.It was contended that the change in land use was in conformity with the Delhi Development Act and each and every provision of the Act as well as the Delhi Development (Master Plan / Zonal Development Plan) Rules was followed.Srivastava challenged the public hearings held in February, and argued that they were not a meaningful exercise. The DDA rebutted this argument stating, “Public hearing was held on February 6 and February 7….Full opportunity was granted to each and every person who approached for public hearing. The objections were duly categorized by Board of Enquiry and Hearing and persons raising similar issues were heard at the same time. The opportunity of public hearing had not been denied and in fact submissions of each person have been duly considered by the BoEH while giving its recommendations,” the DDA’s response said.The DDA stated that the proposal will not increase residential population density in Central Vista area though floating population will increase due to proposed government office buildings.“The proposed modification will increase the floating population which will be offset to an extent on account of persons moving out of existing offices housed in six hutments of 90 acre (which will developed into organized spaces). This land use change proposal is not going to alter any fundamental living history and heritage of this area”, DDA said.The Supreme Court in June declined to stay the redevelopment of Lutyen’s Delhi’s Central Vista for the second time in two months, saying it could prevent government authorities from acting according to the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-redevelopment-will-not-harm-landmarks-dda/story-F7WsUbLzFWHyPjXbk2QBoL.html

Coming from a country known for its cold and snowy winters, he said he’s finding it difficult to adjust to the scorching heat and humidity of the Indian capital.After a trip to Nepal and Aurangabad, the boy, accompanied by his father, had moved into the Nizamuddin Markaz on March 22, just days before the country went into a complete lockdown for Covid-19.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageA three-month trip that was supposed to have been a post-exam vacation ended up stretching into an almost five-month detention. Though not officially charged by police, his passport was seized, and he was lodged with his father at quarantine detention centres since being evacuated from the Markaz on March 31.Following a Delhi high court order on May 28, the foreign attendees at the Markaz congregation -- after their release from quarantine centres – were housed in different court-approved facilities across the city.The 16-year-old is lodged at a school turned into a temporary detention facility in Jamia Nagar, where the detained attendees sleep in classrooms turned into sleeping spaces.“We were supposed to return in May. I was to join a new school in September, but I cannot do that now. I miss my mother and my family. I was enjoying my visit to the country. This was my first time. I do not know why I am not allowed to return,” he said.Trapped in the national capital since March, the teenager has also learnt Hindi words such as “Sathi (friend)” and “Nahi (no)”. When asked if he had tested positive for Covid-19, he replied: “Nahi.”He is the only minor at the facility that is mostly housing senior citizens and couples. The teenager spends most of his time browsing the internet and playing mobile games alone in empty classrooms. His days are spent joining the adults in the centre in offering prayers or catching up with their experiences in the country.“I miss my mother, even though I speak to her and my two elder brothers over video call. It is not the same as being there with them. I am not sure when I will be able to be with them but I miss them and can’t wait to go back,” he said, recalling how he had always been pampered, being the youngest child of the family.The teenager’s father, Fazluddin, a businessman in Ukraine, said they had come to India on December 20 and visited Nepal, and Aurangabad in Maharashtra. It was his second visit to the country. For his son, it was the first.“We came to the Markaz on March 22. We were not preaching. We visited religious places as part of our learning experience. On March 31, we had no symptoms but were taken by the government officials to the quarantine centre in Tughlakabad. We were given a room, where we stayed for around one-and-a-half months. We did not face any problems at the centre, though. It is unfortunate that he is trapped here with me,” Fazluddin said, adding that he and his son had tested negative for the coronavirus disease. Aslam Masuri, who helps the foreigners at the centre, said: “This is no age for a child to be trapped in a foreign country and unable to return home. We are adults and can manage the stress. For a boy of his age, he has suffered enough. His case should be considered and he should be sent back immediately. The only solace in all this is that he is at least with his father.”When contacted, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) member Roop Sudesh Vimal said that the commission had not been informed that a minor had also been moved to the quarantine centre along with those taken into custody in the Markaz case. “We will take cognizance and see if the authorities followed all protocols in the case of this minor,” said Vimal.At the centre, other attendees said that the two are always together. “He always walks behind his father. He is a shy boy,” one of the foreigners said.Stuck in the city for the last seven months and scared of a lengthy trial that could prolong their stay, the teenager’s father last week pled guilty and agreed to a plea bargain. He has been convicted and let off with a fine of Rs 5,000 and simple imprisonment of five days(already undergone in quarantine). The court convicted him under the Foreigners Act, Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act. HT contacted the Ukraine embassy and also emailed a questionnaire to the mission seeking its response to the minor’s case, but it elicited no reply until Thursday night. An official at the embassy, who did not want to be named, said: “We are helping our nationals stranded in the country and provided all assistance. We do not want to make any official comment on the legal aspect of the cases because of the diplomatic ties of the country.”Commenting on the minor being lodged in quarantine for around two months, a senior Delhi government official said that the administration had followed the Centre’s orders while sending foreigners from the Markaz to the quarantine centres. Fazluddin said he and his son were now waiting for the government’s order to leave the country. He said they would have to spend another 14 days in quarantine after reaching home but wouldn’t mind that .“I long for the sea. If I was home during the summer, I would have been out swimming with my friends. I cannot see any sea here,” the teenager said in response to what he misses the most about home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-miss-my-family-long-for-the-sea-ukrainian-minor-stuck-in-india-for-7-months/story-rQP6D0jH1Ld9OlF2lGyrMN.html
17-07-2020||India||As an actor I love to challenge my craft: Manoj Bajpayee||Known for his exceptional performances and frank opinion, actor-producer Manoj Bajpayee needs no introduction to any cinema lover. The actor was busy shooting in Uttarakhand when the Covid-19 lockdown was announced. “The phase of uncertainties has stretched a bit longer than expected. But now I think we all need to go back to our normal lives even though the entire world desperately wants a vaccine or medicine to face the pandemic. It’s okay to say we had good time with our respective families, but how long can that go on. As far as I’m concerned, I am trying to be productive and keeping myself busy attending work meets online, reading and spending time with my little one,” says the actor whose recent OTT release is making waves.Sharing details about the making of ‘Bhonsle’ he says: “Five years back when we started to find financer for this script it took us four years to find the money for the film. Too many people got associated and whoever contributed in whatever manner we are thankful to them. I remember that after shooting for ten days we didn’t have any money and I was shooting as well organising finances and then the biggest help came from producer Sandeep Kapoor who had already produced projects like ‘Jugaad’ and ‘Anarkali of Aara.’ So ‘Bhonsle’ as a film has gone through a lot of efforts,” he said over phone.Talking about his titular character and what interested him to take it up, Manoj said: “As an actor I found it an amazing opportunity to go ahead and challenge my craft because if I succeed I will definitely come out as a better actor and better human being. What I liked about the character and the story was that the story unfolds during the ten days of Ganpati festivities and it was about the old guy who doesn’t want to retire as he has nothing other than his duty as a policeman to look forward to. Bhonsle doesn’t want to be thrown in that one room place where he used to live as his duty was his only escape from day to day life that didn’t interest him at all. He doesn’t get into petty politics and opposes who divide or discriminate on the lines of societal norms.”When asked about the way OTT is changing the entertainment rules, he says: “When we all were locked down OTT did come up as the best medium to keep us all entertained. As far as my film is concerned let me tell you frankly that theatre has never done justice to these films in the past nor they will ever do. Many of my films have already met the same injustice in the past they didn’t get proper shows, proper release and respect when released in theatres. So theatre release would have done no justice or favour to a film like ‘Bhonsle’ in fact I am glad and thankful to the platform that brought it out so pleasantly for us.”On the work front, Manoj would complete the shoot of the independent film in Uttarakhand as soon as things normalize.Then there is another film in post production stage along with the second season of his hit web series ‘The Family Man.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/as-an-actor-i-love-to-challenge-my-skills-manoj-bajpayee/story-TCOwczhhL4quD0yuUcN2LJ.html

The court referred it to a two-judge division bench.Congress chief whip has also asked the Court to be heard in the matter. The chief whip is being represented by a legal team led by senior counsel and Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi.Also Read: The tale of Rajesh and Sachin Pilot, writes Rajdeep SardesaiThursday marks the shifting of the political slugfest in Rajasthan to the high court, which will likely make the crucial decision about the fate of the 19 Congress MLAs who have rebelled against the leadership of chief minister Ashok Gehlot alleging ill-treatment and the state government’s alleged failure to fulfil promises made nearly two years ago before assembly polls.Gehlot’s camp has however, accused his erstwhile deputy in the government and also the former state party chief, Sachin Pilot, of plotting his government’s downfall in connivance with the BJP, a charge denied both by Pilot and the BJP.Pilot was sacked from both the positions after he and his followers refused to attend two legislative party meetings held over two days to discuss alleged horse-trading charges and the differences between the two rival factions. Yesterday, the party chief whip went ahead and asked the assembly speaker to disqualify all 19 MLAs for defying the party whip. He also invoked the 10th schedule of the constitution that deals with anti-defection law.Pilot and his team were then served a notice of disqualification from the membership of the assembly and asked to respond by Friday. The delay in the hearing was caused today due to Pilot’s legal team’s decision to amend the petition to challenge the Rajasthan Assembly Member (Disqualification on the grounds of changing party) Rules, 1989, instead of the notices of disqualification.The single bench judge had to then refer the case to a two-judge bench as only a division bench can hear petitions challenging rules, bylaws and amendments, said Prateek Kasliwal, who is representing assembly speaker CP Joshi.In the petition’s earlier form, Sachin Pilot had argued that missing two meetings of Congress Legislative Party did not amount to defection. In the amended version, the petition argues that the “expression of dissatisfaction or even disillusionment against the party leadership” cannot be treated as conduct that could be covered under the anti-defection law.It adds that expression of views and opinions, howsoever strongly worded, cannot be considered to trigger the anti-defection law, “the said clause would not stand the scrutiny and will have to be declared ultra vires the basic structure of the constitution” since it violates the lawmakers freedom of expression, it argues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-camp-mlas-challenge-to-disqualification-notices-to-be-heard-by-high-court-at-1-pm-tomorrow/story-VsbFWwVSA9KB0fEKFuL1GK.html

Zydus is one of the two companies (the other is Bharat Biotech) that have so far received the Indian dugs controller’s approval to begin human trials for their anti-Covid-19 vaccine candidates. ZyCoV-D was granted the approval on July 2.“…the Adaptive Phase I/ II human clinical trials of its plasmid DNA vaccine, ZyCoV-D commenced today with the first human dosing. The Adaptive Phase I/II dose escalation, multi-centric study will assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine. The human dosing of the vaccine marks a key milestone since the launching of the accelerated vaccine development programme for Covid-9 in February 2020,” said Zydus in a statement.Also read: India set for pivotal role in Covid-19 vaccine production, says ICMRThe vaccine candidate was found to be safe, immunogenic (generating immune response) and well tolerated in the pre-clinical toxicity studies. The vaccine was able to elicit a high level of neutralizing antibodies in animal studies. Phase I and II human trials are conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of a new drug or vaccine.“This is an all-important step in our fight against Covid-19. We acknowledge the support of… [the] government of India and regulatory agencies ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] and DCGI [Drug Controller General of India] in the development of ZyCoV-D vaccine candidate.

17-07-2020||India||Rajnath Singh begins his Ladakh visit to assess military preparedness||Defence minister Rajnath Singh will visit Ladakh for a security review on July 17 at a time of military tensions in the sensitive sector where the Indian and Chinese armies are in talks for the next stage of disengagement, two officials said on Wednesday. Singh will also visit forward areas in Jammu and Kashmir on July 18, they said.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane will accompany the minister, the officials said. The military is keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 2.Singh was expected to visit Ladakh in early July but his tour was deferred. The minister will be visiting Ladakh two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled visit to the sector on July 3. The PM then declared that the “era of expansionism” is over, sending a strong signal to China about India’s determination to defend its borders.Complicated negotiations on kicking off the next stage of disengagement between the Indian and Chinese armies in eastern Ladakh saw senior military commanders from both sides hold a 14-hour meeting at Chushul on Tuesday to discuss the road map for further reducing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The talks that began at 11.30 am and went on till 2 am on Wednesday. The outcome of the talks wasn’t immediately known. A statement is expected only after top-level internal deliberations in the army on the matter, the officials said. The focus of the current round of military talks is to hammer out a consensus on easing tensions between the two armies in the Finger Area near Pangong Tso and Depsang plains as well as pulling back weapons and equipment from friction points in other sectors.This was the fourth meeting between the corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies who made previous attempts to reduce tensions along the contested border on June 6, June 22 and June 30.The previous two meetings went on for up to 11 hours while the first one was the shortest at 7 hours.Negotiations are expected to be far harder this time as the continued presence of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the Finger Area and the Depsang sector could be the sticking point of the talks, as reported by HT on Tuesday.In Tuesday’s talks, the agenda included the step-wise withdrawal of weapons and equipment to mutually agreed distances from all friction areas along the LAC and thinning the military buildup in the region. The military dialogue will be followed by another meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. The military commanders set the time-frame and method of disengagement while the WMCC monitors the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-minister-to-visit-ladakh-for-security-review-on-july-17/story-2SHxK0Feoiro0VLOYhXWOJ.html
