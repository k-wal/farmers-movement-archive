If necessary, the doctor who tests the patient will also prescribe necessary antibiotics, anti-histamine and antacid tablets to the patient,” an official in the medical and health department said.The kit also has the details of the local health centre along with the contact numbers of medical officers, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and ASHA workers and also that of municipal officials.According to an estimate, out of the total number of 12,600-odd active Covid-19 positive cases in the state, around 10,000 patients having mild symptoms have been undergoing treatment at home. “Even if there is more than one patient at home, all of them would get the home isolation kits,” the official said.He said most of these patients are cured with these medicines in home isolation. If they develop any moderate to severe symptoms, they can call up the local medical or civic authorities of ANMs or even dial the toll-free number, so that they could be immediately shifted to the hospital, he said.The Andhra Pradesh government, too, is said to be planning a similar scheme of supplying home isolation kits to Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment at home for mild symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-ease-burden-on-hospitals-telangana-govt-plans-home-treatment-kits-for-covid-19-patients/story-OOgVLVKtcF7j8syIDiXugK.html
11-07-2020||India||Requests for probe into gangster’s death reach SC||The Supreme Court has so far received four requests for setting up a CBI probe or a judicial enquiry into the encounter killing of gangster Vikas Dubey in Uttar Pradesh.The Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), which had filed a petition in the top court in 2018 against the growing number of encounter deaths in UP, moved a fresh application highlighting the deaths of Dubey and his accomplices, Amar Dubey and Prabhat Mishra. Citing news reports, the application said that all three encounters followed a similar modus operandi. In two instances, the petition said, the criminals tried to escape after snatching a police pistol, attacked the police party and were shot dead in retaliatory firing.The PUCL application said, “That the police version of the encounter raises many serious questions, in particular, whether they are simple administrative liquidations.”The application said since January 1, 2017 till March 31, 2018, over 1000 encounters took place in the state resulting in 49 deaths and injuries to 370 persons. By October 2018, the number of encounters doubled and in 2019, the police claimed to have killed 103 criminals in 5178 encounters.The application further stated that only a judicial probe can expose the role of the state behind such crimes. It said, “Police encounter or administrative liquidation is a serious crime – murder/culpable homicide and is an offence against the entire society. If such a crime is committed with the support of the State or where the State condones such an offence, it takes a very serious dimension….”PUCL’s 2018 petition is still pending consideration with the apex court. Pointing to an alleged police-politician-criminal nexus behind Dubey’s encounter, another petition has been filed by advocate Anoop Prakash Awasthi. In the petition, he has said that “trigger happy” officials in the Uttar Pradesh police consider themselves above the law and if this goes unchecked, it will pose a serious threat.In addition, the office of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) has also received a letter from lawyer Atal Bihari Dubey, demanding an independent probe into Dubey’s encounter.Hours before Dubey’s encounter, the apex court had also received a petition by a Mumbai-based lawyer Ghanshyam Upadhyay seeking probe into the death of Dubey’s aides. In his petition, Upadhyay said he suspected that Vikas Dubey too would be killed in similar manner. Following the encounter, Upadhyay has asked the SC Registry to list his case urgently.So far, there has been no direction from the SC Registry to list any of the above-mentioned matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/requests-for-probe-into-gangster-s-death-reach-sc/story-FvIDfRJzwzPx4KuZoW3auJ.html

The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) also filed a preliminary enquiry against three Independent MLAs for alleged attempts to bribe Congress MLAs ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls last month in a bid to destabilise the state government.According to the SOG FIR, the arrested accused were allegedly talking about the rift between the chief minister and the deputy chief minister and also about toppling the Congress government by poaching MLAs. The SOG claimed to have gained the information from phone intercepts. Further questioning of the accused is taking place.Earlier today, the ruling Congress party and the principal opposition party, the BJP, traded serious allegations and counter-allegations over the issue.It all started with chief minister Ashok Gehlot accusing the BJP’s state and central leaders of conspiring to topple his government using money power, reported PTI.“BJP leaders are playing the game at the behest of central leaders. MLAs were offered money... Rs 10 crore in advance and Rs 15 crore after the government is toppled,” the chief minister alleged and added that the BJP wants to convert the state’s politics into a goat market, reported PTI.Gehlot also named leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, his deputy Rajendra Rathore and BJP state president Satish Poonia for allegedly executing the agenda of their party’s central leadership by indulging in horse-trading.Congress MLAs in Rajasthan claim BJP involved in horse-tradingOn Friday night, over 20 Congress MLAs had also issued a joint statement alleging that BJP was trying to topple the Congress government in the state by “luring” legislators, reported the agency.The BJP responded by daring Gehlot to prove his allegation or quit politics, and claimed that the CM was targeting the opposition party since he had failed to stop the infighting in the state unit of the Congress party.Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat alleged that Gehlot’s allegations of horse-trading were nothing but a “cooked up story” aimed to defame Congress’ state president and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot to gain an upper hand in state politics.“The chief minister himself was the script writer, producer, director, actor and villain of this film,” said Shekhawat. He also challenged Gehlot to release the list of the MLAs, who he considered to be “saleable”.Also Read: Case filed for alleged bid to topple Rajasthan govtLeader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria asked Gehlot to handle his party’s internal crisis instead of levelling “false” accusations against the BJP.“I challenge the chief minister to prove his allegations against the BJP. If the allegations are proved then I will quit politics and if the charges are not proven, then chief minister Gehlot should quit politics,” Kataria was quoted as saying by the agency.The matter further intensified when Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) convener Hanuman Beniwal alleged that the state government was involved in tapping the phones of MPs and MLAs through the SOG. Beniwal, whose party is an NDA constituent, also alleged that attempts were made by Gehlot to poach three RLP MLAs during the Rajya Sabha elections last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-arrested-in-rajasthan-for-attempts-to-topple-government-political-slugfest-continues/story-GTI76bfOgjLdT1hbdbHy9L.html

District collector C Narayana Reddy said he has ordered an inquiry into the incident and terminated the services of contract municipal employee, who took the body of Covid-19 victim to the graveyard in an autorickshaw.“There are only two ambulances in the Nizambad hospital which are meant for disposing the dead bodies. On Friday, four people, including three Covid-19 patients, died. While two ambulances had already left with two bodies, the other two bodies completely packed were kept ready for disposal,” the collector said.Reddy said the hospital had informed the relatives of the patient to wait for one hour for the ambulance arrive, but they preferred to carry the body in their own autorickshaw. “So, the hospital authorities arranged for contract municipal employee to accompany the body to the graveyard,” Reddy said.Nizamabad hospital superintendent Dr Nageshwar Rao was not available for comment. Terming the violations in the process of cremation as serious issue, director of medical issue Dr Ramesh Reddy ordered a detailed enquiry in the matter . “The hospital superintendent has been instructed to file criminal cases against those employees who were involved in handing over the body.

11-07-2020||India||Air India terminates 200 cabin crew members, refuses withdrawal of resignations of 50 pilots||National carrier, Air India (AI), has terminated 200 of its cabin crew, and refused to accept the withdrawal of resignations of 50 pilots amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak that has roiled the civil aviation sector. These 200 cabin crew were recently inducted in the airline on a contractual basis. AI has had around 4,000 cabin crew and 1,800 pilots on its rolls until April.The 50 AI pilots had resigned from the airline after securing jobs in private airlines before the pandemic struck India.Their job offers were withdrawn because the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions led to the suspension of domestic and international flights since end-March and adversely impacted the civil aviation sector.The domestic flights have since resumed limited operations.The 50 AI pilots wanted to withdraw their resignations, but the national carrier’s management turned down their proposal and asked them to serve out their notice period.The decision was taken after the AI management met representatives of the pilots’ unions met on Wednesday (July 8).A senior airline pilot said, “The management needs to look at these employees with some compassion amid these hard times.”Earlier, HT had reported in May that the wide-body (Boeing) pilots union, Indian Pilots Guild (IPG), the narrow-body (Airbus) pilots union, Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), had questioned AI authorities about the measures taken while operating cargo flights during lockdown restrictions to ensure the generation of maximum revenue.On July 6 (Monday), the unions wrote a letter to Rajiv Bansal, the interim chairman-cum-managing director (CMD), urging the management to ensure that a fixed percentage is cut from an employee’s salary based on the income and also implement a monthly leave without pay (LWP) for all the staff because of truncated operations due to the viral outbreak.The unions also demanded that 25% of their pending dues be cleared immediately and they are allowed to quit their jobs with immediate effect in case the LWP is not implemented for all the employees.A senior airline official said layoffs were a new normal because the pandemic has heightened AI woes.“The letter has set things in motion. The heads of departments have failed to tackle the situation and stand up for the employees, who have been asked to leave,” the official added.“The crisis has deepened because a limited number of flights are operating due to the pandemic. The management needs to study the non-operating and operating departments and reduce the workforce accordingly amid an acute cash crunch,” said a retired AI official.AI spokesperson, however, refused to comment on the stand-off between the employees and the management.“These are internal issues on which we won’t like to make any comment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-terminates-200-cabin-crew-members-refuses-withdrawal-of-resignations-of-50-pilots/story-HuZwfO7Mt2P9VUguTCW3mI.html

The fares will be decided by the private players based on competitive pricing, the Railways had said.Fares for the private trains will be based on competition with other modes of transport in the same segment, including airfares and fares of air-conditioned buses, the Chairman Railway Board VK Yadav had then said.The bidding and procurement of the private trains and coaches will be done under the government’s ‘Make in India’ policy.

It has just commenced. It’s very much work in progress. At this point, I really wouldn’t like to say more than that.”During the third virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on Friday, India and China said they would push forward efforts aimed at complete disengagement and easing of tensions along the LAC even as differences persisted on key issues such as Beijing’s claim on Galwan Valley.The corps commanders of the two sides are set to meet next week for the fourth time since the standoff began in early May to decide on the next steps of the disengagement and de-escalation process.Though both sides have pulled back their troops and created so-called buffer zones at key friction points, the presence of large numbers of Chinese troops and structures at places such as Pangong Lake continues to be a concern for the Indian side.China’s envoy to India, Sun Weidong, on Friday said the two sides need to find a “fair and reasonable” solution to the border issue through peaceful negotiation and also work together to maintain peace and tranquillity along the disputed frontier till an ultimate settlement is reached.Also read: Arriving at a new normal in India-China relations | OpinionJaishankar also spoke on India’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, relations with key countries such as the US, the UK, Australia and Singapore and the emerging post-Coronavirus world order.India is conscious of the Covid-19-related challenges ahead and the next few weeks and months will be “tough”, he acknowledged. With India the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, the country will have a role in making any vaccine for the Coronavirus “accessible and affordable and available to the rest of the world”, he said.Referring to the UK, Jaishankar said India and Britain need to work together at a time when multilateralism is under stress and there is greater multi-polarity. Both countries have a shared world view and India sees the UK as “one of our natural partners” as it prepares for a stint in the UN Security Council from next year and takes on the chair of the G20 in 2022, he said.In the US, four presidents with very different outlooks – Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump – all agreed on the importance of India and the need to strengthen the bilateral relationship, he said. India’s ties with the US are now “one of our key relationships”, and this will become more important in future, he added.Also read | A timeline: India-China’s deadliest border clash since 1975 explainedLooking forward to the post-Covid-19 era, Jaishankar said he expected the political trends seen during the Coronavirus crisis to accelerate. A lot of countries are “behaving more nationalistically” and people are “looking out for themselves”, he said.“I do see a world where many arguments will sharpen, I think there will be issues of trust, there will be questions on resilient supply chains. It’s going to be a more difficult world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-between-india-and-china-is-work-in-progress-s-jaishankar/story-XGNCxc7OX9WcHeoYFkF73N.html

Among the fresh Covid-19 cases, 234 are locally-infected and the Indian Medical Association Kerala chapter has said community transmission has taken place in the state and there is no point in hiding it.With 488 fresh Covid-19 cases, the state’s total went up to 7,438 – out of this 2,680 patients are under treatment and 3,965 people have recovered, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The state has reported two deaths taking the death toll to 31. With the increase in locally-infected cases containment zones also increased to 168. But the CM said community transmission is yet to take place in the state.Pinarayi Vijayan said in view of the rising cases the government will restrict protest rallies to avoid further spread of the disease. The state has been witnessing a series of protests seeking the resignation of the Chief Minister in connection with the gold smuggling case.The Customs Department had seized 30 kgs of gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates to the country’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. Swapna Suresh, who was working as an IT consultant under the state IT Ministry, had gone underground after the seizure. Later, the CM had transferred his principal secretary M Sivasankar who was reported to be close to Suresh.The Union Home Ministry had later handed over the probe to the National Investigation Agency and the CM had welcomed it. But the opposition is on the warpath saying he was aware of the ‘shady dealings’ that took place right under his nose.“Everyone has the right to protest. But the situation is different now as we are going through a serious pandemic crisis. There is no distancing and masks in some of these protests. They are endangering lives of policemen also,” said the CM adding the protests were politically-motivated. The government has also decided to ban fishing in view of the hike in Covid-19 cases in coastal hamlets. In state capital, Thiruvananthapuram triple lockdown will remain in containment zones only but in other areas it will be a normal lockdown, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/88-new-covid-19-cases-take-kerala-s-tally-to-7-438-hike-in-locally-infected-patients-worrying/story-09iFQW9llh70Lfj3Lwg0AN.html
11-07-2020||India||‘Issues of trust’ will rise in a ‘more difficult’ post-Covid world: S Jaishankar||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday predicted a post-Covid world where differences and issues of trust between countries will sharpen along with a rise in nationalistic approach leading to an “acceleration of a trend seen before” the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.The comments made by the external affairs minister came during the three day India Global Week 2020 event which is an attempt to trace India’s role and place in a post-Covid world order on all fronts, including economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had highlighted Indian government’s policy of self-reliance combined with compassion for the entire world, as a possible solution to challenges presented by exigencies like coronavirus, while delivering the opening address at the event on Friday.Jaishankar said that a post-Covid world could pose several challenges including questions on “resilient supply chains”.“I see a world where arguments will sharpen. I think there will be issues of trust which have been raised. There will be questions on resilient supply chains. It is going to be a more difficult world,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Jaishankar’s comments come close on the heels of a protracted border conflict with China which led to the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in clashes with the Chinese Army, along with an unspecified number of Chinese casualties. While the militaries of the two countries are now engaged in disengagement and deescalation from the conflict zones, the clashes have led to a popular sentiment of mistrust of India’s neighbour. Amid the heightened intension between the two countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had cautioned that the era of expansionism was over. The comment was widely interpreted to be directed at China.Commenting on the ever evolving global dynamics, Jaishankar added that several trends seen before Covid 19 outbreak could become even stronger in the post-Covid world.“A lot of trends that we saw before coronavirus, they could accelerate in the post Covid world. Even in response, in six months, for example, we have seen a lot of countries behaving more nationalistically,” ANI quoted Jaishankar as having said at the summit.His comments come in the backdrop of friction seen on issues of trade and protectionism between the United States and several other countries including China and India. The US under President Donald Trump has also been accused of tightening immigration norms citing his government’s America First policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/issues-of-trust-will-rise-in-a-more-difficult-post-covid-world-order-s-jaishankar/story-MWmgj4pdXzUN4FJsF8yp2M.html
11-07-2020||India||SIT to probe connivance of local police with slain UP gangster Vikas Dubey||The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday announced a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe local police’s ‘connivance’ with slain gangster Vikas Dubey, according to an official statement.The SIT which will be headed by Additional Chief Secretary Sanjay Bhoosreddy will submit its report by July 31.The SIT has been asked to find out what action was taken in the cases lodged against Dubey, the statement said.Dubey was killed Friday morning by the Special Task Force (STF) of the Uttar Pradesh Police when he allegedly tried to escape after snatching a handgun of a police officer when the vehicle carrying him overturned.The STF had come under fire with the opposition alleging that the encounter was staged to eliminate a criminal who could have possibly revealed uncomfortable details of a police-criminal-politician nexus in the state.The STF claimed that Dubey was shot dead after he opened fire and refused to lay down the weapon. He had been arrested in Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday morning, a week after he and his gang members ambushed a police team killing eight policemen.On Wednesday, police arrested suspended Chaubeypur station officer Vinay Tiwari and sub inspector KK Sharma on the charge of conspiring for the attack on the police team by tipping off Dubey.Kanpur’s senior superintendent of police Dinesh Kumar P said the investigation found that Tiwari and Sharma leaked information about the raid to Dubey. Earlier on Tuesday, former Kanpur SSP Anant Deo Tewari and the entire staff of the Chaubeypur police station comprising 68 police personnel, were transferred.Anant Deo Tewari allegedly did not take action on complaints of slain DSP Devendra Mishra against Vinay Tiwari. Mishra had led the police raid against Dubey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-to-probe-connivance-of-local-police-with-slain-up-gangster-vikas-dubey/story-KjnzQX9OBPorg5H1cCLv2K.html

We must take proper care of their physical and mental well-being. They should not feel upset,” she wrote.The chief minister wrote the letter citing the ongoing crisis and the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country.West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar too has called a meeting with all vice chancellor of state run universities on July 16. He said he would also talk with Banerjee.He tweeted on July 8: “Student worries are reflected in inputs to me. After Virtual Conference with VCs on July 15, I will take initiative in engaging @MamataOfficial@itspcofficial for redressal of concerns. If required would also engage #UGC and Union HRD Minister. Am committed to student welfare.”Previously the state education ministry had written to the central government urging reconsideration of the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cm-mamata-writes-to-pm-modi-asks-centre-to-reconsider-ugc-s-guidelines-on-exams/story-8P5LfWR3An8FLBA35ubuqO.html
11-07-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee writes to PM Modi, says let states decide on holding final year examinations||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting that states be allowed to take independent decisions on the issue of holding of final year university examinations given the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic.Banerjee has asked for rescinding a directive issued by the ministry of human resources and the University Grants Commission (UGC) to compulsorily hold terminal examinations by the end of September this year and said that this will inconvenience the students and parents in West Bengal, who support state government’s decision to evaluate students on performance in their previous semesters.“I would therefore request you to get the matter re-examined immediately and restore the earlier advisory of UGC. This will facilitate the state governments to implement its decision, taken on the basis of the guidelines of UGC issued on 29.4.2020 to protect the interest of the students at national/international levels,” her letter states.Banerjee was referring to UGC’s revised guidelines issued on 27.06.2020, which she claims is contradictory to the governing body’s April advisory, which was made the basis for Bengal’s decision to not hold examinations. Her letter says that the Bengal government’s decision in this regard was issued on June 27 after consultations with all Vice Chancellors and other stakeholders and reversing it may lead to various complications.“It may be stated here that the Universities/Colleges aided by the State government have already taken steps as per the advisory issued by the Higher Education Department (of the state). The students, their parents and other stakeholders have overwhelmingly appreciated our advisory dated 27.06.2020,” she says in her letter before adding that her office is receiving hundreds of emails from the students and teaching community raising concerns over the new UGC revised guidelines mandating holding of final year examinations.Bengal is the latest state to protest against the UGC advisory, Maharashtra, Punjab and Delhi have also asked the Centre to reconsider the UGC directive citing the risk posed by coronavirus. Maharashtra, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry have already decided not to conduct final examinations.Some states have also cited the logistical challenge of holding examinations online due to limited access to computers and internet in rural areas and highlighted that some of the higher education institutions have been temporarily converted into Covid 19 management related facilities.Earlier today, the Delhi government decided to cancel all examinations in state-run colleges, institutions and universities and the Delhi CM urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and cancel examinations in Central universities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-writes-to-pm-modi-says-let-states-decide-on-holding-final-year-examinations/story-4E4pOuiDXzKYkOq50l0WQJ.html
11-07-2020||India||BJP offering MLAs Rs 10-15 crore to topple my govt, says Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has tried to buy legislators “like goats in a marketplace” but the Congress thwarted its brazen attempt to topple the government.The special operation group (SOG) of the Rajasthan police has already booked two men with alleged links to the BJP for trying to topple the state government by offering bribes to Congress legislators. The FIR lodged on Friday and based on mobile conservation between the arrested men said the attempt to topple the government was being made since before the Rajya Sabha polls held on June 19.“BJP leaders tried to topple the Rajasthan government at a time when the entire administration was busy in tackling the coronavirus outbreak. When all of us should have been focused in fighting the virus, the ministers, legislators and leaders had to divert attention to saving the government,” Gehlot said, while addressing a virtual press conference on Saturday.Gehlot said Rajasthan did not have a tradition of horse trading but the BJP leaders have become brazen and were promising Rs 10-15 crore to MLAs to switch allegiances and destabilise his government.“The BJP leaders have crossed limits of shamelessness. The BJP is trying to do politics by trying to buy MLAs like goats from a market,” he said. The CM said the BJP was successful in “buying” seven Congress MLAs in Gujarat and winning two Rajya Sabha seats. “But we thwarted their similar game plan in Rajasthan and won two seats and taught them a lesson. But, they are shameless and are still trying their machinations,” he said, claiming there was no threat to his government, which will complete its full term.Gehlot also attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah.“Mod ii and Amit Shah ji cannot tolerate me or my government. The conspiracy is being carried out by BJP leaders in the state who are trying to buy legislators,” he said.Gehlot claimed that the BJP was different when Atal Behari Vajpayee was prime minister between 1998 and 2004. “During (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee’s time, this was not the case but since 2014 the arrogance in the BJP has come out in the open. They are dividing people on religious and caste lines and murdering democracy. Their (BJP’s) thinking is fascist,” he said.BJP leaders, however, said the chief minister and Congress had laid out the entire game plan of accusing BJP of horse trading ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections to hide its own internal divide.Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia said, “This is Congress’s own fight. The entire strategy was worked out by the chief minister to prevent factionalism from coming out in the open.”“In the press conference, the CM did not name any betrayer who could switch sides. He was only trying to hide the divide and friction within the Congress party and is using BJP as a scapegoat which is not justified.”Poonia said Gehlot had crossed limits of political decency by using derogatory words for the legislators and BJP central leaders.“He termed the MLAs as goats and referred to BJP leaders in the state and Centre as shameless. This has never happened in Rajasthan politics,” Poonia said in a virtual press conference. Poonia said Gehlot was trying to emerge as a national leader by attacking Modi and Shah.The BJP president also refuted Gehlot’s charge that the BJP was a divided into several groups in Rajasthan and the state unit has not been able to form its executive because of differences between group led by leaders such as Satish Poonia, former chief minister, Vasundhara Raje and leader of opposition in Rajasthan assembly, Gulab Chand Kataria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-offering-mlas-rs10-15-cr-to-topple-my-govt-says-ashok-gehlot/story-EWaNBsKZIWsU5llfaKXz3K.html

The cloth merchant, identified as Aquil Shaikh, had come to Mumbai in end-June flouting prevailing lockdown restrictions, which were imposed since end-March in a bid to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, to catch a glimpse of actor Amitabh Bachchan.He was staying on a footpath near the actor’s bungalow Jalsa in Juhu.On July 4, the two accused, identified as Sanjay Gopi Kharwa alias Rajendra alias Khidki (25), a resident of Bhayander, and Suresh Kanji Kharwa (20), a resident of Matunga labour camp, spotted Shaikh sleeping on the footpath and targeted him.“Initially, the accused asked Shaikh to drink liqour, which he refused. Then, they took him to an isolated location and again insisted that he drinks liqour. An altercation followed between Shaikh and the two accused, and they started beating him. One of the accused then took out a knife and stabbed him in his hand, chest and stomach,” said Pandharinath Wavhal, a senior inspector at Juhu police station. The accused also robbed his mobile phone and cash and fled from the spot, he added.Locals spotted an injured Shaikh and rushed him to Cooper Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment.Police have registered a first information report (FIR) based on Shaikh’s statement under Sections 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt), Section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and Section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The suspects were identified after Juhu Police station authorities scanned the closed-circuit TV (CCTV) footage of the area.Harish Biradar, sub-inspector, Juhu Police station, and the investigating officer (IO) of the case, said, “Sanjay had a criminal past, as eight cases of robbery are registered against him. We, through our informants, learnt that they would be coming to Juhu. The accused were arrested from Pushpa Park in Juhu on Saturday. Now, we are on the lookout for an accomplice of the accused.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amitabh-bachchan-s-fan-who-came-from-up-to-see-him-stabbed-at-juhu-two-arrested/story-R7hAsLvEkHZyhRRO49PiVI.html

And age is no bar for learning music, I am still learning and will continue to do so always. I pick up little things from singers be it young or old, even from kids for that matter. One should practice regularly. Earlier, because of work I sometimes gave my riyaz a miss and ‘ab dekhiye roz hi riyaaz hai.’ At the same time, now we need to go back to work too. Hopefully studio recordings will start soon and we would be busy making music like before,” he said over the phone.Talking about his early days, he said, “I am fortunate that I was born in a musical family where music was already a part of life. I have learned so much from my father Ustad Hamid Hussain who was a gifted singer. That’s where I knew, that like my father, music is my world too. But I had to start from scratch. I took up whatever came my way as being associated with music was my priority. It was tough but that struggle is there in every field so I am glad and thankful to all who supported me in my musical journey.”The singer is all set to be back on TV as a reality judge. “I love music and enjoy being associated with it in any capacity and my association with the show goes back to 2011. Also getting back with Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Li’l Champs is like a homecoming for me and as the shoot is on, I am glad to be on the sets. In this period of new normal, we want to take viewers on a musical ride. Also joining me in the panel as mentors will be Himesh Reshammiya and Alka Yagnik for the eighth season. Also, I’m extremely emotional towards kids, so while taking care of their feelings, we will together take the show forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-always-knew-that-like-my-father-music-is-my-world-too/story-kyAH4NgSV8bh3mCmMoUeEO.html

Uddhav’s comments follow a similar commendation by World Health Organisation (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Dharavi is a densely populated slum area in Mumbai with around 10,00,000 people squeezed in an area spanning 2.5 square kilometers, making it highly vulnerable to spread of contagions such as Covid-19. Yet active surveillance and containment measures including intense screening, testing, sanitation and isolation of Covid patients and suspects has led to a continuous tapering off in the number of new infections in the area. This is all the more impressive given the high rate of infection in the rest of Mumbai and other cities of Maharashtra.Maintaining social distance is a challenge in Dharavi, which is spread over 2.5 sq km with population density of 2,27,136 per sq km. Not just that, according to a senior BMC official, at least 80 percent of its population depends on 450 community toilets and the administration had to sanitise and disinfect these toilets several times a day.The WHO director general cited Dharavi’s example to say that only aggressive action combined with national unity and global solidarity can turn the pandemic situation around.“And some of these examples are Italy, Spain and South Korea, and even in Dharavi - a densely packed area in the megacity of Mumbai - a strong focus on community engagement and the basics of testing, tracing, isolating and treating all those that are sick is the key to breaking the chains of transmission and suppressing the virus,” he had said.In a statement reflecting he shared the sentiment, Thackeray said, “Dharavi is an inspiration for the world on how to curb the spread of a pandemic.”Thackeray highlighted that 82 percent of patients in Dharavi have recovered from the disease and the number of active cases had dropped sharply in the area to 166. He underlined self discipline and community efforts as key to success achieved in Dharavi.2,359 Covid-19 cases have been recorded in Dharavi so far, of which 1,952 patients have recovered from the deadly infection. Maharashtra as a whole, on the other hand, has registered 2,38,461 coronavirus cases so far.Late last month, the central government had acknowledged the efforts put in by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in bringing down the infection rate in the area.Basking under the glory, the civic body on Saturday told news agency PTI that it had to change its traditional approach of waiting for patients, contact tracing, isolation and home quarantine to begin proactive screening instead, which paid rich dividends.Also Read: Proactive screening helped curb Dharavi’s coronavirus spread, says BMC“Proactive screening helped in early detection, timely treatment and recovery,” Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G North ward of the BMC was quoted as saying.He added that at least six to seven lakh people in the area have been screened so far and 14,000 persons have been tested apart from 13,000, who were placed in institutional quarantine that provided community kitchen apart from medical care for free.According to the official data, while in April, the doubling rate in Dharavi was 18 days, it gradually improved to 43 days in May and slowed down to 108 and 430 days in June and July respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dharavi-inspiration-for-the-world-uddhav-thackeray-lauds-covid-19-containment-model-in-asia-s-largest-slum/story-MqQykcVqrvzyrPGT2izmGO.html

The temple was closed on March 19 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams authorities, around 2.63 lakh pilgrims had a darshan of the Lord till Friday, since June 11 when it was thrown open for pilgrims. “This is not even equal to the four days’ footfall of pilgrims during the normal days,” a TTD official said.The daily footfall in the temple before its closure in March was around 65,000-70,000 during the normal days and nearly one lakh during Brahmotsavams (annual grand festival of the Lord) and other festival days.The drop in the number of pilgrims has had a consequent effect on the revenue of the richest shrine in the country which has seen a substantial drop in the offerings by devotees in Hundi (a cash chest adjacent to the main temple, where devotees drop money).“In the last one month, the collections from the Hundi was just Rs 15.80 crore. This is not even equal to the five day’s collections during the normal days. On an average, the temple used to get Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 4 crore a day during the normal days and during festival days, it used to exceed Rs 5-6 crore a day,” the TTD official said.In fact, in its annual budget for 2020-21 presented in February this year, the TTD had projected an expected revenue of Rs 1,351 crore in the form of cash offerings by the devotees. The total revenue projected in the budget for the year was Rs 3,310 crore.“The hundi collections in April and May were absolutely nil and were partial in March and June. If the Covid-19 situation continues like this for a few more months, the TTD revenues will be abysmally low,” the official said.Andhra Pradesh endowment minister Vellampalli Srinivas who had the darshan of Lord Venkateshwara on Friday, said the TTD had been adopting a cautious approach in allowing pilgrims in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. “In fact, even pilgrims are cautious. Although 12,000 tickets were issued for darshan every day, only 10,000 were opting for darshan,” he said.The minister praised the temple authorities for the arrangements made to curb the spread of coronavirus infection, saying that fool-proof arrangements had been made at Tirumala for safe darshan of the Lord, as per the guidelines of the central government and the state government.“Masks and social distancing of two meters was made mandatory for all pilgrims coming for the darshan. All the crucial locations of the temple, including queue lines, guest houses and dining hall were being regularly sanitised,” he said.TTD trust board chairman Y V Subba Reddy said so far, there had been no complaints from the pilgrims with regard to darshan and other arrangements and there were no instances of any pilgrim with Covid-19 symptoms coming to Tirumala, because of stringent screening everywhere.“Around 70 people in Tirumala tested positive, but none of them is a devotee. Majority of those who tested positive were security persons and other temple staff, who were immediately shifted to hospitals so that the virus does not spread to the pilgrims. All of them are healthy and recovering,” Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirumala-temple-records-sharp-drop-in-footfall-revenues-due-to-covid-19/story-x9sl0wr3ZePZirqMkPcZsO.html

Based on severity of symptoms, Covid-19 can be categorised into three groups: mild, moderate and severe. “For moderate and severe cases, adequate oxygen support, appropriate and timely administration of anticoagulants and widely available and inexpensive corticosteroids, in accordance with the protocol, can be considered to be the mainstay of Covid-19 therapy. For mild cases, which are nearly 80% of the total cases, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been recommended. The standard of care treatment strategies have shown to yield positive results,” the Health ministry said in a statement.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.It also said the pursuit of an effective treatment for Covid-19 has also resulted in repurposing of several drugs which are not a part of the main Clinical Management Protocol but have been indicated as “investigational therapies”. The ministry said these drugs can be used in specific sub-groups of patients on the basis of informed and shared decision making with the patient before prescribing these drugs. “These drugs have still not been approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and are only permitted for restricted emergency use for Covid-19. The States as well as the Medical College hospitals designated as Centres of Excellence were reminded by ICMR and AIIMS that their indiscriminate use or use in conditions for which they are not desirable, may cause more harm than good.” The states were also told that the available evidence for Remdesivir suggests that it may decrease the time for clinical improvement when used in moderate to severe cases. “However, there have been no benefits in terms of reduced mortality. It has to be used with extreme caution due to its potential for serious adverse effects including liver and kidney injury. Similarly, for Tocilizumab studies have not shown any benefits in mortality reduction,” the ministry said.It also warned against rampant use of the drug. “However, If used for patients with severe conditions, proper informed consent is required. Rampant use is to be discouraged since the effect of the drug is directed at the cykotine storm,” the health ministry said.All the ‘investigational therapies’ are required to be carried out only in proper health care facilities where close monitoring of patients is possible so that potential complications can be managed. During the video conference, the ICMR also stressed on high quality supportive care, including mental health counselling for patients and families, management of pre-existing illness and palliation of symptoms||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-support-anti-coagulants-steroids-mainstay-of-covid-19-therapy-says-govt/story-gyj4gvlz3QuaKMWvZPCoIN.html

Earlier, the bank authorities had refused to disburse fresh loans, as they were seeking to recover interests accrued on loans, which were waived off by the Maharashtra government under the Mahatma Phule Karj Mukti Yojana.The move has come as a major relief for thousands of farmers in Maharashtra, who were fearing of being deprived of the fresh loan benefits amid the Kharif season that started from June.The bank had disbursed the loans between January 1 and October 1, 2019.The two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices SV Gangapurwala and RG Avachat, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Kishore Tangade, a farmer, through senior advocate SB Talekar, was informed that the Kharif season has started amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak that has battered the economy, including the agriculture sector.Talekar submitted before the court that many farmers were eligible for a loan, but only 49.62% got the money after they paid interests on their outstanding dues. The bench was informed that the bank was insistent on recovering interests on loans after October 1, 2019, and only those, who have settled their outstanding dues by selling their gold ornaments are eligible for a fresh loan.Talekar submitted that though the state government under Section 79A of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, had directed the bank to disburse loans to eligible farmers on January 17, the lending institution did not comply with the order.The bank’s move has denied many farmers sowing activities for the Kharif season and they are staring at massive financial losses amid the viral outbreak.Government pleader DR Kale reiterated the petitioners’ submissions and reminded the court that the bank is bound to comply with the state government’s January 17 order. However, RS Deshmukh, who represented the bank, stated that compliance of the government order would lead to acute financial losses.The court observed that the bank must comply with the state government’s order and sought a compliance report.The court will hear the PIL next on July 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-directs-aurangabad-district-central-cooperative-bank-to-disburse-loans-to-farmers/story-bITzWfB7KrEPJtgvYb4HJO.html

Election Commission is competent enough to take a decision,” he was quoted as saying in reference to Chirag Paswan’s advocacy of deferment of polls due to the coronavirus pandemic.709 fresh Covid-19 cases take Bihar’s infection tally past 15,000-markOn Friday, LJP president Chirag Paswan had said he was not in favour of impending elections in Bihar as it could pose a serious risk to a large population and also put additional burden on the exchequer. He said that the election commission should take a decision while keeping these facts in mind. He, however, added that his party was readying for the polls. His comments followed a meeting of the party’s parliamentary board held in Delhi on Thursday.“However, due to the pandemic, the common man as well as the Central and state governments are financially strained. Under these circumstances, elections will put additional burden. All the parliamentary board members also expressed concerns over it,” he had tweeted.LJP’s deferment suggestion had come close on the heels of a similar demand made by the leading opposition party, RJD. Leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Yadav had last week accused the Nitish Kumar led NDA government of caring little about the plight of people during the pandemic and focusing more on preparations for assembly elections. He had demanded that the elections be postponed.Also Read: Time to fight Covid-19, not polls: Prashant Kishor to Bihar CM Nitish KumarBJP had yesterday reacted to Chirag Paswan and said that the election commission was capable of holding free and fair elections while ensuring all necessary precautions are observed on ground to prevent further spread of the contagion. Sanjay Paswan, however, went ahead and attacked LJP leader and a Dalit icon Ram Vilas Paswan.“It seems it is part of the strategy and tactics of Ram Vilas ji to remain in power. Our senior leaders have said all is well in NDA so we also believe that all is well. BJP and JDU have been in government even without LJP,” Sanjay Paswan was quoted as saying by ANI.The JDU led NDA government in the state has recently been criticized by Chirag Paswan over its handling of the pandemic and the migrants’ issue in recent months.Party spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad had yesterday said that the Election Commission has taken a decision (to possibly hold the polls on time) after consultations with all political parties. He added that timely elections would be in interests of “good governance” and will help Bihar get its “due respect” on the national stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-attacks-ally-ljp-nda-fault-lines-get-revealed-over-bihar-polls-deferment-debate/story-ObavmGZJrqVvGyUXu8Lz1J.html

As a part of our “boycott Chinese campaign” which began on June 10, 2020, under our mission statement Bhartiya Saamaan-Hamara Abhimaan, we request you to please not allow Chinese state owned CRRC Corporation to participate in global tenders for semi-high speed indigenous Train 18 project of Indian Railways. The total worth of the project is more than Rs 1500 crore for 44 Vande Bharat Express Trains,” CAIT said in its letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times.ALSO READ | China-India joint venture only foreign bidder for Vande Bharat train setsThe JV was established jointly by China-based CRRC Yongji Electric Co. Ltd and Gurugram-based Pioneer Fil-med Private Limited in 2015.The other five bidders include: state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Bharat Industries, Sangrur, Electrowaves Electronics (P) Ltd, MEDHA Servo Drives Private Limited, and Powernetics Equipment India Private Limited.Indian railways’ Integral Coach Factory, Chennai had floated a tender for manufacturing 44 rakes or train sets of semi-high speed Vande Bharat trains on July 10.This comes at a time when India and China are involved in a tense border stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. A brutal brawl in Galwan Valley on June 15 led to 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers being killed. India has also decided to ban 59 apps, mostly having Chinese links.Railways has also scrapped a tender for thermal cameras meant for ‘Covid-19 surveillance’ after Indian firms alleged that the tender specifications favoured a Chinese company, Hindustan Times reported on July 1.The traders’ body had last month also requested the commerce minister to make it mandatory for e-commerce companies in India such as Amazon, Flipkart to mentions the country of origin with each product sold on their platforms.“We further wish to state that this initiative of the Government is a part of ‘Make in India’ call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and as such considering the above fact and the current critical period, it will be most appropriate not to consider the said Chinese Company and rather emphasis should be laid more on Indian Companies who have been shortlisted for this project,” the letter added.The ambitious ‘Make in India’ project involves manufacturing of for 44 train sets of 16 coaches each of Vande Bharat Trains.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had flagged off the maiden run of the Vande Bharat train on the New Delhi -Varanasi route on February 15, 2019. The second such train set service between New Delhi and Shri Mata Vaishnodevi Katra was flagged off by home minister Amit Shah on October 3, 2019.The Railway ministry on Wednesday also began the formal process to allow a private company to run trains on 109 routes -- a process that aims to, for the first time, open up one of the government’s most prominent enterprises that has in recent decades been outpaced by the demands of a rapidly growing economy.On whether Chinese firms will be allowed to bid for the private trains, railway board chairman VK Yadav had last week said, “As far as the question on Chinese companies arises, there are guidelines under the Make in India Policy by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and we will follow them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traders-body-urges-centre-to-scrap-chinese-jv-bid-for-vande-bharat-trains/story-C8mFIl0bRLDEU9rd3oGuiK.html
11-07-2020||India||Seismologists warn big Himalayan earthquake is ‘overdue’; Delhi, Shimla unprepared||Seismologists are increasingly worried about at least one big Himalayan earthquake that is “overdue in the region” and have cautioned that both mountain towns like Shimla as well as cities in the plains like New Delhi are woefully unprepared for a mega quake.The last big tremor in the Himalayas was the Nepal earthquake of 2015 with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.8, killing nearly 9,000 people and injuring 22,000. The quake flattened large parts of the capital Kathmandu.According to an article in Livemint, the quake was strong enough to shift Kathmandu south by 1.5m, wasn’t a big earthquake like the ones that measure over Mw8. It did, however, set the ground conditions that make a far larger earthquake, a “big one”, more favourable.Seismologists are not sure when the “big one” will come. It could happen anytime soon or in a few hundred years. But they insist that will, sooner rather than later for which the country has to be ready.The 2015 Nepal earthquake was caused by the ongoing tectonic collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate. The three main fault lines in the Himalaya gather massive strain due to the tectonic movements.Unfortunately for human population, earthquakes are the most effective way of releasing this strain and stress. It would take the really big, infrequent earthquakes of Mw8 and above, the so-called “crack” ruptures to relieve the strain that has built up.Roger Bilham, a geological scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (Cires), University of Colorado Boulder, wrote in a review paper that over the past 500 years, there haven’t been enough big earthquakes (Mw8 and above) to ease the accumulated strain in large sections of the Himalayan arc. In 100 years, the accumulated strain would need an Mw8.6 earthquake for release. In 350 years, a Mw9 earthquake would be required.India’s most recent major earthquake was in Kashmir in 2005 (Mw7.6) that killed 86,000 people on both sides of the Line of Control.Seismologists are increasingly certain that major earthquakes in the Himalayas over the past 100 years have only loaded greater strain where they occurred, making a big earthquake even more “necessary” to relieve the elastic strain built up in the faults but they are not sure where the next major quake will hit .Earthquakes remain largely a blind spot in India’s planning for disaster resilience.In September 2019, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) published an Earthquake Disaster Risk Index (Edri) report that looked specifically at 50 cities including the metros and cities in seismic zones IV and V (the two most active regions in India). Of the cities surveyed, 30 cities (including Delhi) are at medium-level risk and 13 (mostly Himalayan cities, including Shimla) at high risk.Delhi also faces a major risk given that most of the city is self-constructed, without technical inputs that makes it vulnerable to high-intensity tremors.In June, the Delhi high court came down heavily on the Delhi government and civic bodies for non-implementation of action plan for ensuring seismic stability of buildings in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seismologists-warn-big-himalayan-earthquake-is-overdue-delhi-shimla-unprepared/story-Kt49Y0e7pMyW2SIOqBpQeJ.html
11-07-2020||India||Meet the Covid-19 hero who sold one of her four goats to feed the hungry||Rani and her husband Shankar used to think of themselves as the parents of two children and four goats.He spent his days plying a taxi; she spent hers caring for the house and family. Then an accident left him out of a job, a good deed reduced their family by one goat, and in a twist of fate, that good deed resulted in Rani finding a full-time job herself.At the beginning of the lockdown, Rani, 28, was on her way to buy groceries at the market near their home Carmelaram, on the outskirts of Bengaluru, when she came upon a group of children sucking on the leaves of some eucalyptus trees.Their parents were huddled by the side of the street, out of work and out of money. “I could not bear the sight,” Rani says. “I remembered the state of my own children when my husband was in hospital. I just thought, no child should be faced with such a thing.”Even though her family had no steady income, she decided to do something. She started by speaking to the people by the side of the road. She found out they were migrant labourers from North Karnataka who had been working at a construction site for about a year. They were 43 adults and 22 children with now no income, shelter or food.“I’ll bring you food,” she told them.She went home and spoke to her husband; she wanted to sell one of their goats.“They are actually my husband’s goats — he had bought them in Chennai soon after our son was born. When I asked him, he said, you do what you think is right,” Rani says, proudly.The next day, the goat was sold to a local butcher for Rs 20,000. With that money, Rani rented large utensils from a wedding caterer, roped in a few neighbours and began cooking vegetable pulao and tomato bhaat on alternate days. For a week, she delivered the meals twice a day to the 65 migrants. She also took them biscuits each morning, for breakfast.When she ran out of money, she set out to sell a second goat. “By then the lockdown had come into full effect. The butcher had no customers so he had shut his shop. He couldn’t buy our goat.”She didn’t want to give up, so she began to ask everyone she knew — do you know a way I can continue feeding my people?A friend put her in touch with World Hunger Warriors. This was an initiative set up by events management CEO Kiran Soans at the beginning of the lockdown, to connect people who wanted to contribute funds, food, equipment and time with migrant workers and slumdwellers who could no longer feed themselves.The WHW team visited Rani and met the people she’d been cooking for and, in addition to directing resources their way, they hired Rani as local coordinator at a fixed salary. “Rani inspired me,” says Soans. “When I found out that she had sold one of her goats, I was determined to take her on.”The Shankars now gets free groceries via WHW too. “They also gave us a laptop, so that our four-year-old daughter can do her online classes,” Rani says. (Her son is two and not in school yet).Rani is now involved in identifying communities that WHW can help, ensuring the food gets where it’s supposed to go, and providing temporary shelter to people living on the streets before they can be directed to the local distress home run by the municipal corporation.“This work was meant for me,” she says, taking a deep breath. “I love working in the field and working with people. I feel satisfied with my life after I started working here.”And when she heads out every day, after her daughter’s checked that she has her mask and sanitiser, she and her husband smile at how their family has grown — it’s two kids, three goats and so much more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-the-covid-19-hero-who-sold-one-of-her-four-goats-to-feed-the-hungry/story-cbf3HqdhbvzLYR8Gu5vowO.html

There have been movements of terrorists towards the Indian side.Pakistan’s BAT consists of its army commandos and terrorists belonging to various terror outfits like Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Tayyaba etc. BAT has started targeting civilians as well.In January, the group killed a civilian identified as Mohammad Aslam whose headless and mutilated body was found near the LoC in Poonch district.“There was no such input over the past few weeks but after the input which has come hours back, forces have been alerted, especially in two sectors. Patrolling has been enhanced and there will be extra deployments during the night. Any misadventures of Pakistan will be responded effectively,” a senior BSF official told ANI.“During this season, BAT facilitates terrorists to infiltrate into India. After getting them trained at various known locations, BAT and other Pakistani agencies send them near the border and when they fail in multiple attempts, they plan action with these terrorists to facilitate them,” a senior government official said.Last week, the Indian Army on the basis of specific intelligence inputs from Jammu and Kashmir Police, in a joint operation, eliminated a terrorist close to the LoC in Keri area of Bhimber Gali sector in Jammu division’s Rajouri district.Earlier today, two terrorists were killed in an ambush by the Indian Army at Nougam sector in north Kashmir along the LoC. The Army recovered arms and ammunition, along with Pakistani currency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intel-warning-on-terrorists-action-with-pak-help-in-j-k-security-forces-on-alert-report/story-l9tY0RQuhR7r4OeVSdsPRK.html

We are preparing to implement it in Karnataka as well. The state government will soon implement a ban on cow slaughter, sale and consumption of beef on the lines of many other states,” said Prabhu Chauhan, the state’s Animal Husbandry Minister. The Anti-Cow Slaughter Act is already in place in several states like Gujarat, Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh among others. Last month, the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government passed a draft ordinance to prevent cow slaughter, providing maximum rigorous imprisonment of 10 years and a fine up to Rs 5 lakh.The Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Cow Slaughter Prevention (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 aims at making the existing Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955 more effective towards cow safety. In Karnataka, the BJP-led government had promised to ban cow slaughter in its manifesto for 2018 state assembly election. “The government will form a team of experts to look into once the current pandemic situation eases,” Chauhan stated, adding that if necessary, the team of experts will visit states like Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat. The BS Yediyurappa-led BJP government had passed the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Protection Bill in 2010 but it failed to get presidential approval. Three years later, the Bill was withdrawn by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government. “I will discuss this matter with Chief Minister and if this pandemic situation eases, by next session, if not by upcoming assembly session, we will try to bring Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill,” Chauhan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-mulls-ban-on-cow-slaughter-beef-consumption-after-covid-19-situation-eases/story-p96XIH1YY6ntA0OQ36JPeN.html

11-07-2020||India||Indian economy showing signs of returning to normalcy: RBI Governor||The Indian economy has started showing signs of returning to normalcy in response to the staggered easing of lockdown restrictions, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Saturday. He further said the need of the hour is to restore confidence, preserve financial stability, revive growth and recover stronger. “The Indian economy has started showing signs of getting back to normalcy in response to the staggered easing of restrictions,” Das said at the 7th SBI Banking and Economics Conclave. Indian companies and industries respond better in a crisis, he noted.   Das, however, said it is still uncertain when supply chains will be restored fully, how long it will take for demand conditions to normalise, and what kind of durable effects the pandemic will leave behind on potential growth. According to him, targeted and comprehensive reform measures already announced by the government should help in supporting growth.   Possibly in a vastly different post-Covid global environment, reallocation of factors of production within the economy and innovative ways of expanding economic activity could lead to some rebalancing and emergence of new growth drivers, Das added. The central bank, he said, strives to maintain the balance between preserving financial stability, maintaining banking system soundness and sustaining economic activity.   “Post containment of Covid-19, a very careful trajectory has to be followed in orderly unwinding of counter-cyclical regulatory measures,” he said. The financial sector should return to normal functioning without relying on the regulatory relaxations as the new norm, he added. He said the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has reduced policy rates by 250 basis points since February 2019 to support growth. The conventional and unconventional monetary policy and liquidity measures by RBI have been aimed at restoring market confidence, alleviating liquidity stress, easing financial conditions, unfreezing credit markets and augmenting the flow of financial resources to those in need for productive purposes, he said.           “The broader objective was to mitigate risks to the growth outlook while preserving financial stability,” he added. Das said despite the substantial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country’s financial system, including all the payment systems and financial markets, are functioning without any hindrance. “RBI is making continuous assessment of the changing trajectory of financial stability risks and upgrading its own supervisory framework to ensure that financial stability is preserved,” he said. Banks and financial intermediaries have to be ever vigilant and substantially upgrade their capabilities with respect to governance, assurance functions and risk culture, Das noted. The Governor also said banks will have to improve their governance, sharpen their risk management and raise capital in an anticipatory basis instead of waiting for a situation to arise. He said as the lockdown has obstructed RBI’s on-site supervision to an extent, the central bank is further enhancing its off-site surveillance mechanism. The objective of the off-site surveillance system would be to ‘smell the distress’, if any, and be able to initiate pre-emptive actions, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-economy-showing-signs-of-returning-to-normalcy-rbi-governor/story-lhHKr52UJMXJadzjEX98mN.html

Rapid antigen tests will be conducted exclusively on security personnel, including those from the Army and the paramilitary forces, at the Rangpo border check-post from Saturday onwards, he said. The Rangpo check-post along the Sikkim-West Bengal border is one of the major entry points to the Himalayan state. “Those testing positive for Covid-19 during the rapid antigen tests will not be allowed to enter Sikkim and will be sent back to quarantine centres from where they came,” said Director General-cum-Secretary of the Health Department, Dr Pemba T Bhutia. The measure comes after more than three dozen security personnel posted in the Himalayan state, bordering China, tested positive for Covid-19. Earlier, thermal screening was conducted on everyone including security personnel entering the state through the border check-posts. The rapid antigen tests, that give results faster, will be conducted for free for the first 15 days, he said. Meanwhile, eight more people have recovered from Covid-19 in the state, the official said. Of the 121 Covid-19 cases in the state, 41 are active and 13 patients (Army personnel) have migrated to neighbouring West Bengal, while the remaining people have been cured of the disease, he added. Sikkim had reported its first Covid-19 case on May 23 after residents started returning to the Himalayan state from other parts of the country.

PM Modi’s intervention was made during a high-level meeting he chaired on Saturday to review the status of the coronavirus pandemic situation in India.PM Modi is also reported to have praised the authorities for their coordinated efforts to contain the pandemic in Delhi and asked for the adoption of a similar approach in the national capital region (NCR) comprising several districts of UP, Rajasthan and Haryana adjoining the national capital.“PM appreciated the concerted efforts of the Centre, State & local authorities in containing the pandemic in Delhi. He further directed that a similar approach should be adopted with other State Governments in containing Covid19 in the entire NCR area,” an official communication by the PMO said.Watch | PM Modi lauds Delhi’s approach during review meet for Covid preparedness With record 27,114 new Covid-19 cases in a day, India’s tally tops 8.20 lakhThe review meeting was also attended by union home minister Amit Shah, union health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, member, NITI Aayog, cabinet secretary and other senior officials of the government of India. While taking stock of the situation in various parts of the country, the prime minister directed for a renewed emphasis on the need to observe personal hygiene and social discipline in public places. This he indicated should be done through renewal of awareness campaigns about Covid and methods to prevent its spread. He said that there is no room for any complacency in this regard. During the meeting, the Ahmedabad model of home-based care through ‘Dhanvantri Rath’ and surveillance was picked up for special commendation for its success in containment of the disease and it was directed that it may be emulated in other places. The review meeting came on a day when India’s Covid-19 tally went past the eight-lakh mark with a record single-day increase of 27,114 cases.

The surrender figures convey this trend. Last year and this year to date, 13 and 19 Maoist rebels have surrendered, respectively,” said DGP Abhay, days after five Naxals, including a state committee member, who carried a reward of Rs 20 lakh on his head, were gunned down.Kosa Sodi alias Sukru, a member of Odisha State Committee of the CPI (Maoist), was killed in an encounter with police in the dense forests of Kandhamal district last Sunday.Nayagarh, one of the five districts that may lose its LWE-hit district tag soon, hit the headlines in 2008, when Maoists had carried out their biggest-ever arms heist from the district police armoury. The rebels had looted hundreds of automatic rifles and magazines in a bid to boost their firepower.By the turn of the new millennium, the Maoist dominance started gathering momentum. And, the rebels held sway in the state’s 22 out of 30 districts by 2010. The internal rebellion intensified until 2015, when Odisha reported an unprecedented level of violence and loss of lives and property, as the Maoists targeted government installations and security forces with impunity.Abhay said the situation in Swabhiman Anchal area of Malkangiri district, considered to be the hotbed for LWE activities, has improved significantly over the past few years.Two police camps have been set up at Hantalguda and Darlaguda. Besides, a new police station has been set up at Jodaamba, the DGP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-asks-mha-to-remove-5-maoist-affected-districts-from-sre-list/story-wMCFP0uusgdEYKYF85ww4J.html

Preliminary investigation did not find any suicide note, but her parents maintained that she used to often talk about the recent suicidal deaths of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh and a popular minor Tik Tok star (16) from Gurugram, said police. Ajay Rawat, senior sub-inspector (S-I), who is one of the investigators in the suicide case, said, “The deceased had appeared for her Grade XII Board examinations this year. She used to live with her parents and two elder brothers. Her father is a trader.”“She was found dead in her room on Friday morning,” Rawat added.She was rushed to a nearby hospital, but doctors declared her brought dead on arrival. Soon, the police reached the spot and started the investigation.“Her family members insisted that there was no apparent reason for her to commit suicide. However, she was frequently talking about the suicidal deaths of Rajput and the popular minor Tik Tok star for the past 10-12 days,” Rawat said. Though her father used to tell her that she shouldn’t “think much about such incidents, but never thought she would take a similar step”.A probe is on, the senior S-I added.If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

Pawar, in an interview to the Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana, insisted there is no difference of opinion between him and Uddhav Thackeray over the way the government brought in the relaxations during the lockdown. This is the first time Saamana has interviewed a leader from some other party.In the interview to Saamana’s executive editor and Sena MP Sanjay Raut, Pawar said he came to a conclusion that curbs should be gradually lifted to revive the economy after discussions with several people and brought it to the notice of the chief minister. The Maharashtra government under its Mission Begin Again started relaxing lockdown norms from June and there were speculations that Thackeray was earlier unwilling to open up the state but Pawar intervened to get the curbs eased across the state.Raut asked if there were any differences on lifting the lockdown referring to newspaper reports about them and Pawar refuted them.“Absolutely not... During this entire situation, I have been in touch with the chief minister and am even today... During this time, I had discussions with labour bodies, business-owners etc. I formed an opinion based on that and brought it to the notice of the CM,” Pawar said. “This is not called a difference of opinion. Delhi and Karnataka lifted relaxation, it faced issues but economic activities started again. Such steps have to be taken. If the entire state’s and the country’s economy is disrupted then the ill-effects will be far greater than coronavirus which the future generations will suffer,” he said.Pawar said though some might think Thackeray delayed giving relaxations but they came at the right time. “The decision that came was true to the nature of the chief minister. Meaning, a decision should be taken but with caution. To take a step by seeing all sides, so that there is no need to go back on it,” he said.In the first of the three-part interview published in Saamana, Pawar spoke also about the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the changing nature of political activities after the coronavirus pandemic, his relationship with former Sena chief Bal Thackeray among other issues. The Maratha strongman denied that he is either the “remote control” or the “headmaster” of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government amid a buzz that Pawar has been directing Thackeray from behind the curtains and running the government.“I am neither. If headmaster, he’d have been part of the school. In a democracy, governments or administration do not function with remote control. It functions where there is no democracy,” he said giving an example of the political scenario in Russia.The veteran leader denied that the alliance between the three parties—the Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress—to form the government was an “accident”. Pawar pointed out that in the Lok Sabha elections last year there was no change but before the state assembly polls the people had decided to bring one.He said Sena’s voters and supporters were uneasy during the BJP-Sena government between 2014 and 2019. He said the Sena paid a heavy price for its association with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“The BJP continuously took the stand to sideline Sena, keep it quiet. The Sena supporters were uneasy because of it. They functioned as if it was only a BJP government. Earlier too there was a Sena-BJP government under Manohar Joshi but the atmosphere was not like this then. The BJP sidelined the Sena and functioned as only they are the rulers. This did not go well with the people of Maharashtra,” he said.Without naming former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Pawar said, “No political leader should take the people for granted saying ‘I will come back again’.” He added the Sena had a major contribution in the BJP’s assembly tally of 105 seats. “Had it not been for the Shiv Sena, that number would have been around 40-50.”Pawar also claimed that Bal Thackeray did not have the functioning style and ideology similar to the BJP. “The functioning style of Balasaheb, whom I have known, was different than the ideology of the BJP. He respected the leaders including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani, Pramod Mahajan,” he said.“Through respect, the idea of forming government came forward. Secondly, the Shiv Sena had struggles with the Congress but it was never permanent, I think. Shiv Sena was never at loggerheads with the Congress,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-no-remote-control-no-differences-with-uddhav-thackeray-over-lockdown-sharad-pawar-to-sena-mouthpiece/story-7s9n2YmP85i3gR6aW3FS6K.html

The response we received has now inspired us to create a range of Corona warrior rakhis with the tricolour, red cross, swachhata spectacles and other such motifs particular to different departments and clubs,” Uma Devi, the trainer of these women, said.Around 100 women are engaged in making the cow dung and seed rakhis, out of which 10 carve out the moulds and the rest then paint them. The other group creates the bamboo and thread bases to rest these seeds on. Once done, they package them in in-house handmade paper bags or cloth bags.The idea for seed embedded cow dung rakhis came from Durgesh Nandini and Manju Chandrakar.“In rural areas, people are closely connected with cow dung in their daily routine. Using this is considered a good omen to start festivities. Using them for seed balls is a new twist and opens a whole lot of possibilities for modern variations to this widely available local resource,” Chandrakar said.She said the prices of these rakhis vary from Rs 40 to Rs 100 depending on the bamboo base used. Made as a salute to frontline workers, the tricolour, red cross and swachhata rakhis are available for Rs 20 along with courier charges.“If we hit our sales target, about which we are optimistic, each woman will take home Rs 10,000 for a month’s work,” Devi said.Namrata Gandhi, the chief executive officer of Zila Panchayat, said people’s response to these rakhis has been encouraging.Gandhi said they had started training the women with the support from Arya Prerna Samiti before the coronavirus pandemic broke. She said the energy and ideas of the women inspired them to create around 15,000 rakhis.“There was a lag due to the Covid lockdown. But the women remained eager to get on with the work. With due precautions, we restarted work at our multi-utility centres. Keeping in mind the upcoming Rakhi festival, these women decided to make rakhis,” said Gandhi.“The public response to this initiative has been very encouraging. Local NGOs have come forward to help market these swadeshi rakhis. We have also trained women to sell them so that in the future it’s an added skill for them. Our next target is to create a range of ethnic lifestyle products with a modern twist,” Gandhi added.Raksha Bandhan, a festival of the bond between brothers and sisters, will be celebrated on August 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chattisgarh-women-make-cow-dung-rakhis-add-corona-warrior-motifs/story-mDsnRcChoGbmtLSTRqwdfO.html

The census has entered the Guinness Book of World Record. The fourth edition of the census, which was carried out between 2018-19, was “the most comprehensive to date, in terms of both resource and data amassed,” mentions the Guinness Book of World Record on its website.Environment minister Prakash Javadekar reacted to the feat and said that the aim is to double the numbers achieved four years before target.“Our census of tigers entered Guinness World Records because we have installed more cameras to monitor them as compared to other countries. Their population is nearly 70% of the world’s tiger population,” he told news agency ANI.  Our census of tigers entered Guinness World Records because we have installed more cameras to monitor them as compared to other countries. Their population is nearly 70% of world's tiger population. Resolve to double their numbers achieved 4 yrs before target: Min of Environment pic.twitter.com/ELO9K5KK9USince 2006, the government of India has been conducting the census every four years led by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) with cooperation from various state forest departments and conservation NGOs.The exercise aims at arriving at a nationwide assessment into the country’s population and habitat of tigers (Panthera tigris tigris). Also read: SC committee asks Assam to submit report on illegal construction in Kaziranga animal corridorThe latest survey was carried out in three phases, marked by an “unprecedented camera trap usage”. “Camera traps (outdoor photographic devices fitted with motion sensors that start recording when an animal passes by) were placed in 26,838 locations across 141 different sites and surveyed an effective area of 121,337 square kilometres (46,848 square miles),” the website noted. Around 34,858,623 photographs of wildlife (76,651 of which were tigers and 51,777 were leopards; the remainder were other native fauna) were captured during the survey from which 2,461 individual tigers (excluding cubs) were identified. The 2018 “Status of Tigers in India” assessment also conducted extensive foot surveys that covered 522,996 km (324,975 mi) of trails and sampled 317,958 habitat plots for vegetation and prey dung. It’s estimated that the total area of forest studied was 381,200 km2 (147,181 sq mi) and cumulatively the collection and review of data equated to some 620,795 labour-days.A positive outcome of the survey was that it concluded that India’s tiger population had increased by roughly one-third - from 2,226 in 2014 to 2,927 in 2018, though some have cautioned that this rise may in part reflect more comprehensive surveying as opposed to purely a population surge. Areas of improvement include better “corridors” between isolated pockets of tiger territory, reduced poaching and building up prey numbers through habitat restoration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/largest-ever-camera-trap-wildlife-survey-india-s-2018-tiger-census-sets-guinness-world-record/story-gRHiJKldML9LDF2ZPcaY8O.html

So, we assigned our designers to create masks, which the customer later bought. After this, we made a wide range of these masks as people will be requiring them in the coming days. Pure diamonds and American diamonds have been used with gold to make these masks,” Choksi told ANI.“Yellow gold has been used in the mask along with American diamonds and it costs 1.5 lakhs. Another mask which is made with white gold and real diamonds and it costs Rs 4 lakhs,” he added.The shop owner said the cloth material of these masks is in accordance with the government’s guidelines of manufacturing the protective gears.He said that diamonds and gold studded from these masks can be taken out as per the wish of customers and they can be used for making other jewellery items.A customer, Devanshi at the jewellery shop, said, “I came to the shop to buy jewellery as there is a family marriage. Then, I saw diamond masks which look more attractive to me than jewellery. So, I decided to buy it to match it with my dress.”Recently, a man named Shankar Kurade in Pune has bought himself a mask made of gold worth Rs 2.89 lakhs amid the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jewellery-shop-in-surat-selling-diamond-studded-masks-worth-lakhs/story-u5Hs5xFh9VY6GzA3scKxIN.html
11-07-2020||India||Bombay HC refuses bail to woman accused of supporting husband who allegedly raped two daughters||The Bombay high court last week rejected the bail plea of a woman accused of passively supporting her husband who allegedly raped two of their daughters and tried to sexually assault the third in Maharashtra’s Beed district.A single bench of Justice Vibha Kankanwadi took note that the entire story as was narrated by their daughters in the FIR was ‘consistent’ and ‘shocking’, and rejected the woman’s bail plea which claimed that the accusations against her were false. On April 2, 2020, Kaij police in Beed district had booked the man who is a headmaster of a school, along with his wife after the eldest daughter registered a complaint with the police after all the three sisters who were badly beaten up and locked in a room by the parents were rescued by police.On March 31, 2020, the man tried to molest his 20-year-old eldest daughter that led to all the three sisters raising a hue and cry. But the parents beat them up and locked them inside a room. The sisters, however, managed to communicate their condition to a friend who then informed the police which then rescued them on April 2.The eldest daughter then narrated her ordeal to the police officials and in her complaint stated that she was raped by her father in 2012. She told police officials that she was badly beaten up by her father after she informed her mother about the incident.The complainant further alleged that while her father kept molesting her intermittently, her father sexually had also assaulted her younger sister who is now 18-years-old since the time she was in fifth grade. All the three sisters were badly beaten up after the matter was reported to their mother and all of them were warned not to disclose the acts of their father to anyone.She further alleged that their father tried to rape their youngest sister, who is now 15-year-old, in 2018, and again their mother remained silent even after the incident was brought to her notice.Acting on the complaint lodged by the 20-year-old, the police on April 2 arrested the headmaster for rape, and his wife for abetment, for passively supporting her husband. The woman had moved the high court seeking bail claiming the complaint was false and that the 20-year-old had made wild allegations because she was reprimanded for moving around in bad company. “It is highly impossible that the mother would keep quiet when her husband was molesting their own daughter and would allow such activity to be continued for years together,” her lawyer had argued.The judge rejected the woman’s bail plea primarily noting that, “The entire story that has been narrated in the FIR, appears to be consistent with the statements of the sisters, in which serious allegations are levelled against her.”Justice Kankanwadi said the entire story was shocking and the defence put forth by the applicant mother appeared baseless. The judge felt that no daughter will go to the extent of making such serious allegations against her own parents simply because they were opposed to her relationship with a particular boy having bad antecedents. The judge also said that even if the complainant went to that extent, the other two sisters would not have supported her against their parents, if the allegations were false.The judge also took note of the allegation of the complainant that on the night of March 31, 2020, when they were at their native place, their father tried to molest her, and the next day when the sister raised a hue and cry, they were badly beaten by both their parents. The sisters were locked up in a room, and were rescued by police after they succeeded in contacting one of their friends, who in turn sought police help in freeing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-refuses-bail-to-woman-accused-of-supporting-husband-who-raped-two-daughters/story-kyyA2wOU9E8eEEz2zTKYLK.html

Maxwell is the daughter of the late British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell.Epstein was found hanged last Aug. 10 in jail at age 66, in a death ruled a suicide.He had before his arrest socialized over the years with many prominent people including Britain’s Prince Andrew, US President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton.Media crushMaxwell’s proposed bail package includes a $5 million bond, the surrender of her passports, “stringent” travel restrictions, and home detention with electronic monitoring.She said she will continue needing security guards to ensure her safety.Maxwell also maintained she is not a flight risk, claiming to have remained in the United States since Epstein’s arrest.She “did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable purpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online attention and its very real harms,” the filing said.Friday’s filing also raised several legal challenges to the indictment, including that Epstein’s 2007 nonprosecution agreement with the US government covered “any potential co-conspirators.”In seeking Maxwell’s continued detention, prosecutors called her an “extreme risk” of flight because of the possible long prison term, her wealth, her multiple passports and citizenships, and her having “absolutely no reason to stay.”The case is US v.

The former Congress president tweeted just one word and tagged a post from the Twitter handle of the Prime Minister’s Office.“Asatyagrahi!” Gandhi posted. असत्याग्रही! https://t.co/KL4aB5t149The word in Hindi means someone who practises the policy of untruth.Before Rahul Gandhi, the chief of the Congress’ Karnataka unit DK Shivakumar had sought clarification from the Union power minister over the government’s claim, saying that a 2,000MW solar plant already exists in Pavagada of Karnataka’s Tumakuru district.“BJP Central Govt is claiming today that it inaugurated Asia’s Largest Solar Plant of 750 MW at Rewa, MP. What then is the 2000 MW Solar Plant in Pavagada, Karnataka which was built in just 3 years by @INCKarnataka govt and has been operational since 2018?” Shivakumar asked in one of his tweets. “The unique thing about the 2000 MW Pavagada Mega Solar Park was that not a single acre of land was acquired from the farmers. All 13,000 acres have been leased from the farmers who are being given yearly rent. Karnataka model of Renewable Energy was accepted as the best in India,” he said in another post. The Pavagada solar park was developed by the Karnataka Solar Park Development Corporation Limited (KSPDCL), a joint venture between the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and the Karnataka Renewable Energy (KREDL).Earlier this year, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had tweeted about the “world’s largest solar park at Pavagada.”“India Takes Lead in Clean Energy: World’s largest solar park at Pavagada in Karnataka is now operational. Generating 2050MW of clean energy, the park is located on land leased from farmers, utilising the drought-hit area & adding to farmers’ income,” Goyal had tweeted on January 19, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-one-word-rahul-gandhi-questions-govt-s-claim-on-750mw-rewa-solar-project/story-jQ5BsrRj4q8cXzTUEEifvJ.html

These are from other states and have no legal permission to enter the state. Many who have succeeded in sneaking into the state have been quarantined. So far, sixteen people hailing from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have been quarantined for fourteen days at Maheshwari ashram in Haridwar under police vigil.Also read: Eight-month-old tests positive for Covid-19 in Uttarakhand, state tally rises to 3,373To ensure total adherence of prohibition on entry of Kanwariyas in the state, the administration has started deploying police personnel at the interior and arterial routes on border areas.According to Shyampur station house officer Deepak Kathait, additional force has been deployed at sensitive border posts and entry points along the interior stretches of the district.“We are carrying out round the clock checking at various border posts for people on vehicles as well as on foot who try to sneak into the state. Many times, people resist but when we tell them that they can’t enter the state as Kanwar yatra has been cancelled, they agree to return, “said Kathait.Local intelligence unit personnel and villagers have brought to light how people from UP, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab are deceiving the police by skipping highway routes where checking is being done and are using narrow-temporary routes that pass through forest and riverbeds.Taking cognizance of this, the police administration has deployed additional security personnel at such rural arterial routes through which other state people were trying to reach Haridwar.The police have also deployed personnel at Sirchandi, Badedi, Hasanpur villages that lie on the border with Uttar Pradesh.The whole district has been bifurcated into 10 zones and 21 sectors to ensure better management and monitoring of security aspects till Kanwar yatra period ends.

Not being able to get there is another, especially for visiting non-resident Indians when the pandemic hit.As they waited out the lockdowns — the borders were shut on March 22 and the latest announcement, made on Friday, confirmed that they will remain shut until at least July 31 — they risk losing their jobs even as they continue to pay rent on homes that sit vacant overseas; and they remain separated from loved ones whom they may not see for some months more.Niklesh Sadarangani, 42, has been paying ~70,000 a month to rent a Singapore flat he and his wife Krishna Merchant, 35, haven’t used since December. That’s when they flew into India, a month before their first child was due. The idea was for Merchant, her mother and their baby to return to Singapore in March. Merchant would resume work as a journalist with a news agency and her mother would help with the baby while her husband established his car-polishing business in Mumbai and went back and forth.“On the one hand, I’m happy to have these months with my son. But my business hasn’t started. We’re also paying rent on a warehouse in Mumbai. It’s all adding up,” Sadarangani said.Plus, as NRIs, their tax structure is set to change if they don’t return to Singapore in the next 180 days or so. Meanwhile, the baby’s passport still hasn’t arrived, Covid-19 has disrupted his vaccination schedule, and the couple’s Singapore visas expire in October.“Because Singapore is not open to visitors, I will most likely not be able to take my mother with me whenever I do head back, so there will be no help with the baby,” Merchant said. “What worries me the most is the uncertainty and our complete inability to plan ahead.”A. Pereira, meanwhile, says that with every extension of the travel ban, his dream life slips a little further out of his grasp. The 33-year-old spent five years applying for hospitality positions in Canada. He finally got a job as a restaurant manager late last year, his visa was approved in mid-March.“My employers have been quite understanding so far. But it is utterly frustrating,” he said.The Vande Bharat flights that bring Indians stranded abroad back to the country, are also offering seats on their return journeys provided the country permits entry. However, lesser seats on account of social distancing norms and a low frequency means customers like Pereira have faced an uphill task booking a seat. “The flights are too few. The seats are all gone within an hour of bookings opening. I have just had no luck so far,” he said.In Bengaluru, Nidhi Agarwal, 33, a finance consultant, has been stuck in limbo since end-March. She flew in from Dubai with her son Shlok Dani, 3, for her parents’ 40th wedding anniversary. She now has no idea when she will get back. Her son’s schooling has become another source of worry.“For now, he will attend classes online, but we don’t know if we will even be back in Dubai when schools reopen in September,” she said. Alifya Tarawala, 25, a quantitative researcher flew from Dubai to Mumbai on March 13 to marry a business-development manager. Their wedding, scheduled for March 28 was brought forward to March 20 and their plans to return to Dubai were put on hold. The newlyweds are here with only what they packed for their wedding. “None of us even has a laptop,” Tarawala said. Two weeks ago, Tarawala was put on unpaid leave. It’s a blow for the couple, who is still paying rent on a home in Dubai that they have never used, and a car that’s been lying idle since March.The Tarawalas are among over 2,000 members of a Facebook group called UAE Residents In India, who are now collectively pushing for a way back. The page, created by 27-year-old Dubai resident Mohit Mulchandani, is hoping to get the Indian government to allow carriers other than Air India to offer flights.“We’re writing to the Prime Minister’s Office; we’re filing RTIs, but the responses so far have offered nothing concrete,” Mulchandani, who has been stuck here since March 9, said. “My finances are being depleted. My office has been supportive thus far but we don’t know for how long.”Tarawala said that being able to turn to others in the same situation has helped keep her sane. “I’m bonding with my mother-in-law, so that’s a plus. But some days, I wake up and I can’t believe what’s happened,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/closed-borders-few-flights-leave-nris-struggling/story-Qw8xpi2qa6K6SFyBniAVdK.html
11-07-2020||India||SC refuses to change Cheque validity period for lockdown||The period of validity of cheques will not be affected due to the lockdown as the Supreme Court on Friday held that it would not interfere with the policy decision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) prescribing the cheque to be valid for three months.A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde stated in its order, “We do not consider it appropriate to interfere with the period specified by the RBI (for validity of cheque) as the entire banking system runs on the basis of the period specified.”In a suo moto petition, the court took up the period of limitation expiring under various laws that could possibly be hit due to the present Covid-19 situation across the country which had forced several parts of the country to come under lockdown. This prevented litigants from approaching the Court and physically file cases.Meanwhile, the court agreed to grant concessions under other statutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-change-cheque-validity-period-for-lockdown/story-6HzuGUTM6M8Inw7DYaH6xN.html
11-07-2020||India||SC notice on use of loud sounds to scare animals||Use of barbaric means like explosives and snares to ward off wild animals should be declared illegal and more stringent punishment should be prescribed for cruelty against animals, a plea before the Supreme Court said.The petition filed on June 11 in light of the death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala on May 27 after she ate a pineapple filled with firecrackers, also sought guidelines for the tracking of elephants in order to save them from cruelty and extinction.“It is quite a common practice to scare off wild animals or scare wild boars/Nilgai etc by using food stuff filled with crackers as bait as the damage caused by these animals at times is severe and there happens to be no means to stop it. The Forest Department across India has failed in this endeavour to protect the wildlife and humans due to a severe shortage of staff and lack of scientific measures being used by general populace [sic],” the plea filed by advocate Shubham Awasthi said.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde issued a notice to the central government and 13 states which have more than 50 elephants in the wild.On May 27, a pregnant elephant passed away in the Palakkad district of Kerala after she accidentally ate a pineapple filled with firecrackers which was meant for wild boars which destroy crops. The incident had led to outrage on social media.Subsequently, another incident came to light in June when a cow in Himachal Pradesh was injured in a similar incident involving crackers.“This shows that the usage of such snares is pan-India and affects wildlife across India,” the petition filed through advocate Vivek Narayan Sharma said.Awasthi prayed that vacancies in forest forces should be filled in a timely manner to ensure effective management and order in wildlife belts.Scientific and alternative measures should be devised to ward off wild animals which pose a threat to crops and humans, he added.“Order governments to introduce necessary amendments in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960 to enhance punishments by making it more stringent as per modern times”, the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-on-use-of-loud-sounds-to-scare-animals/story-IYi5tCvYvA8XHwpJoi9TqJ.html
11-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||It is likely that around 15% of Delhi’s population has already been infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).That is one of the preliminary findings of antibody tests administered to 22,823 people across all 11 districts of the Capital between June 27 and July 5. The Delhi government and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), which conducted the study, are yet to publish the results.Hindustan Times reported the preliminary findings on Friday.Even at 15%-plus or 15%-minus (the final number may be a few percentage points higher or lower) this would suggest that there is community transmission in Delhi, though I sometimes wonder why we continue to be obsessed with this. In a press briefing by the health ministry, the first in 28 days — once, they were as regular as this column — the issue came up and the ministry once again danced around it. We should simply stop asking the ministry about this; it’s like repeatedly asking Shahid Afridi his age.It was on the basis of antibody tests such as this that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late last month that only one in 10 cases in that country was being reported. Delhi, based on a similar extrapolation, would then be reporting only one in 30 cases. Assuming that the actual proportion isn’t 15% but 10%, it would still be reporting only one in 20 cases. That may sound excessive, but it is probably correct.We already know many people who are infected remain asymptomatic. How many? A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research based on around 40,000 people infected by Sars-CoV-2 puts the proportion at around 28% in India. The actual proportion may be much higher — I have seen international studies with numbers ranging from 45% to 78%.We also know that many infected people suffer mild symptoms, do not require hospitalisation, and recover, often even without any sort of medical intervention. A June study by the US CDC put the proportion of hospitalised patients at 14% of those infected (it covered 1.3 million Covid-19 patients), although this is more a measure of how many of the infected were admitted to a hospital as opposed to the number that needed to be.Given this, it isn’t surprising that 15% of Delhi’s population may have been exposed to the virus.On Friday, the New York Times reported, based on data from tester CityMD, which “administered 314,000 antibody tests in New York City... 26% of the tests came back positive”. In some neighbourhoods, some clinics turned in positive results as high as 56% and 68%, the report added. Both numbers are around the 60% that is widely accepted as the proportion of the population that needs to be infected for so-called herd immunity — a phenomenon where a virus or any other pathogen can’t infect too many people because it soon runs into someone who has already been infected, and is therefore immune, breaking the chain of infections.In one particular area of Delhi, HT reported, the proportion in the early sero-survey findings was as high as 25%. Still, at 15%, Delhi is far away from 60%, or even the 43% defined in an article in Science by researchers from the universities of Stockholm and Nottingham — but the number should also be seen as 15% of Delhi’s population now being immune (we still do not know how long this immunity will last).These people are potentially safe from a second wave, if and when one breaks, and also in a position to go out and do their thing without the fear of getting infected or passing on the infection to someone. Purely mathematically, it also means the Capital’s death rate is actually much lower (a little over 3%, based on the current numbers).Interestingly, the 15% number is higher than the 6% a similar study in France came up with and the 5% a study from Spain (reported earlier this week in The Lancet) did. The Spanish study used the low number to highlight the difficulty of achieving herd immunity — which means this is not going to be a disease that runs out of steam in the foreseeable future, but one that needs a vaccine.Delhi should do wider antibody testing (or sero survey, or serological study, as these are called) to better understand the real prevalence of the coronavirus disease. So should every other state. A high prevalence isn’t necessarily a bad thing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-iL9V5AjtcsSxFstzEKI2uN.html
11-07-2020||India||US to Haryana, backlash against migrants grows||International students in the US – there are at least 200,000 from India – might have to leave the country or risk deportation, if their universities shift to online-only mode. The US also suspended for this year the H1-B visa programme, used by a lot of skilled Indian workers, last month. Kuwait’s parliament has passed a bill putting quotas on the migrant population that could force 800,000 Indians to leave the country. And closer home, the Haryana government has issued an ordinance to reserve 75% private sector jobs for applicants from the state. All are clear signs that the pandemic, and the economic disruption it has inflicted, has added to the already growing backlash against free movement of labour across the world. At a time when India has also imbibed self-reliance as the cornerstone of post-pandemic recovery, there is a need to seriously examine the implications of such a sentiment.World Bank data shows that India received the highest amount of personal remittances, $ 83.1 billion, in 2019. This is more than combined amount received by Mexico and Philippines, countries ranked second and third that year. Net personal remittances, or remittances received after subtracting remittances paid, for India were $75.6 billion in 2019. These numbers have been continuously increasing. The net remittances received in 2019 amount to 2.6% of India’s GDP. To put this in perspective,the amount is more than double of what India spends on health. As is obvious, India will stand to lose the most if there is a major backlash against immigrant workers. (See Chart 1)  The importance of migrant workers in the Indian economy is not limited to those who cross international borders. The Economic Survey, an annual publication of the ministry of finance, estimated that almost a fourth of India’s workforce is made up of migrant workers. In their book “How Lives Change: Palanpur, India and Development Economics”, Himanshu, Peter Lanjouw and Nicholas Stern show that 70% of workers who left their villages for non-farm work travelled more than 50km . A third of such workers actually travelled at least 100km. A lot of them must have crossed state borders. A 2018 World Bank paper by Gaurav Nayyar and Kyoung Yang Kim found that migrant remittances had a share of 35% in Bihar’s gross state domestic product (GSDP) and positively affected consumption at the household level. Not all this migration is due to push factors, or poor income levels in states which send out migrants. Migrant-receiving states are equally dependent. Southern states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where population growth has slowed down considerably need more workers from states with high population growth to meet their labour requirements . While a lot of this migration is of unskilled workers, policies that hinder upward mobility for migrant workers are bound to create discontent. And the cascading effects of loss in remittance incomes will ultimately hurt demand in the country. Any blanket policy which reserves jobs for local residents will also have an adverse effect on the talent pool available to enterprises. Annual Survey of Industry (ASI) data shows that 40% of India’s industrial jobs were located in just three states - Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat. If factories located in these three states were to hire just locals, or mostly locals, they would miss out on the talent pool available to them. Any such policy will also have serious consequences for India’s IT industry, which is concentrated in a handful of cities. (See Chart 2) To be sure, the push for anti-immigrant policies has an objective basis. With economies in contraction mode across the globe, politicians are doing all they can to placate local workers, who are also voters. While such short-termism might be attractive at the moment, it can end up doing long term harm. Foreign students bring large amounts in tuition fees and a wealth of knowledge to the American higher education system. India’ rich states are critically dependent on migrants for a host of activities.Political temptation for counterproductive policies during times of economic crises is not new. Economies tried to hurt each others’ exports by trade barriers or competitive devaluation during the Great Depression of the 1930s. This is often referred to as a beggar-thy-neighbour policy. Because all countries replicated this, it only ended up worsening the situation. A century later, the world seems to have shifted from beggar-thy-neighbour to beggar-thy-neighbour’s worker.As the highest recipient of remittances, it is in India’s interest to lead the charge against such a mindset. Doing this will require coherence in international and domestic policies. Policies which institutionalise discrimination in dealing with migrant workers or state governments enacting legislations which exclude migrants from jobs are the opposite of what is required to demonstrate such coherence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-to-hry-backlash-against-migrants-grows/story-2tfsPY9HCYBQj9uIIGYxEM.html
11-07-2020||India||India may invite Oz for naval drill||India is close to taking a call on including Australia in the Malabar trilateral naval exercise involving Japan and the US, people familiar with developments said on Friday.The move would dovetail with last year’s upgrade of the Quadrilateral alliance or Quad – which groups India, Australia, Japan and the US – to the level of foreign ministers and greater convergence between the four countries on the Indo-Pacific, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.It will also be a natural progression to India and Australia elevating their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signing a crucial agreement for reciprocal access to military logistics during a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart Scott Morrison last month.The annual Malabar exercise began as a bilateral drill between India and the US in 1992, and was expanded with Japan’s inclusion in 2015. This year’s manoeuvres have been delayed by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and are expected to take place by the end of 2020, the people said.A decision on Australia’s inclusion will also include consultations with Japan and the US for their concurrence, the people added.Australia’s inclusion will lead to the exercise having more complexity and scope, though it could also rile China, especially at a time when Beijing’s differences with all four members of the Quad are in sharp focus.US leaders have said China’s aggressive stance along the border with China fits with a larger pattern of Chinese aggression in other parts of the world, while Japan is engaged in a row with China over Chinese vessels intruding into its territorial waters around the disputed Senkaku Islands. Japan has also backed India in the standoff with China, saying it opposes any “unilateral attempt to change the status quo” on the LAC.Prime Minister Morrison referred to the India-China standoff when he recently launched Australia’s 2020 Defence Strategic Update.During a virtual meeting between Morrison and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe on Thursday, the two leaders welcomed the inaugural Quad foreign ministerial meeting in September 2019 and reaffirmed their commitment to ongoing quadrilateral consultations.Morrison and Abe also “committed to continue to work together through various bilateral and plurilateral mechanisms, including the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue with the US and trilateral meetings with India”, according to a joint statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-may-invite-oz-for-naval-drill/story-UsfaAIIbGEJb4s5qC9H6aI.html
11-07-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine could be available by early next year: Parliamentary panel told||A vaccine for Covid-19 is expected only by early next year, a parliamentary panel was informed on Friday.Presentations were given by the Department of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the principal scientific adviser to the government before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Climate on the Centre’s Covid-19 preparedness. The panel is chaired by senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, who, along with six other members, attended the meeting.Sources said it was conveyed to the panel that a vaccine for Covid-19 could be available only by early next year.This was the first meeting of the panel since the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25.Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said the delay in the resumption of parliamentary committee meetings was forced by circumstances beyond control.“I am glad that Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committees have resumed functioning, three and half months since the last sitting of Parliament on March 23rd,” he wrote on Twitter.Naidu said everyone was keen on resumption of work by these committees, “but the delay was forced by circumstances beyond our control”.“Corona pandemic did cast a shadow on the working of these committees, which function on behalf of the Parliament,” the vice president said.Naidu said all possible measures were taken to enable the committee meetings by complying with the norms of social distancing, wearing of masks etc.“I am hopeful these committees would now go about examining important issues concerning respective domains,” he said.Urging Naidu for the holding of virtual meetings, Ramesh, in a tweet, said, “I would still request you Sir to allow virtual meetings given that Parliament is unlikely to meet for the next month at least.” The sources said the other members present at the meet also sought virtual deliberations.A detailed discussion was held at the meeting over the government’s preparedness and handling of Covid-19.“Our Parliamentary Standing Committee is having a most informative and useful meeting with @DBTIndia @IndiaDST @CSIR_IND & @PrinSciAdvGoI on the issue of Science & Technology & COVID-19. Too bad we are not allowed to have virtual meetings so that more MPs could have participated,” Ramesh wrote on Twitter.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs is scheduled to meet on July 15.While the members of the panels are demanding virtual meetings, the presiding officers of both Houses of Parliament have said this requires a change of rules and endorsement by the Rules Committee of Parliament as also a nod from Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-could-be-available-by-early-next-year-parliamentary-panel-told/story-mzctmSr7RxHKs7CqhpaDLO.html
11-07-2020||India||SC to consider social media bar as bail rule||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine whether prohibition on use of social media can be prescribed as a pre-condition for granting bail.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde issued a notice to Uttar Pradesh government while refusing to interfere with an order passed by the Allahabad high court on May 20 which granted bail to Congress leader Sachin Choudhary on the condition that he will not use social media. “What is wrong with an order asking you not to use social media? We don’t think it’s too onerous if a person’s participation on social media creates mischief. Why can’t the court say you don’t use the instrument which was used to cause mischief,” the bench remarked.UP police had filed an FIR against Choudhary on April 11 for various offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including sedition (section 124A) and promoting enmity between religious groups (section 153-A), and Disaster Management Act. The case was registered in connection with a press conference allegedly held by Choudhary in April questioning chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s handling of the pandemic.The Allahabad high court released him on bail while setting a slew of conditions.In his plea filed through advocate Keshav Ranjan, Choudhary maintained that he had only given a statement to media when they approached him. Choudhary also contested imposition of restrictions on use of social media as a condition for bail submitting that it is violative of freedom of speech under Article 19 of Constitution. The SC bench said that it will lay down a law regarding whether restrictions on social media can be imposed while granting bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-consider-social-media-bar-as-bail-rule/story-eYTMgGV4BglqvEsfJifTAO.html
11-07-2020||India||Govt scales up testing in containment zones||The Delhi government has issued fresh guidelines under which residents of containment zones who are identified as contacts of Covid-19 cases, people with influenza-like symptoms, and high-risk individuals will be tested thrice through rapid antigen kits within 15 days of sealing an area, senior government officials said on Friday.The order, issued by the director-general of health services, and which has been reviewed by HT, said that the same set of people, all of whom will be identified during the formation of a containment zone, will be screened and tested between the first and third day of sealing an area, then again between the fifth and seventh day, and, finally, once again, between the 13th and 15th day.“Their health records will be saved in a database and they shall be asked to visit the nearest antigen test centres. The objective of the strategy is to get a better picture in terms of local transmission so that the government’s ongoing testing efforts can be enhanced for better accuracy,” said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified. High-risk individuals include people aged above 60 years, pregnant women, those with severe acute respiratory illnesses and those with comorbidities, said health department officials.Dr Lalit Kant, former Head, Division of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research said, “By employing this strategy it will be possible to test as many people as possible who may have come in contact with the infected individual in the entire period in which they are capable of infecting others. By tracking, testing, and treating these people, it will allow early detection of disease thereby limiting further spread of the infection.”Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “Such a strategy can help the government in assessing the prevalence of the disease and get a better picture concerning local transmission so that testing drives in future can be better strategised for more accuracy.”The new guidelines came even as the number of containment zones in the Capital rose from 458 to 563 between Wednesday and Friday, with several existing ones being split , government data showed. This move is a part of the government’s new delineation strategy for containment zones under which Covid-19 clusters are identified within existing containment zones and they are divided into multiple units of no-go zones.The first round of the delineation strategy was implemented between June 26 and 28, and the number of containment zones in the city rose from 280 to 421. “The strategy has two objectives. First, fewer people remain in containment zones. It is a matter of inconvenience and the government acknowledges that. Second, smaller containment units allow for stronger and more focused surveillance efforts,” said an official in the revenue department who asked not to be named.Containment zones in Hari Nagar, Tilak Vihar, Badarpur, Sangam Vihar, Meet Nagar, GTB Nagar, Jahangirpuri, Mahendru Enclave, Alipur, Malkaganj and Pratap Nagar are among those that have been split under the government’s new delineation strategy. Kishore said, “However, it is high time that the Delhi government revisits its overall containment policy. Now that a large number of people are apparently adhering to home isolation norms on being diagnosed Covid-19 positive, the government may limit its policy to areas where it is absolutely necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-scales-up-testing-in-containment-zones/story-DgLwhAQRUn499By9oWG8EN.html
11-07-2020||India||Dispute persists, but India, China commit to disengage||India and China said on Friday they will push forward efforts aimed at complete disengagement and easing of tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), even as differences persisted between the two sides on issues such as Galwan Valley. In a separate but related development, the Chinese envoy to India called for maintaining peace along the disputed border until both sides found a “reasonable solution” and for a “win-win” bilateral relationship, but warned against measures aimed at “decoupling” the two economies. Following the third virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs since the standoff began in early May, both sides issued similarly worded statements focused on progress in the disengagement and de-escalation process that began last weekend after a phone call between the Special Representatives on the boundary issue – India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. People familiar with developments, speaking on condition of anonymity, drew a distinction between positions adopted by the two sides on contentious issues such as China’s claim on Galwan Valley, and the process of disengagement involving meetings of corps commanders and mechanisms such as WMCC.“This meeting of WMCC reviewed the progress in disengagement and de-escalation and agreed communications will continue. WMCC monitors the disengagement according to the roadmap drawn up by the military commanders, who are set to meet again next week,” said one of the people cited above.“The positions of the two sides on issues such as Galwan Valley haven’t changed. We have made it clear that we aren’t ceding any ground on such issues,” the person added. The Indian readout following the two-hour meeting of WMCC said both sides had reaffirmed they “will ensure complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC and de-escalation from...border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas in accordance with bilateral agreements and protocols”.The statement from China’s foreign ministry said both sides “fully affirmed the positive progress made by border defence forces of the two countries in implementing the consensus reached at the commander-level and easing the situation on the ground”. It added they will continue to properly handle issues and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity along the border and overall ties.Both sides said the disengagement and de-escalation process is in line with the agreement reached by the foreign ministers on June 17 and the Special Representatives during their phone conversation on July 5.The Indian readout further said the two sides had agreed it was essential to maintain “enduring peace and tranquility” along the border for overall development of bilateral ties. It added India and China had also agreed it “was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between senior [military] commanders”. As agreed by the Special Representatives, the corps commanders will “meet soon to discuss further steps so as to ensure complete disengagement and de-escalation in a timely manner”, the Indian statement said. The two sides also agreed to hold another meeting of WMCC in the near future.The Chinese statement also spoke about promoting the “further cooling of the situation on the ground”, strengthening confidence-building measures along the border and promptly handling issues to prevent differences becoming disputes.Friday’s WMCC meeting was co-chaired by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and director general Hong Liang of the boundary and oceanic affairs department of China’s foreign ministry. Shortly after the meeting, Chinese envoy to India, Sun Weidong, said that both countries need peace rather than confrontation, and should maintain peace along their disputed border until they find a “reasonable solution” to the complicated issue.Sun addressed calls from some quarters for “decoupling” of bilateral economic and trade relations and excluding “Made in China” goods, saying self-protection, non-tariff barriers and restrictive measures would be unfair to both Chinese enterprises and Indian consumers.He further said India and China need to build trust through mutual respect and treating each other as equals. The two sides should “respect and accommodate mutual core interests and major concerns” and adhere to the principle of non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.Sun made the remarks in a nearly 18-minute video posted on the Chinese embassy’s YouTube channel. The theme of his remarks was “Implement consensus and handle differences properly to bring China-India relations back on the right track”.His remarks focused on five points — India and China should be partners, rather than rivals; they need peace, rather than confrontation; they should pursue win-win cooperation instead of a zero-sum game; they need to build trust, rather than suspicion; and bilateral ties should move forward, rather than backward.“We need to seek convergence while putting aside differences and not impose one’s will on the other. We should honour our commitment, walk the talk, and ensure implementation of the leaders’ consensus in letter and in spirit,” Sun said.He also made several references to the age-old ties between the two countries and the consensus achieved through informal summits between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping since 2018.Referring to the phone conversation between the Special Representatives, Sun noted the two had agreed to prevent more incidents that undermine peace and tranquillity along the border.Sun acknowledged China and India have a “sensitive and complicated” boundary issue left over from history and said: “We need to find a fair and reasonable solution mutually acceptable through equal consultation and peaceful negotiation. Pending an ultimate settlement, we both agree to work together to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.”However, the envoy again sought to blame India for the violent clash at Galwan Valley on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and caused unspecified Chinese casualties. “The right and wrong of what recently happened at the Galwan Valley is very clear. China will firmly safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and ensure the peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” he said.A person familiar with developments said the Chinese envoy’s remarks acknowledged the importance of China-India ties. “He’s saying there is a larger relationship to take care of,” the person added.Experts, however, continued to be sceptical of China’s position on the border standoff.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “There is a glaring gap between the noble norms talked of by the Chinese envoy and the brutal actions of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). India’s focus remains the disengagement and de-escalation process by zeroing in on the implementation of the agreements reached so far.” He added that feedback from metros and towns across India reflected the increasing sentiments about restricting economic ties with China. “The People’s Liberation Army is effectively demolishing the business prospects of Huawei and other Chinese firms in India and elsewhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dispute-persists-but-india-china-commit-to-disengage/story-USy0lQ8gonULKagDqZGdaP.html
11-07-2020||India||Good cop, bad cop online: Interrogations go digital||It is 4 in the afternoon and two men arrested for snatching are brought to a room inside a police station in central Delhi. They are wanted in different cases of snatching and robbery in different police precincts. The two are asked to be seated and prepare for a video conference with a team of officers. On a computer screen are small square-shaped windows of police officers, who are ready to begin what is called a virtual interrogation.Law enforcement in times of the Covid-19 pandemic has often been demanding and unpredictable and sometimes ventured into the realm of the unknown. In the first two months of the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the disease, they were on the streets to ensure that people were following social distancing norms, and feeding the homeless and migrant workers, or in the police stations stitching face masks. Now that lockdown norms have been gradually eased and criminals have returned to their line of work, the police have introduced the concept of virtual interrogation, questioning criminals and witnesses over video conferencing to minimise physical contact with them. Senior officers have also started interacting with victims over video link. Delhi police officers say that in almost all cases, barring a few in which the suspects were hardcore criminals or weren’t forthcoming enough, they have adopted virtual interrogation. The move is working, senior Delhi police officers said, because unlike in the pre-Covid-19 days, top officers need not depend on juniors and can join questioning at the click of a button from their offices.It started last month, when 11 policemen tested Covid-19 positive after coming in contact with a carrier in central Delhi’s Anand Parbat. During a virtual meeting of senior officers at the police headquarters and district police chiefs from their offices across the city, an officer informed his bosses that the men had been infected after coming in contact with a 37-year-old man who had murdered his life. The top officers then decided that since they were already holding law and order meetings over video conference, they could do digitally question suspects and witnesses too.Joint commissioner of police (central range) Suvashish Chaudhary said virtual interrogation offers many benefits and is working well. “It saves time and ensures social distancing. Suppose we have arrested a snatcher, then the investigating officer (usually junior rank officers such as sub-inspectors) may ask him about his past cases. Someone like me is more interested in why that snatchers does the crime in a specific place or how he identifies his victim. Many times, depending on the profile of the criminal, we come together and hold joint virtual interrogation sessions.” Police said they had come across many cases where arrested suspects were from containment zones. Until July 9, Delhi had 562 containment zones across the city, where more than 350,000 residents live. The police have arrested more than 100 such residents from across the city in cases of snatching, robbery, theft and burglary. Such suspects were subsequently interrogated by senior officers virtually after initial questioning by juniors. Chaudhary said virtual interrogation was the best option when the suspects are from containment zones.“On June 8, our local police had arrested six men for snatching and robbery. Some of them such as Gopesh alias Gopi, 23, and Ashim alias Aslam, 25, were from containment zones in Anand Parbat. Instead of visiting the station and crowding to question those men, my seniors and I interrogated those men virtually. We managed to quiz them thoroughly and found their involvement in over 15 cases.”In the last two months, senior police have also started meeting victims and complainants over video conference. Until the lockdown, the meetings would take place at the offices of the senior police officers. Many senior officers of the rank of joint commissioner have started virtual meetings every morning. HT spoke to one city resident who had met senior officers of the central range when her daughter went missing. On June 16, the seven-year-old child had gone missing from her house in Patel Nagar. The woman, Rameeta Devi, was adamant on meeting senior officers.“They connected me to the DCP and the Joint CP. I explained to them how my daughter was unsafe. They assured me on the video call that they would find her. I remember that while I was talking to him, one of the officers was driving and was on his way to find my child. Luckily they found her,” said Devi adding that she has only met the top policemen who found her daughter online. “ After this pandemic is over, I will meet all of them in person and thank them,” she said. Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava said, “Adversities also present opportunities. We realised that in many cases, we could easily question the suspects virtually. There is better monitoring of the cases when the senior officers monitor the interrogation directly. We will follow this even after the pandemic is over. Following this and many others measures we have managed to minimise physical contact of our men on the ground and reduce the coronavirus cases (in the police department).”The police chief also said that the cases of police personnel testing positive are gradually coming down. Until July 9, 2,339 police personnel had tested positive for the coronavirus disease, of which 1,808 (77.29%) have recovered. There are around 80,000 men and women in the city police. As many as 12 Delhi police personnel have died of the disease, while 44 are admitted in hospitals. The rest are in home quarantine. An expert in policing matters, Prakash Singh, who headed Border Security Force(BSF) and the state police forces of Uttar Pradesh and Assam, said virtual interrogation was a good initiative that police had taken given the circumstances. “ It is the best possible solution at this times. Senior officers will not have to depend on their juniors. The monitoring is better. Besides a group of officers avoiding physical contact, if this is minimising the risk of many officers for one interrogation, it is a laudable move,” said Singh, whose petition led the Supreme Court issuing directions for police reforms in 2006.“Sometimes, coming in contact with such arrested persons could mean a serious risk. The high court and the Supreme Courts are already holding virtual court hearings. It is working fine, it seems. One needs to evolve and find the best possible solution in this pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-cop-bad-cop-online-interrogations-go-digital/story-qZythKUVDhoagUvLJBOQ2H.html
11-07-2020||India||Rapid tests begin at Delhi govt dispensaries||In a bid to bring more residents of the Capital under the testing net to check for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Delhi government on Thursday directed all its dispensaries and polyclinics to start rapid antigen testing and extend quick point-of-care testing to those living outside the 633 containment zones.Testing in the centres is likely to begin next week. Any resident can walk in for a Covid-19 test, and will require no documents or prescriptions. “We need to upload the data on an app that asks for valid phone numbers, so that’s all we ask for. We check whether the number is working right at the centre itself,” said a Delhi government official who asked not to be named.These will be in addition to at least 160 centres set up by the government to test those inside or in the vicinity of containment zones.“Our instructions were to increase the number of tests and testing centres from day one. The resident welfare organisations had also said centres closer to people’s homes would encourage them to get tested,” said a district official, on the condition of anonymity.The test kits need to be stored at below 30°C. As a result, over the next few days, dispensaries that did not have air-conditioning systems will get them, the Delhi government official quoted above said.The official said although several of the testing centres were initially started in schools, the government is trying to move away from them. “Schools are likely to reopen in some time, so the centres will have to be closed. These tests do not require any elaborate facility or bio-safety arrangements, and can be performed in a small room. We are in talks with several RWAs to just get small air-conditioned rooms close to societies where people can come and get tested. In some places, we are roping in mohalla clinics as well,” another district official said.Delhi has about 200 dispensaries and 25 polyclinics. There are around 450 mohalla clinics in the city.Outside containment zones, dispensaries and polyclinics will test those with influenza-like symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat. Those who have come in contact with confirmed Covid-19 patients will be tested.“The priority is to test those with symptoms and who have come in contact with other cases, or have co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. However, we have asked our staff not to refuse anyone who comes to the centre even if they have a mild suspicion. Earlier, when there were limited RT-PCR test kits, we had to refuse people. Now, we can test more people,” a third district official said.Manpower shortageTwo of the three dispensaries HT spoke to said they already had enough kits, but that a staff shortage was preventing testing from being scaled up. “We already have the kits because they are distributed from here to testing centres. However, our lab technicians are currently posted at these centres, so we do not know how to start testing here,” said a doctor from a dispensary in east Delhi.A doctor from a dispensary in south district said, “We have received notification about testing at the dispensaries, but there aren’t any detailed guidelines yet. The guidelines are likely to come in by Monday. We already have the kits with us as soon as we get some of our trained staff back or someone is posted we can start testing here.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-tests-begin-at-delhi-govt-dispensaries/story-PoClOUssOK3oBXlAQduERK.html
11-07-2020||India||Chinese JV among six bidders for Vande Bharat trains||Chinese joint venture company CRRC Pioneer Electric (India) Private Limited is among the only foreign bidders for the global tender floated for manufacturing 44 rakes of Vande Bharat trains.The JV was established jointly by China-cased CRRC Yongji Electric Co. Ltd. and Gurugram-based Pioneer Fil-med Private Limited in 2015. Indian railways’ Integral Coach Factory, Chennai had floated a tender for manufacturing 44 rakes or train sets of semi-high speed Vande Bharat trains on July 10.“We have got bids from six players for the tender,” Vinod Kumar Yadav, chairman, Railway Board, said on Friday.The other five bidders include state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Bharat Industries, Sangrur, Electrowaves Electronics (P) Ltd, MEDHA Servo Drives Private Limited, Powernetics Equipment India Private Limited, according to the railway ministry.This comes at a time when India and China are involved in a tense border stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. A brutal brawl in Galwan Valley on June 15 led to 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers dead. India has also decided to ban 59 apps, mostly with Chinese links.The Railways has also scrapped a tender for thermal cameras meant for ‘Covid surveillance’ after Indian firms alleged that the tender specifications favoured a Chinese company, Hindustan Times reported on July 1. In June, Railtel, the railways’ telecom arm, had issued a tender for thermal temperature screening AI-based surveillance cameras for assistance in Covid-19 surveillance. The government company has decided to issue a fresh tender after the controversy.The ambitious ‘Make in India’ project involves the manufacturing of 44 train sets comprising 16 coaches each for Vande Bharat. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had flagged off the maiden run of a Vande Bharat train on New Delhi -Varanasi route on February 15, 2019. The second such train service between New Delhi and Shri Mata Vaishnodevi Katra was flagged off by home minister Amit Shah on October 3, 2019. The Railway ministry last week also began the formal process to allow a private company to run trains on 109 routes -- a process that aims to, for the first time, open up one of the government’s most prominent enterprises that has in recent decades been outpaced by the demands of a rapidly growing economy.On whether Chinese firms will be allowed to bid for the private trains, Yadav had last week said, “As far as the question on Chinese companies arises, there are guidelines under the Make in India Policy by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and we will follow them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-jv-among-six-bidders-for-vande-bharat-trains/story-rQlg6aK7RLQBo8xdkLC1HK.html
11-07-2020||India||Trafficked, abused minor from Tripura rescued in Rajasthan||A 14-year-old girl from Tripura was trafficked, sold twice, raped multiple times, forcibly married off and had to undergo an abortion in a span of about four months beginning March, according to her statement to authorities in Rajasthan.The girl, who managed to escape from her in-laws’ house in Jhunjhunu on May 2, has been rescued. She has been staying at a shelter home since. The minor is expected to be taken back to her state by a team of the Tripura Commission for Protection of Child Rights next week.Her statement before a magistrate and a panel of the Rajasthan Commission for Protection of Child Rights on June 23 narrates her ordeal that began in her home district of Unakoti four months back and continued in Jhunjhunu, about 2,500km away from her home.According to her statement, she lived with her mother, four sisters and a brother. A Tripura child rights body official said her father died a few years ago and that the family was living in extreme poverty.In the statement, the girl said a neighbour told her family that he will marry her off to a good family. “My mother is very poor. My family agreed,” she said in the statement on June 23, a copy of which is with HT.For seven days, the neighbour kept the girl in Assam’s Silchar and she was “physically abused four times”, the minor said.The neighbour trafficked her to Delhi and sold her to a resident of Rajasthan’s Jhunjhunu in April. He then sold her to his neighbour for ~2 lakh, according to the girl. Later, the second person married her.Sangeeta Beniwal, the chairperson of the Rajasthan child rights body, said the girl was raped by her husband five times between April and May. “Her mother-in-law also harassed her for not understanding the local language and being slow with household chores,” Beniwal said.On May 2, the minor managed to escape from her husband’s house and hid in a nearby field, according to a Jhunjhunu police official. The husband filed a missing person’s report, saying his wife aged 20 years had gone missing.After police found her the next day, members of the Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) met her and suspected that she was much younger than the age mentioned in the complaint.The girl was kept in a government rehabilitation centre in Jhunjhunu and the district child rights body wrote to Tripura police for her details, Mandawa police station in-charge Mukesh Kumar said. The area where in-laws live falls under the Mandawa police jurisdiction.“The girl told us that she has been living here for three-four months and that she is a native of Tripura. She also told us that she doesn’t want to live with her in-laws after which we kept her in a shelter home of an NGO,” said a police official who did not want to be named.After the Tripura police sent the documents, it was found that she was just 14 years old. Her medical tests conducted on June 15 found that she was 11 weeks’ pregnant.On June 23, the girl told authorities she would go for an abortion, which was done on July 2, according to Beniwal.Police booked the two Jhunjhunu men for kidnapping, trafficking and rape. They were arrested and sent to jail. Police are also looking for the neighbour of the girl.The Tripura high court took suo motu (on its own) cognisance on June 17 and sought the state’s response on “appropriate ways to ensure the safety and security of the minor girl”.According to the Tripura government’s reply on July 6, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, and the child rights bodies in Tripura and Rajasthan were coordinating to reunite the girl with her family.“The state government will send a team to Rajasthan soon to bring back the girl,” Barnali Goswami, chairperson of Tripura Commission for Women, said.(With inputs from Priyanka Deb Burman in Agartala)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trafficked-abused-minor-from-tripura-rescued-in-rajasthan/story-qsuM5x9Bxq8LEoQLGnnsOK.html
11-07-2020||India||Taiwan names new envoy to India||Taiwan has named senior diplomat Baushuan Ger as its new representative to India while his predecessor Tien Chung-kwang has been promoted to the post of deputy foreign minister.Baushuan’s appointment was part of personnel changes announced by Taiwan’s foreign ministry on Thursday. Tien, who served as Taiwan’s representative to India for more than seven years, is expected to leave for home on Friday.However, Baushuan is expected to take up his post in India in September, people familiar with developments said. He is currently director-general of the department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs in Taiwan’s foreign ministry and has served in the US and the UK.Tien will replace Hsu Szu-chien as deputy foreign minister. Hsu has been appointed as deputy secretary-general of Taiwan’s National Security Council.“Not only does such an arrangement convey approval for Tien’s performance as Taiwan’s representative to India over the past seven years, but it also suggests that the relationship with India is likely to become one of Taiwan’s most important diplomatic priorities in the future,” Taiwan News portal reported on Thursday.Under the “One China policy”, India doesn’t have full and formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Taiwan established the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center (TECC) in New Delhi in 1995 as its government representative office in India.Besides promoting bilateral relations in economy, trade, investment, media and tourism, TECC has divisions for consular, economic, education science and technology activities that are responsible for advancing mutual interests between Taiwan and India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal.Amid the border standoff between India and China, several experts and commentators have called for New Delhi to upgrade its ties with Taipei.In a recent article for HT, Sana Hashmi, Taiwan Fellow at the Institute of International Relations, National Chengchi University, wrote: “India’s foreign policy priorities, particularly with regard to the Indo-Pacific, should accommodate Taiwan. Along with military preparedness and aligning interests with key countries, Taiwan needs to be included prominently in its long-term strategy towards China.”Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s New Southbound Policy, launched in 2016, aims to expand political, economic, and people-to-people linkages with countries such as India. Taiwan also cooperated with India during the Covid-19 pandemic, donating one million face masks to protect frontline medical personnel engaged in the fight against the Coronavirus.In a recent editorial headlined “Taiwan must stand with India”, the leading newspaper Taipei Times said the June 15 clash between Indian and Chinese troops “fits a pattern of Beijing’s increasingly aggressive expansionism in the region – which should also concern policymakers in Taiwan”.The editorial said: “The incident should be understood in the context of Beijing’s aggressive behaviour in the region, which has clearly become more frequent since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.”It added, “What motivates Chinese President Xi Jinping’s increased assertiveness in the region? This is a question that Taiwan, India and other regional nations must seek to answer... Taiwan should deepen ties with India, in particular economic, military and intelligence ties, to contain Chinese expansionism and put Xi back into his box.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taiwan-names-new-envoy-to-india/story-3G1YGPNXYw4UmGf2DtkoLN.html
11-07-2020||India||New rules: Printing of green cards in US scaled back||Indians holding or applying for green cards face a new anti-immigrant obstacle from the United States government. The US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) has scaled back the printing of the physical green cards, which identify the holder as a legal permanent US resident.By law, US permanent residents are legally required to carry the credit card-sized identity cards “at all times” and must show them when applying for jobs and when travelling. Indians received 10% of all green cards issued in 2019 and are the second-largest group of existing green-card holders. But 53% of all green card applicants are from India, a figure that has kept rising each year.A green card holder gets permanent resident status in the US and has the authorisation to stay and work in the country.The USCIS contract with the private printing firm that produces green cards expired in mid-June, reported the Washington Post. The USCIS was supposed to take over the printing itself but the agency’s financial difficulties forced it to reduce its output. There are two printing facilities for green cards. One in Kentucky has shut down. The other one, in Missouri, is operating at reduced capacity. There is a 50,000 shortfall in green cards, the USCIS said in a statement. The agency has asked the US Congress for an emergency $1.2 billion loan or else “all agency operations will be affected.”Even existing green card holders must get new identity cards every 10 years or if the card has been damaged or lost. Normally, green cards are printed within 48 hours of an applicant’s residency being approved.While the Trump administration has taken a number of anti-immigrant steps recently, including suspending new H and L visas and requiring students who are taking only online courses leave the country, it is not clear the printing problem is deliberate.However, USCIS’s financial difficulties are a direct result of Trump’s anti-immigrant policies. The agency is funded solely from the fees it earns from the services it provides. Thanks to President Donald Trump’s obsession with supposed immigrant fraud, much of the USCIS’s resources have been channelled towards trying to find such cases. This has led to the present financial crisis. The agency has reportedly warned that without the emergency funding it will have to reduce its workforce by three-quarters. The administration, says the Washington Post, has put up other bureaucratic hurdles to make life more difficult for immigrants including shutting down biometric data collection points and making intra-agency documents movement more difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-rules-printing-of-green-cards-in-us-scaled-back/story-a5CXJRVMTR9xZqP5L38DnJ.html
11-07-2020||India||Rajnath meets military brass, reviews situation||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday met the military brass and reviewed the border developments in eastern Ladakh, where Indian and Chinese armies are implementing a complex disengagement plan, officials familiar with the matter said. Singh held discussions with the chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs ahead of the fourth meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).“The meeting between the corps commander-ranked officers is likely to take place in three to four days,” said one of the officials cited above.The meeting is expected to focus on the critical Finger Area and the strategic Depsang plains, with a complex disengagement process that began after previous military talks on June 30 progressing smoothly in the Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra, as reported by HT on Friday.Tensions between the two countries escalated when 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on June 15. An undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers died in the violent face-off. The minister also spoke with US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper over the telephone and the conversation covered aspects related to bilateral military cooperation and the current border tensions with China, said a second official.While the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) pulled back 2km from Patrolling Point 14 (Galwan Valley) and PP-15 (Hot Springs) earlier this week, a similar retreat was completed at PP-17 (Gogra) on Thursday. The Indian Army, too, has pulled back proportionately from these friction areas and is closely monitoring PLA’s withdrawal.The army has observed some thinning of PLA troops, vehicles and removal of structures from the base of Finger 4 during the last three days but the PLA continues to hold ridge-line positions on the spur near Pangong Tso, the second official said.The Finger Area, which refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong lake, is expected to test the disengagement process. Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4 overlooking Indian deployments, the army would patrol right up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers 4 and 8 are 8km apart.The army is keeping a strict vigil on the Depsang sector, where the PLA’s forward presence is a matter of concern. A 2013 Chinese intrusion there blocked the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes.The defence minister also spoke with his South Korean counterpart, Jeong Kyeong-Doo, over the telephone and discussed regional security developments of mutual interest, a spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-meets-military-brass-reviews-situation/story-8L7NjmM53M9Jt3PFqJNDKL.html
11-07-2020||India||88 million visit Ayushman centres since February||Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) set up under the Centre’s flagship Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana have recorded 88 million footfalls since February 1 despite restrictions from late March on movement due to the lockdown imposed to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to Union health minister. They have played a key role in providing non-Covid services to patients within the community, he added.HWCs are the primary pillar of the flagship scheme that aims to provide universal and comprehensive primary health care. The government aims to set up 1,50,000 HWCs by converting some of the existing sub-health and primary health centres by 2022.Health checkups have been conducted at these grassroots-level centres and people screened and treated for hypertension, diabetes and certain cancers, according to the health ministry. Teams associated with the scheme have also helped local administrations in screening and conducting wellness sessions for migrants, who returned to their homes after losing jobs due to the Covid-19 lockdown, at quarantine centres.“Since there were teams deployed on the ground, it made sense to make use of the trained manpower to screen people housed at various quarantine centres set up at the peripheries of villages. This helped in assessing the health status of a large population base in a short span of time,” said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity.Nearly 14.1 million individuals were screened at the 41,000 centres across the country for hypertension, 11.3 million for diabetes and 13.4 million for oral, breast or cervical cancer, according to the ministry. Medicines were distributed at these centres among about 5,62,000 hypertension and 3,77,000 diabetes patients in June alone. From January to June, an additional 12,425 HWCs were made operational. The addition increased the number of these centres from 29,365 to 41,790, according to health ministry.“Having undertaken population-based screenings for non-communicable diseases, HWC teams already have a list of those with chronic disease and are able to rapidly screen individuals with co-morbidities and provide advice for protection against infection,” said a Union health ministry statement on Friday.HCW teams are also conducting immunisation and medical checkups of pregnant women and delivering essential medicines to tuberculosis, leprosy, hypertension and diabetic patients. “Health and Wellness Centres have demonstrated that creation of strong primary health care systems closer to the community is critical to the delivery of essential primary health care services to the community while also responding to the challenge of managing a pandemic,” the ministry added in the statement.The centres have also been creating awareness about measures such as frequent hand washing, wearing of masks and social distancing for preventing Covid-19 infections.Experts say establishing HCWs in villages is the best way to ensure health for all. “Historically, we have neglected primary health care, and by focusing on HCWs, now, it is a journey in the right direction to build positive health,” said CS Pandav, a former head of the community medicine department at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/88mn-visit-ayushman-centres-since-february/story-eimX28HpkrQUdu2ZdUmfzO.html
11-07-2020||India||Construction bids for new Parliament to close on July 14, work to begin after winter session||The pre-qualification bids to construct the new Parliament building, an integral part of the Central Vista’s redevelopment project, will close on July 14 and its construction is likely to begin after the Parliament’s winter session, officials aware of the development said.Earlier this month, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) began the process to select a firm to construct a new Parliament building which will come up adjacent to the existing Parliament.  CPWD invited pre-qualification bids in a two-bid system to construct the new building, which will comprise halls with greater seating capacity for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, a foyer, offices for members of Parliament, as well as a courtyard, dining facilities and a lounge for lawmakers. A Constitution gallery is also likely come up in the foyer. “The proposed work is of very prestigious nature and is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit of 21 months with the highest standards of quality and workmanship,” the bid document said.The bid document offered an estimated cost of Rs 889 crore, which it referred to as “a rough guide” to the project. It laid out strict eligibility criteria based on a firm’s past work — such as having built an assembly hall of minimum 1000 capacity and a building with a basement — as well as experience of ongoing projects, average monthly turnover, and net worth, among other factors. “The proposed new Parliament Building shall be of reinforced cement concrete framed structure building. The plinth of building shall match with plinth of existing building which is approximately 1.8 meter above the ground level,” the document stated.The ground plus two-storey triangular-shaped building with a built-up area of approximately 60,000 metre square, is set to come up on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate, which currently houses a reception, boundary walls and other temporary structures. The current Parliament building, which is over 90 years old, will continue to house the famed Parliament library and function in tandem with the new Parliament.“The construction work will begin post the Parliament’s winter session. It is expected to be completed by end of the year 2022,” said Bimal Patel, managing director of HCP Design, Planning And Management Private Limited, the architecture firm which won the bid for the redesign of Central Vista last year.The bid document also specified that 50% of the workers will need to be skilled for work of stone masonry, carving, fresco, furniture, and adequate health and safety measures would need to be taken in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.The purpose of prequalification is to assess the technical and managerial competency and financial soundness of the interested bidder. CPWD, which is the project implementation arm of the ministry of housing and urban affairs, specified that existing Parliament building shall continue to function during the entire period of execution of this project.“The existing Parliament Building shall continue to function during the entire period of execution of this project, therefore utmost care is required to minimise construction noise, dust free area and other construction activity related issues,” the document stated. “The contractor may have to execute the work in three shifts with large man power of workers, supervisors and professional engineers” the bid document said. “In view of high degree of security concerns at site and the work itself, stringent access control measures shall be exercised for entry and exit of manpower, material and construction equipment,” it stated.The plan to build a new parliament building had received two key approvals, including from the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee, towards the end of April. The proposal was also cleared by the Central Vista committee.On July 1, the new Parliament building also got the nod of the Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC), which had sought a revised building plan and made suggestions such as incorporating public art along the fencing and the gates of the Parliament complex. It further noted that the height of the building along the periphery of the boundary wall should be up to 3.6 meters “so as to ensure that the new Parliament building is visible from the adjoining roads and presents an aesthetically pleasing street picture.”“The suggestions made by DUAC have been taken into account and necessary changes have been made. More detailed plans will be made as the project progresses. Plans for incorporation of public art will also be detailed out,” Patel said. The new Parliament complex, which has an earlier deadline of 2022 under the Central Vista redevelopment plan, will be among the first plans to be finalised and tendered out.The redevelopment will also see North and South Block turning into a museum as well as new administrative offices with an underground metro on either side of the avenue.On January 21, Hindustan Times reported that the new Lok Sabha hall would be big enough to house up to 1,350 parliamentarians for joint sessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/construction-bids-for-new-house-to-close-on-july-14/story-cPxZ4BVQCN1IafqxwO9yML.html
11-07-2020||India||We need to allow testing for all: Adar Poonawalla||Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of the Serum Institute of India and president of the Vaccine Manufacturers’ Association of India, spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the timelines for vaccine development, the plan to begin production of some of the candidates, the low rate of testing in India, and the need to end stigma around a region where cases spike. Edited excerpts:Everyone is tracking vaccine development closely. Is it true that you plan to begin production of the candidates as early as next month?Yes, we have to start manufacturing some of these candidates at risk because if the world wants hundreds of millions of doses, we need to start by August-September. We’ve planned that, and we are planning to start manufacturing when we apply for Phase 3 of clinical trial permissions, which should be in the first week of August. That’s the plan. Of course, there’s risk-taking in everything, and this is where we have chosen to put in a lot of our investment both in the opex (operating expenditure) and the capex (capital expenditure) -- so that we have a dedicated facility, so that we can procure all the raw materials, and glass vials which we have already done. There’s the risk that if it doesn’t work out, we’ve got to go on to the next candidate, and the next candidate, and so on. We’ve got five different partnerships at the moment, including two of our own candidates, so I’m sure something will eventually work. But we shouldn’t be in a rush, we should take our time and make sure that the vaccine that we launch is safe and effective.ALSO WATCH | On The Record: ‘10 million tests till now is a joke,’ says Adar PoonawallaBefore we get to that bit of safety, can you explain the timeline a bit more about when vaccine will be ready for India’s billion-plus population?As I said, rolling out the vaccine, reaching everyone in India, is probably going to take more than a year, even from December. So we are talking about a year-and-a-half at least. We are talking about reaching parts of the country that are very difficult to reach, and even if we assume that people are going to come from rural parts to cities to get vaccinated, I don’t know how that whole plan is going to pan out. So up to two years provided the vaccine trials succeed and work. That’s the main “if”. After that, we can calculate how much time it will take, but the way the disease is spreading -- 70-80% are asymptomatic, which means you are not really having very detrimental symptoms, severity of the disease is not so bad in most healthy individuals. A lot of people will get the disease way before the vaccine comes about, I think in the US, roughly 1% of people have got it. That’s visible because of the amount of testing they are doing, and I’ve said if you increase the testing in India, you’ll see something similar coming about where 2-3% of the population by the end of the year will have it. And in 3-4 years, maybe 20-30% of the population would have got the disease and have recovered.The ICMR DG’s letter on a vaccine by August 15 created a storm. What did you make of the episode?I think the letter was misconstrued. I think they were trying to expedite things that the government is expected to do -- and they are doing a fabulous job about it. It got jumbled up, but nobody’s trying to cut corners. The whole vaccine industry is standing together to say we will conduct all Phase 1 and 2 and 3 trials, and even ICMR wants us to do that. They also want to adhere to global standards. What’s happened is a lesson that everybody’s learnt -- let us all be patient and wait for trials of drugs and vaccines to happen. After that happens, then we can come to a conclusion and give recommendations of what can be given to the public. We’ve just marked the milestone of 10 million tests in India. You’re not satisfied by that?No, I think that’s a joke. I think it should be 100 million, because if you look at our population, and if you look at other countries and the amount of testing they have done, it is way more. I think as the labs are gearing up, we certainly have the technology and the capability in India to do it. I believe in Mumbai you no longer need a doctor’s certificate to get tested. In a workplace, say you have a couple of hundred employees, you should be able to test everyone so that you feel safe and they feel safe coming back to work. We need to allow free testing, not in terms of price, but without doctor’s certificate or other such documents. The pricing of the test is very reasonable and affordable. We have picked up a lot, every week we are increasing and I think we are going in the right direction. Initially there were limitations to testing but now that’s no longer the case. Are there apprehensions that some states are not testing enough because of what the numbers will say about their Covid-19 management?Initially it was true, but very soon, whether it is at a country level or state level, where they compare with other states or countries to see the number of cases, I don’t think anybody’s going to care. Because there is going to be no shame in a state or a country that has got these cases, because this is something out of anyone’s control; you can’t stop it. You can mitigate it, you can take measures -- everyone’s wearing masks, taking precautions, but you can’t hold it back beyond a point, so there’s no shame. As soon as countries realise that, and the individual states realise that, there is no competition, and no shame, politics doesn’t come in the way of the science. With testing, you can isolate areas, you can isolate people, you can actually prevent more damage by testing more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-need-to-allow-testing-for-all-adar-poonawalla/story-ecBYZ9RUFaUOszxZ6RajNO.html
11-07-2020||India||UPSC may reimburse airfare to aspirants||New Delhi: Around 700 candidates, who have cleared their preliminary and main civil services examinations, are likely to get airfare reimbursements for their travel to Delhi for interviews and medical examinations to complete the annual selection process, officials familiar with the matter said. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), which conducts the examinations, usually reimburses railway fares for shortlisted candidates. It is in consultations with the department of personnel and training (DoPT) for refunding airfares given the Covid-19 pandemic and a shortage of trains. Shortlisted candidates travel to Delhi for their interviews and medical examinations before the selection process is concluded. The preliminary and main examinations were held in June and September last year. Some interviews, too, were conducted in Delhi in March when the process was suspended in view of the pandemic and the nationwide lockdown imposed to check its spread. In some cases, interviews have been held while medical examinations are pending.“We are still discussing the modalities...,” a DoPT official said on condition of anonymity. The official added they were also considering hospitals that can conduct medical examinations in states for the candidates whose interviews have been done. “The idea is to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in case of aspirants, who have appeared for their interviews... [they should not have] to travel to Delhi again just for their medical examinations.”The DoPT has in consultation with UPSC shortlisted six hospitals in Delhi for conducting the medical examinations scheduled from July 21 to August 4. Initially, nine hospitals were shortlisted. The number was reduced to six after some of the facilities were declared Covid-19 hospitals. The DoPT official said around 50-60 candidates daily would undergo medical examinations. The interviews are scheduled from July 20 to 30, according to UPSC. “Ten days have been slotted for the interviews... around 700 candidates will be appearing for them,” a UPSC official said.A 26-year-old who is among those who have cleared their main examination said coming to Delhi from Hyderabad will amount to risking contracting Covid-19. She added many like her will prefer to undergo medical examinations in their states.Former Indian Administrative Services officer, BS Baswan, called the idea of airfare reimbursements a creditable one. “This is an understandable decision. Although UPSC releases the reimbursement funds, the budget allocation is done by the DoPT.” Baswan said DoPT can allocate funds under the All India Services Residuary Matters Rules, 1960. “Exceptions can be made in case of an emergency,” Baswan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upsc-may-reimburse-airfare-to-aspirants/story-mobBiAurab2tQ8Nvy4Er0K.html
11-07-2020||India||Lab-made antibody trials show promise||A lab-made cocktail of antibodies has entered late-stage clinical trials in the US to evaluate its ability to prevent and treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has infected at least 12.5 million people and killed around 560,00 of them worldwide since December.The US biotechnology firm Regeneron announced the start of its Phase 3 experimental monoclonal antibody cocktail REGN-COV2 against Covid-19 this week in collaboration is the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The late phase trial will assess its ability to prevent infection among close contacts of infected people, such as family members.Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made proteins that act like natural antibodies and work by identifying and binding to the virus to destroy it. They are currently being used to treat several diseases and conditions, including cancers, asthma, Crohn’s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.REGN-COV2’s two antibodies bind non-competitively to the critical receptor binding domain of the virus’s spike protein to prevent infection.REGN-COV2 has also moved into the Phase 2/3 portion of two adaptive Phase 1/2/3 trials testing the cocktail’s ability to treat hospitalised and non-hospitalised (ambulatory) patients with Covid-19. These trials will involve 1,850 hospitalised patients and 1,050 ambulatory patients at 150 sites in the US, Brazil, Mexico and Chile. The preliminary data expected later this summer, according to Regeneron.“We are running simultaneous adaptive trials in order to move as quickly as possible to provide a potential solution to prevent and treat Covid-19 infections, even in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic,” Dr George D. Yancopoulos, co-founder, president and chief scientific officer of Regeneron, said in the company’s news release.Regeneron’s antibody cocktail will be tested in four separate study populations, which included hospitalised Covid-19 patients; people with mild disease; healthy people at a high risk for getting infected; and healthy people who have come into close contact with a person who is sick.US-based pharma giant Eli Lilly and Canada-based AbCellera have also started testing their antibody treatment in humans June 1.Multi-centric studies to evaluate the off-label use of the anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody drug Tocilizumab to treat Covid-19 began in India last month. This second-line drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and works by lowering aberrant host immune response that leads to inflammatory cytokine storm and death in hospitalised Covid-19 patients. Inflammatory cytokine storm stops oxygenation by impeding gas exchange in the lungs, leading to death.“Tocilizumab is already available, licenced and effective in treating cytokine release syndrome caused by other conditions. The Covid-19 trial is going well, the recruitment is at the halfway mark within a month. We have recruited around 90 of the 180 patients for treatment across 14 hospitals in 10 cities, and hope to complete recruitment by the end of July and get initial data by August 15,” said Dr Arvinder Soin, national lead, Indian multi-centre trial on Tocilizumab in moderate and severe Covid-19.The trial will be conducted in several hospitals in Delhi-NCR, Haryana, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. “Off-label use for Tocilizumab is approved for moderate to severe patients whose condition is worsening, and the trial is an attempt to evaluate whether the drug will also prevent the progression of stable moderate disease to severe Covid-19 needing oxygen or ventilator,” said Dr Soin, who is also chairman, Medanta Liver Institute, Medanta, Gurugram.“The trial will show if it works or not. I think we should give science a chance to provide evidence-based data, so that we can ensure fair access to all to the most effective treatments against Covid-19,” said Dr Soin.Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody trials will be a part of the NIAID’s newly launched Covid-19 Prevention Trials Network (COVPN) to test vaccines and other treatments against Covid-19 through the merger of four previously existing clinical trials networks that focused on HIV/Aids. COVPN is a functional unit of Operation Warp Speed, the US federal partnership focused on speeding the development and delivery of COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine, which was developed jointly with NIAID, is expected to be tested in the first phase 3 clinical trial conducted through COVPN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lab-made-antibody-trials-show-promise/story-GQDrmNUmTWkSLJ4RPVQKfN.html
11-07-2020||India||Vikas Dubey encounter brings politics-crime link under lens||In the mid-1980s, two independent candidates, Hari Shakar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi, walked into the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha straight from jail. They had comfortably won their seats with the tacit support of the Congress.Tiwari was lodged in Agra jail and Shahi in Fatehgarh, hundreds of km away from their electoral arena in Maharajganj of east UP,. While Shahi was gunned down later in the 1990s, Tiwari continued his winning spree, becoming a minister in various governments.The trendsetters belonged to the two castes – Brahmins and Thakurs -- that had dominated the electoral politics of the state till Mayawati, Kalyan Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav emerged in the 1990s.But two constants remained. One, candidates with criminal antecedents continued to win elections . Some criminals fought as independent candidates, others as official nominees of the political parties. Two, all the criminals were self-styled Robin Hoods with similar career trajectories: a small begining by bullying or befriending cops at the local level and helping people out by funding weddings; building their empire with support from local politicians; living in huge safe bungalows with luxurious vehicles and protected by an army of supporters; and creating an aura of terror. Money came from lucrative contract business -- basically, they got a cut off everything. Over the decades, politicians and governments turned a blind eye to the growing influence of such gangsters -- instead tapping them for this very influence during elections . And people knocked on their doors as governments failed to redress their grievances.No government or leader could ignore them -- or their power and influence. Former BJP chief minister Kalyan Singh, a tough administrator, included Raguraj Pratap Singh in his government in 1998. Raghuraj Singh was on the run till his swearing in Raj Bhawan. The Samajwadi Party’s Mulayam Singh Yadav formed a government in 2003 and included Singh in it. The recommendations of the Election Commission were thrown to the wind in the distribution of tickets. Winnability became the prime factor in selection of candidates. In 2017 as many as 143 out of 403 members of the Vidhan Sabha had criminal cases against them. Interestingly, some do fall out of the favour.Mukhtar Ansari , a five time MLA and former MP Atiq Ahmad, are facing the heat under the present dispensation with CM Yogi Adityanath out to demolish their empires . Raghuraj Pratap Singh and his father were hounded by Mayawati and are currently lying low. Like many others, the Singhs are connected to every party. DP Yadav who ruled the roost in west UP was denied ticket by Akhilesh Yadav in 2012. He has been languishing in the backwaters.Prof DNS Yadav of Lucknow University says: “ Politicization of criminals started during Indira Gandhi days when parties started taking their help to win elections. Thereafter started criminalization of politics - instead of supporting candidates, criminals decided to themselves contest and win elections.”Vikas Dubey, too, had a huge following, especially in his caste group (he is a Brahmin) but he did not contest elections. He took membership of BSP in 1996 but could never get a ticket to contest. He was convicted in a murder case. But his wife is independent member of zila panchayat, an indication of his clout. The empire that he built would not have been possible without the support of the administration; Dubey had 60 criminal cases against him and had been convicted in a murder case.Former DGP and chief of UP Election Watch, I C Dewedi told HT once that “the leaders of mainstream political parties talk of clean and crime-free politics but to win elections they give tickets to criminals with money and muscle power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/politics-crime-link-under-lens/story-OOKqFETjnJcZmjgggjGd9J.html
11-07-2020||India||Encounter killings violate rule of law, says plea in SC||Killing of accused by police under the garb of encounter is a serious violation of the rule of law and amounts to “Talibanisation of the country”, a plea filed before the Supreme Court said on Friday, while seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the encounter killings of Uttar Pradesh gangster Vikas Dubey’s aides.The plea was filed by Mumbai-based advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay hours before Dubey himself was killed after he allegedly tried to escape from police custody on Friday morning. The plea raised concerns that Dubey, too, would suffer the same fate.“...there is every possibility that even accused Vikas Dubey shall be killed by Uttar Pradesh Police like other co-accused once his custody is obtained by Uttar Pradesh Police,” the petition stated.Besides seeking a CBI probe into the killings of the co-accused, Upadhyay also prayed that adequate security should be provided for Dubey so that he can be dealt with as per law.Apart from Dubey, five people from his gang been killed in separate encounters in Kanpur, Etawah and Hamirpur.Upadhyay likened encounter killings to what is depicted in the cop movie “Singham”.“A new tendency is now gaining ground in the rank and file of police machinery of arresting the accused alleged to be involved in heinous crimes and then killing the accused under the guise of encounter and then becoming movie cop ‘Singham’. (It) needs to be nipped in the bud at the earliest to save the country from becoming Taliban,” the plea said.Dubey was killed near Kanpur on Friday morning. The gangster was being brought back by the UP Police from Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, where he was arrested a day ago. Dubey had been on the run since the killing of eight policemen by his men in Bikru village near Kanpur city on July 3. “Though it cannot be denied the act of the accused of killing eight policemen is extremely heinous crime, yet the accused were required to be dealt with as per law and upon their guilt being proved after full-fledged trial, they could have been convicted even for death sentence,” Upadhyay’s petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/encounter-killings-violate-rule-of-law-says-plea-in-sc/story-8Lj3mo7ZvgJZG7WEThqixM.html
11-07-2020||India||Questions mark close encounter||Retired police officials, experts and human rights activists have said that Vikas Dubey’s death on Friday morning raises disturbing questions about the procedures followed by the Uttar Pradesh (UP) police; casts a shadow on its integrity and professionalism; points to the existence of a “strong lobby” which did not want to see him alive; and undermines potential investigations into the larger political-crime nexus in the state. They have also demanded an independent probe, and possibly a judicial enquiry, into the killing. Dubey was arrested in Ujjain on Thursday, and then taken by the UP police back to his home town of Kanpur, when on Friday morning, the police alleged that he sought to escape when the car transporting him overturned and was killed in an “encounter”. A former director general in the Kerala Police, NC Asthana, said he could point to glaring loopholes in the police’s story about the sequence of events. “The car overturned but one cannot see any skid marks near the vehicle. The street was wet but there were no skid marks. It is impossible that Dubey was the first person to be able to come out of the car after it overturned. Were there police officers inside the car? Why did the police not handcuff him if he was a notorious gangster? Also, why would Dubey try to flee in a place where there were only open fields all around? And above all Dubey’s mask was intact despite the accident, running and the shootout.”Asthana said that the story was somewhat similar in the case of Dubey’s associates, who too were shot dead. “Even they supposedly took the police’s weapons while fleeing. All this casts a shadow on the work of the UP police.” He added that the UP police had lost a great opportunity in getting Dubey convicted for the murder of the eight policemen. “His conviction would have set an example but all that is gone now.”Prakash Singh, who was the chief of the UP police between 1991 and 1993, and has been a key votary of police reforms, said he could not comment if the shootout was staged or genuine but expressed disappointment over the police’s handling of the case. “I am disappointed. Even if the encounter was genuine, let me say that there should have been no need for a shootout. Why was he not brought on a flight? He would have been a mine of information on the nexus between criminals, police and the powers that be.” Singh added that he had a feeling that there was a “strong lobby” within both the government, and the Opposition too, that did not want Dubey alive. “But I do not know. There could be a possibility (that he was killed in a genuine encounter). But what happened today was unfortunate and disappointing.”Human rights lawyers and activists too expressed their concern at the incident, but also pointed to the larger pattern of custodial violence, extra judicial killings and lack of accountability of the police, and demanded a probe. Sanjoy Hazarika, international director of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, said that Dubey could have given valuable evidence to unearth the nexus between police, criminals and the powers that shielded him. “What happened on Friday morning is the stuff of reel life. There needs to be a detailed accounting of the events from the time of his arrest to his death. The details of the post-mortem report need to be published and the National Human Rights Commission needs to move quickly on this case asking for accountability. It has raised key issues of due process and custodial violence.”Colin Gonsalves, a lawyer who has fought a range of human rights cases and is the founder of the Human Rights Law Network, said that under the Code of Criminal Procedure section 176(1)(A), a judicial enquiry should be conducted to find out what led to Dubey’s death. “The law is clear. The enquiry must be held by a judicial magistrate and not an executive magistrate or special investigation team. Has an judicial magistrate been appointed to look into it? The facts point out towards an extra judicial killing.” He emphasised that the UP government must follow the law and probe the chain of events because if a person had been killed in police custody, then it was a “heinous crime”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/questions-mark-close-encounter/story-oxlYI2be6c1IqehlMntpYI.html
11-07-2020||India||HT Salutes: His mission is menstrual hygiene of migrant women||Amid the migrant crisis, the one thing Kiran Soans thought about was whether the women, who were undertaking the long and arduous journey back home on road, had any access to sanitary hygiene products. Even for those who stayed back in the cities of work, the absence of income would have meant reduced access to sanitary napkins.“So we thought about it and started looking for someone who could provide sanitary napkins,” said Bengaluru-based Soans (44) who heads an event management company called Goldrush Entertainment. “And it struck us, why not just make them ourselves? We could employ women daily wage earners, teach them how to make the pads, and then hand the pads out free.”At the beginning of the lockdown, in March, Soans launched an initiative called World Hunger Warriors. His aim was to connect people in his extensive network who wanted to donate funds, food, cooking equipment, space, ingredients, fuel or labour.Watch | HT Salutes: Bangalore initiative that helps women make reusable sanitary pads He now has a network of 50 apartment kitchens and four commercial kitchens making the food and over 100 volunteers hand out cooked meals to migrant workers and other underprivileged people in Bengaluru. It was through this network that he heard of the urgent need for sanitary pads.Searching for companies that manufactured reusable pads, he stumbled upon Stonesoup, and reached out. He didn’t want to buy their product, he told them. But could they help him figure out how he could make his own?Stonesoup agreed to help. The design the two settled on was a durable, washable waterproof jacket, to be provided by the company; the women would make the cotton cloth inserts. Each jacket would be handed out with a set of five inserts. The whole thing could be washed, sunned and reused multiple times.“We settled on this design because the washable inserts look like regular cloth napkins and can be hung out to dry in the sun without stigma attached,” Soans said.WHW now works with 50 women in Yelahanka and Sarjapur, most of whom previously worked on construction sites. Soans sources korra cotton from local traders and the women, with a little training, have begun production. They call the pads Shaktipack.It’s a relatively slow process, since quality checks take time, but since the end of April, the women have made 200 Shaktipack pads; 55 were distributed on July 1. “We use our production units in Dindigul for the leakproof jackets, because those require machines to put together, but the inserts are easy to hand-stitch,” says Smita Kulkarni, co-founder of Stonesoup. “It feels like a great way to be involved.”Sheela Manu, 26, a construction site labourer who has used the pad, said she prefers them to the low-cost disposable ones she had been using. “These are more comfortable, especially in summer,” she added.WHW has started a fundraising campaign on crowd-sourcing website, Ketto.org, called ‘ShaktiPack4Women’ to raise money that would enable them to employ 500 women and make over 5,000 sanitary.“The women say the pads are comfortable and give them security. We hope the campaign works out and we find a way to continue this into the future,” Soans said.Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you 15 stories of HT Salutes.

11-07-2020||India||Dangerous dependence on China: House panel||The parliamentary panel on science and technology, in its first meeting since the Covid-19 outbreak, on Friday discussed the “dangerous dependence” on key Chinese imports in domestic pharma industry and the urgent need to get rid of these imports, functionaries familiar with the matter said.The Jairam Ramesh-led panel also discussed how making a vaccine for the pathogen before August 15 would “not be possible anywhere in the world” — a reference to a letter last week by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that suggested this possibility but later clarified it as a motivator of innovation, and not as a hard deadline.The meeting, which lasted more than three hours and included inputs from top scientific minds, also discussed the need to produce low-cost health equipment including ventilators, which are in high demand in the wake of the pandemic.Though only six out of 30 members could attend the meeting, the department of biotechnology, science and technology and the Prime Minister’s principal scientific adviser, K VijayRaghavan, gave presentations to the committee on India’s Covid-19 preparedness. “The focus was vaccines, drugs, pharmaceuticals and health equipment,” said a member of the panel.The focus on pharmaceutical imports from China assumes significance in the backdrop of the bloody clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Galwan Valley on June 15. Over the past few weeks, New Delhi has taken a series of measures to curb Chinese investments and contracts.In a written reply to Parliament last year, the government had said that from 20016 to 2019, more than 65% of India imports of bulk drugs and drug intermediates came from China. Replying to Trinamool Congress’s Mala Roy, the chemicals and fertilizer ministry had also said that “imports from China are due to economic considerations”, indicating that they were available at cheaper rates.According to a member of the panel who was present in the meeting, the “urgent need for research and development efforts to rid ourselves of Chinese dependence was also discussed threadbare”.In the discussion on an India-made vaccine, the panel members felt that if a vaccine has to come before August 15, it would mean that trials, tests and safety protocols would’ve been short-circuited.There was also a discussion on how India can make more affordable medical equipment, especially ventilators at a price range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. Functionaries also said that panel chairman, Jairam Ramesh, pointed out that “health security is as critical as defence security”.Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, who often faced demands from MPs for online meetings in recent weeks, said he was glad that standing committees under the Rajya Sabha have resumed functioning.“The corona pandemic did cast a shadow on the working of these committees, which function on behalf of Parliament. All concerned were keen about the resumption of work by these committees. But the delay was forced by circumstances beyond our control,” he said.He added that committee on home affairs, also under the Rajya Sabha, will meet next week after an earlier meeting could not be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dangerous-dependence-on-china-house-panel/story-Cuh4vOBG7kpP6Y3erCsIDJ.html
11-07-2020||India||Laying fibre cable tops PM’s job plan||An unusual but necessary and apt (given the times) activity has emerged the source of the most work in the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Yojna, the ambitious jobs-for-migrants scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 20 -- the laying of optic fibre cables. In the three weeks since its launch, the government has spent Rs 6,000 crore on the scheme on which it plans to spend a total of Rs 50,000 crore in 125 days, providing jobs to millions of daily wage workers who returned to homes in the Indian hinterland from cities in the wake of the coronavirus disease and the lockdown imposed to slow its spread. A total of 59.8 million days of work has been created across a bouquet of 25 schemes—clubbed to create the programme—in the three weeks, indicating, according to government officials who asked not to be named, the demand for work in rural areas. Of this, laying optic fibre cables generated the most work, and accounted for 93,390 activities (or work lots) according to government data. Details of how many man days this translated into were not immediately available. construction of houses for rural poor, which got off to a slow start, accounted for 64,756 activities. This comes at a time when a lot of daily activities have moved online, even in rural India, in the wake the coronavirus disease.The government estimates that at least 7.5 million migrant workers returned home due to the pandemic and the national lockdown. Policymakers scrambled to tweak plans and resources as rural India saw heavy demand for work while construction in some urban centres faced paucity of labourers. Demand for work under the goverment’s flagship rural guarantee scheme has soared. According to government data, 67.2 million individuals have already worked and 227,000 households have completed their entire quota of 100 days of work.The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Yojna was crafted last month to offer work to migrant labourers and, at the same time, focusing on key priorities. With around 60% of the workers having worked in the construction sector -- the government conducted a large survey to assess this -- the scheme was heavily loaded with similar opportunities.Interestingly, the data shows that two flagship schemes— the Jal Jeevan mission and Urja Ganga, —are yet to generate any work. While the Jal Jeevan mission aims to supply water to all houses, Urja Ganga aims to buid a piped network of cooking gas.The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Yojna and MGNREGA are the two major sources of jobs in rural India at this point in time. Together, they have a budget of Rs 2 lakh crore .Former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra said, “The rozgar scheme was envisaged to help migrant workers get livelihood in this crisis period. It is helpful but the ground reports suggest that many migrant workers are going back to their old workstations in cities and many of them are unwilling to take up hard manual work in rural areas. So, we may see a lot of existing workforce in villages taking up some of these works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/laying-fibre-cable-tops-pm-s-job-plan/story-QtLfhX0giUG2i4zJ0zIp8J.html
