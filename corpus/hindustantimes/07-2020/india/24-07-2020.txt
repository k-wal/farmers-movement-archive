24-07-2020||India||China figures in Rajnath’s call with Israel||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday spoke with his Israeli counterpart Lt Gen Benjamin Gantz over the telephone, with the strengthening of bilateral defence ties being the focus of the conversation. The conversation comes as India is making emergency purchases from several countries including Israel to bolster the military’s capabilities amid border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh. The border row was also discussed, officials said.“Both ministers expressed satisfaction at the progress of strategic cooperation between the two countries and discussed possibilities of further strengthening defence engagements,” the defence ministry said in a statement.Singh updated Gantz on the situation along the contested Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. India and China have lately failed to make a breakthrough in reducing border tensions despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels. The disengagement process at some friction points has virtually stopped, people familiar with the developments said.The border conflict has forced India to speed up the purchase of military hardware, including fighter jets, smart air-to-ground weapons, missiles, rockets, multi-mission drones, air defence systems, GPS-guided artillery ammunition, tank ammunition and even assault rifles. The US, Russia, France and Israel are among the countries that India plans to import the weaponry from.India is looking at sourcing from Israel the Firefly loitering ammunition, Spike anti-tank guided missiles, Spice guidance kits that can be mounted on standard bombs to convert them into smart weapons and an operational surface-to-air missile system. A 2017 order worth $2 billion for such advanced systems to take down hostile aircraft and missiles has not translated into deliveries yet, the officials said.Israel has been a reliable military partner and has stood by India, said Air Marshal KK Nohwar (retd), director-general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “Israel has always given us niche technologies in areas of electronic warfare systems and weapons systems that were not readily forthcoming from other countries,” Nohwar said.The government has authorised the armed forces to process cases for buying urgently-needed weapons and equipment worth up to ₹300 crore to meet their critical operational requirements. The decision was taken at a special meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council—India’ apex procurement body—on July 15 to fast-track key purchases.Singh sought greater participation of Israeli defence companies in the defence manufacturing sector under the new liberalised Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) regime, the statement cited above said.From raising FDI in defence manufacturing to creating a separate budget for buying locally-made military hardware and notifying a list of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported, the government in May announced a raft of measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector.In early July, the defence ministry approved the purchase of weapons and ammunition worth ₹38,900 crore. The cost of military hardware cleared for purchase from the domestic industry is pegged at ₹31,130 crore. The orders are expected to give a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-Reliant India Movement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-figures-in-rajnath-s-call-with-israel/story-BS8TTTQyczo1oEwYI2WxBM.html
24-07-2020||India||Odisha forest official dies of Covid-19, kin get test results after his death||The result of the swab test of a forest official in Odisha’s Covid-19 hotspot of Ganjam district was revealed at least 24 hours after he died, his family members have alleged.Basant Mohanty, a forest official from Bhanjanagar area of Ganjam gave his swab for a Covid-19 test on July 12, days after he started getting fever. While taking the swab, Mohanty was told that if he does not get any phone call on his registered number, then the test result can be deemed as negative.The forest official was, however, admitted to the ICU of the MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town of the district on July 19 after his condition turned serious. He passed away on July 21 at the hospital and was cremated on July 22 in the presence of family friends.On July 23 evening, Mohanty’s near and dear were however shocked when they received a call on his mobile to keep him ready as he had tested positive for Covid-19. “I thought someone was playing a prank on us. My father had passed away 2 days ago and we were getting calls to shift him to a Covid-19 hospital. I told the official at the other end about his death,” said his son Diganta Mohanty.The deceased forest official’s son said the callousness of the government was shocking. “If the government is claiming that it provides the swab test results in 3 days, why did they take 11 days in case of my father? Is this some kind of a joke,” he asked. “After my father was admitted to ICU, several family members visited him. After he died, at least 20 people in our locality had come. All of us now have been quarantined.”Bhanjanagar tehsildar Alok Pradhan said normally the swab test results are available within 3 days of collection of samples. “But in Mohanty’s case, we got it on 21st night. I don’t know why there was so much delay,” Pradhan said.Two days ago, an additional district magistrate of a Covid-19 hotspot district had passed away before his swab test results returned positive. The initial swab test reports of Gajapati ADM Karunakar Raika had come negative in antigen and Truenat tests, but the RT-PCR test of his swab after his death came positive. Ganjam on Friday reported a record 732 cases taking the total to 7,634 cases in the district. Incidentally, all the 732 cases reported today were outside quarantine centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-forest-official-dies-of-covid-19-kin-get-test-results-after-his-death/story-hq3UJixdr1GnLIq0BxQvuN.html
24-07-2020||India||Differences emerge over border troop withdrawal||New Delhi/Beijing Differences between India and China on the disengagement process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) spilled into the open on Friday, with New Delhi calling on Beijing to “sincerely implement” all understandings on troop withdrawals reached by senior military commanders of the two sides.The issue figured in a nearly three-hour meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, which reviewed the situation in the border areas and the disengagement process in the western sector of the LAC.The Indian side sent a “strong message” on the need for the Chinese side to deliver on commitments regarding the withdrawal of forces at friction points on the LAC, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.A statement from the external affairs ministry said the two sides agreed “it was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between senior [military] commanders in their meetings till date”.The two sides also agreed another meeting of the corps commanders “may be held soon so as to work out further steps to ensure expeditiously complete disengagement and de-escalation” along the LAC, the statement added.The people cited above said another meeting of the corps commanders is expected to be held next week but no dates have been finalised as yet. The fourth and most recent meeting of the generals from the two sides was held on July 14, with marathon discussions continuing till early morning the next day.The Indian side at the WMCC meeting, the fourth engagement at the diplomatic level since the border standoff emerged into the open, focused on the need for China to completely withdraw its forces from key friction points in Ladakh sector in keeping with commitments made at the meetings of the corps commanders and the July 5 phone conversation between the two Special Representatives on the border issue, the people said.The main problem areas continue to be the presence of Chinese troops at Pangong Lake and Depsang plains, the people said. While there has been some pullback by Chinese forces at Hot Springs and Gogra, this was not in line with the understandings reached so far and more needs to be done, the people added.The Chinese readout on the WMCC meeting, issued in Beijing in Mandarin, referred to “positive progress made by the frontline border defence forces of the two countries to disengage and ease the situation on the ground”.It said the two sides will “maintain bilateral military and diplomatic dialogues and consultations in accordance with the important consensus reached by the two foreign ministers and Special Representatives on border issues, properly handle remaining issues on the ground, and promote further cooling of the border situation”.The Chinese readout also spoke of the two sides continuing meetings of WMCC and the corps commanders to “strengthen the building of confidence” and “jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas”.However, the people cited above disagreed with the Chinese side’s characterisation of the troop withdrawals as “positive”.The Indian statement also noted the two sides had “agreed that early and complete disengagement of the troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and de-escalation from India-China border areas in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols and full restoration of peace and tranquillity was essential for smooth overall development of bilateral relations”.Such a complete disengagement will also be “in accordance with the agreement reached between the two Special Representatives (SRs) during their telephonic conversation on July 5”, the statement said.Experts believe the troop withdrawal has virtually stalled because the Chinese side has dug in at key points along the LAC.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said it would be very difficult to predict the next moves by China. “It is possible the Chinese side is not withdrawing as a reaction to economic and other actions taken by India. Even the Indian ban on Chinese apps has been backed by other countries and India has been able to mobilise global support on the issue of China’s aggressive actions,” he said.“For now, India has the option of waiting and watching, or escalating by mounting pressure at places where it has an advantage. But as defence minister Rajnath Singh pointed out, this will be a prolonged process,” Patil added.The Indian side at the WMCC meeting was led by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry, and the Chinese side was led by Hong Liang, director general of the boundary and maritime affairs department of the foreign ministry.(With inputs from Rahul Singh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/differences-emerge-over-border-troop-withdrawal/story-vH9u0FoldIJynJASG2SBIL.html
24-07-2020||India||HC makes Centre a party in rebel MLAs’ petition||New DelhiThe Rajasthan high court on Friday allowed the application filed by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 dissident Congress MLAs asking the court to include the Union government as a party to the case filed by them challenging speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notice of July 14.In their application moved through counsel S Hariharan and Divyesh Maheshwari, the rebel camp said the Union government should be included as a party because the validity of constitutional provisions (10th schedule) are under challenge.In their petition filed on July 15, the Pilot camp made the speaker and secretary of Rajasthan legislative assembly as respondents.The original version of the petition challenged only the speaker’s notice issued to them. However, the petition was amended later in the day to include an additional prayer challenging paragraph 2(1)(a) of tenth schedule of the Constitution. Para 2(1)(a) provides for disqualification of lawmakers on the ground of voluntarily giving up party membership.Since, the Constitutional provision was challenged, it became imperative to hear the central government due to which the application was moved on Thursday to add the Centre as party to the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-makes-centre-a-party-in-rebel-mlas-petition/story-DgMuLGXFKZbsI0Sr6cAbtJ.html
24-07-2020||India||Govt extends curbs, domestic flight fare caps until Nov 24||New Delhi The ministry of civil aviation on Friday extended restrictions on limited domestic flight operations and caps on air fares till November 24.Currently, the Centre has allowed domestic flight operations to function at 45% of their total capacity. “We will be extending our capacity of flight operations. At present, flight operations are at around 28%, we will extended the capacity beyond the 45 % limit soon,” a senior ministry official said.The ministry had last month cleared an increase in capacity of flight operations to 45% from 33% allowed previously. It had capped domestic flights to a third of their approved summer schedule in an order passed on May 21.Domestic flight operations were resumed from May 25, two months after their suspension in the wake of the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. Union aviation minister Hardeep Puri had earlier this month said that he hoped that the number of domestic flights will reach 55 – 60% of the pre-coronavirus level by Diwali this year.Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation in May had imposed fare limits for these bands -- domestic flights of less than 40-minute duration to have lower and upper limits of Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000. Fare limits for flights of 40-60 minutes are Rs 2,500 and Rs 7,500, for 60-90 minute flights, they are Rs 3,000 and Rs 9,000 and fare limits for 90-120 minute-flights are Rs 3,500 and Rs 10,000. Flights of 120-150 minute duration have Rs 4,500 and Rs 13,000 and those of 150-180 minutes have Rs 5,500 and Rs 15,700 as the lower and upper limits respectively.Airlines should adhere to the upper and lower limit of fares prescribed by the ministry during the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry had said.The aviation minister had said the move will mean that the lowest fare between Delhi and Mumbai, the busiest route in the country, will be capped at ₹3,500 and ₹10,000 at the higher end.The government’s decision to temporarily fix a cap on air fares following the resumption of domestic passenger flight services in a graded manner is impacting air travel demand as airlines are unable to offer tickets at lower prices to customers, aviation think tank Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) said earlier this month.CAPA said adopting such a mechanism takes away an airline’s flexibility to charge fares at a lower rate when demand is on the lower side. “The temporary fare caps by the regulator are impacting demand. The pricing restrictions mean that the airlines have less flexibility to offer lower fare to stimulate demand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-extends-curbs-domestic-flight-fare-caps-until-nov-24/story-X5XzzsBo4Z5gr7C8hA2YrN.html
24-07-2020||India||Not held hostage, say 3 MLAs||JaipurThree legislators from the Sachin Pilot camp, currently lodged at a hotel in Manesar, released video messages on Friday to counter chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s allegations that the Bharatiya Janata Party had held them hostage. “We are not hostage, we are here to voice our dissent to the CM’s style of working,” Congress MLAs Murari Lal Meena, Ved Prakash Solanki, and Suresh Modi said in the video. Addressing mediapersons in Jaipur earlier in the day, Gehlot said, “Our friends had been held hostage in Gurugram and they are under control of BJP. There are bouncers to prevent their return to Jaipur.” Meena, Congress MLA from Dausa, said the involvement of anti-corruption bureau and the special operations group in the probe has scared their families. “They are in fear. We are here to tell the high command that we are ignored in the party. We have not left the Congress or joined the BJP,” he said in the video message. Gehlot, Meena added, was a seasoned politician but he is leveling baseless allegations against the legislators in Haryana. Solanki, Congress MLA from Chaksu, also said they were not under anyone’s siege. “Some people in Jaipur are making allegation that we have been held hostage; that is wrong, we came here on our own will. As a matter of fact, I took a pass from the collector from travelling outside the state.” Modi, the third Congress legislator, also denied the allegations that they were being held hostage. “His [Gehlot] statements against us are undignified. We are here to complain against his style of working,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-held-hostage-say-3-mlas/story-hjWqlEbxG3rWpmO2kfq8fN.html

24-07-2020||India||‘Lives at stake’: Karnataka doctors protest attacks by Covid patients’ kin||Hundreds of doctors across Karnataka in both government and private hospitals wore black bands and held placards demanding that they be provided adequate security and protection while they perform their duties during the ongoing pandemic. There have been several incidents of violence and attacks by relatives of Covid patients - in some cases due to alleged delay in attending to them or handing over bodies only after undertaking necessary safety precautions.Doctors, speaking to the media, pointed out how the torching of an ambulance and stone-pelting at BIMS in Belgavi by relatives of a dead Covid patient as well as the assault on nurses and doctors at KC General Hospital in Bangalore due to delay in handing over a Covid patient body as medical procedures were being carried out has created a sense of fear and insecurity.Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors President Dr Dayanand Sagar said that the government should take the strictest possible action under law as medical personnel were already working under heavy odds.“Violence and assault on doctors, nurses or paramedical staff, damaging property under any circumstances is not acceptable. We should be able to work without fear for our lives. All of us are working by putting our lives at stake and for this, the reward should not be being violently attacked by a mob,” said Dr Sagar.KARD also outlined a charter of 11 demands, including arrest and legal action, against culprits involved in the Belgavi, Bidar and KC General hospital incidents, ensuring safety protocols and security are provided at all Covid care centres with police presence. Other demands in the charter include special allowances for Covid and night duty, providing good quality PPEs, N95 masks, shields, gloves and other equipment, no hierarchy among doctors and ensuring a common work design for everybody. They also said that funds should be released to ensure stipends which were hiked recently to be paid promptly.The Medical Education minister Dr K Sudhakar has assured that strictest action would be taken against those who threaten frontline Covid warriors. In the Belagavi case, already three have been detained for questioning and an FIR has been registered against 12 others. A senior health department official, who did not want to be identified, said: “Of course we will ensure safety and security. In all the cases, FIRs have been registered and in some culprits have been arrested with investigations are on. But on enhanced allowances and other financial matters a decision would be taken after due consideration.”For the second successive day, Karnataka recorded more than 5,000 Covid positive cases. On Friday, it recorded 5,007 new Covid-19 cases taking the cumulative tally to 85,870 which includes 31,347 discharges and 1,724 deaths.

24-07-2020||India||Telangana encounter probe panel gets six-month extension due to Covid-19 pandemic||The Supreme Court has granted a six-month extension to an inquiry commission probing the alleged encounter killings of four rape-murder accused in Telangana. The extension came on a request made by the Commission Chairman, former apex court judge, Justice VS Sirpurkar who cited the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions for its inability to complete the enquiry by the allotted deadline of September 3. The commission requested for a six-month extension.Passing an order on the commission’s application, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and comprising of Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “We grant six months’ further time to the Inquiry Commission to submit its final report.”The application filed on July 16 stated, “Even though the work of the commission is continuing, the same could not be completed because of the prevailing pandemic situation…Therefore, the inquiry commission is constrained to apply for an extension of time of six months from the date the commission is able to function with physical hearings, spot inspections etc.” The other two members of the Inquiry Commission are former judge of the Bombay High Court, Justice Rekha Baldota and former Director of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) DR Karthikeyan. The Commission was constituted on December 12, 2019 by a bench headed by CJI SA Bobde on a petition filed by two lawyers GS Mani and Pradeep Kumar Yadav. The petition sought an independent probe into the killing of the four people accused of raping and murdering a 26-year old veterinarian amid growing public outrage. The ghastly rape-murder took place in the outskirts of Hyderabad on November 27 and had shocked the entire country. On December 6, in a shootout with the police, the four men were killed as they tried to escape.The apex court tasked the Commission to verify the claims of the petition and examine the veracity of police claims. The Commission met once in February and was scheduled to meet next in March, this year. Due to their advanced age, none of the members could travel or meet amid the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-encounter-probe-panel-gets-six-month-extension-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-9uk7WJBaGbhxGTgA97Z4xN.html
24-07-2020||India||BJP’s Bengal leaders called for Delhi interviews as party gets poll ready||Despite complete or partial lockdown in parts of many districts and biweekly lockdown in Bengal, all BJP district presidents, many of whom are newly elected, have been summoned in phases to Delhi to evaluate party’s position in each of the state’s 294 assembly seats. The BJP has declared that it will win at least 200 seats in the 2021 Bengal polls. The exercise was set in motion on Wednesday and will continue till next week.The constituency-wise evaluation began on Thursday with north Bengal districts where BJP wrested all seven Lok Sabha seats in 2019. It set a record by winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats while TMC won 22. BJP’s vote share was 40.64 % against 43.69 % of the TMC.“Each district president is being given a questionnaire. One of the difficult questions is how the BJP would perform if polls are held right now. They are being asked to state the party’s strengths and weaknesses right down to local unit level. They have to give their assessment on voters as well as the TMC’s strategies and weaknesses,” said a leader who did not want to be quoted. Each district president is being interviewed for two hours, he said. The exercise is being conducted by BJP central leaders such as Arvind Menon, who is in charge of West Bengal, joint general secretary (organisation) Shivprakash and general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh and national secretary Rahul Sinha are representing the state leadership. National general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh is overseeing the exercise. BJP currently has 16 legislators but most of them are defectors from the TMC and other parties. In the 2016 polls, the BJP won only three seats while its ally, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha of Darjeeling district, won three more. The BJP contested 291 seats but had only 10.16 % vote share.BJP leaders believe that although the situation has improved drastically since 2019 there is no space for complacency as TMC chief Mamata Banerjee is trying to regain lost ground by overhauling the party and stop more defections.“We have gone into election mode. The BJP will fight with full strength,” said BJP national executive member Mukul Roy, a former Rajya Sabha member, who switched over from the TMC in 2017 and played a key role in several defections and the party’s impressive 2019 Lok Sabha polls performance. Roy also flew to Delhi for a meeting but returned to Kolkata on Friday for an eye treatment. Interestingly, the Bengal chief minister is figuring in the BJP’s ongoing exercise for non-political reasons as well. Since direct flights between Kolkata and Delhi are banned, Bengal BJP leaders are flying to Lucknow or Indore to catch connecting flights and then following the same route on the return journey.“The chief minister has no sense. Has she been able to stop people from travelling between Kolkata and Delhi? Her whims are only costing people more money and travel time,” said Bengal BJP vice-president Ritesh Tiwari who reached Delhi on Friday via Lucknow.“I have to attend a meeting on July 26. I will travel via Indore,” said Arjun Singh, another vice-president and Lok Sabha member from Barrackpore in North 24 Parganas district. The constituency has witnessed maximum political violence since the Lok Sabha polls.Since flights from Bagdogra airport in Darjeeling district are operating without restriction, only the BJP district presidents from north Bengal flew directly to Delhi. Reacting to the exercise, TMC leaders said it only proves that Mamata Banerjee was right in saying that the BJP is a party of “outsiders”. “If BJP has to get its Bengal leaders to fly to Delhi to explain ground reality one can easily conclude that the party knows nothing about the state and its people,” said minister of state for parliamentary affairs Tapas Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-bengal-leaders-called-for-delhi-interviews-as-party-gets-polls-ready/story-VQKXAPka1kBpz9uFCDXkTL.html

The legislators were demanding that the Governor should convene an assembly session so that the chief minister and his colleagues could prove their majority in the House.In his letter to the chief minister, the Governor wrote, “Before I could discuss the matter with experts regarding an assembly session, you have openly said that if Raj Bhawan is ‘gheraoed’ then it is not your responsibility.”“If you and your Home Ministry cannot protect the Governor then what about law and order in the state? What agency should be contacted for the Governor’s security? I’ve never heard such a statement from any CM.

24-07-2020||India||Railways earned Rs 430 crore from Shramik Special train fares||The Indian Railways earned Rs 429.90 crore revenue through the fares of its Shramik Special trains till July 9, data shared by the railway ministry shows.The national carrier received the highest revenue of Rs 102 crore from Gujarat followed by Maharashtra ( Rs 85 crore) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 34 crore ), according to the data reviewed by Hindustan Times.However, railways spent much more than it earned through fares - around Rs 2,400 crore - in operating the Shramik trains, a senior ministry official said.“This should be taken as receipt only in lieu of expenses incurred by the Railways in running of Shramik Trains. Roughly that would amount to more than Rs 2,400 crore. The fares were not taken by railways from passengers but released from state governments,” the official added.In June, the ministry had said the average cost of fares for migrants aboard Shramik Special trains was Rs 600 and added that it spent around Rs 3,400 per person to operate the train.“It may be noted that railways incurred 85% of the cost of operating Shramik Trains. It was an important operation to rise up for the need of the nation during the lockdown,” a spokesperson for the railway ministry said.According to Rajendran Narayanan, assistant professor at Azim Premji University, “The actual number of migrants that have been transported during the lockdown is around 1 crore and there are still many more migrants estimated to be stranded. Due to the obstacles in the procedures in getting on board the trains and the fact that curbs are easing, many are choosing to stay put now. In terms of fares, many migrants ended up paying fares in the month of May though it did get free later on towards June in most places. Migrants ended up paying about Rs 800 to Rs 1000. When the regular IRCTC trains also began in June, many migrants decided to book them due to lack of availability in shramik trains and ended up paying dynamic fares in the IRCTC trains.”Shramik Special trains began from May 1 in the Centre’s bid to ferry stranded migrant workers to their native states amid the Covid-19 lockdown.But soon the national carrier had come under criticism over the issue of train fare being charged from the migrants. The ministry had also issued guidelines stating that the sending state will pay the consolidated fare to railways. “Sending state may decide to bear this cost or take it from passengers or take it from the receiving state after mutual consultation or may charge it to any fund. It is purely their prerogative,” it had said in its guidelines for operating the trains.The Ministry of railways had clarified it subsidised the ticket prices for migrant workers by agreeing to pay 85 %, while state governments had been asked to pay the remaining 15%.The fare structure for the trains included the price of regular sleeper class tickets plus superfast charges of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20.The Shramik train operations have finally come to an end with the last service on July 9. However, the ministry has said that it will run more trains if there is demand. Railway board chairman VK Yadav said on Thursday that the railways would continue to run the trains if the demand arose from the states.On July 9, the last two trains departed from the Chennai Central station - one to Jodhpur with 1,449 passengers and second one to Howrah with 1,620 passengers, according to the data.Till date, railways have ferried 63.14 lakh migrants to their home states aboard 4,496 Shramik trains.Gujarat and Mahrashtra accounted for the highest number of Shramik trains originating from the states with 1027 and 844 trains, respectively. The maximum number of trains ferrying migrants were sent to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar with 1712 and 1507 trains, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-earned-rs-430-crore-from-shramik-special-train-fares/story-duFiaV9EILYEkbF4NpLiDK.html

Governments are formed and run with a majority. BJP’s conspiracy to topple the Rajasthan government is very clear. This is an insult to eight crore people of the state. The governor should call for a session of the state’s assembly so that the nation gets to know the truth,” Rahul tweeted.Earlier, Ashok Gehlot led a large contingent of MLAs supporting him in buses to the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, where they laid siege on the lawns and shouted slogans demanding that Kalraj Mishra calls a session of the Rajasthan assembly.Gehlot, too, met the governor during the day seeking assurance that he will not succumb to “pressure” from above and take a decision on the matter in line with the constitution. Before the Congress MLAs gathered for a show of strength at the Raj Bhawan, Gehlot had issued a warning, saying his government will not be responsible if people of the state surrounded the governor’s house to protest against the delay in calling the session.Also Read: Rajasthan Guv writes to CM Gehlot, asks who is responsible for his security after MLAs’ protestGehlot has said that he will prove his government’s majority in the house ending speculations that it may not have the numbers after the rebellion by his former deputy and state congress chief Sachin Pilot and his 18 followers, also MLAs of the Congress party.The Congress MLAs left the governor house premises around 9 pm followed by a cabinet meeting called by Gehlot to discuss the current situation.Watch: Rajasthan Crisis | Mukul Rohatgi on high court’s order on disqualification rowCongress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said that governor Kalraj Mishra had given a note to Gehlot, which would be responded to immediately.“CM wants to prove majority, call the assembly session on Covid crisis and wants to silence those who say Congress doesn’t have a majority.

24-07-2020||India||Air Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari to take charge of Western Air Command amid tension at LAC||The Indian Air Force’s Western Air Command (WAC), whose responsibilities include the sensitive Ladakh sector, is set to get a new chief even as the IAF remains on its highest state of alert to deal with any military provocation by the Chinese forces amid tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the upcoming change of guard said on Friday.Air Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari will take charge of the Delhi-based WAC on August 1, said one of the officials cited above. Chaudhari was closely associated with the Rafale programme in a previous role, and the IAF is inducting its first batch of the fighters imported from France next week.He will replace Air Marshal B Suresh who will retire on July 31. Chaudhari is currently serving as the Senior Air Staff Officer at the Shillong-based Eastern Air Command. He earlier held the appointment of IAF deputy chief at the Air Headquarters in Delhi and steered a raft of key procurements.An experienced pilot, Chaudhari has logged more than 3,800 hours of flying on a variety of fighter planes such as MiG-21, Mig-29 and Sukhoi-30. He has commanded important fighter bases in his military career including one in Kashmir. He also flew air defence missions during the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan.Chaudhari, who was commissioned into air force’s fighter stream in December 1982, is assuming command of the WAC at a time when the IAF is inducting its new Rafale fighter jets and operationalising them at the earliest is a top priority for the air force.He was closely associated with the Rafale programme as IAF deputy chief --- he was the head of the bilateral high-level group monitoring the progress of the fighter jet project, said a second official.The IAF will induct its first batch of five Rafale jets at the Ambala air base, which comes under the WAC, on July 29. The air force could deploy the new fighters in the Ladakh sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region, officials previously indicated to Hindustan Times. India is looking at arming its Rafale jets with an all-weather smart weapon of French origin that will allow combat pilots to engage ground targets from a standoff range of up to 60 km, as reported by HT on Thursday.The IAF is likely to initiate the purchase of Hammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) using the emergency financial powers granted to the military by the government at a time of heightened military tension with China.The other weapons that the Rafales will be armed with include Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to plug gaps in the IAF’s combat capabilities.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases including Leh, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-marshal-vivek-ram-chaudhari-to-take-charge-of-western-air-command-amid-tension-at-lac/story-XVW25BvpR7LYyGSQVgZyyH.html

This is the 23rd quake to jolt the northeastern state in the last five weeks. The quake on Friday occurred at 11.16 am and the epicentre was 29 km southeast of Champhai, the NCS said. The earthquake and heavy rains caused landslides at several places in the district, Champhai Deputy Commissioner Maria CT Zuali told PTI. She said two buildings have been vacated and the water supply pipeline to Dungtlang village was damaged due to landslides. The quantum of damage is yet to be ascertained as officials are assessing it, Zuali added Many people have set up makeshift tents and camps, and are sleeping outside their houses spooked by frequent quakes. The district administration has provided them tarpaulins, water tanks, solar lamps, first aid kits and eatables, according to officials. A series of earthquakes have hit the state since June 18 with remote Champhai being the worst-affected. Earthquakes have also rocked Saitual, Serchhip and Siaha districts. Earlier in the day, newly elected Rajya Sabha member from Mizoram K Vanlalvena, who is at present in the national capital, called on the secretary at the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences, M Rajeevan, and asked him to send a team to the state. Speaking to PTI from New Delhi, Vanlalvena said he urged the ministry to send seismologists to assess the cause of the frequent earthquakes. He said the secretary told him that they were taking the earthquakes in Mizoram seriously and would put forward the matter before higher authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earthquake-triggers-landslides-in-mizoram-23rd-to-hit-state-in-5-weeks/story-7KpnsdewNJUU9Ei5zICHHJ.html
24-07-2020||India||India, UK agree on steps to bolster trade relationship||India and the UK agreed on Friday to deepen their economic ties by removing additional barriers and working on an enhanced trade partnership that could possibly pave the way for a free trade agreement.During a virtual meeting of the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO), India’s commerce minister Piyush Goyal and UK’s international trade secretary Liz Truss also agreed to work on maximising the potential of the digital economies of the two countries, including on data regulation and interoperability.The meeting was held against the backdrop of India’s efforts to boost economic activity to overcome the impact of the Covid-19 crisis and to forge cooperation aimed at shaping new supply chains and the economic order in the post-pandemic era.The UK, which is in the process of exiting the European Union (EU), is keen to bolster economic ties with India, which is also being wooed by the 27 remaining countries in the bloc. India-UK trade was worth £24 billion last year, and India is now the second largest investor in the British economyTruss and Goyal agreed to explore opportunities for expanding and deepening the trade relationship. “This will include an enhanced trade partnership as the first step on a wider roadmap for a deeper trade partnership, and subject to progress could lead to a future free trade agreement,” a statement from the British high commission said.An Indian official familiar with developments, who declined to be named, said: “The UK is a very important ally of India and at this point in time, cooperation from the UK will be of immense importance. The UK has been supporting India’s cause at multilateral forums and we will further strengthen this relationship, which will span through trade, investment and cultural and strategic ties.”Britain’s international trade minister Ranil Jayawardena, who also joined the meeting, raised the issue of removing barriers for businesses in a range of sectors, including food and drink, healthcare, life sciences, IT, data, chemicals and services.The British side noted that the UK’s new Global Tariff, which comes into force on January 1 next year, will benefit Indian exporters by reducing tariffs on their goods by up to £40 million a year, assuming all duties are levied. It was also pointed out that UK companies have secured registration for polyhalite, a multi-nutrient fertiliser mined in Britain that could help Indian farmers to increase yields while supporting a cleaner and sustainable environment.“Increasing investment in each other’s markets is more important than ever as both economies seek to recover from the impact of Covid-19,” the British high commission’s statement said.The statement quoted Truss as saying that the meeting was an opportunity to “look at barriers preventing our trading relationship from reaching its full potential”. She described India as an “incredibly important partner” and said: “Today we agreed to look in detail at a framework for a deeper relationship. At this stage we want to keep all options on the table, including the possibility of a free trade agreement at some point in the future.”Jayawardena also led a business plenary, organised by the UK India Business Council (UKIBC), where the ministers spoke with businesses from both sides about the shared ambition to deepen the economic partnership.Jayawardena said: “We want to knock down existing trade barriers, create more good jobs and encourage innovation between two of the greatest democracies in the world.”Indian and British investments support more than half-a-million jobs in each other’s economies. There are 842 Indian companies based in the UK, employing more than 110,000 people and their revenues in the last fiscal were almost £41 billion.The UK is the second fastest growing G20 investor in India over the past 10 years, investing more than £22 billion and helping create more than 422,000 jobs. India is currently the second biggest investor in the UK, with 120 new projects and more than 5,000 new jobs in 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-uk-agree-on-steps-to-bolster-trade-relationship/story-HsRkywjEZx9DCBKGgbsbrI.html

Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, army chief General MM Naravane and navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh addressed the IAF’s top brass on jointness and integrated warfighting.Addressing the IAF’s commanders’ conference on its opening day, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday asked the air force to stay prepared for any eventuality, with Bhadauria asserting that IAF was poised to counter any aggressive action by the adversary.Singh said the swift deployment of the air force’s assets at forward locations in response to the current situation in eastern Ladakh “sent a strong message” to the adversary. Bhadauria also stressed on the need to focus on “the ability to handle situations at a short notice” to ensure a robust response.The defence minister last week said the progress in negotiations with China should help resolve the border dispute but he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved,” underlining that complex nature of the disengagement process along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-stresses-on-need-to-build-capacity-swiftly/story-vwpG78D3r3wMl0YuHYmmEL.html

A notification by the ministry issued in the evening also said that the domestic airfare cap, too, will remain in place till November 24 or until further orders.Domestic flights were suspended on March 25 as the government announced a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the disease. Union aviation minister Hardeep Puri had earlier this month said that he hoped that the number of domestic flights will reach 55 – 60 percent of the pre-coronavirus levels by Diwali this year.He had also noted a continuous improvement in the domestic air traffic while stating that it had more than doubled by early July from the 30,000 fliers, who boarded flights on May 25, when phased reopening of the sector began after two months of suspension.Also Read: No flight operations at Kolkata airport on July 25, 29In an effort to boost the domestic sector, the ministry had last month cleared an increase in capacity of flight operations to 45% from 33% allowed previously.

India stressed that full restoration of peace and tranquillity was essential for smooth overall development of bilateral relationsThe reaffirmation of the need for complete disengagement, de-escalation and full restoration of peace was made in the 17th meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs held on Friday.India was represented by a team led by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and the Chinese team was led by Hong Liang, director general of the boundary and oceanic affairs department of China’s foreign ministry.The talks between the two sides came amid a deadlock on the ground despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels. The disengagement process at some points of the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) including Pangong Tso and Depsang had virtually halted. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, too, had said that it was not possible to “guarantee” the outcome of talks with China.On the eve of the talks, external affairs ministry had said that it expected Chinese side will “sincerely” work with India for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas at the earliest as agreed to by the Special Representatives.The Friday statement underscored the point.“The two sides noted that this was in accordance with the agreement reached between the two Special Representatives (SRs) during their telephonic conversation on 5 July 2020. They agreed in this regard that it was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between Senior Commanders in their meetings till date,” the statement said.A statement from the Chinese foreign ministry has described the talks held on Friday as “candid and in-depth” and claimed that both sides acknowledged positive progress made in disengagement of troops at the frontline.“The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on the recent Sino-Indian border situation and fully affirmed the positive progress made by the front-line border defence forces of the two countries to disengage from contact and ease the situation on the ground,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement released Friday evening.The Indian government’s statement, however, did not reflect the progress that Beijing alluded to. It said another round of meeting of the senior commanders could be held soon to complete the process of disengagement and de-escalation.

24-07-2020||India||No relaxation on 4G internet curbs in Jammu and Kashmir for now: Centre tells SC||A special committee constituted as per the Supreme Court’s May 11 order to review internet restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has decided against affording any relaxation to such restrictions for the time being, the Central government told the Supreme Court on July 21.In the affidavit filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), it was stated that the special committee held a meeting on June 10, where it comprehensively considered all aspects of the matter including terrorist related incidents in J&K before deciding to continue with the restrictions on 4G mobile internet.“A thorough and comprehensive consideration of all facets of the matter including recent occurrence of terrorism related incidents in the region was carried out (by the committee). Ultimately, based on wide-ranging assessment of the prevailing situation in this sensitive region, the committee arrived at a decision that no further relaxation on restrictions on internet services, including 4G services, could be carried out at present. It was also decided that the next review of the committee would be carried out in two months,” the affidavit filed by the MHA said.The response came on a plea by NGO, Foundation of Media Professionals praying for initiation of contempt of court proceedings against the Central government and the Union Territory of J&K on the ground that no action was taken to comply with the top court’s judgment of May 11 to review restrictions on internet.The May 11 order was passed by the top court on a plea filed by the NGO in April challenging the order issued by the J&K administration on March 26 restricting internet speed in mobile data to 2G and praying that 4G internet services be restored in Jammu and Kashmir. The petitioner had claimed that patients, doctors, and general public of J&K were unable to access latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions about Covid-19 because of restrictions on mobile internet speed to 2G.“Various public health practitioners, medical professionals, and doctors have repeatedly expressed their concern about wasting precious time trying to download the latest studies, protocols, manuals and advisories on treatment and management of Covid-19. In some cases, doctors are not able to access these resources at all, due to the internet speed being too slow to download heavy files,” it was stated.Further, it was also pointed out that slow internet speed also renders telemedicine (diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunication) or online video consultation impossible.The Supreme Court, in its May 11 judgment, refrained from passing directions to restore 4G mobile internet services in J&K instead constituting the special committee comprising high level government officers to take a call on the same and examine the necessity to allow faster internet in certain geographical areas of the newly formed union territory. The committee was to comprise the secretary of Ministry of Home Affairs, secretary of Ministry of Communications and the chief secretary of J&K.The NGO then approached the court in June filing the present contempt petition submitting that there is no information available in the public domain about whether the constitution of the special committee has been notified and whether it has conducted any meetings or passed any orders.The MHA, however, told the court that the committee stood constituted by the May 11 order of the Supreme Court itself and no separate notification was required in this regard from the central government.The special committee met on May 15 to review the restrictions and decided to obtain further inputs before taking any decision. It subsequently met on June 10 and decided not to relax the restrictions, the centre said.“In view of the above, the contempt petition is misconceived and without any merit and is liable to be rejected”, the affidavit added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-relaxation-on-4g-internet-curbs-in-jammu-and-kashmir-for-now-centre-tells-sc/story-zFU8G37Nh4p5KhR42siX8O.html
24-07-2020||India||Unrelenting floods without respite add to Assam’s plight this monsoon||Floods are an annual feature of Assam’s calendar and 4-5 waves of deluge usually strike the state between April and August each year.But this year heavy rains, almost without any long break, has led to more suffering for the state’s residents who are already witnessing the third wave of floods this monsoon.“Usually we have a gap period between successive waves of floods in Assam, which allows water level in rivers to come down and flood waters to dry. But this year rainfall has been almost continuous for weeks and it has aggravated the situation. This is unusual,” said eminent water expert Dulal Goswami.“Though excess rainfall could be a factor, we have to consider that global climate change could also be responsible. According to a government study done in 2018, Assam was found to be the most vulnerable to changing climate among 12 states in the Indian Himalayan Region,” he added.According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) since the beginning of June, the state has recorded 20% more rainfall—894.4 mm till July 22 against the normal of around 743.9 mm.“We are witnessing a pattern in past few years where unlike in the past when rainfall used to get spread over a few months but now it seems most of the rainfall is taking place in one go,” said Mirza Zulfiqur Rahman, visiting research associate, Institute of Chinese Studies, Delhi.“Climate change is definitely a factor for this and such erratic events will continue. We need to see if we are prepared for this when 2-3 waves of floods happen almost at once. It is important to talk of floods as a livelihood issue and not discuss this only when the disaster strikes,” he added. Both experts said instead of piecemeal and sporadic efforts, a holistic approach needs to be taken to address the annual floods keeping into consideration people’s livelihoods and that Brahmaputra and other major rivers in the state have their own characteristics. As per Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) data, over 27 lakh people in 26 of the state’s 33 districts were still affected by floods on Friday. This season 96 persons have died due to drowning and another 26 in landslides caused by heavy rains.Over 50,000 displaced persons were taking shelter in 301 relief camps. Flood waters have also inundated over 1.22 hectares of crop area across the state.“We are witnessing the third wave of floods at present. Rainfall and flooding has been taking place since May end. While rainfall has taken place as per IMD prediction, climate change could be a reason for lack of gap between waves of floods,” said Pankaj Chakraborty, state project coordinator, ASDMA.Kaziranga still inundated by flood waters; Britain’s Prince William shockedFloods continue to affect Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) with 85% of the park spread over 430 sq km inundated. This season 125 animals of the park including 13 rhinos (9 due to drowning and 4 due to natural causes) have died in and around the park.The situation at the park evoked reactions from Britain’s Prince William, the second in the line of succession to the British throne, who wrote to KNPTR director P. Sivakumar on July 21 expressing his and his wife Catherine’s feelings.“Catherine and I were heartbroken to hear about the appalling devastation to Kaziranga National Park and its precious wildlife caused by the very heavy monsoon flooding,” said the letter.“We have the happiest memories of our visit to Kaziranga in April 2016 and are shocked by what has happened. The deaths of so many animals including one-horned rhino, is deeply upsetting,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unrelenting-floods-without-respite-add-to-assam-s-plight-this-monsoon/story-XQVNjX4fUwKRv3m2WE6UFJ.html
24-07-2020||India||Jamshedpur Bandh on Saturday against Rs 1 lakh fine, 2-year jail order for not wearing mask||A day long shutdown has been announced in Jharkhand’s industrial city of Jamshedpur on Saturday to protest state government’s ordinance mandating Rs 1 lakh fine and 2-year jail term for violation of Covid-19 safety protocols like wearing masks and social distancing etc. Announcing this, business and trade organizations here on Friday said that all the markets would henceforth shut down voluntarily by 6 pm from Saturday onwards.The trade body said they have been in support of Covid-19 safety measures and also backed its strict enforcement but the provision for Rs 1 lakh fine and 2 year jail term is impractical.“But this new order by the state government-- Rs 1 lakh fine and 2-year jail term-- is too much and impractical. It will lead to blackmailing and corruption. Hence, we have called for a Jamshedpur bandh on Saturday in opposition to this order and decided to close down all shops and markets by 6 pm from tomorrow onwards,” Ashok Bhalotia, Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) president, said here today.Also Read: Jharkhand reports 403 new Covid-19 cases; recovery rate at 45.40%Bhalotia has also written to chief minister (CM) Hemant Soren to reconsider the order he described as ‘arbitrary and anti-common people’. The Soren cabinet had passed the Jharkhand State Epidemic Diseases Ordinance-2020 (JSEDO-2020) on Wednesday, mandating Rs 1 lakh fine and 2-year jail term for not wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and violation of other such Covid-19 protocols.It was also decided that the business, industry and trading community would wear black badges in protest. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mahanagar president Gunjan Yadav also announced party’s moral support to the Jamshedpur bandh tomorrow.For Coronavirus Live Updates“This is a black law, a Tuglaqui farman. BJP is extending full support to the Jamshedpur bandh tomorrow by business and industry organizations against this order. The government was sleeping when women in quarantine got pregnant despite being in custody. The government should distribute masks, sanitizers to the residents, provide Covid-19 beds, increase tests, expedite test reports and treatment facilities. Instead, it is burdening already poor, unemployed and distressed people with Rs 1 lakh fine and jail threat,” said Gunjan.Former CM Babaulal Marandi has also written to the Soren requesting him to reconsider this order while party state spokesperson Kunal Sarangi wondered if the government would levy similar fine and jail-term on its own ministers who he claimed were flouting lockdown rules and Covid-19 safety protocols with impunity.“Where was the government when its own minister and coalition leaders attended Lalu Parasad’s meeting in RIMS while the latter was in judicial custody! This order will facilitate extortion, bribe culture at lower administrative and police levels. Government should focus on augmenting health infrastructure, providing citizens with proper medical care, hospitals, bed, ambulances and speedy tests and results,” said Sarangi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jamshedpur-bandh-on-saturday-against-rs-1-lakh-fine-2-year-jail-order-for-not-wearing-mask/story-5gilUu38Fd8xtovu05SbwN.html
24-07-2020||India||India has one of world’s lowest Covid-19 infection, death rate: Harsh Vardhan||At 864 cases and less than 21 deaths per million population, India has one of the world’s lowest Covid-19 infection and death rate, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday said underlining that the recovery rate among coronavirus-infected patients in the country is 63.45 per cent and the mortality is 2.3 per cent.These remarks were made by Vardhan at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Health Ministers’ Digital Meet held digitally, the health ministry said.According to the ministry’s statement, Vardhan emphasised on how the Indian traditional system of medicine has also contributed substantially in boosting the immunity of general population during Covid-19.“There is currently no institutional mechanism within SCO to discuss cooperation in traditional medicine that has the potential to fulfil the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 and also reinforce the effective implementation of the joint statement on cooperation in combating epidemics signed at the Qingdao Summit in 2018,” the statement quoted him as saying.“This is in spite of such complementary medicine systems being widely practised in all member states of our SCO,” he said and proposed the setting up of a new sub-group on traditional medicine under the existing institutional meetings of the SCO health ministers.Expressing his condolences at the loss of lives across the world due to Covid-19, Vardhan described the India’s political commitment to contain the pandemic and spoke on how Prime Minister Narendra Modi has “personally monitored the situation and ensured a pre-emptive, pro-active and graded response to prevent the deadly virus from spreading”.He explained that a series of actions were initiated in a graded way that included issuing of travel advisories, point-of-entry surveillance, community-based surveillance, enhancement of laboratory and hospital surge capacities, wide dissemination of technical guidelines on managing different aspects of disease outbreak and communicating risk to the public. “The consecutive lockdowns provided India with much required time and opportunity to build up on technical knowhow, laboratory capacities, hospital infrastructure and also to build up its pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions,” Vardhan said.Speaking on the result of the lockdown he said, “India has so far reported 1.25 million cases and more than 30,000 deaths due to Covid. At 864 cases per million and less than 21 deaths per million of our population, India has one of the world’s lowest infection and death rate. “Our recovery rate stands at 63.45% whereas our mortality at 2.3 per cent.” The Union Health Minister also spoke on the increase in testing capacity and health infrastructure during the lockdown and after, the statement said.On logistics, Vardhan said, “India didn’t have a single manufacturer of personal protective equipment (PPE) and now the country has developed indigenous capacity in the past few months to the extent that the country can export quality PPEs. “Similar scaling up was also done for achieving other indigenous capacity and reducing the demand & supply gap for ventilators and medical oxygen.” He also elaborated on the innovative use of information technology in virtually every aspect of Covid management.“Aarogya Setu app and ITIHAS, a cellular-based tracking technology, are used for surveillance and identification of potential clusters of disease, RT-PCR app for testing, facility app for managing information on admitted patients and hospital bed capacities, all integrated with a single Covid portal.” According to the statement, Vardhan called upon all member nations to rise in this time of crisis and mitigate the effect of Covid on health and economy. He also congratulated all the frontline staff dealing with the pandemics and called them “no less than God for humanity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-one-of-world-s-lowest-covid-19-infection-death-rate-harsh-vardhan/story-dfDV9dS2dt8MCLDWMfYq6H.html
24-07-2020||India||‘No bouncers are guarding us, nor are we ill or crying’: MLA in Pilot camp||A group of dissident Congress MLAs supporting Sachin Pilot in the fight against Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot released short videos debunking the charge that they were held hostage by the BJP. Underscoring that that his government has a complete majority of the Congress and its allies in the 200-member state assembly, Gehlot said, “Everyone is aware that a small section of our MLAs have been held captive in a hotel outside the state under the watch of bouncers and police of other states.”Suresh Modi, an MLAs in the Sachin Pilot camp, said the statements made the CM do not fit his stature. The legislator found fault with the CM’s working style and accused him of not doing any work in his constituency. “I want to make it clear, na hume bandhak bana ke rakha hai, na bouncer baithe hai, na bimaar hai, na aasu baha rahe hain, na wahan aane ke liye tadap rahe hain (We are not held hostage, nor are there bouncers, nor are we crying or ill, and nor are we dying to go back there),” said Suresh Modi in Hindi in a video message, stressing that he was staying away of his own free will.  #WATCH: "Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot said we are held hostage by BJP, I want to clarify that it is not so... We are here at our own will as despite our efforts he didn't listen to any of our demands related to work in our constituencies," says MLA Suresh Modi from Sachin Pilot camp pic.twitter.com/Y1ZU2elw5UThe CM, however, maintains that he has learnt that the MLAs want to “break free of their captivity” and go along with the government. “This will become evident in some time,” Gehlot said, when asked whether the Rajasthan Congress is in touch with MLAs in the Pilot camp.Murali Meena, another MLA in the Pilot camp, reiterated that he and other rebels are still Congress members. He alleged that the CM’s working style forced him and others to take this step. “Galat aarop (wrong allegations)” are being levelled against us, said the legislator, adding “dukh hua (felt pain)”. “We are staying in Delhi. CM Ashok Gehlot said we are held hostage by BJP, it’s untrue as we were never in touch with them. On the contrary, our families are scared due to use of SOG by the CM,” said Murali Meena.The Rajasthan speaker had issued disqualification notices against the 19 dissident MLAs, who challenged it in the high court. On Friday, the court ordered status quo and said there will be no action for now on the disqualification notices against the dissident MLAs.“Few people sitting in Jaipur are claiming that we are being held hostage. We came here on our own will. Infact, I got a pass made through the DM to reach here,” said Vedprakash Solanki, another MLAs in team Pilot. Team Pilot has said that issuance of disqualification notice by the speaker is a violation of their freedom of speech right and merely disagreeing with the leader does not amount to defection. The chief minister also reiterated his allegation that top BJP leaders were involved in the conspiracy to dislodge his government. Asked about the BJP’s claim that current developments in Rajasthan are a reflection of internal Congress factionalism, he said, “Can anyone say that the BJP does not have a hand in current developments in the state... Audio tapes in the public domain, raids on my close aides, hospitality offered to Congress MLAs by BJP-led Haryana government, prove BJP’s hand in this matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-bouncers-are-guarding-us-nor-are-we-ill-or-crying-mla-in-pilot-camp/story-ByTUDV9CARwG12p9dZREIJ.html

We have also decided to start this method soon,” Ratan Lal Nath, state law minister, told media persons.The government has also decided to conduct door-to-door surveillance across the state from Monday (July 27) to check people, who may be showing symptoms for Covid-19.“The survey will list people, who are displaying Covid-19 symptoms. Their swab samples will be collected and a rapid antigen detection (RAD) test will be conducted,” the minister said.The state government has constituted three committees for effective Covid-19 management, include core, strategy and technical panels. The core committee will suggest clinical aspects, the strategy panel will propose ideas to the state government, while the technical committee will give suggestions regarding diagnostic and treatment mechanisms.So far.

24-07-2020||India||India, Israel to deepen military cooperation amid border row||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday spoke with his Israeli counterpart Lieutenant General Benjamin Gantz over telephone with strengthening bilateral defence ties being the focus of the conversation, at a time India is making emergency military purchases from several countries including Israel to bolster the military’s capabilities amid border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh.The border row was also discussed, officials said.“Both ministers expressed satisfaction at the progress of strategic cooperation between the two countries and discussed possibilities of further strengthening defence engagements,” the defence ministry said in a statement.Singh updated Gantz on the situation along the contested Line of Actual Control in Ladakh, where Indian and China have lately failed to make a breakthrough in reducing border tensions despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels, and the disengagement process at some friction points has virtually stopped, people familiar with the developments said.The border conflict with China has forced India to speed up the purchase of military hardware including fighter jets, smart air-to-ground weapons, missiles, rockets, multi-mission drones, air defence systems, GPS-guided artillery ammunition, tank ammunition and even assault rifles. The United States, Russia, France and Israel are among the countries that India plans to import the weaponry from.India is looking at sourcing from Israel the Firefly loitering ammunition, Spike anti-tank guided missiles, Spice guidance kits that can mounted on standard bombs to convert them into smart weapons and an operational surface-to-air missile system as a 2017 order worth $2 billion for such advanced systems to take down hostile aircraft and missiles hasn’t translated into deliveries yet, the officials said.Israel has been a reliable military partner and has stood by India, said Air Marshal KK Nohwar (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “Israel has always given us niche technologies in areas of electronic warfare systems and weapons systems that were not readily forthcoming from other countries,” Nohwar said.The government has authorised the armed forces to process cases for buying urgently-needed weapons and equipment worth up to Rs 300 crore to meet their critical operational requirements. The decision was taken at a special meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council --- India’ apex procurement body --- on July 15 to fast-track key purchases.Singh sought greater participation of Israeli defence companies in the defence manufacturing sector under the new liberalised foreign direct investment (FDI) regime, the statement said.From raising FDI in defence manufacturing to creating a separate budget for buying locally-made military hardware and notifying a list of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported, the government in May announced a raft of measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector.In early July, the defence ministry approved the purchase of weapons and ammunition worth Rs 38,900 crore. The cost of military hardware cleared for purchase from the domestic industry is pegged at Rs 31,130 crore and the orders are expected to give a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-Reliant India Movement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-israel-to-deepen-military-cooperation-amid-border-row/story-TevqNLchqH4MNPHkkQAJkM.html

The entire process and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) of the drug has been transferred to Cipla to manufacture and market the drug at scale,” the statement says.Favipiravir is an off patent, oral antiviral drug, originally discovered by Fuji Pharma in Japan, and has shown promise in clinical trials for treatment of Covid-19 patients, especially in mild and moderate cases.Director of CSIR-IICR S Chandrashekhar was quoted by news agency PTI as saying that the technology transferred to Cipla is very efficient and affordable, allowing the company to make large quantities of the product within a short span of time.Also Read: Coronavirus protein redesigned in lab, may enable fast, stable vaccine productionCSIR director general Shekhar C Mande said Ciplenza was another example of the institute’s commitment to work with the industry to develop quick solutions and products for mitigation of Covid-19.Earlier in June, drug manufacturing firm Glenmark Pharmaceuticals was given approval from the Indian drug regulator to launch oral antiviral drug favipiravir for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 patients in the country.Another Indian pharmaceutical company Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (Dr Reddy’s) had recently announced signing a tripartite agreement with two international firms based in Japan and the UAE for the development, manufacturing and sales of favipiravir innovator brand Avigan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cipla-launching-covid-treatment-drug-ciplenza-in-august-rs-68-per-tablet/story-pEGUAYKbUz319Bzhrpgc9L.html

He also does not have any co-morbid conditions.“The first dose of 0.5 ml intramuscular injection was given to him around 1.30 pm. No immediate side-effects have been observed so far. He was under observation for two hours and will be monitored for the next seven days,” Rai said. Few more participants would be given the vaccine on Saturday after their screening reports come.AIIMS-Delhi is among the 12 sites selected by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting phase I and II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of Covaxin. In phase I, the vaccine would be tested on 375 volunteers and the maximum of 100 of them would be from AIIMS. The second phase would include around 750 volunteers from all 12 sites together, Rai said. Phase I of the vaccine trial will be done on healthy people aged 18-55 years having no co-morbid conditions. Women with no pregnancy will also be selected to be a part of the trial in the first phase. In the second phase, 750 people will be recruited between 12-65 years, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria had said.Already, around 1,800 volunteers have registered themselves for the trial at AIIMS, he had said.“In the first phase we see the safety of the vaccine which is of primary importance and the dose range is also calculated,” he said.There are three formulations of the vaccine, and each subject will be given any one of the formulation in two doses two weeks apart.The first 50 will get the lowest strength dose of the vaccine. If it is found to be safe in them, then it will be given to another 50 patients in high doses, acording to Rai.Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin, developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), had recently got the nod for human clinical trials from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-dose-of-covid-19-candidate-covaxin-administered-to-30-yr-old-at-aiims-delhi/story-jttBRw99uJnETubSivMZ0I.html

The park has been hit by three waves of flood so far this year with 92 per cent of its area submerged in waters and 123 animals, including 12 rhinos, dead. In a letter to the park’s Director P Sivakumar, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said they were heartbroken to hear about the appalling devastation to the Kaziranga National Park and its wildlife caused by very heavy monsoon flooding. “We have the happiest memories of our visit to Kaziranga in April 2016 and are shocked by what has happened,” Prince William wrote in the letter, which was made available to the press by park authorities on Friday. The deaths of so many animals, including the one- horned rhino, is deeply upsetting, he said. “We know from our visit how dedicated all the staff in Kaziranga are in caring for the park’s wildlife, and can only begin to imagine what a difficult time this must be,” he said. Expressing their appreciation for the park’s rangers, the Duke said, “Catherine and I greatly admire all the work that you and the rangers at Kaziranga are doing to risk your own safety, rescue animals and contain the damage.” The loss of life and livelihoods in Assam as a result of the flooding, coming on top of the Covid-19 pandemic, is deeply distressing, he said. “We offer our deepest condolences to all those affected,” the Duke said. The park director said that they are deeply moved by the letter, which is full of compassion and concern for the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve. “In difficult times like this, a message from the Duke is surely a morale booster for all,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shocked-by-what-has-happened-prince-william-kate-middleton-on-flood-devastation-in-kaziranga/story-JDGnBkY7FwZBmzsK4gP3dJ.html
24-07-2020||India||Rehana says kids painted her body for sex education, court rejects argument, bail plea||The Kerala High Court on Friday rejected the bail petition of activist Rehana Fathima who is facing a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) and other charges for posting a video of her minor children painting on her partially-naked body.The court rejected her contention that she allowed her children to paint her to impart sex education. The court observed that while she was free to do this privately in her house to educate children, the intention behind her publicizing the video of the act cannot be good and it attracted charges related to obscene representation of children. Her video with her two children--a 14-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl-- had triggered much outrage after it was circulated last month, prompting police to book her under Pocso, Juvenile Justice Act and other sections. A lower court turned down her bail plea following which she moved the high court. Also Read: Neuberg Diagnostics gets ICMR approval for COVID testing in KeralaHer plea states her acts were intended to enable her children to view body and body parts “as a different medium altogether rather than seeing it as a sexual look alone.” She also stated that if children grew up seeing natural bodies, “their minds will be liberated of hyper-sexualization of women.” “In a sexually frustrated society, women simply do not feel safe in clothes. It is high time to open up and tell children what the female body is all about and what sex and sexuality really mean,” she said in her plea. The court had earlier watched the video and rejected her contention and asked her to stand trial. “If the painting on the body of the petitioner happened inside four walls of her house, there cannot be any offence. After watching the picture, the court appreciates the talents of children. But not in the way the petitioner encouraged them by uploading the video. We cannot accept her view it was part of sex education,” the single bench headed by Justice P V Kunhikrishnan observed. After the HC decision, Fathima said she will move the Supreme Court soon.Initially, Fathima had posted the video clip on Facebook but later she uploaded it on YouTube. She rationalized her act by saying her kids did the painting while she was resting and called it a beautiful artwork. “Just as beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, so is porn in the eyes of the beholder,” she wrote in the post. There was a big outcry after her post surfaced. Fathima was dismissed as a junior technician with the BSNL in Ernakulam in May this year after many cases came up against her. Last year she was arrested on a complaint filed by a right wing activist claiming she hurt the religious feelings of the Hindu community by posting an objectionable picture on social media. She was in jail for two months.After her unsuccessful attempt to trek to Sabarimala temple in 2018 along with a Hyderabad-based digital journalist Kavitha Jakkala, she was excommunicated by the Muslim Jamaath Council. Her house was later vandalised by protestors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rehana-says-kids-painted-her-body-for-sex-education-court-rejects-argument-bail-plea/story-hs6RzqApPLH7qePHXrWJxH.html

Through his bold leadership, our country was able to overcome many challenges successfully. The Union Budget of July 24, 1991, paved the way for the economic transformation of our country,” it added.Sonia also mentioned that Rao’s tenure was marked by a number of political, social, and foreign policy achievements and highlighted that he was a dedicated Congressman.“I congratulate the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee for having organised these year-long celebrations. PV Narasimha Rao was a very respected national and international figure. The Congress party takes pride in his many accomplishments and contributions,” she added. అనేక సవాళ్లు, అనిశ్చితి. ఈ పరిస్థితుల్లో ముందుండి సమస్యలపై పోరు సలిపి, అంతర్గతంగా, అంతర్జాతీయంగా, ఆర్థికంగా, సామాజికంగా దేశానికి కొత్త దిశను చూపిన మహానేత, కాంగ్రెస్ శిఖరంమన పీవీ నరసింహ రావుగారు. అయన శతజయంతి ఉత్సాహం కాంగ్రెస్ కే కాదు, దేశానికే ఏడాదిపాటు పండగ.#PVNarasimhaRao pic.twitter.com/4iZQARSoozRahul too congratulated the Telangana unit for organising the year-long celebrations to commemorate Rao’s many achievements.“On this occasion, we celebrate the legacy of a man whose contribution continues to shape modern India. From joining the Congress party in his teenage years to becoming the Prime Minister of the largest democracy, his remarkable political journey reflected his grit and determination,” Rahul said in a statement.“July 24 marks the twenty-ninth anniversary of the 1991 budget. On this day, India embarked on a bold new path of economic transformation. Rao and Dr Manmohan Singh played a pivotal role in ushering in the era of liberalisation,” he added.The Congress has earlier been accused of distancing itself from the former prime minister. When Rao died in 2004, unlike other prime ministers and party chiefs, his mortal remains were kept outside the AICC office. Rao’s grandson, NV Subhash, even went on record to say that he had been ‘sidelined’ by the party. Subash told a news agency that Sonia and Rahul should apologise for the ‘injustice’ done to him. Rao, who started his career as a young party worker, served as a legislator in erstwhile undivided Andhra Pradesh from 1957 to 1977. As a cabinet minister (1962 to 1970), he handled various portfolios, after which he served as the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh in 1971.In 1972, Rao became a member of parliament and finally took over as prime minister in 1991. Rao is considered one the architects of the LPG (liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation) policies in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-rahul-gandhi-praise-bold-pv-narasimha-rao-neglected-for-years/story-BMYuOfBrrGVaHn49xWcPCK.html

24-07-2020||India||Narasimha Rao can truly be called father of economic reforms in India: Manmohan Singh||Former prime minister P V Narasimha Rao was a “great son of the soil” and he can truly be called the father of economic reforms in India as he had both the vision and the courage to push them forward, Manmohan Singh, who was finance minister in his cabinet, said on Friday.Singh, while addressing the inaugural function of the year-long birth centenary celebrations of the late prime minister organised by the Congress’s Telangana unit, said he is particularly happy that the programme coincides with the presentation of the first budget of Rao’s government by him in 1991.The 1991 budget is hailed by many as one that laid the foundations of a modern India and the roadmap for pushing economic reforms in the country.Recalling that he as finance minister in the Narasimha Rao cabinet had dedicated his first budget to the memory of Rajiv Gandhi, Singh said the 1991 budget changed India in many ways as it ushered in economic reforms and liberalisation.“It was a hard choice and a bold decision and it was possible because prime minister Narasimha Rao gave me the freedom to roll out things, after he fully understood what was ailing India’s economy at that time,” Singh, a former prime minister, said online.“On this day, while inaugurating his birth centenary celebrations, I pay my humble respects to the man who had the vision and the courage to push these reforms,” the Congress leader said, adding that Rao, like former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, had great concern for the country’s poor. Singh also said that Rao was a “friend, philosopher and guide” to him in many ways. Real tough decisions had to be urgently taken in 1991 as India was faced with a foreign exchange crisis, and with foreign exchange reserves down to about two weeks’ imports, it brought the nation to the edge of a precipice, he said. “But then, politically, it was a big question if one could take hard decisions to meet the challenging situation. It was a precariously placed minority government, which was dependent on outside support for stability. Yet Narasimha Rao ji was able to carry everyone along, convincing them with his conviction. Enjoying his confidence, I went about my job to carry forward his vision,” Singh said.Quoting French poet and novelist Victor Hugo, Singh said he had once said that “no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come”. India’s emergence as a major economic power was one such idea, he said. “There was an arduous journey ahead but it was time to let the whole world know loud and clear that India was wide awake. The rest is history. Looking back, Narasimha Rao can truly be called the father of economic reforms in India,” the former prime minister said.Singh also recalled the political journey of Rao that started from the days of the freedom struggle.Rao as a Union cabinet minister had held important portfolios of human resource development and external affairs, and was an important member of the Congress, who had worked very closely with late Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, he said. Singh said Rao was chosen to become the Congress president after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and became the automatic choice to become prime minister on June 21, 1991. “It was on this day that he made me his finance minister,” he said.While economic reforms and liberalisation were indeed his biggest contribution, his contributions to the country in different fields cannot be underestimated, Singh said On the foreign affairs front, he said Rao made efforts to improve the “relationship with our neighbours including China and India signed the South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement along with the SAARC countries”. “Then the ‘Look East Policy’ was also his brainchild to link India with East and South-East Asian countries,” the Congress leader said.It was also under his leadership that the Indian space programme got an impetus with the successful testing of the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) and the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Singh recalled.He noted that India also successfully tested the Prithvi missile to strengthen and enhance external security capability then.Rao had also asked late Dr APJ Abdul Kalam in 1996 to get ready for nuclear tests to take India to join a new league, which were later conducted by under the prime minister Vajpayee-led NDA Government in 1998, Singh said.“That was a difficult era in politics. Endowed with a cool temperament and deep political prowess Narasimha Rao ji was always open to debates and discussion. He always tried to take the opposition into confidence,” he said, adding that deputing Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the leader of the Indian delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission was one such example.Former prime minister Rao left behind an unmatched legacy of being a linguist, well versed in 10 Indian and four foreign languages and a scholar, Singh said. He was one of the first converts to new technology by not only becoming adept with using a computer but also became proficient with programming. This was possible because he was always willing to learn new things, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narasimha-rao-can-truly-be-called-father-of-economic-reforms-in-india-manmohan-singh/story-bXkxbjotr1lsrmj1ISYWCN.html

However, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, it could not happen,” he said.“Now, as August 5 was suddenly fixed as the bhoomi pujan date, we decided to gather the soil and water from the places that we could visit and send it to Ayodhya,” he added.As part of the exercise, we collected the soil from RSS headquarters in Nagpur and from Shree Ram Mandir in Ramtek, besides water from Ambhora (confluence of five rivers), Shende said.“The intention is that we will feel that we have also taken part in the bhoomi pujan ceremony,” he said.According to him, the soil and water has been sent to Ayodhya by courier on Thursday.On Wednesday, a member of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra trust had said in Pune that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would attend the ground-breaking ceremony of the Ram temple on August 5.The trust member, Swami Govind Devgiri Maharaj, had also said that in view of the coronavirus pandemic, only 200 people would attend the ceremony and all social distancing norms will be followed at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soil-from-rss-hq-sent-to-ayodhya-for-ram-temple-bhoomi-pujan/story-tSfkobK8H7tHdoPS6GgYQP.html

On Thursday night, the wild elephant got electrocuted, when it came in contact with the farm’s electric wires,” Pandey said.In June, six elephants were killed in the state’s four districts, including carcasses of two tuskers were recovered from the Pratappur forest range in Surajpur district and another was found dead in the neighbouring Balrampur district.Later, two elephants were electrocuted at Dharamjaigarh in Raigarh district and a calf died after getting stuck at a marshland in Dhamtari district.The state forest department took cognisance of a spate of elephant deaths and launched an awareness campaign in June in the northern plains to encourage farmers to use bio-insecticides and bio-fertilisers.The authorities have also issued an order to divisional forest officer (DFO) of Dharamjaigarh in Raigarh district, which has reported the maximum number of elephant deaths by electrocution in the last 10 years and directed him to take necessary steps to prevent such incidents. The order stated that the forest department should ensure that 11 kilo-volts (KV) of power transmission lines, which have caused deaths of pachyderms should be installed 7.5 metres above the ground-level and insulated electric wires should be used in these areas that fall within the elephant corridor.Forest officials have been directed to coordinate with Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company Limited (CSPGCL) in a bid to detect illegal connections and live wires in areas that fall in the elephant corridor.The state forest department data showed that the population of wild elephants in Chhattisgarh has risen from 225 to 290 in the past 10 years.Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has issued guidelines for the monitoring of wild animals and also improving measures for their conservation.North Chhattisgarh is home to around 240 wild elephants, which have claimed several human lives and loss of properties in the region over the past few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-wild-elephant-killed-in-jashpur-district-seventh-death-in-last-two-months/story-D0iE5970ej0wBEAPm1RILP.html
24-07-2020||India||Three arrested in Mumbai over 43,000 litres of ‘smuggled’ diesel found in a boat||Mumbai crime branch officials have arrested three members of an alleged diesel smuggling group following the recovery of 43,104 litres of diesel worth Rs 35 lakh from a tugboat at the New Ferry Wharf, Bhaucha Dhakka, Mazgaon. The accused are suspected to have smuggled the diesel from foreign commercial vessels at sea.Assistant police inspector, Sachin Vaze, in-charge of the crime intelligence unit (CIU) recently received specific intelligence about the movement of some members of a diesel smuggling racket. Acting on the input, Vaze’s team on July 18 visited a jetty at the New Ferry Wharf located at Bhaucha Dhakka, Mazgaon and found a tugboat ‘Barsaatu’ there.The boat is owned by Hind Offshore Private Limited, having its office at Ballard Estate. Barsaatu is at the New Ferry Wharf Jetty since May 29, 2020 and there were nine crew members on board.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOn examining the tug boat in presence of panchas (witnesses) the police found 43,104 litres of diesel worth nearly Rs 35 lakh on the boat. When crime branch officials asked boat’s chief engineer Debashish Vishwas, 48, and master Ismail Mujawar, 59, about the diesel they could not give satisfactory answers or produce any relevant documents. They were asked to produce relevant documents justifying the presence of huge quantities of diesel by July 21, however, they failed.Preliminary probe revealed that the boat in question wasn’t in operations by the company since the last three years, despite that it was being used for some other purposes, as per an official.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Investigators suspect that the accused used the boat to either steal the diesel or illegally procure it from other foreign vessels at sea to further illegally sell it in the black market,” said a crime branch official requesting anonymity.On July 23, the police arrested superintendent of the boat Rajesh Kute, chief engineer Vishwas and master Mujawar under sections 3, 7, 8 and 9 of Essential Commodities Act and 379 and 120B of Indian Penal Code. They were produced in a court on Friday and remanded in police custody up to July 27.The police are looking for the directors of the company for questioning.However, the lawyer of the arrested accused, Ravi Hirani said, “My clients have legally purchased the said diesel and have relevant documents to prove the same. The said diesel has not been procured by stealing, if that was the case then why is there not even a single complaint from any one till date. It is a totally false case against my clients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-arrested-in-mumbai-over-43-000-litres-of-smuggled-diesel-found-in-a-boat/story-bzbPDwEIVKbQDeAlKLBkcP.html
24-07-2020||India||Rajasthan HC defers order in Pilot vs Gehlot case: Issue and implications||The Rajasthan high court (HC) on Friday deferred its final verdict on the plea filed by 19 rebel Congress lawmakers, including sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot challenging the assembly Speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notice.It admitted the case and framed 12 legal questions that it will examine. Since the matter has been admitted, it is unlikely to come up for hearing for long.HC ordered the Speaker to maintain status quo effectively barring him from acting on the notice of disqualification.What are the implications of the HC order?1. Speaker Joshi cannot decide disqualification plea against Pilot and other members of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs) for the time being.2. When can the Speaker act?If the Supreme Court (SC) stays the HC order, then the Speaker can act. The SC is slated to take up the matter for hearing on Monday on the larger legal question of HC’s jurisdiction to interfere with a Speaker’s proceedings. If the SC on Monday stays the HC order, then he can proceed with the disqualification proceedings.But such relief is unlikely because the SC had declined stay, when the matter was heard on Thursday.If the SC does not stay the HC order, then the Speaker cannot act until the HC pronounces its verdict one way or the other.This will take a while since the HC has admitted the matter for a hearing, which means the case will draft on for long.3. What are the issues that the SC is examining?The SC is deciding the limited legal question of whether an HC can interfere with the disqualification proceedings initiated by the Speaker before he gives his decision on the disqualification plea.The SC in its 1992 judgment in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillu had held that that judicial review should not cover any stage prior to the making of a decision by the Speaker/Chairman. No interference would be permissible at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings, the court had said.The court is proposing to re-examine this legal principle. If the three-judge SC bench, which is currently hearing the case, thinks that the five-judge bench judgment needs re-consideration, then it might have to send the matter to a larger bench of seven judges.In that scenario, the SC verdict will also take long.4. What are the issues HC is hearing?HC will examine the Constitutional validity of clause 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule. The 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India contains provisions relating to disqualification of lawmakers for defection. Clause 2(1)(a) lays down that voluntarily giving up membership of the political party on whose ticket the lawmaker was elected.The Pilot camp has contended that voicing opinion against party leadership does not amount to “voluntarily giving up membership” and clause 2(1)(a) to the extent it prohibits the expression of opinion violates the basic structure of the constitution and freedom of speech under Article 19 of the Constitution.Besides, HC will also decide the validity of the Speaker’s notice issued on July 14.HC will frame 12 issues which it will consider.5. Has HC said it will wait for SC order?HC has not expressly mentioned in its Friday order that it would wait for the SC order before it hears the case again.But since the case has been admitted by HC, it is not likely to come up for hearing for long.The SC has clarified that the HC judgement would be subject to the outcome of the proceedings before it. As a result, HC might not take up the matter again until the SC settles the legal question.6. What other legal option does the Speaker has now?The options are limited. Speaker Joshi can challenge the Friday’s order before the SC by way of a fresh appeal. But since Joshi had already challenged the July 21 order of HC, which had also postponed his action, the subject matter of both the appeals will be the same. In such a scenario, the new appeal is also likely to be tagged along with the pending appeal and heard together and might not yield any desired result.The matter in all likelihood would be rendered infructuous as far as Joshi is concerned.7. What are the key takeaways?Advantage Pilot as far as the legal battle is concerned. The HC order of status quo on Speaker will mean that Joshi cannot disqualify the rebel MLAs for the time being. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot has to ensure that his 101 MLAs remain with him.The full strength of the 200-member Rajasthan assembly will vote in the event of a no-confidence motion. At present, Gehlot has a wafer-thin majority if all the members in the assembly votes, a change in the stance of one or two MLAs can bring down the government. But if either, the HC or the SC had allowed the Speaker to act on the disqualification plea, Joshi might have proceeded with the disqualification of 19 MLAs. This would have brought down the strength of the assembly to 181 making it easier for Gehlot to secure a victory in the event of a floor test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-the-rajasthan-high-court-order-entails/story-VvBf3yoASOQdZGKzb4iTHI.html
24-07-2020||India||Team Ashok Gehlot claims 109 MLAs on its side, asks Guv to call assembly ASAP||Chief minister Ashok Gehlot rode a bus with Congress lawmakers to Raj Bhavan on Friday afternoon to persuade Governor Kalraj Mishra to convene the Rajasthan assembly by Monday to let him face a trust vote. Gehlot’s meeting with the governor came moments after he accused Raj Bhavan of holding back orders to convene the assembly by Monday to let him prove his majority in the 200-member assembly.Gehlot, who has been fighting off a rebellion led by his former deputy Sachin Pilot for weeks, wants to clear the floor test before Pilot’s camp or the rival Bharatiya Janata Party is able to deplete the ruling party’s numbers. He told reporters before leaving for Raj Bhavan that he had requested Kalraj Mishra to convene the assembly session at their 20-minute meeting on Thursday, and followed up with a phone conversation.But the governor was under pressure from the top, he said, a reference to the BJP-led central government.As four buses - Gehlot was sitting in one of them - drove into Raj Bhavan, Transport Minister Pratap Singh told reporters what Gehlot would tell Kalraj Mishra.“We have the majority… the government has the support of 109 MLAs,” Pratap Singh said.This is the first time that the Ashok Gehlot’s team has put a number on the lawmakers that it expects to support the ruling government in the assembly.Gehlot’s meeting with the governor - lawmakers in tow - was designed to message that he was running out of patience, and time and would keep the spotlight on Raj Bhavan.As Gehlot emerged from his meeting with the governor - his second in 24 hours - scores of lawmakers who had been waiting in Raj Bhavan’s lawns raised slogans, pledging to fight for justice. For now, that translates into an early assembly session.It is not clear if the Congress’ count of 109 MLAs includes some of the 18 MLAs of Pilot’s camp who have been camping in Gurugram hotels. Gehlot did yesterday claim that some of them wanted to back him but weren’t allowed to leave by bouncers at the hotel.An independent assessment of the breakup of the 200-member Rajasthan assembly had earlier indicated that the Gehlot camp has 101 legislators and the Pilot camp, 22 including 19 Congress rebels and three independents.The Opposition has 75 MLAs, including 72 of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and three of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party.Before the Ashok Gehlot vs Sachin Pilot feud blew up earlier this month, the Congress government had the support of 125 lawmakers in the assembly. The immediate trigger for the revolt was a communication from the police that asked Sachin Pilot, then deputy chief minister, to give his statement on attempts to influence lawmakers in last month’s Rajya Sabha elections.Gehlot has insisted that it had been building up for months, even revealing that he had Pilot hadn’t been on talking terms for 18 months. For the last six months, Gehlot alleged, Pilot’s camp had been trying to lure Congress MLAs in a conspiracy that had originated in the Bharatiya Janata Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/team-ashok-gehlot-claims-109-mlas-on-its-side-asks-guv-to-call-assembly-asap/story-z8KolewlWRZWbNnSvv4wjM.html
24-07-2020||India||Two more CBI officers probing Tuticorin custodial killings test positive for Covid-19||Two more officers of the CBI team that probed the Tuticorin custodial death case tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, while one of the accused policemen is found to have contracted the virus. The CBI office cum quarters at Athikulam here, where the investigation was held and four officers from Delhi were staying, has been sealed and disinfected. While two officers tested positive for the virus on Wednesday, the others on Friday, officials said. The police personnel arrested in connection with the case and lodged in the central prison here has been placed under quarantine, they added. The father-son duo, Jeyaraj and his son Bennicks died in a hospital in Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district, after they were allegedly thrashed by the personnel at Sathankulam police station. The state government has transferred the case to CBI following public outrage over the incident. The CBI has swung into action as soon as it received a reference from the Centre to proceed with its investigation and had dispatched a team from its special crime unit. The team reached the location on July 10 and collected crucial forensic evidence and met a large number of people during the field work, possibly exposing the members to the contagious pathogen. The father and son were arrested by Sathankulam police for alleged violation of prohibitory orders in force due to Covid-19 lockdown by keeping their mobile phone shop open in Tuticorin district beyond the allowed time. They were taken to jail in the early hours of June 20. While Bennicks died on June 22, his father Jeyaraj succumbed to injuries within hours on June 23. The ghastly manner in which the two were allegedly beaten by police personnel had evoked a sharp response from civil society, movie industry and political parties, resulting in the recommendation of the CBI probe by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-more-cbi-officers-probing-tuticorin-custodial-killings-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-pyAWbcPkS56uEx2VM9H0LL.html
24-07-2020||India||Bihar assembly’s monsoon session to be held at convention centre to follow social distancing norms||For the first time, the full session of the Bihar Legislature will be held outside the assembly premises to conform to the norms of social distancing in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has badly affected Patna. The brief four-day monsoon session, the last session of the 16th Assembly, is scheduled from August 3. Sources said that it could also be further truncated, but the decision would only be taken at the customary all-party meeting before the start of the session or the business advisory committee meeting comprising members from various political parties, which happens on the first day of the session itself. Since Governor Phagu Chouhan has already summoned the Legislative Assembly on the recommendation of the Cabinet, the Bihar government, acting on the request of the Bihar Legislative Assembly, has recommended that he should issue a modified letter. Bihar assembly speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the secretariat had written to the Bihar government that it would not be possible to hold the assembly session in the Central Hall, which does not have space to accommodate 243 members with the proper seating arrangement. “The government was requested to look for some other place where social distancing norms could be properly followed, as that is a prerequisite in the prevailing situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The government has selected Gyan Bhawan at the Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre for it, as it has enough space and open entry and exit points,” said Choudhary. The state-of-the-art Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre to the north of Gandhi Maidan was inaugurated in 2017 and is one of the iconic structures of the Nitish Kumar government. Choudhary said that the session of the Bihar Legislative Assembly would be held in the conference hall on the second floor, which has a seating capacity of 800, while the session of the Bihar Legislative Council would be held in the meeting hall on the first floor. Bihar is one of the five states which have bicameral legislature with two Houses. Bihar Vidhan Sabha has 243 members, with no vacancy, at present. Earlier this month, there was a plan to hold the assembly session in the Central Hall, built on the lines of Parliament’s Central Hall. However, with the infection spreading to new areas and the number of positive cases crossing the 1000-mark consistently over the last fortnight, it was found inadequate. “Despite trying various combinations, we could not ensure more than one-and-half feet distance between two members in the central hall. Ultimately, the Speaker said that the government should be asked to explore other options. For the Bihar Legislative Council, however, there is no space issue, as the 75-member House has 21 vacancies. But both Houses need to run close by. The ministers often have to shift from one House to another,” said a senior Vidhan Sabha official. The Budget session of the Bihar Legislature had come to a premature end on March 16, 15 days before schedule, in view of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic following a unanimous decision at the business advisory committee. It was scheduled to end on March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-assembly-s-monsoon-session-to-be-held-at-convention-centre-to-follow-social-distancing-norms/story-7HzS5jHDErhOcApoLmfwXP.html

It’s tough and hazardous to go on sets but I know God will take care of me. I have full gratitude towards almighty for getting a role in the period when here is hardly any work happening.” The actor is playing the role of Parvati. “Getting the role of a goddess that too in the holy month of Shravan is a blessing. I am taking it as a very positive message. I come from the land of Baba Vishwanath and feel very thankful towards him.”Sharing what all precautions she is taking while on work for her show, ‘Kahat Hanuman Jai Shree Ram’, she said, “From my end, I am taking all safety measures that I can because I stay with my parents so I have to be extra cautious. Since I have started to shoot I am maintaining adequate distance from them. I am doing my own make-up by myself as it takes one hour to get ready for my role so I manage maximum things on my own,” said the young actor.After playing Sita, this is her second mythological show. “I feel really positive and happy while I am playing such iconic roles. But, for an actor, there are also limitations while playing goddess — I need to maintain poise, calm, composure and dignity. At times I find it tough too as while essaying such roles we have to be very focused and controlled.”Vidita had done her schooling from Azamgarh and her graduation from Agrasen College in Varanasi followed by an online MBA degree, “I lived in Kabir Chaura locality and started doing theatre from very early days. I even won Miss Varanasi title. Director Ajay Mehra came to the city for audition and he was looking for new a face for DD1 show ‘Caudaha Phere’ based on Shivani’s novel. I auditioned and was selected for the role. That was my debut.”Her father also shifted to Mumbai. “Thankfully, I had great family support and being a small-town girl, he chose to come with me. During early days I used to work and travel to Varanasi by train to appear for my examinations. I started modelling and also did about 11 movies down South.”She barely knew the South industry when she started to take up work. “I was totally unaware of the industry and took up work as they were giving good money. Later, I came to know that it’s such a big industry and I have done films in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam.”Then she decided to do TV. “People knew me in South but in the Hindi belt people didn’t know me. So I knew to become a known face so for that TV was the best medium. So I opted for TV and luckily, I got a good break in ‘Yeh Hai Mohabbatein’ for which I got nomination for best debutant. Then I played Sita in ‘Shrimad Bhadwad’ and antagonist in ‘Meri Gudiya’,” she concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucky-to-get-work-in-such-a-tough-phase-vidisha-srivastava/story-h4mlu1rJsIbDr0qPJ1zPYK.html

The petitioner also questioned the assembly speaker’s alleged inaction following his complaint seeking disqualification of these six legislators under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution in March this year.The bench of Justice Mahendra Kumar Goyal will hear the petition on Monday.According to the petition, speaker CP Joshi declared six BSP MLAs – Sandeep Yadav, (Tijara), Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kisangarh Bas), Lakhan Meena (Karauli) and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati) – as having merged with the Congress on September 18, 2019.Dilawar, MLA from Ramganj Mandi constituency in Kota district, has challenged the validity, legality and correctness of the speaker’s order.Earlier, he moved a petition before the speaker on March 16 under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India to pray for disqualification of these six MLAs. That remains still undecided.The petitioner questions the delay in deciding his petition citing the recent instance of the speaker issuing notices to 19 Congress MLAs led by Sachin Pilot on the same day of receiving a petition for their disqualification from party chief whip Mahesh Joshi.The petitioner has prayed to the HC to stay the speaker’s merger order during the pendency of the writ petition in the interest of justice and law.The Congress has 107 MLAs in the 200-member assembly, including these six BSP MLAs; 19 Congress MLAs have turned rebel against chief minister Ashok Gehlot and are housed in a resort in Manesar. A decision on the BSP legislators’ status may impact the strength of Gehlot camp in the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-challenges-6-bsp-mlas-merger-with-congress-as-gehlot-eyes-floor-test/story-xgKuRv78AwDrxrxDjFHIgK.html

He has accused the governor of stalling on the question of convening an assembly session. The development came after the Rajasthan high court ordered status quo to be maintained in the disqualification case against rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs.The CM, who had been expecting the orders to convene the House session last night, had warned that if they are not issued today, he will be meeting governor Mishra at the Raj Bhawan, requesting him to make the decision. He wants the session to be called on Monday.The Congress MLAs, who the CM claims are over 100 in number, flashed the victory sign for the posse of cameramen as the buses drove through the gates to the governor’s house.Upon reaching, CM Gehlot headed straight to meet governor Kalraj Mishra, while the lawmakers were seen sitting under the sun in the Raj Bhawan garden. The MLAs resorted to sloganeering. “Inquilab Zindabad, Ashok Gehlot Zindabad” slogans rend the air on a crisp cool summer afternoon on the expansive lawns of the governor’s house. Soon after the governor, accompanied by CM Gehlot, came to the lawns to meet the MLAs. An independent assessment of the breakup of the 200-member Rajasthan assembly had earlier indicated that the Gehlot camp has 101 legislators and the Pilot camp, 22 including 19 Congress rebels and three independents.The Opposition has 75 MLAs, including 72 of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and three of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-with-mlas-in-tow-lands-at-governor-s-house/story-XZxsDnBPWcvYk1B6Ktno3M.html

24-07-2020||India||India builds trade barriers with China amid border row||India slapped new trade curbs on some of its neighbors, in a move primarily seen aimed at keeping Chinese businesses out after a border conflict and worsening economic ties between the two nations.Companies from nations that share a land border with India are barred from bidding for government contracts for goods and services until they register with the industry department, according to an official statement. Previously, New Delhi had made it mandatory for suppliers to mention the country of origin on the government’s e-Marketplace while bidding for tenders.The measure is the latest in a series of steps taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to wean India away from reliance on China -- New Delhi’s biggest source of imports. Earlier, the administration banned the use of 59 Chinese apps, while goods purchased from China were delayed at Indian ports after a deadly conflict between the neighbors along a disputed Himalayan border left several soldiers dead on both sides.India’s move to firewall key sectors from Chinese presence signals that the south Asian nation is willing to bear costs in the short run in order to reduce exposure of critical sectors, said Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London. “Such moves are a calculated response to shape Chinese calculus on the border issue which is getting serious by the day in the absence of any commitment by the Chinese to resolve it amicably.”The development comes at a time when both the nations are engaged in talks to defuse a border stand off. India on Thursday said it expects the Chinese side to be sincere in completing the disengagement of troops along the Line of Actual Control.A spokesman of the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a text message whether recent curbs are aimed at China while a spokesperson of the prime minister’s office was not immediately reachable over phone during office hours.Other key points from the latest move:The step of further tightening of rules for bidding process was taken as border disengagement and de-escalation are not moving in a positive direction, said Pant. “Tensions with China are already high with growing consensus in India that the Chinese Communist Party seems in no mood to diplomatically resolve the border crisis.”India imported goods worth over $70 billion from China in 2019 while the bilateral trade deficit stood at about $50 billion, much higher than with any other trading parter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-builds-trade-barriers-with-china-amid-border-row/story-n3R5loDz5zioRtkRzy5s3M.html

The petitioner sought a direction to restrain “Bhoomi Pujan” for laying down the foundation stone of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya during the period of pandemic as it is in violation of protocol prescribed by the central government. According to petitioner, about three hundred people have been invited at a single place on August 5 and that may cause violation of the protocol prescribed by the government of India and government of Uttar Pradesh for the purpose of maintaining ‘social and physical distancing’ to combat Covid-19 pandemic.According to the petitioner, such an event, which may attract public gathering at the site, must not be allowed by the state government. The Bench, however refused to interfere in the matter while observing, “The entire petition for writ is based on assumptions and there is no foundation for apprehending violation of the prescribed protocol.”It further added: “At present, we expect the organisers and the government of Uttar Pradesh to ensure all the protocols applicable for social and physical distancing. In view of whatever stated above, we do not find any just reason to interfere in the matter.

24-07-2020||India||27-yr-old lab technician from UP’s Kanpur killed within a week of kidnapping: Police||Police on Friday said a lab technician who was kidnapped last month was killed within a week of being held captive.While the man’s family claimed that Rs 30 lakh ransom was paid for his release in the presence of police, Circle Officer Vikas Pandey said the allegation was not true.Senior Superintendent of Police (Kanpur) Dinesh Kumar Prabhu said that several suspects were detained and grilled intensively, and two of them confessed to the crime.He said the accused initially tried to mislead the police, but later they disclosed that they kidnapped 27-year-old S Yadav, and killed him either on June 26 or June 27. They further confessed that they disposed of Yadav’s body in Pandu river, the SSP said, adding that the accused had worked together with Yadav in another pathology lab.The family had earlier appeared before the media and claimed that they had thrown a bag containing Rs 30 lakh from a flyover to railway tracks in the presence of police and also did whatever the kidnappers demanded, but the accused did not free the victim.Circle Officer Vikas Pandey said that no ransom money was paid for his release in the presence of police and the allegation was not true. He confirmed that five people, including a woman, were arrested in connection with the case.The Uttar Pradesh government has, however, asked ADG (Police Headquarters) V P Jogdand to immediately reach Kanpur to probe whether ransom was paid to the kidnappers or not.According to an official spokesman in Lucknow, the government has suspended SP (South) Aprana Gupta and then circle officer Manoj Gupta in public interest. Besides the SSP has suspended former SHO (Barra) Ranjit Rai and chowki incharge Rajesh Kumar for laxity in investigation, the spokesman said. The SSP said several police teams, including crime branch and surveillance, have been directed to find the victim’s body and arrest all those involved in the crime, the SSP said.Efforts are also being made to trace the victim’s motorcycle and mobile phone which have been missing since he was kidnapped, the SSP said.“Kuldeep, who had worked with Yadav at another pathology lab, invited him for a liquor party at his rented accommodation in Ratanlal Nagar,” CO Vikas Pandey said, adding that the victim was injected with sedatives and kept hostage for about five days.He was sedated whenever he regained consciousness during captivity, CO said, adding, Kuldeep with the help of others murdered him either on June 26 or 27 and he kept the body in his car and dumped it into the Pandu river.The SSP said that on June 22, Yadav, a resident of Barra area, was kidnapped and his family filed a missing complaint with Barra police station the next day.Just three days later, the charges were changed into kidnapping charges.The victim’s family alleged that the kidnappers had called on the mobile phone of his father, Chaman Singh Yadav, and demanded Rs 30 lakh for his release.The SSP took cognisance of a media report that claimed a ransom of Rs 30 lakh was given to the kidnappers.“I am talking to the aggrieved family. If anyone is wrong, they will be punished,” he said.The SSP had also assured the family about the safe return of the victim and said that if any ransom was paid it would be recovered.Opposition parties, including Congress and BSP condemned the killing of the lab technician and alleged that there was “jungle raj” in the state.BSP president Mayawati in a tweet said, “In another incident during the jungle raj in UP, the body of Sanjit Yadav was thrown into the river by his kidnappers in Kanpur. This is very sad and condemnable. The state government needs to immediately come into action specially in the matters of crime control and law and order.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said the law and order in Uttar Pradesh has completely collapsed.After taking the life of a common man, now public proclamations are being made about it, she said, adding that be it home, road, office, no one feels safe anywhere. “After Vikram Joshi, now abducted Sanjeet Yadav in Kanpur has been killed. The police got the money paid to the kidnappers and he was killed as well. A new ‘gundaraj’ has come into being,” Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.“In this jungle raj, law and order has surrendered before the goons,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/27-yr-old-lab-technician-from-up-s-kanpur-killed-within-a-week-of-kidnapping-police/story-FrN8DuArnMCKHE3VAgcxwL.html

Boundary question falls within bilateral scope [between] #China & #India. We have wisdom & capability to properly handle differences. No need for third party interference,” he tweeted shortly before 1 am.Sun said in a second tweet: “Real challenges in #SouthChinaSea come from powers outside the region stirring up territorial & maritime disputes & undermining regional peace & stability. On #HongKong affairs, #China’s HK allows no foreign interference.”Also read| Chinese actions are a challenge for the world community: British envoyAlso Watch | ‘Closing more Chinese consulates in US always possible’: Donald Trump Barton had made the remarks in his first news briefing after presenting his credentials. However, the British envoy had also made it clear that the India-China border standoff was a bilateral matter that the UK had no desire to be a part of.“From the UK perspective, obviously we’re not part of that nor do we want to be,” Barton had said while responding to a specific question on the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), where India and China have arrayed tens of thousands of troops since May. Barton had also been critical of China’s actions in the former British colony of Hong Kong and the South China Sea.“There are challenges around the world on all sorts of Chinese actions, for us Hong Kong particularly is a focus, clearly for India the LAC is a particular focus,” he said.“These are concerning things and our hope would be that there can be de-escalation, and tensions do seem to have eased over the last week or two after the tragic loss of lives,” he said, referring to the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a clash with Chinese forces along the LAC on June 15.The envoy welcomed progress by India and China in managing tensions and the commitment by the two Special Representatives on the border issue to disengage and de-escalate. “I hope we’re not about to see a change in that,” he said.Britain had its own concerns about a range of Chinese actions and had also decided to remove Chinese technology giant Huawei’s equipment from all its telecommunications networks by 2027 because of security concerns, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-reacts-to-uk-envoy-s-remarks-on-india-china-stand-off-says-no-need-for-any-interference/story-tzdLFghXcH72d5OqhsweVM.html

This papad will be helpful in our fight against the viral outbreak,” the minister can be heard saying in the video clip.A minister putting out hearsay information on social media evoked both strong and bemused reactions from the public and also his political rivals.“Fight against Covid-19 update: US govt: We are developing a vaccine. UK govt: We are in stage-III of clinical trials. Indian govt: Ye lo Bhabhiji papad. It will help fight corona,” one person tweeted.Another person tweeted that it seemed the government has found an alternative to the Covid-19 vaccine. “Why spend millions of dollars on vaccine development, when you can sit at home and eat papad to protect yourself from Covid-19?

In a thinly veiled warning, he said his government would not be responsible if people gherao the Raj Bhavan tomorrow.The CM’s announcement came shortly after the Rajasthan high court ordered status quo to be maintained in the disqualification case against rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs.“We cannot understand the pressure under which the governor is not calling the session... If tomorrow, people of the state come to gherao the Raj Bhawan, we won’t be responsible,” said the CM.Gehlot said he wanted the assembly session to be convened in order to discuss issues - including coronavirus and the political situation. Expecting the orders to be issued last night itself, the CM said it hasn’t happened till now. If the orders aren’t issued, Gehlot said, then all MLAs will be meeting governor Mishra at the Raj Bhawan, requesting him to make the decision. “We want the assembly session from Monday, and there things will be clear,” he added. Reacting to the development, Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia said: “Why is Gehlot so desperate for a session? His comment that people of Rajasthan will picket Raj Bhawan is sad. He should have patience and maintain the dignity of language. Looks like Gehlot is looking for a way to send out his opponents out of the party and Assembly.”Reiterating his charge that “our colleagues (rebel MLAs) are held hostage” under BJP-ruled government in Haryana, the CM said they have been calling asking to be rescued.“This entire game is of BJP and its leaders’ conspiracy. Like they did in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, they want to do the same in Rajasthan but all MLAs and public are with us,” said Gehlot.The number of lawmakers present at the two Congress legislature party meetings indicated that the Gehlot government would be able to stay in power even if with a wafer-thin majority. At the third meeting held this week, Gehlot urged the legislators to stand firm like a rock as the country is watching them.The Rajasthan CM hasn’t put a number of lawmakers on his side yet. “You’ll get to know the exact number when we win the floor test by a thumping majority. This time, every MLA will hear the voice of his conscience and vote,” Gehlot told HT on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-understand-why-governor-is-not-calling-the-assembly-session-says-rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot/story-NeiKX7EkSoQ1IJaXXmRZqN.html

Gandhi said, as a result, “disaster followed”. He said he keeps warning the government concerning the situation with China as well.“I kept warning them on Covid19 and the economy. They rubbished it. Disaster followed. I keep warning them on China. They’re rubbishing it,” Gandhi said in a tweet on Friday. On Thursday, Gandhi released a video message wherein he said that the situation with China can be resolved only when India creates a global vision to take on the crisis.  “If you deal with them (China) with a position of strength, you can deal with them. It requires a vision, an international vision,” he said.I kept warning them on Covid19 and the economy. They rubbished it. Disaster followed. I keep warning them on China. They’re rubbishing it.“We’re fighting among ourselves, look at the politics. An Indian is fighting an Indian. This shows there is no clear cut vision going forward,” he added.This comes as Gandhi’s latest jibe at the Centre in his series attacks this week. Earlier this week, Gandhi took to Twitter and posted that the prime minister has fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power which has now become India’s biggest weakness as he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’.The Congress leader posted a video message on Twiter and wrote, “PM fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power.

The veteran leader recorded the case before the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Lucknow through video-conferencing.On Thursday, the court recorded the statement of another BJP veteran Murli Manohar Joshi in the case. Joshi had told the special CBI court that he was innocent and implicated in the case by the then Congress government at the Centre.The 86-year-old leader had also called the prosecution witnesses in the case as “liars”.“The entire investigation was conducted under the political influence and he was charged on the basis of false and fabricated evidence,” Joshi told the court.The court recorded Joshi’s statement in the presence of his counsel Vimal Kumar Srivastava, K K Mishra and Abhishek Ranjan.The counsel for prosecution agency CBI, Lalit Singh, R K Yadav and P Chakravarti too were present in the court during its proceeding.The court is recording the statements of as many as 32 accused in the case after examination of the prosecution witnesses.It is conducting a day-to-day hearing in the case to complete its trial by August 31 as directed by the Supreme Court. BJP leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Uma Bharti had appeared in person earlier this month before the court to make her deposition in the case. In her testimony, she too had accused the then Congress government at the Centre of implicating her in the case due to political vendetta.The Babri mosque in Ayodhya was brought down on December 6, 1992 by kar sevaks who believed the structure was built on the birth place of Hindu God Ram.The decades-old dispute over the site was settled last year when the Supreme Court ordered that the site be given to a trust to build a temple, and that alternative land be provided in Ayodhya for a mosque. Advani, Joshi, and others have been accused of being involved in the conspiracy to demolish the mosque.The foundation-stone laying ceremony of the temple is expected to be held in the first week of August with the Prime Minister in attendance. Advani, too, is expected to attend the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babri-demolition-case-lk-advani-deposes-before-cbi-court/story-xYlEBAocYeskOiBnBsnaNO.html

A bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta allowed the application that was moved by the petitioners on Thursday. The court then adjourned for 20 minutes.The application for impleadment was moved on the grounds that the constitutional amendment is under challenge and, therefore, the Union of India is a necessary party now.The dissident Congress MLAs led by Pilot have challenged their disqualification notices through the writ petition which was taken up by the bench on Friday last week and arguments were held.The hearing continued on Monday and the arguments concluded on Tuesday. The court on Tuesday said it will give appropriate order on the writ petition on Friday.  The notices to MLAs were served after the party complained to the Speaker that the legislators had defied a whip to attend two Congress Legislature Party meetings, on Monday and Tuesday last week.The Pilot camp, however, argued that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.In its complaint to the Legislative Assembly Speaker, the Congress had sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2 (1) (a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution.The provision disqualifies MLAs if they ‘voluntarily’ give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.Pilot was sacked as deputy chief minister and the president of the state unit of the party after he rebelled against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.

I would have shot him myself,” said Richa.Recalling the incident, Richa said that Vikas called her at 2 am on July 3 asking her to leave Bikru village. “He said that policemen are being attacked, you take our kids and leave. I told him that ‘I am fed up with all this’.”She further said that Vikas abused her after which she disconnected the phone and left the village.Richa also said that she knew very little about Vikas’ work, and who he was in contact with. She said that she used to visit the village only when asked to.Talking about her escape, Richa said that she spent about a week in a dilapidated building in Lucknow. “I thought only about my children. I knew I would never get any support from in-laws or my family,” said Richa.“Vikas suffered an accident after which his brain developed a bubble. This resulted into an anxiety disorder and Vikas suffered from bouts of anger. He was being treated for this condition, but for the last 3-4 months, the treatment stopped which further aggravated his anger,” said Richa.Dubey was killed in an encounter by the special task force (STF) of Uttar Pradesh Police on July 10 after he “attempted to flee” while being brought to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain city.He was arrested on July 9 from outside the Mahakal Temple in Ujjain after being on the run since the July 3 attack on the police team out to nab him in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur.The post-mortem report said there were injuries on the head, elbow, rib and stomach on the right side of his body.The Uttar Pradesh government has formed a one-member judicial commission to probe the encounter after opposition leaders claimed that the gangster was killed in a “fake encounter” to protect the identity of his political masters.The commission headed by retired justice SK Aggarwal has been given two months’ time to submit its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-would-have-killed-vikas-dubey-for-what-he-did-to-cops-says-his-wife/story-hghkKr48mDzvvssIohkKFN.html

A total of 15,439,456 have so far contracted the disease while 631,926 fatalities have been recorded across the globe, according to latest figures released by Johns Hopkins University. Here are top updates on the Covid-19 situation in India and the world India’s daily Covid-19 cases now second only to the USIndia now has the second highest daily Covid-19 case count after the United States. Between July 16 and July 22, India registered 269,969 new infections against Brazil’s 260,962 which —the second and third most daily cases in the world. However, the US continues to report the maximum number of new cases with nearly half a million new cases (478,899) coming in the past week.Global Covid-19 cases top 15 millionAs many as 15,437,206 people have been infected with the coronavirus disease in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University’s dashboard. The global toll has mounted to 631,926. The most number of cases continue to be reported from the US (4,034,831), followed by Brazil (2,287,475) and India (1,238,798).India, Israel to develop Covid-19 rapid testing kit for results in less than 30 secondsThe embassy of Israel in India on Thursday said that the two nations will jointly develop rapid testing kit which will give the Covid-19 report in less than 30 seconds. “A special planned flight from Tel Aviv to New Delhi is set to carry a high ranking Ministry of Defence, R&D team which has been working with India’s chief scientist K. Vijay Raghavan and DRDO to develop rapid testing for #Covid_19 in under 30 seconds,” the embassy tweeted.5 nations have 50% of global casesFive worst-hit nations account for more than half of the world’s total Covid-19 infections and deaths. The nations with most cases are United States with 4,034,831 cases,Brazil with 2,287,475 confirmed cases, while India has 1,238,798 cases, followed byRussia and South Africa with 793,720 and 408,052 cases respectively. India’s Covid-19 positivity rate on the rise. Why it’s still good news India’s Covid-19 positivity rate is steadily increasing. The weekly average is around 11.7% now as against 8.1% a month ago, while in early May it was as low as 3%. However, despite what this trend suggests, the rising positivity rate in the country, under the current context, is actually good news because the positivity rate increases with testing till a point, then plateaus, and then eventually starts declining as a country, state, or city starts testing adequately. India has only tested around 1.1% of its population so far.Air India pilots write to Hardeep Puri over psychological impact of pay cuts, compulsory leaveAir India’s executive pilots committee has written to aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri explaining how pay cuts and compulsory leave without pay scheme may have potentially disastrous psychological impact and lead to “desperate and extreme acts. They have appealed to the minister to rescind the decision to revise wages while informing him about 60 pilots deployed in government’s Vande Bharat Mission flights have tested positive for Covid-19. At least one pilot has lost a family member to Covid-19 and those of many others have also been infected, the letter said. Diagnostics manufacturer warns of Covid-19 tests shortage Chief executive officer of Roche Holding AG Severin Schwanon on Thursday said that the world needs to become more judicious about how it uses Covid-19 tests because there still aren’t enough to go around.

24-07-2020||India||Rajasthan high court’s crucial order on Team Pilot’s petition shortly||The Rajasthan high court has started the hearing in a case which can end the political crisis plaguing the state. The case has been filed by Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident Congress MLAs against the disqualification notice served to them by Rajasthan Speaker CP Joshi.The Supreme Court had refused to stay the proceedings of the high court on Thursday. Hearing a petition filed by Rajasthan assembly Speaker CP Joshi, the apex court said that “voice of dissent” in a democracy cannot be shut down.Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs have challenged a disqualification notice given by the Speaker in the high court. In the last hearing, the Rajasthan high court had asked the Speaker to wait for its verdict on Friday before taking any action against Team Pilot.But Joshi had moved the apex court to challenge the “direction” given to his office by the court. He had contended in his petiton that the court cannot interfere in legislative matter, and that the action against the dissident MLAs should be decided by his office.The notice was given on the request of Congress’ chief whip who said Pilot and his supporters did not attend the party’s CLP meetings. The Pilot camp, however, argued that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.The apex court, which heard the matter through video-conferencing, said that issue raised in the plea filed by the Speaker required “prolonged hearing” as it involved “larger question” related to the democracy and how it will survive.“As the high court has already heard the matter after prolonged arguments and reserved the order, we are not staying the passing of the order, however, whatever order is passed, shall be ultimately subject to the outcome of this petition,” the bench comprising justices Arun Mishra, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari, said and fixed the matter for hearing on July 27.The high court, meanwhile, accepted another application filed by Pilot to include the Union government in the list of respondents. Pilot had contended that Tenth Schedule’s constitutional validity was under challenge and therefore, the Union of India was a necessary party now.On Friday, the dissident Congress MLAs led by Pilot had challenged their disqualification notices through a writ petition which was taken up by a bench of Rajasthan High Court, comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta, and arguments were held.The hearing continued on Monday and the arguments concluded on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-high-court-s-crucial-order-on-team-pilot-s-petition-today/story-FceIeTgOc0DyGvoYYs5itN.html

After the exchange of fire ended, the SOG and DVF spotted two bodies - a male and a female. Both were in Naxal uniform. We also seized one INSAS rifle, one carbine, and two country-made firearms,” Abhay said. The DGP appealed the Maoists to surrender and get the benefits of Odisha Government’s Naxal rehabilitation policy.The identity of the two deceased Maoists is yet to be ascertained.Between July 5 and 7, five Maoists including two women were killed in two separate encounters with the police in Kandhamal district in Sirla forest of Tumudibandh block. One of those killed was Kosa Sodi alias Sukru, a member of Odisha State Committee of the CPI (Maoist) with a bounty of Rs 20 lakh on his head. The other two were identified as Itesh and Reena, both area committee members with reward of Rs 4 lakh each on their heads.The Union home secretary, in a letter to Odisha chief secretary and DGP, had appreciated Odisha Police for its successful operation in Kandhamal district on July 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-maoists-killed-in-encounter-with-police-in-odisha-woman-among-them/story-nj3LQ10qC7ohSuMfqySCII.html

He was immediately admitted to the Community Health Centre of G Udaygiri. However, he passed away while being taken to the district headquarters hospital in Phulbani town.“As his body was brought back to his village in Mallikpadi, the locals did not allow it to be buried there fearing that the doctor had succumbed to Covid-19. The doctor’s body was finally buried in an isolated patch of land around two kilometres away,” said Kailash Dandapat, an NGO worker in Kandhamal district.Also read: Odisha raises minimum wages of labourersThe doctor’s burial was opposed by people of another village till the district administration intervened. The body was buried 12 hours after death.Dandapat said he has never seen such a situation in nearly four decades of his stay in Kandhamal. “Whenever any death happens, there would be a big gathering of near and dear ones and the villagers to pay their last respect to the departed soul. But Corona has turned the situation completely different. I do not think this is the only case of G Udayagiri, this is also going to happen in other parts of the district and the state,” said Dandapat.In a similar incident, in Covid-19 hotspot of Ganjam district, the villagers did not touch the body of a retired school headmaster and stopped the body from entering suspecting it to be a case of Covid-19 death. A retired school headmaster in Seragada village of Ganjam was suffering from cough and fever for the last fortnight and died on Wednesday.While the deceased’s two sons could not return to the state due to coronavirus-induced lockdown, villagers refused to help fearing infection of Covid-19.As no one came forward, four local journalists went to the deceased headmaster’s home wearing PPE kits and brought his body in an ambulance to the cremation ground.

24-07-2020||India||PM Modi gives Ladakh its first central university; will have a Centre on Buddhist Studies||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has greenlighted the plan for the first central university in Ladakh with a Centre on Buddhist Studies, a move that comes just about a fortnight before the first anniversary of the parliamentary enactment that led to the creation of Ladakh as a union territory.The proposed central university will offer degrees in all courses such as liberal arts and basic sciences except engineering and medical education.PM Modi’s in-principle approval came at a meeting convened on Monday to review the steps taken by the government over the last one year in the union territories of Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir and outline the priorities for the Centre over the next few months to improve the lives of people. Union home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and all top officials attended this meeting.Also read: DRDO sets up Covid testing facility in LehOn 5 August last year, the Centre had moved Parliament to strip the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir of its special status in the Constitution and create the two union territories. The Centre had then promised that the Union Territory status would lead to an improvement in the security situation in the centrally-administered territories and put the focus back on development.The education ministry is expected to move a formal proposal to set up the central university soon. It will require enactment of a central legislation that will, after clearance from the Union cabinet, go to parliament for its approval.PM Modi indicated his approval to set up a central university at the July 20 meeting since more than 10,000 Ladakhi students were forced to travel hundreds of kilometres away from home for higher education, people familiar with the development said.Ladakh got its first university - University of Ladakh - only recently after the state assembly enacted a legislation in December 2018. This was a cluster university created by pooling all the resources of existing colleges of Ladakh.According to a proposal of the human resource development ministry, the Ladakh Central University is also aimed at students from Lahaul and Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh once the Rohtang La tunnel opens this year and ensures round the year access to Leh via Jispa-Sarchu-Upshi route. The university will have a Centre for Buddhist Studies to cater to the largely Gelug (to which the 14th Dalai Lama belongs) and Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhist population of Ladakh.It is learnt that the PM was totally focused on development of the two UTs and wanted specific improvements highlighted in the coming days. He did not want the development debate to be digressed into the achievements of the state police and security forces on counter-terrorism front.Even though the government is clear that vested interests within and across the border will try and vitiate the atmosphere close to August 5, there was consensus in the meeting that the development agenda in both the UTs should not be derailed at any cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-preps-for-ladakh-s-anniversary-gift-greenlights-its-1st-central-university/story-ZZTaNsvEQhydzDRPmWvb6N.html
24-07-2020||India||Rahul takes swipe at Modi, BJP hits back||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that he was busy building his own image, and noted that one man’s vision cannot be a substitute for a national vision.Gandhi’s attack on the PM came as part of a series launched by him on Twitter, where he seeks to explain the India-China conflict at the border.The Congress leader said there is no clear-cut vision for the country going forward. BJP president J P Nadda had accused Gandhi of attempting to politicise defence and foreign policy matters, saying it shows one dynasty’s desperation to wash their past sins of 1962 and weaken India.The Congress leader said one has to deal with the Chinese psychologically from a position of strength and if they sense weakness, “then you had it”. “PM is 100% focused on building his own image. India’s captured institutions are all busy doing this task. One man’s image is not a substitute for a national vision,” he said on Twitter, along with a two-minute video on the Chinese aggression at the LAC.Gandhi said he is agitated because he can see a huge opportunity being lost by India. He had earlier accused the Prime Minister of only being bothered about his image, which the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had described as “mudslinging”.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nalin Kohli reacted, saying, “Before asking question and beyond the daily tweets, Mr Gandhi would do well to provide the nation a list of his personal, non-inherited achievements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-takes-swipe-at-modi-bjp-hits-back/story-tJymIWAs6OngBZDoXzXIwO.html

The applications — Helo Lite, ShareIt Lite, Bigo Lite and VFY Lite — have been removed from the Google playstore and Apple app store, the officials said. The government had, in a similar move last month, banned 59 applications, including popular video app TikTok, in the backdrop of a India-China standoff in Galwan Valley, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.Banning the apps, the government had said that they were ‘prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country’.“The apps were found to be operating despite the ban via these versions,” a MEITY official said. “They have been taken down from application stores.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ministry-to-ban-more-apps-over-links-with-china/story-vZdlB6D9ilUsemmDPpQuAL.html
24-07-2020||India||India’s poor risk falling through the gaps as schools go digital||The coronavirus has pushed schools all over the world to go online as new waves of infections keep emerging. In India, a country where the gaps in access to education and the Internet were already vast, poor families are struggling to stay the course.Shirin Riyaz Shah, 15, attends a small private school in Mumbai. There’s one smart-phone between her and her four siblings over which they sit through Zoom lessons and submit homework via WhatsApp. Their schedules don’t blend neatly and there’s a constant tussle over the phone.Data is especially precious because money, always tight, is now in even shorter supply as the pandemic stretches her family’s single income. Her father is a tailor and for now, movement restrictions mean he’s mostly home. When that changes so will the children’s access to his phone.And digital classrooms make the process of learning harder.“In class we can raise our hands over and over again and it isn’t a problem,” said Shah by phone. “We can ask teachers to pause in a class and then ask them to repeat. But in a video call if two or three students do this then time will run out.”The pandemic has led to the “biggest global education emergency of our lifetime,” according to a report by the Save The Children Fund. Globally, lockdowns enforced to stop the virus’s spread have put 91% of learners out of school. Out of these, the poorest and most marginalized children are at highest risk of never returning to the classroom.In India, where the government spends about 3% of the nation’s gross domestic product on education and only half the population has access to the Internet, 320 million students have already been affected, according to Save The Children Fund.The spokesperson for India’s Ministry for Human Resource Development and the secretary of the School Education and Literacy department did not respond to an email and or phone calls asking for comment.UNFAMILIAR TECHNOLOGY“You have one side of the population that’s so used to tech, it’s like a second language to them,” said Shreya Tobias, a volunteer with Teach for India, a non-governmental organization, who educates fourth grade children. Many of her students have never used phones before, and their parents themselves don’t know enough to help. “These kids don’t have that. Tech is confusing for them.”The majority of her students have seen their parents lose jobs as a result of the economic distress caused by India’s protracted lockdown. She lost contact with some when they were forced to return to their villages.Instead of innovating, governments and schools have gone for the easiest option available, said Shantha Sinha, founder of the research institute Mamidipudi Venkatarangaiya Foundation and the former head of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. “It’s showing a lack of sensitivity.”Governments must allocate funds to local village councils and encourage solutions from the bottom up, Sinha said. “They should allow people to come together, they should say, ‘Come up with an innovation, we will support you.’”SCALING UPSeveral rights groups and NGOs have taken this approach -- from reading rooms to distributing books directly to homes -- attempting to fill the gaps left by online education. A village in Jharkhand has seen widespread fame for its use of loudspeakers perched on trees through which children can listen to classes. But these initiatives need to be scaled up quickly, experts say.Despite the challenges, many teachers and students hold on to hope.Tobias believes her students will return to classes once lockdowns are fully lifted. “After having worked in this system for a while, I’ve realized that it takes a lot of effort to get your child into a school, to begin with,” she says. “The parents are quite invested.”And 15-year-old Shah is worried but determined.“This is my aim, and this is my responsibility,” she said. “I will not let my future goals be disrupted by anything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-poor-risk-falling-through-the-gaps-as-schools-go-digital/story-Dfq5YriX1MT7QZZTsXWFVI.html
24-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India’s Covid-19 positivity rate – the proportion of people testing positive to those tested – is increasing. The weekly average is around 11.7% now. The number has steadily increased. It was around 8.1% a month ago. In early May, it was as low as 3%. Contrary to what this trend may immediately suggest, and concerns being expressed by some experts, a rising positivity rate in India, under the current context, is actually good news.India has thus far carried out around 11,310 tests per million of the population. This number too has been increasing steadily; over the past week for instance, India carried out 333,697 tests a day on average. It should be doing a million a day, but the current number is still higher than the 143,565 tests a day it was conducting in mid-June. This increase is responsible for the country’s rising positivity rate.As regular readers of this column know, the positivity rate increases with testing till a point, then plateaus, and then eventually starts declining as a country, state, or city starts testing adequately. At the current level of testing, India has tested around 1.1% of its population. That’s way too low. There are countries that have done 10-12%, but given India’s size and population, the country should be aiming for testing at least 5% of the population.It is important to understand how to read the positivity rate. A low rate is desirable, but only when accompanied by adequate testing. There are states that show a low positivity, but this isn’t because they have few cases, but because they aren’t testing enough. Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Bihar, for instance, have low positivity rates, but are clearly not testing enough, and so while absolute numbers may suggest that they are better off than other states in managing Covid-19, they actually aren’t. In fact, the reverse is probably true. Telangana and Gujarat have higher positivity rates, but they too are clearly not testing adequately (which is actually even more worrying).In contrast, Delhi has a high positivity rate (cumulatively), but the number is way off its peak (when the trend in daily positivity rates is seen; for instance, it was only 5.7% on Thursday), an indication that things have gotten better in the Capital (which is also reflected in the falling number of daily cases). And it is testing a lot (around 4.4% of its population has been tested at last count). Tamil Nadu presents another narrative. It is testing adequately (it has tested 2.8% of its population at last count, a significant number for a state with a population of around 80 million), and is just about maintaining its positivity rate (which means the daily cases are still high) – an indication that the state is on the long plateau that comes before the dip. The state’s positivity rate is way off the peaks it once scaled, perhaps an indication of just how badly inadequate testing can skew this metric in either direction.It’s easy to understand – given this behaviour – why most experts maintain that a positivity rate between 7% and 12% (some are a lot more specific and put the number at 10%) is a reflection of adequate testing. Given the Tamil Nadu example, this proportion seems to correspond with the ideal positivity rate in the plateau-phase of the curve.So, how high can India’s positivity rate go? That’s a tough question to answer, but if the country were to sharply increase testing – say, reach the million-test-a-day mark that I’ve been suggesting – it will reach this peak very soon. Still better, it won’t stay there very long if it keeps up the intensity of testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-x4mYWVRm55A2N7TIxfQS7N.html

24-07-2020||India||Delhi’s old drainage system unable to cope with heavy concretisation||The Capital’s decades-old drainage system is unable to keep pace with unplanned construction, and much of its stormwater management features are either blocked or have disappeared, leading to a few hours of heavy rain triggering widespread chaos, according to several urban experts.On Wednesday, Delhi Traffic Police updates showed there were at least five cave-ins on key roads, and long traffic jams due to heavy waterlogging was reported from at least 13 major localities or stretches.The mayhem, which exposed the fragile civic infrastructure in the Capital, was the consequence of around four hours of heavy rain in the morning.AK Gosain, professor of civil engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, said the problem lies in three distinct issues: increase in paved area means less volume is absorbed by the ground and rains lead to heavier water run-off; stormwater drains are being used for sewage; and most of these stormwater drains do not let water flow freely.Gosain presented a master plan to the government in 2018 identifying the issues that made the problem most acute and suggested a road map of how the drainage network — which still follows the 1976 master plan — can be revamped.Waste water from rains are meant to follow a system separate from the one that carries sewage from homes and industries. This includes a network of streams, natural and seasonal water bodies, and urban stormwater channels that are meant to further drain into the Barapullah canal, the Najafgarh canal, or the Yamuna. The report by Gosain’s team found many of these were either encroached upon, blocked with waste, or were disappearing. Around 19 out of the 201 natural drains mentioned in the 1976 Master Plan could not be traced. “Last drainage Master Plan for Delhi was prepared in the year 1976, when the population of Delhi was 60 lakh. Population of Delhi as per Census 2011 stands at 167 lakh (1.67 crore) and the projected population as per projection in Master Plan Delhi 2021 is 250 lakh (2.5 crore),” said a release from the chief minister’s office on August 1, 2018, when the Gosain panel’s report was submitted.According to the release, the main recommendations were to ensure there are no encroachments on such drains, sewage is routed through separate sewage channels, dumping of construction and demolition debris is stopped, effective de-silting is carried out and that new stormwater drains are designed and built in such a way that existing run-off estimates and architecture are taken into account.“The document is circulated among various departments who pass their judgment and drainage work is given in bits and pieces by the government to contractors. The drainage plan is ahead of its time and cannot be comprehended by contractors,” said Gosain in an interview to HT. Representatives of the Delhi government did not respond to requests sent on Thursday for comments on the status of the plan.Two other experts supported Gosain’s assessment of the situation. “Delhi’s groundwater recharging area has reduced drastically because of concretisation in the form of roads, paved pedestrian paths, buildings. Where will rain water from a very large surface area go? It will come on to the highways where underpasses don’t have proper drainage. Where they have drainage, it’s not cleaned, it’s choked with plastic,” said CR Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems at Delhi University. “Tree cover along highways can help. They can slow the way rain water falls on the ground and open ground can then be recharged with it,” he added. Manu Bhatnagar, principle director, Natural Heritage Division, INTACH, said: “Unusual flooding is because of very poor engineering and too much paved hard surface. The converse of waterlogging is water harvesting. Even on top of the Barapullah elevated road, water was standing after rain. This shows poor planning and maintenance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/old-drainage-system-unable-to-cope-with-heavy-concretisation/story-xnWNak8AZozgVjBrlsfhJN.html
24-07-2020||India||SC refuses to interfere in HC order on speaker||The Supreme Court on Thursday — in a setback to chief minister Ashok Gehlot and a possible reprieve to his former deputy Sachin Pilot — refused to stay the proceedings of the Rajasthan high court, which is scheduled to pronounce a verdict on disqualification notices sent by the speaker of the state assembly to 19 rebel Congress MLAs, including Pilot.The top court, which was looking at the limited but crucial question of whether the high court can interfere in proceedings initiated by the speaker even before a decision on disqualification has been taken, said that the issue would require greater judicial examination. It agreed to hear the plea filed by Rajasthan speaker CP Joshi from Monday onwards, and ruled that high court’s Friday decision would be subject to the outcome of the top court’s final verdict.“As the high court has already heard the matter after prolonged arguments and reserved the order, we are not staying the passing of the order [by high court]. However, whatever order is passed shall be ultimately subject to the outcome of this petition,” said a three-judge bench led by justice Arun Mishra, and also including justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari.Though the court did not go into the question of the correctness of the speaker’s decision to issue notice and if the actions of the Pilot camp amounted to giving up the membership of the Congress party, justice Mishra observed during the hearing that “voice of dissent cannot be suppressed… then democracy will shut”.“After all they have been elected by the people. Can they not express their dissent? Can voice of dissent be shut down like this in a democracy?” he told senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who was representing the speaker.Proceedings in the high court will resume at 10.30am on Friday. It is expected to pronounce its verdict later in the day.Thursday’s order could be a major boost to the Pilot camp — if the high court on Friday bars the speaker from disqualifying the 19 MLAs, they will remain protected from such proceedings until the top court has reached its verdict. It may, meanwhile, hamper the Gehlot government from calling an assembly session — fearing a no-confidence motion from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — because the numbers in the House are still tenuous for the chief minister.Speaking to reporters on Thursday evening, however, Gehlot said an assembly session would be called “soon”.As things stand, Gehlot appears to have the support of 101 members —the majority mark in the 200-member state assembly (though this does not include speaker CP Joshi). Pilot has 18 other Congress MLAs and three independents in his camp, taking his tally to 22. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. One Congress MLA, Bhanwarlal Meghwal, is indisposed, though he is said to be close to Pilot. If Pilot’s tally is added to that of the opposition alliance, it takes their number up to 97. This means a three-member swing from the Gehlot camp to the Pilot camp or to the BJP could lead to the government falling in the event of a no-confidence motion.Conversely, if the high court allows the speaker to go ahead with the proceedings and disqualify the MLAs — Gehlot will then be more confident in calling an assembly session and proving his majority through a trust vote — the rebels led by Pilot will have legal recourse to challenge the order through a petition in the Supreme Court. The speaker has so far been asked by the high court not to take any decision until after its verdict on Friday.Sibal sought for a stay on the proceedings and the July 21 order of the high court reserved the judgment till Friday. When the court appeared disinclined to grant the prayer, Sibal alternatively sought for the matter before the high court to be transferred to the Supreme Court. This, too, was rejected by the court.But the larger legal question argued in the court emanating from the Rajasthan developments was whether the high court overstepped its jurisdiction by “directing” the speaker to not proceed on the disqualification proceedings.Sibal submitted that the “court cannot direct speaker to extend time (to decide the disqualification proceedings). Court cannot interfere till the speaker gives a decision”. “It is settled by the judgment of this court in Kihoto Hollohan of 1992,” he said.In Kihoto Hollohan’s case, a five-judge Constitution bench held that judicial review should not cover any stage prior to the making of a decision by the speaker/chairman. No interference would be permissible at an interlocutory stage of the proceedings, the court had said.Justice Mishra asked whether the speaker can muzzle dissent within party by using his powers of disqualification.“We are trying to find out whether the procedure adopted (by speaker) is correct or not. Can voice of dissent be shut down like this in a democracy?” he asked.Sibal, however, replied that courts cannot go into the merits of the speaker’s actions before the speaker gives a decision.Senior counsels Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, representing the Pilot camp, questioned the speaker’s decision to approach the Supreme Court after participating in the hearings before the high court for three days.Experts said the Tenth Schedule and the anti-defection law needed examination.“The role of the speaker has to be reconsidered. As it stands today, if the Kihoto Hollohan judgment is applied literally, the speaker’s actions, even if they are completely without authority or jurisdiction, cannot be touched by courts till the speaker actually gives a decision.This could lead to the speaker overstepping his jurisdiction and issuing notices time and again,” said Alok Prasanna Kumar, senior resident fellow at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy. Senior counsel Sanjay Hegde said: “The crucial thing the Supreme Court has done by keeping matter pending, is in a sense to immobilise the speaker till Monday. Even if Rajasthan high court dismisses the petition, its final judgment is not to be implemented till SC hears petition on Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-interfere-in-hc-order-on-speaker/story-lqWoxVlVq3oHaaaoDL6PyI.html
24-07-2020||India||HC seeks ICMR reply on testing||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday directed the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to file an affidavit within a week in response to a plea challenging the requirement of a doctor’s prescription to undergo Covid-19 testing. It asked ICMR to clarify its stand on the matter.Utsav Sindhu has filed the plea citing the need for professionals to produce Covid-19 negative reports to travel to several states for work. The plea cited ICMR’s July 1 order asking states to ensure that laboratories are free to conduct tests without the prior requirement of a doctor’s prescription. It added the order was not being complied with.The Delhi government on Monday told the court that ICMR’s Specific Referral Form of Covid-19 makes a doctor’s prescription mandatory for testing. On Tuesday, Sindhu’s lawyer, advocate Manish Tiwari, told the court that Himachal Pradesh’s travel advisory requires a person travelling to the state for tourism to produce a Covid-19 negative report issued by ICMR authorized/certified lab report before undertaking such travel.The lawyer added the requirement of the prescription for the Covid-19 test has been done away with for travel to Chandigarh and Mumbai presumably based on ICMR’s advisory issued on July 1. He contended states were following different criteria that leads to confusion and restricts the people’s inter-state movement.Following this, the court said, “The respondent no 2 [ICMR] is directed to file an affidavit stating its stands on the requirement of a prescription for testing of Covid-19 especially in light of the submissions of the petitioner…. Such affidavit be filed within one week.”The matter would be now heard next on July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-icmr-reply-on-testing/story-B5B0EeuzkvYXxlk0iftQxL.html
24-07-2020||India||NIT, CFTI admissions to be based on JEE||New DelhiCandidates seeking entry to National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and other Centrally Funded Technical Institutes (CFTIs) will be ranked solely on their performance in the upcoming JEE (Main) exam, the human resource development ministry announced on Thursday, doing away with the admission criterion of minimum 75% marks in Class 12 school-leaving exams.“Due to prevailing circumstances, Central Seat Allocation Board (CSAB) has decided to relax the eligibility criterion for admissions to NITs and other centrally funded technical institutions,” HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ tweeted, referring to the Covid-19 outbreak.The coronavirus disease pandemic has affected the academic schedule. Schools and colleges have been closed since the end of March. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and several state boards could not hold all exams for Class 12 and granted marks based on performance in tests that were already conducted. CSAB’s decision to relax the 75% marks rule came against this backdrop and amid a demand for the same by a large section of students.“JEE [Joint Entrance Examination] Main 2020 qualified candidates will now only need to obtain a passing certificate in class XII examination irrespective of the marks obtained,” the HRD minister posted on Twitter.Previously, for admissions to CFTIs, the eligibility was to secure a minimum of 75% marks or rank among the top 20 percentile in the Class 12 board exams, apart from qualifying the JEE-Main.There are over 80 CFITs in India, including including Indian Institutes of Information and Technology (IIITs) and Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs).Last week, the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) did away with the rule making it mandatory for a student to secure 75 % marks in Class 12 board exams for admissions to these premier institutes.The JEE-Main exam, which has been postponed twice, will now be held from September 1-6.While admissions to NITs are decided on the basis of the JEE (Main) exam, candidates seeking entry to IITs have to take another round of test called the JEE (Advanced). The JEE (Main) result is the basis for qualification to appear in JEE (Advanced).“Students have to prepare for both board exams and JEE. However, this year there have been a lot of disruptions. I personally think it is a good move,” said Jashan, a student.“This is a step taken in student interest. Especially, for the mental health of the students who have to prepare for competitive exams in the time of a pandemic. We welcome this move,” said Lalit Kumar Awasthi, director, NIT Jalandhar. “Students who are preparing for competitive exams like JEE have to focus on the application of theorems etc which they learn in the CBSE syllabus. However, this year there has been a lot of upheaval. It is a good step and will allow children to focus on the competitive exam without worrying about other factors,” said eminent educationist Dr Inder Mohan Kapahy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nit-cfti-admissions-to-be-based-on-jee/story-lqJ0BXMxaEn9T0LyzimsFM.html
24-07-2020||India||‘Treat SARI patients as potential Covid-19 cases’: Experts||Patients with symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) symptoms should not be moved to non-Covid spaces in hospitals even if their initial test results for the coronavirus disease are negative, experts treating Covid-19 patients said in their first meeting to present and discuss specific cases and the learnings from them. “We have to give a lot of importance to the clinico-radiological findings of the patient, in spite of the test returning negative. The tests have also to be interpreted in the light of other findings. When index of suspicion is high, the patient should not be transferred to an area where there is risk of spread of disease to other patients. We must have an area in hospitals where such patients can be put till such time there Covid-19 status is confirmed,” said Dr S Rajeshwari, department of anesthesiology, AIIMS. The comments came during the first session of national Clinical Grands Rounds (CGR) on Covid-19 diagnosis. CGR is a globally accepted practice where doctors discuss specific cases. The first session focused on patients who test negative despite showing symptoms of Covid-19 and who, sometimes, test positive in later tests. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, in collaboration with Niti Aayog and Union ministry of health and family welfare, launched the CGR on Covid-19. The first session that took place on Wednesday was on disease diagnosis. Experts who presented cases agreed that apart from test results that can return negative in some rare cases, reports of a chest CT scan or an X-ray should be considered to watch for classic Covid-19 signs that affect the lungs, especially the lower lobe.“There will be separate discussion topics in coming weeks that will deal with issues such as neurological or gastrointestinal manifestations, and Covid in pregnant women,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS. Each case discussion will be followed by a short presentation on clinically relevant topics in managing Covid-19. “Our ultimate aim is to devise a strategy that brings down the number of deaths due to Covid-19 to less than 1% (of cases) as ultimately it is the number of deaths that’s going to matter and not the number of cases,” said Dr Guleria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treat-sari-patients-as-potential-covid-19-cases-experts/story-fs5JjTwPQJ4fJdAcnoAN6L.html
24-07-2020||India||60 AI pilots involved in Vande Bharat mission test positive for Covid-19||At least 60 pilots involved in the Vande Bharat Mission to fly back Indians stranded abroad because of the Covid-19 pandemic have tested positive for the disease, Air India’s Executive Pilots Committee said in a letter on Thursday to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri. The letter, which requested Puri to rescind the national carrier’s decision to revise wages last week, added at least one pilot has lost a family member to Covid-19 and many others have also been infected.The Centre this month said 5,03,990 Indians stranded in 137 countries have been brought back to the country as part of the repatriation mission since it began in May following the suspension of regular international flights due to the pandemic .The letter cited salary cuts and compulsory leave without pay and added it could have a potentially disastrous psychological impact and lead to “desperate and extreme acts”.The Air India’s Board last week approved leave without pay scheme for its permanent employees for six months to two years, which is extendable to up to five years. The national carrier defended its decision saying it is in a very challenging financial situation and taking recourse to several initiatives to ensure the continuance of its operations. It has also decided to cut salaries of its cockpit and cabin crew with effect from April 1.“Our Association is also extremely concerned about the potentially disastrous psychological impact that the massive forced pay cuts and Compulsory Leave Without Pay scheme may create on some employees. We shudder to think of the kind of desperate and extreme acts that could be triggered off because of the prevailing situation– as has been repeatedly proven many times in the past,” the letter said, a copy of which HT has seen. The letter also cautioned against litigation from employees. “As executives, we shall always support all acts and decisions that are financially prudent and serve the company’s best interests. Therefore, we believe that a rising stack of litigations and financial liabilities (contingent and current), arising out of pending financial dues owed to employees could potentially destroy our organization’s future health, and more so, would be unfairly transferred to any prospective buyer of Air India, in case the impending strategic disinvestment.”Air India’s Executive Pilots Committee is one of the pilot’s union of the national carrier.The Indian Commercial Pilot Association on Monday also wrote to the national carrier’s management, saying changes in the wage settlement would be illegal and such a situation has the “potential to flair to unprecedented magnitude.”Air India chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal last week said the national carrier was working on four fronts to reduce costs by reducing the debt, cutting on lease rentals, trimming staffing costs, and reducing operating costs.The cost-cutting drive dovetails with a government plan to sell its entire stake in Air India amid increasing debt and mounting losses. The Centre, in January, started the process by releasing an information document for investors and offering access to financial and other data of Air India and its subsidiaries.The government’s entire stake in Air India, its 100% stake in low-cost subsidiary Air India Express Ltd, and 50% stake in ground handling unit Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited are on offer.An attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw any bids. The airline’s accumulated debt is estimated to be more than Rs 69,000 crore. It posted a loss of Rs 8,556 crore in the financial year 2018-19, as against a net loss of Rs 5,348 crore in the previous financial year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-ai-pilots-involved-in-vande-bharat-mission-test-covid-ve/story-BXM2m8Z1TcOd2h1SeXr7OL.html
24-07-2020||India||Low occupancy in Covid coaches ‘good sign’: Railways||Indian railway’s Covid care coaches have seen less extremely low occupancy rates in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh till date, but the railway ministry sees this as a “good sign”, pointing out that their facilities were only “the last resort” for the state governments.Data collected from the states by the Centre shows that in Delhi, railways deployed 503 coaches with 8048 beds. For every three beds, oxygen cylinders were also provided. “But cumulative admission till yesterday was 208 and number of patients in these beds on Wednesday was 130”, said a top-ranking official of the Modi government, citing reports sent by states to the Centre’s Covid management team.Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh, as against 3784 beds, cumulative admission was 256 and as on Wednesday, not a single bed was occupied, added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Centre built its first prototype of a Covid coach in April ; by May it was ready to deploy 5,231 railway coaches across 215 stations in 15 states considering the possibility of an increase in cases of Covid-19.But with little demand from the states for these coaches, on May 21, the Railway Board wrote to its zones to reconvert 60% of the Covid-19 coaches into normal ones to be utilised on Shramik Special trains launched to ferry stranded migrant workers back to their homes in the Indian hinterland. With the number of cases rising, it was only in June that some states started using these coaches. “At first, it was one of the best innovative and disruptive ideas, but it did not find many takers. Similarly, attaching hospitals to hotels was a good idea but a report from the states show that hotels didn’t get as many patients as was expected,” said a second official who asked not to be named. His reference is to the move to use some hotels to house and treat milder cases of the infection. A third official in the Covid management team said that coaches were largely unused as they didn’t have air-conditioning, were difficult to access, and that states were not keen to use them, a railway spokesperson maintained that lack of occupancy was not due to “any issue” with the Covid care coaches.Railway board chairman VK Yadav underlined, “The most important aspect of the Covid care coaches was that the health ministry said they are to be used only where states have exhausted their facilities and needs to augment capacities for isolation of both suspect and confirmed Covid cases.”“These coaches are provided on the demand of the state governments. We pray to God that these Covid care coaches are used as little as possible and that spread of Covid is controlled. The advantage of these coaches is they can be moved from one place to another. The second advantage is that they can be used to transport the patients. I believe it’s a good sign that they are being used less as cases are reducing and states are able to control,” he said.The rail ministry spokesperson added that the Covid care coaches were meant for very mild cases and aimed to be used as care centres where the states have exhausted the facilities and needs to augment capacities for isolation of both suspect and confirmed Covid cases.According to health ministry’s guidelines, the isolation coaches were meant to be under the complete care of the chief medical officer of the concerned state. The state administration were to provide doctors and paramedics while the railways would deploy two liaison officers in each location of coaches to assist state government officials.The spokesperson also maintained that both Delhi and UP government have appreciated Indian Railways efforts. He also claimed that “with the onset of monsoon, the problem of heat is also solved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/low-occupancy-in-covid-coaches-good-sign-railways/story-BZVQHlUGFYTABgiZQEv3JI.html
24-07-2020||India||Govt approves first central varsity for UT of Ladakh||Nearly a year after the reorganization of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state into two union territories (UTs) including Ladakh, the Narendra Modi government has cleared the decks for the first Central University in the latter, which will also host a Centre on Buddhist Studies, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The move is aimed at addressing the huge vacuum in higher education in the new UT, with many students having to venture out to other states. While the formal decision will be taken after the proposal is moved by the HRD Ministry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in favour of a separate Ladakh university, the people said, as at least 10,000 Ladakhi students have been forced to enrol in educational institutions outside the UT. Barring engineering and medical education, the proposed university will offer degrees in all courses including liberal arts and basic sciences.In 2018, the then government of Jammu and Kashmir state set up a Ladakh University, but this was a so-called cluster university created by pooling all the resources of existing colleges of Ladakh.The creation of Ladakh university was discussed in a meeting on July 20 to review the progress made a year after J&K was reorganized on August 5 last year. Chaired by the Prime Minister, the meeting was attended by Home Minister Amit Shah, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and other top officials.According to the HRD ministry’s proposal, the Ladakh Central University will also cater to students from Lahaul and Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh once the Rohtang La tunnel opens this year and ensures round the year access to Leh via the Jispa-Sarchu-Upshi route. The university will have a Centre for Buddhist Studies to cater to the largely Gelug (to which the 14th Dalai Lama belongs) and Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhist population of Ladakh.While a decision on not allowing students from the Kashmir Valley enrol in higher education institutions in Pakistan -- the country even has a quota for students from Kashmir -- is still awaited, PM Modi reviewed the development in the two UTs over the past year. The people cited in the first instance said the Prme Minister wanted specific improvements in the UTs highlighted in the coming days. He did not want the development debate to digress into the achievements of the state police and security forces on the counter-terrorism front.Indian parliament passed laws and resolutions on August 5 and 6 last year to scrap Article 370 of the constituton, which gave the erstwhile state of J&K special status, and split it into two UTs. The move, the government believed, would help it focus on development in the state, and also address the issue of terror. Even though the government is clear that vested interests within and across the border will try and vitiate the atmosphere close to August 5, there was consensus in the meeting that the development agenda in both the UTs should not be derailed at any cost, the people added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-approves-first-central-varsity-for-ut-of-ladakh/story-LHj4P9fa9UIM50uCQNGhMK.html
24-07-2020||India||In Karnataka, 70% quota for locals in projects||Karnataka on Thursday approved a new five-year industrial policy that reserved 70% jobs in all new industrial projects for local residents, becoming the latest in a clutch of state governments to move towards policies guaranteeing employment for local population.State industries minister Jagadish Shettar said the policy aimed to attract investments worth Rs 5 lakh crore and create employment opportunities for two million people. “With the new policy, the state is aiming at an industrial growth rate of 10 percent per annum, even as we are looking at promoting industrial activity in tier 2 and tier 3 cities outside of Bangalore. The new policy will ensure a well balanced, sustainable and inclusive industrial development in the state.”In recent years, states such as Andhra Pradesh, Harayana, and Goa have announced similar policies that reserved employment opportunities for local residents. “All new industrial projects shall create maximum possible direct employment opportunities with a minimum employment of 70 per cent to Kannadigas on an overall basis and 100 per cent in case of Group D employees,” the 2020-2025 industrial policy read.Policy also aimed to ensure that Karnataka reached the third position among states in merchandise exports over the next five years, Shettar said. It also provides for an amendment to the Factories Act 1948 to allow women to work during night shifts as well as allow overtime to be extended to 125 hours per quarter. For medium, large and mega enterprises, the investment promotion subsidy based on turnover would range from 1.75% to 25% for a period of 5-10 years. It also allows the development of private industrial parks. “Our aim is to emerge as a global leader in advanced manufacturing, research and development, Innovation, and to create an ecosystem for an inclusive, balanced, and sustainable development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-karnataka-70-quota-for-locals-in-projects/story-dOKAzoPuSwXI80CkwGMm1O.html

Locust numbers are said to cross the economic threshold level when their numbers cross 10,000 adults per hectare (one hectare equals 2.4 acre). Beyond this limit, the pest become economically ruinous and needs aggressive control.“Using our indigenously developed technologies mounted on air force helicopters and continuous surveillance, we have been able to prevent hoppers (wingless baby locust nymphs) from reaching the immature stage of their life-cycle, which is when they are most devastating,” said KL Gurjar, deputy director of the Locust Warning Organisation, the federal agency under agriculture ministry which is responsible for anti-pest operations.Gurjar said operations to kill nymphs so that they did not reach the crop-eating stage has proven successful in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Bihar. Uttarakhand and Bihar are latest states where locusts have appeared.Adult locusts pose considerably less threat than immature ones, which need a lot of food, Gurjar said.Desert locusts can fly hundreds of kilometres a day and one square-km swarm can eat as much crop food as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day, according to the FAO Desert Locust Information Service manual. If unchecked, locust infestations can cause a considerable drop in food output. Two MI-17 helicopters of the air force are conducting operations at short notice after being re-purposed to fight the pest with an indigenously developed technology. Air force pilots are using an in-house technology to spray atomised pesticides from the air, which has been able to track and kill large armies of locusts, Gurjar said.In one of the largest containment exercises, in the intervening night of July 22-23, operations were carried out at 31 places in 9 districts, including Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Churu, Sikar, Nagaur, Pali and Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan and Kutch in Gujarat.“The choppers were needed because they have better manoeuvrability and can target large trails of pests with a special form of the pesticide malathion, which has been indigenously developed,” a second official, requesting anonymity, said. A privately owned Bell helicopter has been deployed by Rajasthan government, apart from 15 drones. The agriculture ministry signed a contract with the UK’s Micron Group to modify two Mi-17 helicopters for spraying atomized pesticides. But the UK-based firm’s supply has now been delayed until September, a second official said.This prompted the air force to task its “no. 3 base repair depot” in Chandigarh to indigenously design an airborne locust control system for Mi-17 helicopters. “Atomized airborne spraying has been successfully achieved in air through a configuration of nozzles mounted on both sides on external trusses of Mi-17 helicopters,” the second official said.The focus of the operation have been largely Rajasthan, a hotspot state where swarms of immature pink locusts and adult yellow locusts are active in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Churu, Sikar, Nagaur, Jaipur, Pali, Hanumangarh, Sriganganagar and Dausa.Dozens of countries, from Kenya to Pakistan, are battling the worst locust outbreak in generations. The migratory insects are setting off from the Horn of Africa, where they are breeding in “insurmountable” numbers due to frequent cyclones, according to the FAO.These cyclones are possibly linked to climate change, according to the FAO. The organisation has already warned the invasions pose a “serious” risk to India’s agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-swarms-expected-tech-keeps-locusts-at-bay/story-BPo0vF5p3detEqTPUtkq0K.html

Over 28 lakh people in 26 of the state’s 33 districts continue to be affected. Over 47,000 displaced people are taking shelter at 456 relief camps. Rescue personnel evacuated 1,102 persons stranded by floods on Thursday.  In Bihar’s Bettiah, three bodies were recovered from different parts of East Champaran as villages in Raxaul, Sikarahana, Bettiah, Bagaha and Pakaridayal sub-divisions continued to be flooded.In Chakiya sub-division, body of a 35-year-old man was recovered from Dhanauti river.

At least twelve villages in Banjariya blocks were inundated after an embankment on Tilawe river breached on Wednesday, said an official. An estimated 2.4 million children have been affected by the floods in India, the UNICEF said on Thursday, calling for immediate support to address the challenges. In a statement, UNICEF said, “In India, over 6 million people across Bihar, Assam, Odisha, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have been affected by the floods, including an estimated 2.4 million children,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floods-claim-91-lives-in-assam-3-deaths-reported-from-bihar/story-Vcn2dujg3dglFmgWPMamPO.html
24-07-2020||India||Bridging ties to be in focus as diplomats meet on LAC||A day ahead of a crucial meeting of diplomats to review the India-China border standoff, people familiar with developments said on Thursday the focus will be on bridging differences that have led to the stalling of the disengagement and de-escalation process.The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, which held its last virtual meeting on July 10, is expected to reconvene on Friday to review the disengagement process. This will be the mechanism’s fourth meeting since the border standoff emerged in the open and India and China mobilised troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Also Read: Air Force ready to counter aggressive action: IAF chief“Both sides will look at the progress that was to have taken place in the disengagement and de-escalation process as agreed on by the leadership of both countries,” said one of the people cited above. “No one said this process will be simple. It will be complex and long-drawn.”India and China have failed to make a breakthrough in reducing tensions in the sensitive Ladakh sector despite intense negotiations at the military and diplomatic levels, and the disengagement process at some points of the LAC has virtually halted.No meeting between Indian and Chinese military commanders is scheduled for now and the possibility of a fifth meeting between them will be considered on the basis of the outcome of the WMCC meeting on Friday, the people said.Also Read: 8 Indian,US warships conduct maritime drills in Indian OceanThe scheduling of a meeting between the corps commanders will also depend on the People’s Liberation Army honouring the understanding on disengagement reached during the previous talks between the generals on July 14-15, the people added.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing on Thursday that the Chinese side would have to cooperate for the “complete disengagement” on the disputed frontier that was agreed on by the Special Representatives for the border issue, India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and China’s foreign minister Wang Yi.Also Read: Stage set for Australia to be part of next Malabar exercise with India, US, Japan“As we have stated earlier, the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is the basis of our bilateral relationship. Therefore, it is our expectation that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation ... as agreed to by Special Representatives,” he said.Srivastava pointed out that “respecting and strictly abiding by the LAC is the basis of peace and tranquillity in the border areas” and this was reflected by several agreements signed by India and China since 1993. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow at Gateway House, said there was a growing impression that de-escalation was a work in progress and would take considerable time. “India will need patience, perseverance, persistence and a dose of firmness....there have been contextual developments that are a good sign, such as the India-US naval exercise in Indian Ocean and the clear message emerging from the air force commanders’ conference,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-extradition-time-frame-in-vijay-mallya-case-uk/story-bChlujfj7tRJNSfu5kgVrL.html
24-07-2020||India||Congress deliberating on timing of floor test amid uncertainty||The Congress on Thursday said it was not disappointed with the Supreme Court’s order related to disqualification notices issued to its 19 rebel lawmakers in Rajasthan as it was not expecting a favourable verdict and has prepared a political plan to deal with the crisis while it is confident of proving its majority. ” The legal battle is just a part of the entire political battle. Knowing and understanding fully well that the courts may not give a decision in our favour, we have prepared our political plan,” said Congress leader Ajay Maken.The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to prevent the Rajasthan high court from pronouncing its decision on Friday on the petition of the rebels, including Sachin Pilot, challenging disqualification notices issued to them by the speaker. The Congress said there are two views in the party on holding a floor test in Rajasthan. “No doubt, floor test is the only solution and we can go for it any opportune time. We are confident of our numbers and will prove majority on the floor of the House. There are two views in our party. One section feels that we should wait for the proceedings in courts to be over and the other suggests that we should immediately go for the floor test,” Maken said.“But as far as the floor test is concerned, we are very confident and will easily cross the majority mark with at least a margin of 15-20 legislators in the final count,” he added, without elaborating. The Congress has the support of 101 legislators in the 200-member assembly; Pilot has the support of 22; the BJP and its allies have 75 members in the assembly; of the other two seats, one s the speaker and the other is an indisposed Congres legislator believed to be close to Pilot. Chief minister Gehlot has claimed the support of 115 legislators. Maken said a ruling party’s legislators seeking a floor test themselves is unheard of and also sought to establish a link between the dissidents and the BJP. “ Why are Harish Salve and Mukul Rohtagi appearing for the rebel legislators? Will they ever appear for the Congress? Who is Gajendra Shekhawat? Why is [Union home minister] Amit Shah’s police protecting them (the legislators)? Why is ED [Enforcement Directorate] raiding relatives of the chief minister? Isn’t this the BJP’s open support to rebel legislators?”The Congress has accused Union minister Shekhawat of being involved in the conspiracy to topple its government. It has alleged his voice can be heard in audiotapes of purported recorded conversations detailing a plot to bring down the government. Shekhawat has denied the charge and said he is ready for a probe.BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli said the Congress’s response to the Supreme Court’s ruling shows a lack of confidence in the strength of its arguments. “It is unfortunate that while invoking the honourable Supreme Court, which gave the Congress a patient hearing and is yet to adjudicate the matter, such a statement is being made. It confirms the Congress party’s lack of confidence in the strength of its own arguments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-deliberating-on-timing-of-floor-test-amid-uncertainty/story-VPfYwSqE0df115KcR46MFL.html
24-07-2020||India||Not just tax officials, 4 intel, investigating agencies get access to your I-T records||The Cabinet Secretariat, the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have been formally authorised to access income-tax returns (ITRs) and other tax-related information of individuals or firms, a move that will help these agencies in their efforts to curb terrorism and check drug trafficking, two government official said.A notification to this effect was issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Tuesday, the officials said requesting anonymity. Section 138 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 empowers CBDT to furnish information received or obtained by income tax authorities to any other enforcement authority, they added.Himanshu Parekh, partner and head - corporate and international tax at consultancy firm KPMG in India said, “The intention behind allowing such a free flow of information would be to empower the other agencies to take requisite action against the alleged offenders of law under different statutes.”Also Read: Covid-19 may further skew India’s tax profileThis provision enables “automatic” exchange of information relating to income-tax assesses with any tax authority, the Reserve Bank of India, and any other authority notified by the government, Naveen Wadhwa, a deputy general manager at Taxmann said. “The recent notification allows the tax department to share information of a taxpayer which might be relevant for the notified enforcement agencies,” he added.The officials cited above said seamless sharing of information with enforcement authorities such as NIA and NCB aims at greater national security. “While an honest taxpayer should not worry, incongruous information provided by unscrupulous elements to different authorities will now be caught,” one of the officials said.“The move has also made information exchange between the tax authority and other agencies formal and legally tenable in a court of law,” the second official added. Also Read: Faceless assessment brings in greater transparency: CBDT ChairmanExplaining the legal implications of the move for income-tax assesses, SR Patnaik, partner and head-taxation at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas said, “The action taken by the tax authorities cannot be challenged by the taxpayer on the ground that the tax authorities did not have the power to use such evidence against him.”Experts said taxpayers need to be very careful because discrepancies in information or documents provided by them could attract scrutiny by multiple agencies. “Various agencies and government bodies as notified can receive information from income tax authorities on taxpayers which can further help them in their own governance under various laws,” said Archit Gupta, founder and CEO of financial technology platform Cleartax.Also Read: No need to meet tax officer in case of scrutiny notice; use faceless assessment: I-T DeptAuthorities dealing with different taxation systems such as income-tax, customs and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) are now increasingly sharing information among themselves “automatically” to check tax evasion, the first official said.A memorandum of understanding between CBDT and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on information exchange was also signed on Tuesday, he said. “Access to data will help to quickly nab such unscrupulous individual or firms that claim false input-tax credit under the GST [Goods and Services Tax] regime”. While CBDT is responsible for income-tax related matters, CBIC is the apex body for customs, central excise and GST.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-secy-ib-nia-can-access-itrs-tax-info/story-r3uO6bYvTnharzXGyjh8aM.html
24-07-2020||India||Birth, death registration rates at all-time high in ’18||Birth and death registration rates in India were at an all-time high in 2018 with nearly nine in every ten births and deaths being registered, according to the latest civil registration system report published this week.More than 23.2 million births were registered in India in 2018 against an estimated 26 million live births which took place in the country – a registration rate of 89.3%. This is 4.4 percentage points more than the level of registration in the previous year.The birth registration rate increased between 2017 and 2018 after falling for three consecutive years. It was just 57.7% in 2003, increased every year reaching 88.8% in 2014 before showing a declining trend.Nearly seven million deaths were also registered in 2018 against more than eight million deaths estimated to have occurred in the country that year, a death registration rate of 86%. This is 6.4 percentage points more than the previous year. It also marks the eighth consecutive year for which the death registration rate in India has been increasing.It is compulsory to report births and deaths to the Registrar of Births and Deaths in India. Registration of birth is a right of every child and the first step towards establishing the child’s legal identity. Even as the birth registration rate of 89.3% looks promising, it also means that births of more than 10% or nearly 2.8 million children were not registered in 2018.Between 2017 and 2018, the birth registration rate increased in nine states while it decreased in 17 other states and union territories. Four states saw the highest percentage point growth in birth registrations between 2017 and 2018 – 18.6 percentage points in Uttar Pradesh, 12.2 in Uttarakhand, 8.3 in West Bengal and 6.6 in Bihar. At the same time, birth registration rate dropped by more than six percentage points in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in this period.The birth registration rate was 100% in 2018 in 13 states. Ten of these states had 100% registration rate in 2017 as well while the remaining three have also reached the 100% mark at least once in past few years.A bigger number of states have fared better in terms of improvement in death registration rates between 2017 and 2018. The rate increased in 16 states and dropped in only six others. It remained unchanged at 100% in 14 other states. In 2018, a total of 16 states recorded 100% registration of deaths. Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh marked the best improvement in terms of death registration rates as well, increasing it by 23.8 and 22.5 percentage points between 2017 and 2018 respectively.On the other hand, Telangana, Nagaland and Bihar saw the highest percentage point drop in death registration rates, 15, 11.4 and 8.1 percentage points respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/birth-death-registration-rates-at-all-time-high-in-18/story-17pgjXlOLPxarzWkW2KE3H.html
24-07-2020||India||MM Joshi denies charges in Babri demolition case||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Murli Manohar Joshi on Thursday denied all charges against him in the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition case, and dubbed them as fabricated and politically motivated. Joshi, 86, appeared before the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court to record his statements through video conferencing from his residence in New Delhi. Lawyer KK Mishra represented Joshi in the CBI court in Lucknow. “During the court proceedings, Joshi answered around 300 questions,” Mishra said. Judge Surendra Kumar Yadav of the CBI court ordered that a PDF file of Joshi’s statements be sent to the central agency’s Delhi office via email. The court also ordered CBI to get Joshi’s statement signed by him and sent back to the CBI court. On Friday, senior BJP leader LK Advani, 92, will appear before the CBI court via video link from his residence in New Delhi to record his statements. With Advani’s statement, the CBI court will complete recording statements of all 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, barring Shiv Sena leader Satish Pradhan, who has tested positive for Covid-19 and is under quarantine in Mumbai. The court has fixed July 28 for Pradhan to record his statements. Another accused, Om Prakash Pandey of Uttarakhand, is absconding for the last 16 years and the CBI court has issued orders to seize his property. The Babri mosque in Ayodhya was brought down on December 6, 1992 by kar sevaks who believed the structure was built on the birthplace of Hindu God Ram. The decades-old dispute over the site was settled last year when the Supreme Court ordered that the site be given to a trust to build a temple, and that alternative land be provided in Ayodhya for a mosque. Advani, Joshi, and others have been accused of being involved in the conspiracy to demolish the mosque.The foundation-stone laying ceremony of the temple is expected to be held in the first week of August with the Prime Minister in attendance. Advani, too, is expected to attend the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mm-joshi-denies-charges-in-babri-demolition-case/story-9RsPSoYcG2SePF0z2PzaKL.html
24-07-2020||India||Pilot, rebels move Rajasthan HC to add Centre as party||Sacked deputy chief minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs, who challenged notices for disqualification issued by the assembly speaker in the Rajasthan high court, moved an application before the high court on Thursday asking the court to include the Union government as a party to the case as validity of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution has been challenged.In the application through counsels S Hariharan and Divyesh Maheshwari, the legislators prayed that the Union of India through the secretary of Ministry of Law and Justice (Department of Legal Affairs) be made a party respondent to the present writ petition in the interest of justice and law.The application said that the union government should be included as a party because the validity of constitutional provisions (10th schedule) are under challenge. The 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India contains provisions relating to disqualification of lawmakers for defection.An identical application was also filed in the Supreme Court where the Rajasthan assembly speaker filed a special leave petition (SLP).The application was filed on the day the Supreme Court took up a plea by assembly speaker CP Joshi asking the top court to stay Rajasthan high court order of July 21 which directed speaker to defer action on the speaker’s notice till July 24. The Supreme Court eventually declined Joshi’s prayer to stay the proceedings before the high court and deferred the matter for further hearing on July 27.On July 15, the dissident Congress MLAs led by Pilot challenged their disqualification notices through a writ petition which was taken up on July 17 by a bench of Rajasthan High Court, comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta, and arguments were held.The hearing continued on Monday and the arguments concluded on Tuesday. The court will give its order in the writ petition on Friday.The notices to MLAs were served on July 17 after the chief whip of the party complained to the speaker that the legislators had defied a direction to attend two Congress Legislature Party meetings on Monday and Tuesday last week.The Pilot camp, however, argued that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.In its complaint to the Legislative Assembly Speaker, the Congress had sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2 (1) (a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution.The provision disqualifies MLAs if they ‘voluntarily’ give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.Pilot was sacked as deputy chief minister and the president of the state unit of the party after he rebelled against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.Legal expert Pana Chand said the application seemed to be an attempt to delay the proceedings in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-rebels-move-hc-to-add-centre-as-party/story-phZjwWWvYFSPzIQS4xpyaN.html
24-07-2020||India||EC defers bypolls to eight assembly constituencies||By-elections to eight assembly constituencies due in June-July have been deferred till September 7, the Election Commission said on Thursday.The polls deferred are those in Rangapara in Assam, Kuttanad in Kerala, Joura in Madhya Pradesh, Southern Angami in Nagaland, Pungro Kiphire in Nagaland, Bangermau in Uttar Pradesh, Suar in Uttar Pradesh and Dumka in Jharkhand.“It is hereby clarified that the aforesaid communication is only in respect of eight constituencies regarding which a reference to Ministry of Law & Justice was made vide letter No. 99/bye-election/2020/EPS dated 03.7.2020 due to some extraordinary circumstances peculiar to these constituencies,” EC statement said.“However, the total number of bye-elections due is 56 Assembly Constituencies (including the eight referred to earlier) besides one Parliamentary Constituency. Out of these total number of 57 bye-elections, it is hereby clarified that the Commission has already taken a decision to hold all bye-election as per provisions of Section 151A of the R.P. Act. In any case the deferring of aforementioned eight bye-elections is only up to 7th September, 2020,” the statement added.Under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the commission is supposed to hold a by-election within six months of any seat getting vacated either due to the death of a legislator or his/her resignation. The six-month period has not lapsed for the other 48 other assembly seats and one parliamentary seat.The issue of when the by-elections will be conducted is likely to be discussed on Friday at a meeting of the commission.According to EC officials who did not wish to be named, elections to the eight seats could not be conducted due to the “Covid-19 pandemic and other prevailing conditions in some of the states”.A new date will now be issued after EC’s consultations with the Centre. “The by-elections are likely to be conducted in September,” an EC official said on the condition of anonymity.The Congress’s Uttar Pradesh committee chief, Ajay Lallu, said the government decided to defer the polls because it was on the back foot over countering the pandemic, law and order and the situations of farmers.“On one hand, the pandemic is spreading rapidly in state,” Lallu said. “But to keep an assembly seat vacant for over six months is also not constitutional. EC will have to conduct polls soon.”However, state BJP spokesperson Chandramohan said the EC’s decision is independent of any politics. “The commission is an autonomous body,” said Chandramohan. “They must have taken into account the situation caused to the Covid-19 pandemic and then taken a call.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-defers-bypolls-to-eight-assembly-constituencies/story-dhIFQlVqoMhXgzlHNxQeHL.html
24-07-2020||India||Permanent commission for women in army approved||Five months after the Supreme Court ruled that women officers, who have joined the Indian Army through Short Service Commission (SSC), are entitled to a permanent commission, the defence ministry on Thursday issued a formal sanction letter in this regard. The order will pave the way for “empowering women officers to shoulder larger roles in the organisation”, an army spokesperson said.“In anticipation, the Army Headquarters had set in motion a series of preparatory actions for conduct of the Permanent Commission Selection Board for affected women officers,” the army said in statement. The board will be scheduled as soon as the SSC women officers exercise their option and complete the requisite documentation. The statement said the army is committed to providing equal opportunities to all personnel including women officers to serve the country.The Supreme Court in February ruled that women should be considered for command roles and that all women officers are entitled to permanent commission. It asked the army to give them permanent commission within three months in a major boost to gender parity. The Centre got a one-month extension on July 7 to implement the Supreme Court’s verdict after it moved an application before the apex court seeking the extension of the deadline by another six months citing the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to check its spread from March 25.The army, in May, made the Battle Physical Efficiency Test (BPET) mandatory for all women officers including those commissioned before 2009 and over the age of 35 (these officers were previously exempt). In March, it made a junior command course at Army War College, Mhow mandatory for women officers. There are around 600 women officers eligible for permanent commission, and a third of them are over the age of 40. Both moves have come in for criticism for women officers who have pointed to their timing -- after the SC’s verdict. The Supreme Court’s judgment was hailed for creating a new equality paradigm in the armed forces. It upheld a 2010 Delhi high court verdict. The Supreme Court ruled that women officers, who joined the Indian Army through SSC, are entitled to permanent commission even if they have more than 14 years of service. It also held that there cannot be an “absolute bar” on women officers being considered for command appointments, paving the way for their elevation to such roles. The case before the Supreme Court was only about permanent commission and command roles in the army’s non-combat streams.The defence ministry’s sanction specifies grant of permanent commission to SSC women officers in 10 streams--Army Air Defence, Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, Army Service Corps, Army Ordnance Corps, and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General and Army Educational Corps.Advocate Aishwarya Bhati, who represented women officers in the Supreme Court, said it was wonderful to finally see the defence ministry’s sanction. “I am elated,” said Bhati.Wing Commander Anupama Joshi (retd), who is from the first batch of women officers commissioned into the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the 1990s, said the government should be lauded over the defence ministry’s move. “As they say ‘a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.’ The government needs to be lauded for this leap. The equity has been achieved. However, equality still remains a goal to strive for,” said Joshi. She said the army should allow women in combat roles too.The Supreme Court in February ruled the army’s SSC women officers are entitled to permanent commission and they have to be considered for it irrespective of their service length. It held the Centre’s policy of restricting the permanent commission to SSC women officers with less than 14-year service as violative of the right to equality. The judgement was delivered on defence ministry’s petition challenging the 2010 Delhi high court verdict that ruled that SSC women officers in the army and IAF should be granted permanent commission on par with male SSC officers.The Centre issued a notification in February 2019 granting permanent commission to SSC officers of the army. However, as per its proposal, only SSC women officers with up to 14 years of service were to be considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/permanent-commission-for-women-in-army-approved/story-hj6ScKvb48UYDJgHsyyh3L.html
24-07-2020||India||Notice to youth climate group under UAPA ‘clerical error’: Delhi Police||The Delhi Police on Thursday said a July 8 notice sent to youth climate group Fridays For Future under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) was a clerical error, saying they had withdrawn it and sent a fresh one under milder sections on July 12.On July 8, police had issued a notice to Fridays For Future under Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which invokes Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, saying their website depicted contents “which are dangerous for the peace, tranquillity and sovereignty of India.” The notice was issued following a complaint by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar over getting multiple emails on his email with the subject ‘EIA2020’ (draft environment impact assessment notification 2020). Delhi Police on Thursday however said the July 8 notice issued under UAPA was a “clerical error”, which was withdrawn, and a fresh notice was sent to the group under Section 66 of the IT Act on July 12. Delhi Police’s additional commissioner MS Randhawa said late on Thursday that the police on July 16 wrote to Endurance Domains Technology, clarifying that they had also withdrawn the July 12 notice under Section 66 of the IT Act because the “unlawful activity had ceased”. “The notice under 66 IT Act (dated July 12) was also withdrawn on July 16 because such unlawful activities had ceased. The first notice (dated July 8) under the incorrect sections was a clerical error, so there was a fresh notice under 66 IT (on July 12) sent to the website. But this was also withdrawn on July 16 and the matter was settled,” Randhawa said.The Internet Freedom Foundation, which is providing legal help to Fridays For Future (the India arm of a global climate movement started by Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg in 2018), however, said they haven’t received any updated notice. Section 79 (3)(b) of the IT Act refers to being notified by government or government agency of any data or communication link being used to commit an unlawful act. Section 66 of the IT Act pertains to criminalising sending of offensive messages through a computer or other communication devices. Deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell), Anyesh Roy also said the July 8 notice under sections of UAPA was a clerical error. The officer said police learnt of the error on July 12, withdrew the notice and sent a fresh notice under Section 66 of IT Act the following day. “The notice was supposed to be sent under section 66 IT Act. It got mixed up with the other notice that was to be sent that day. We immediately withdrew the first notice and sent a fresh once under the correct section,” Roy said. According to the Internet Freedom Foundation, Fridays For Future’s website had been disabled by its domain service provider on July 10. Upon enquiry, the service provider had informed them that the website had been blocked in accordance with a notice received from the Delhi Police under Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which also invokes the UAPA. Fridays For Future shared a copy of the notice with the media, which read that after investigation on Javadekar’s complaints it was found that the website was sending emails to him. “Their unlawful activities on this website may disturb peace, sovereignty of India,” it said. “The website depicts objectionable contents and unlawful activities or terrorist acts, which are dangerous for the peace, tranquillity and sovereignty of the India. The publication and transmission of such objectionable contents is a cognizable and punishable criminal offence under Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,” the notice added. Punishment for conspiracy under the act is punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine. “The Draft EIA Notification 2020 is in public domain. Any suggestion and public comment can be sent to the official mail provided for the purpose i.e. eia2020-moefcc@gov.in till August 10, 2020 as mentioned in the notification. How is spamming the hon’ble minister’s personal mail with a lakh mails justified?” asked MOEFCC official spokesperson Gaurav Khare. Javadekar did not respond to requests for a comment. Fridays for Future, in a statement on Thursday, said their website fridaysforfuture.in was taken down on July 10 without any notice during the peak of their awareness campaign that intended to draw attention to the draft EIA Notification 2020 and make it easier for people to raise their concerns by writing an email to the MOEFCC and the environment minister. On Wednesday, Fridays For Future also sent a representation to the Delhi Police seeking the restoration of its website. The representation clarified that the website merely provided a template to make it easier for citizens to participate in the public consultation on the Draft EIA notification and it did not send the emails received by Javadekar which were actually sent by concerned citizens from their personal email IDs. “We are youth in India, inspired by the global Fridays for Future movement, who came together in 2019, after connecting digitally, to do good for the environment, our community and our country. We support our government’s on the commitments made to mitigate the effects of climate change…we raise awareness and engage in knowledge sharing online on related environmental issues, along with beach clean-ups, garbage drives, tree planting campaigns, community outreach, and sustainable lifestyle sessions, all without any financial support. Our website was a platform for those interested, to join us, and participate actively to protect the environment,” the group’s Thursday statement added. HT had reported on July 16 that the websites of three environmental, youth and student movements have been blocked since June 29. These include fridaysforfuture.in; letindiabreathe.in and thereisnoearthb.com--Indian movements focused on various environmental issues including air pollution. It couldn’t be confirmed if the two others were also blocked following Delhi police notice. “I think digital activism in today’s world for all issues specially climate justice is a very important avenue. Covid-19 has made it difficult for climate justice campaigners to do climate strikes and hence they provided a digital platform for people to reach out to public officials. It’s their constitutional duty to protect and work for the environment. Shocking that public officials are threatening them with charges of illegalities,” said Apar Gupta, lawyer representing Fridays For Future. The draft EIA 2020 has been in the eye of a storm because it is expected to overhaul the process of environmental regulation of infrastructure projects and has contentious clauses on regularising projects that violate environmental norms and shortening the time period for public hearings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/notice-to-youth-climate-group-under-uapa-clerical-error-delhi-police/story-Z3KES7Ksy0aD1qYweBdXxM.html
24-07-2020||India||Rajasthan police to probe role of Shekhawat in co-op case||A Jaipur court has ordered the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police to probe the alleged role of Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, his wife, and three others, in the Rs 884 crore Sanjivani Credit Cooperative Society fraud case.Additional district judge Pawan Kumar issued the order on July 21 -- it was made public on Thursday -- on a revision petition seeking, among other things, an investigation into the role of the Union Jal Shakti minister and his wife Naunad Kanwar in the fraud case registered by SOG in September 2019. The petition was filed by Ladu Singh and Guman Singh, residents of Barmer, who, along with some 50,000 other people, invested in the scheme that offered interest between 10% and 12%. Ladu Singh claimed to invest Rs 54 lakh and and Guman Singh Rs 14 lakh with Sanjivani Cooperative Society.They alleged that they got no return for their investments, and the money trail led to companies linked with Shekhawat and his wife. The head of Sanjivani Cooperative Society, Vikram Singh, was arrested last September and is in jail since then on charges of cheating, forgery and fraud.Shekhawat’s office said the Union minister will study the order before commenting on it. “We will read the order before putting out our reaction,” said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Rajendra Rathore, who is the deputy leader of Opposition in the state assembly.Shekhawat has been in the news in recent days after the Congress alleged his voice can be heard in audio tapes of purported conversations detailing a plot to topple the Ashok Gehlot government. Shekhawat has denied the charge and said he is ready for a probe. He was also named by chief minister Gehlot in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about an alleged attempt by the BJP to bring down the Rajasthan government.The SOG earlier this week issued a notice to Shekhawat to record his statement in connection with the taped conversations. Shekhawat had denied any role in state’s political crisis, and said that none of the voices in the tapes are his.The counsel for the complainants, Ajay Kumar Jain, said a magistrate’s court in Jaipur rejected the petition on July 13. But the additional district judge Kumar accepted a revision petition, filed on June 20. “I direct the investigative agency to conduct a probe into the complaint,” Kumar said in his order dated July 21.The cooperative society, which began operations in 2008 from Barmer, had allegedly cheated 50,000 investors of Rs 884 crore, the SOG said in a charge sheet filed in a Jaipur court on December 13, 2019.“The SOG found that documents between the year 2008 and 2015 were destroyed by the office-bearers of the society. Till June 30 this year (2019), 214,472 investors had invested Rs 883.38 crore but none of them were paid maturity dues,” the charge sheet added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-police-to-probe-role-of-shekhawat-in-co-op-case/story-7zoeS3q3UHJqNyhLKNValI.html
24-07-2020||India||Assembly session soon, will prove majority: Rajasthan CM||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said he will call an assembly session soon to prove his majority and later met governor Kalraj Mishra, hours after the Supreme Court dealt a blow to his camp by refusing to stay proceedings in the Rajasthan high court on the disqualification of 19 rebel legislators, including former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.Gehlot did not elaborate on when the session would be called but added that all issues -- from Covid to politics - will be discussed. “The assembly session will be called soon and we will prove the mandate in the house,” he told reporters. Later in the evening, he met Mishra for about 20 minutes and officials termed it a courtesy call. Congress leaders said on condition of anonymity that the meeting was to apprise the governor of political developments and discuss the possibility of holding a session. In his press conference, Gehlot expressed hope that rebel MLAs will come back and vote for the party in the assembly session.“Some of them (dissident MLAs) are calling and saying that we aren’t able to come out… bouncers are deployed. Even without them, we have the full majority and will come to the house with those numbers, and prove the mandate,” he said.His comments came hours after the top court refused to suspend proceedings of the Rajasthan high court, which is scheduled to pronounce a verdict on disqualification notices sent by speaker CP Joshi to 19 rebel Congress MLAs, including Pilot. The court is expected to pronounce its verdict on Friday. In the 200 member Rajasthan assembly, Gehlot camp has 101 legislators and Pilot camp has 22 -- including 19 Congress rebels and three independents. The Opposition has 75 MLAs, including 72 of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and three of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party.One legislator Bhanwarlal Meghwal -- believed to be close to Pilot -- is indisposed and the speaker casts his vote only to break a tie. This effectively means that Gehlot enjoys a narrow majority at the moment. Despite the ongoing turmoil in the state, the opposition BJP has not openly sought a trust vote so far . According to the rules, the governor notifies an assembly session 21 days prior to the first sitting but in an emergency situation, a session can be called within 24 hours for a specific agenda. The business of the house is decided by the Business Advisory Committee, which is headed by speaker CP Joshi.A senior government official said the legislative agenda might include approving an ordinance to amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, which the state government used in May to hike penalties for lockdown violations. “The calling of the assembly session would be more for disqualification of the rebel MLAs and negate any adverse ruling by the Rajasthan high court,” said a Congress leader, who was not willing to be named. The leader said a whip could be issued on voting on Ordinance and those failing to attend could be served disqualification notices for failing to attend the vote.In his press conference, Gehlot backed speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notice to 19 rebel legislators and said only “misguided” MLAs went to the court.“There are many judgments of the Supreme Court, where when the intentions are known that the MLA wants to leave the party voluntarily, the Speaker can issue notice and after holding hearings and discussions can take a decision on disqualification,” Gehlot said.The notices were issued on the petition filed by Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi with the speaker claiming that not attending the legislative party meeting translated to the rebel MLAs voluntarily giving up their party membership. The rebel MLAs moved the high court, claimed that the grounds of the notice was violation of constitutional guidelines and anti-defection laws.Gehlot also challenged Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to get his voice sample tested in connection with a controversy over a set of audio tapes. The Congress claims the tapes prove that Shekhawat was involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the state government while the central minister has denied all charges and said his voice is not heard in the tapes. “We can send it (audio tapes) for forensic lab testing to America, if they (BJP) have no trust in the government of Rajasthan,” Gehlot said. He added that the Congress was not afraid of raids by central agencies, referring to a number of raids in the past two weeks on firms and individuals with ties to the chief minister. BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the recent events exposed the CM, who did not have the legislators to prove his majority. “The CM’s statement has neither truth nor evidence,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assembly-session-soon-will-prove-majority-cm/story-7W33w69yt5VWU3i5hClsBM.html
24-07-2020||India||India builds a huge wall to stop Chinese firms from getting govt contracts||The Union finance ministry, in a late night development on Thursday, made an important amendment in its public finance rule that barred all government agencies from procuring goods and services from bordering countries such as China and Pakistan on the grounds of national security, two officials said requesting anonymity. “The Government of India today amended the General Financial Rules (GFR) 2017 to enable imposition of restrictions on bidders from countries which share a land border with India on grounds of defence of India, or matters directly or indirectly related thereto including national security,” the finance ministry said in a statement. The GFR laws regulate all matters related to public finance.The order takes into its ambit all public sector companies, autonomous bodies and public-private partnership (PPP) projects receiving financial support from the government, it said. State government and its undertakings have also been directed to follow suit.Also Read: Will ‘Boycott China’ strategy really help?The Department of Expenditure, an arm of the finance ministry, issued two separate orders on late Thursday night.While the first order barred public procurements from countries sharing land-borders with India, the second gave exemptions to certain neighbours whom India offers lines of credit.

24-07-2020||India||Prashant Kishor’s year-long Bengal survey behind CM Mamata’s big TMC shake up||Trinamool’s Lok Sabha member Mahua Moitra and former Indian cricketer and party legislator Laxmi Ratan Shukla have been made in charge of important district units in Bengal as chief minister Mamata Banerjee decided to overhaul the face of the party leadership by putting young faces at the centre of its campaign for the 2021 assembly polls.Veterans and those facing charges were either shunted out or given higher posts that TMC insiders described as “non-functional” in election-related matters.Banerjee replaced some key functionaries in north Bengal, where the BJP won all seven Lok Sabha seats in 2019, as well as those in the western districts of Purulia, and Bankura where the BJP’s deep inroads into the region’s sizeable tribal population ensured victory in the four Lok Sabha seats.Of the total votes polled in 2019, the BJP got 40.64%, winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats; while the TMC got 43.69%, winning 22 seats.In a simultaneous move, the TMC’s youth wing headed by the chief minister’s nephew Abhisek Banerjee was also overhauled and presidents of several district units were replaced in an apparent bid to end infighting between leaders of the party’s general and youth wings in several pockets.The TMC did away with poll observers and formed a seven-member steering committee for the 2021 assembly polls and a 21-member coordination committee. Significantly, Abhisek Banerjee was inducted in both committees. The massive changes, TMC leaders said, were made on the basis of a year-long survey made by political strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by the chief minister after the debacle in 2019.The poll results indicated that a sizeable chunk of young voters supported the BJP. For the ruling party, this is a cause for concern before the crucial assembly polls where alleged nepotism in distribution of cyclone relief funds and mismanagement in the health sector can be raging issues. “The allegations, though mostly blown out of proportion by the BJP’s campaign machinery, made it necessary for the party to bring in fresh faces, especially those who have a clean image,” a cabinet minister told HT on condition of anonymity. Significantly, Chhatradhar Mahato - the tribal leader from Jhargram district who headed the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCAPA), an alleged Maoists-backed outfit during the last years of Left rule and released from jail after 10 years - was inducted into the TMC state committee. His life term was commuted by the high court and the state released him in February.The BJP was not sitting idle. On Thursday, state president Dilip Ghosh and national secretary Rahul Sinha started a series of crucial meetings in Delhi with BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and Arvind Menon, who is in charge of West Bengal, to assess the party’s organisational strength in each of the state’s 294 assembly seats. BJP national executive member Mukul Roy, who switched over from the TMC in 2017 and masterminded several defections, is also in Delhi and he met Vijayvargiya on Wednesday. More leaders from Bengal will take part in these meetings.The Bengal BJP leaders will stay in Delhi till Saturday for more meetings, including one with party president JP Nadda. They are also scheduled to meet home minister Amit Shah.“Around 40 assembly seats were reviewed till Thursday afternoon. The central leadership wants our outreach programme to intensify in every polling booth area, especially in north and western Bengal where the TMC will now try to make a comeback. Also, our focus is on SCs, STs and erstwhile Hindu refugees from Bangladesh, a sizeable section of whom are Dalits,” a senior BJP leader told HT on condition of anonymity. To counter the BJP, Mamata Banerjee sent out a clear message to party workers and voters that she will not tolerate those who violate discipline, indulge in nepotism or keep personal interest above that of the party, said a TMC minister who did not want to be quoted. Citing examples, the minister said that cooperation department minister Arup Roy, who was president of the Howrah district unit and was recently accused of shielding corrupt leaders by forest minister Rajib Banerjee, a young face of the TMC, has been replaced.In another example, Swaroop Biswas, president of the TMC youth wing in south Kolkata and younger brother of PWD minister Aroop Biswas was replaced. The minister too did not find a place in the core committee despite being younger to most members of the cabinet.“I am happy. Now I have to tour all the 17 assembly segments,” said Lok Sabha member Mahua Moitra, who has been made president of the TMC’s Nadia district unit. “We have to keep working for the people. I will try to fulfill my responsibility,” said former cricketer Shukla, who has been made president of the Howrah district unit.State BJP leaders called the changes in TMC an eyewash and said it will not help Banerjee remain in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-kishor-s-year-long-west-bengal-survey-behind-cm-mamata-banerje-s-big-tmc-shake-up/story-Fqg72zL8dls0t7KNl8B5IO.html
