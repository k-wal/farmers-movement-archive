AIIMS director Dr Gitanjali Batmanabane said the hospital was facing a shortage of staff as many of the employees had tested positive for the disease and their contacts were in quarantine. Besides, many employees were residing in containment zones and therefore unable to report for duty.Earlier, the MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town of Ganjam and Acharya Harihar Regional Cancer Centre at Cuttack district had shut their OPD departments as many of their patients and doctors tested Covid-19 positive.Odisha’s Covid-19 scenario continued to be grim as the state’s daily growth rate continued to outpace the national average for about a week. On Thursday, Odisha’s daily growth rate was 5.43 per cent compared to the national growth rate of 3.5 per cent. The state has been reporting around 3,100 cases in the last 7 days.The sample positivity rate at 9.17 per cent has also overtaken the national average of 7 per cent. The surge in local cases as percentage of total cases continued to be higher than 30 per cent indicated community transmission.Meanwhile, the state government on Thursday decided to constitute an expert panel to examine the cause of the Covid-19 deaths. Health and Family Welfare minister Naba Kishore Das said the expert committee comprising specialist doctors, scientists from the Regional Medical Research Centre, Drugs Controller and Director Medical Education and Training would examine the cause of the deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-posts-highest-single-day-spike-of-covid-19-cases-with-577-new-patients/story-AKR1YtODYxc2Hy3axpmqKP.html

The statement didn’t say how many Pakistanis are still stranded in the country.A total of 627 Indian nationals stranded in Pakistan because of the pandemic returned to the country via the Wagah-Attari crossing during June 25-27.About 100 Indians are still in Pakistan and the government is in touch with Pakistani authorities and awaiting clearances to facilitate their return, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/75-pakistanis-stranded-in-india-due-to-covid-19-return-home-via-wagah-attari-crossing/story-QS7MZ9it1uIRnvAVtt09CL.html
09-07-2020||India||Nepal’s cable operators remove Indian news channels||Nepal’s cable TV operators on Thursday yanked Indian news channels from their networks over coverage of the Chinese ambassador’s meetings with senior Nepalese leaders even as country’s envoy in New Delhi raised the media reports with the external affairs ministry.Multi-system operators (MSOs) such as Dishome, Mega Max, DSN and My TV decided to stop beaming Indian news channels in Nepal from Thursday, with the sole exception being state-run Doordarshan News.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that there was no official ban on Indian news channels by the Nepal government.In a related development, Nepal’s ambassador Nilambar Acharya raised the issue of Indian media coverage of the Chinese envoy’s recent meetings with senior Nepalese political leaders and certain derogatory references in these reports during a conversation with the external affairs ministry, one of the people cited above said.Dhruv Sharma, vice-president of Mega Max TV cable network, said Indian news channels were resorting to “exaggerated and uncontrolled propaganda” about Nepal, especially “objectionable” reports that referred to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Chinese envoy Hou Yanqi.Rajan Bhattarai, a member of the central committee of the ruling Nepal Communist Party and foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, tweeted: “The news coming from Indian media against our PM and government after publication of new Map is condemnable. We completely reject their fabricated & fake reports. We urge them to respect Nepali government & people’s unified position on our sovereignty & national independence.”Nepal’s information minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada was asked specifically during a news conference whether the government would ban Indian channels, and he replied it would be better if the media exercised self-restraint and provided accurate news instead of the government resorting to a ban.However, he said the government will seek political and legal remedies against the Indian media’s reports that jeopardise the nation, nationality, sovereignty and self-respect of Nepali people.“We also request the media not to disseminate news that infringes on the sovereignty and self-respect of Nepalis. This includes the media of neighbouring countries,” said Khatiwada.The Chinese envoy in Kathmandu has had a series of meetings with the President and leaders of the Nepal Communist Party, including Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who are seeking the ouster of Prime Minister Oli, who has been accused of poor governance. The move against Oli has come at a time when his government issued a new map showing the Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal, thus triggering a border row with India.The people cited above said the Nepalese political leadership was particularly irked by derogatory references to Oli and the Chinese envoy by an Indian news channel, which suggested the premier could be “honey trapped” by the ambassador.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-s-cable-operators-remove-indian-news-channels/story-8WGa3TYqqLwSduBv5iDNGL.html

However, over the last few weeks, cheaper IMFL drinks from neighbouring states have been pouring into Odisha resulting in excise losses for the state.Last month, manufacturers of alcoholic beverages had urged the state government to reduce the special Covid fee from 50 per cent to a reasonable rate and allow retailers in the state to sell such products from outlets, an official said on Saturday.Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies director general Vinod Giri in a letter to the Odisha chief minister said the 50 per cent cess had led to a drastic fall in liquor sales.The state government from the beginning of this month has permitted opening of outlets after allowing them to sell via online. However, the shops would be open till 6 pm to avoid the evening crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-reduces-special-covid-19-cess-on-liquor-to-15-per-cent-amid-slump-in-sales/story-qBO78VGRhDp9Je6J3Gg8fL.html

The meeting with Manjhi lasted more than an hour.Manjhi’s party, which contested the Lok Sabha elections as part of the Grand Alliance, had demanded a discussion on issues of seat adjustment, candidates etc for the forthcoming Assembly polls. It had also set up a deadline for constitution of a co-ordination committee to manage the affairs of GA by June 25. The deadline came and went without any favourable outcome for Manjhi’s party.Senior BJP leader and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi took a dig at the internal rumblings in GA. “The number one party of GA (RJD) has rejected the demands for a co-ordination committee, and has even ignored senior Dalit leader’s ultimatum. The number two party has virtually become spineless, while other parties are like slaves,” said Modi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dinner-with-tejashwi-tea-with-manjhi-cong-sues-for-peace-in-ga-as-bihar-assembly-polls-draw-near/story-7CG07L8JPt1Om9sFqUXXLL.html

The owner who had seen him on TV became suspicious and called up the private security agency at the temple and informed them.” Ujjain’s superintendent of police (SP) Manoj Kumar Singh told reporters at a briefing.The Ujjain’s police chief said Dubey who had been on the run since Friday after carrying out an ambush that killed eight Uttar Pradesh policemen in Kanpur, had tried to hoodwink the security guards by giving a false name. “When he entered, private security guards informed our officials at Mahakal Chowki and started talking to him and asked his name. He gave them a false name but later gave his correct name. He was then taken to the police station where we interrogated him,” Singh said.The SP said Ujjain police also sought Dubey’s photograph from their counterparts in Kanpur for further confirmation that they had indeed nabbed UP’s most wanted man.“For further confirmation, we contacted Kanpur SSP and the STF and asked for his photo. We handed him over to the STF when they reached here. They later left for UP with Dubey,” Singh said.While Dubey was nabbed in the morning, teh UP STF arrested his wife Richa Dubey and elder son in the evening on charges of harbouring the gangster and acting in connivance with him, a senior officer of the Lucknow police commissionerate said.The UP police killed five of Dubey’s gang members and aides since they mounted a massive manhunt for him. Two of them were killed on Thursday – one in an encounter and the other while trying to escape from police custody. On Tuesday, Dubey had escaped from a Faridabad hotel shortly before the STF raided it.On Wednesday, the UP Police had raised the bounty on Dubey’s head to Rs 5 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shopkeeper-outside-mahkal-temple-tipped-off-security-guards-about-vikas-dubey/story-RfDKBBHcLn8EMuOxFad1yN.html

Among this active cases are 2,295 and recovered patients are 3,710. The state has reported 29 coronavirus deaths so far. Out of the 339 new cases, 133 contracted the disease through local contacts, 117 came from abroad 74 from other states. The state has pressed the emergency button after locally- transmitted cases surged.“According to World Health Organisation norms super spreading has occurred in some places including the fishing hamlet Poonthura on the outskirts of the state capital. If we lower our guard next is community spread which is round the corner,” said the CM adding the government was forced to enforce triple lockdown in the state capital after the situation worsened. He said the number of daily tests will be increased in the coming days.“Those who are on reverse quarantine are most vulnerable. They should heed the guidelines strictly. One tiny fault will derail all our efforts,” he said adding if the contact cases rise at the same pace community transmission will be imminent. Reverse quarantine is a practice of detaching most vulnerable people, aged or people with co-morbidity conditions, from the rest and monitoring their health indicators closely-- a method of protecting vulnerable people from getting the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-339-new-covid-19-cases-kerala-logs-highest-single-day-surge-critical-phase-says-cm/story-cSk61DfuwVJNt7e7p6kwPO.html

So I decided to come back,” said Tandi.But several of his friends in the nearby villages who worked in states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka could not return for more than a month. Many of them returned a couple of months later, some by hopping onto a bus or walking or by cycling. Sitting at home, without work, and seeing the videos of migrant workers travelling in pitiable condition stoked the inner rage of Tandi.After coming back, Tandi, who goes by the nickname of Rapper Dule Rocker in Kalahandi, did a 2.45 minute rap video called “Telling the Truth” in which he vents out his angst against the politicians. In May, Tandi made a 3.5 minute rap video called “Sun Sarkar, Sat Katha” in which he narrated how the migrant workers got a rude jolt by the virus and the subsequent distress.“In that video I rapped about how the migrant workers who had saved their hard-earned money lost everything and they lost everything in a matter of days after the factories and construction sites were closed due to lockdown. All that the leaders were doing were giving us sermons instead of helping the migrant workers. I was angry and so wrote down the rap song,” said Tandi, who first migrated out for work soon after completing his BSc degree in chemistry from a government college in Kalahandi in 2013.With the two acres of land mortgaged with a bank in 2014 for Rs 50, 000 in the year 2014, when his mother had to undergo a surgery in a hospital in Visakhapatnam, Tandi said he had no other way than to go out for work. He initially wanted to be a doctor, but had to give it up due to his family’s financial conditions. He then started giving tuitions in Borda village, but found the income too meagre to sustain and had to leave for other states. In 2017, his father, Nilamani Tandi, a farmer and local police station assistant, passed away.Though getting two square meals was difficult for Tandi, the Dalit boy had set his heart in rap music since his college days. “When I used to write lyrics for rap music, everyone used to dissuade me. Everyone used to say what would you gain out of it. But in my heart I knew that I wanted to be a rapper,” he said.In 2014, someone from Punjab saw one of his rap videos on Facebook and called him to perform at Chandigarh. “It was a new experience for me as I performed in different competitions,” he said. In 2015, he came to Bhubaneswar and visited studios, channels for making the videos. However, no one helped him as he did not have the money required to make slick rap videos. “One needs at least Rs 50,000 for making each such rap video, which I did not have. So I decided to stick to making the videos on my mobile phone,” he said.The rap songs on migrants that Tandi composed during lockdown have slowly become popular. After hearing his songs, Odia singer Humane Sagar recently gave Rs 30,000 to him. A local recording studio recently called him expressing an interest in recording his music.The Dalit youth insists that his rap songs would be about common people and their hardships. “I don’t want to promote sleaze or liquor in my songs. Migrant workers like us have too many issues. Those things would find a place in my songs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-rapper-from-odisha-s-kalahandi-is-telling-the-truth-about-migrants/story-bINseEJ7nJFTPntcNeA5cI.html
09-07-2020||India||Kanpur gangster Vikas Dubey’s wife, son arrested in Lucknow||The wife and son of gangster Vikas Dubey were arrested by a team of the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (UP STF) on Thursday evening.Richa Dubey, the wife of Vikas Dubey, and the couple’s elder son were arrested in Lucknow on the charge of harbouring the gangster and acting in connivance with him, a senior officer of the Lucknow police commissionerate said.They were being taken to Kanpur, the officer added.The gangster, wanted in the killing of eight policemen in Kanpur last week, was arrested earlier on Thursday morning in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain.The policemen, including a deputy superintendent of police, were ambushed in Bikru village in the Chaubeypur area of Kanpur, where they had gone to arrest Vikas Dubey and fell to bullets fired from rooftops last Friday.Watch how gangster Vikas Dubey reacted after being nabbed by police in MPVikas Dubey was on run since then and was finally arrested earlier today outside a famous temple in the pilgrimage city of Ujjain, ending a six-day manhunt across three states.Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra said that Dubey had arrived at the famous Mahakal temple in his car and was identified by a police constable, who alerted three others before he was questioned and arrested. He described Dubey’s arrest as a big achievement for Madhya Pradesh police.Dubey was carrying a reward of Rs 5 lakh for information leading to his arrest and has been on the run since the barbaric encounter of policemen near his residence in Kanpur. A dreaded gangster, Dubey is wanted for several criminal cases, including murders. He was accused of killing a BJP MLA in a police station 20 years ago but was acquitted for lack of evidence.He has been handed over to UP Police. Meanwhile, two more aides of Dubey were gunned down in separate encounters in Uttar Pradesh, police said. Five persons have been killed in police encounters since the Kanpur ambush.A relative of DSP Devendra Mishra, who was among the eight policemen killed in the Kanpur ambush, claimed that the arrest of Vikas Dubey was staged and the gangster was “saved from death”, according to PTI.“This is not an arrest but he has been saved from death. It was a surrender made in a well-planned manner,” he was quoted as saying by the news agency.Congress, too, has questioned Dubey’s surrender and demanded a CBI probe into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanpur-gangster-vikas-dubey-s-wife-son-arrested-in-lucknow/story-sIZlLfjIkZI1gfILbd1a6H.html
09-07-2020||India||In response to NGO’s plea to transfer funds, Centre defends PM Cares before SC||Creation of funds like the PM Cares Fund is not barred by the existence of other statutory funds like the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) under the Disaster Management Act of 2005, the Central government told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.In its affidavit filed before the top court, the Centre defended the PM Cares Fund stating that it is a fund established to carry out relief work and there are several such funds that have been established on similar lines in the past.“Mere existence of a statutory fund (NDRF) would not prohibit creation of a different fund like PM Cares Fund which provides for voluntary donations,” the affidavit said.The Centre’s response came on a petition by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) seeking transfer of all contributions made to PM Cares Fund till date to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).The NDRF is a fund created by the Central government under Section 46 of the Disaster Management Act for dealing with disasters.The PM Cares Fund, the petition claimed, has been set up in violation of the legal mandate under the Disaster Management Act as per which any grant made by any person or institution for the purpose of disaster management should be compulsorily credited to NDRF.The PM Cares Fund was set up by the Central government on March 28 as a public charitable trust with the primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation such as that posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.The petitioner pointed out that two weeks before setting up the PM Cares Fund, the Central government had, on March 14, communicated to all states that Covid-19 would be treated as a notified disaster for the purpose of providing assistance under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), a fund similar to NDRF and setup under the Disaster Management Act at the state level.The petitioner said that apart from SDRF, the Central Government should have included NDRF too, for the purpose of providing assistance in the fight against Covid-19 which was decided to be treated as a notified disaster. However, the same was not done so that the central government could later create the PM-CARES Fund.The Supreme Court had sought the Centre’s response to the plea in June.The Centre, in its affidavit, also gave details about steps taken by it to alleviate grievances of the poor and migrant workers.As on the July 7, around 42 crore people received financial assistance of Rs. 67,478 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package, the affidavit stated. Further, 37.07 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT) of food grains were distributed covering 74 crore beneficiaries in April. The number was 36.87 LMT in May and 31.18 in June. Similarly, under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat package, 8 LMT food grains were allocated for stranded migrants for two months, the affidavit highlighted.The Indian Railways operated 4,611 special Shramik trains from May 1 to July 6 bringing back 63 lakh migrants from various cities to states including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.“Mere criticism of a few may not be enough to undermine the humongous and unprecedented response given by our nation which includes, Central government and all state governments, local bodies, health care workers, sanitation workers and each individual citizen who are all corona warriors,” the affidavit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-response-to-ngo-s-plea-to-transfer-funds-centre-defends-pm-cares-before-sc/story-aN2CUBFXuhNZoEHvedovNJ.html

The incident came to light after her mother lodged a complaint on Wednesday stating that she committed suicide but police are suspecting she might have been murdered, said police. According to the police, the girl, a student of class 10 used to live with her paternal grandparents in a village of the district. Both her parents used to live separately in two different villages. One of the cops investigating the case said the girl’s pregnancy was detected two days ago on Tuesday. “On Tuesday, the girl complained of uneasiness after which her grandmother took her to a nearby health centre, where during diagnosis, the doctor revealed that she is five months pregnant. He also suggested her grandparents take her to a higher centre in Bageshwar,” said police inspector Prahlad Singh.Singh says that the girl’s grandmother, however, took her home, where the girl was scolded by her father who had arrived there after receiving the news. He left the same night.“All this while, they didn’t inform the girl’s mother who lives in another village about 2 km away. Then in the wee hours of Wednesday, the grandparents found her dead in the home,” said Singh. Heavy rains trigger landslides across Uttarakhand, one dead in car accidentThe police officer said that the grandparents, however, didn’t inform the police and buried her with the help of villagers after performing the last rites. “On Thursday morning, her mother came to know about the whole incident and lodged a complaint. Based on her complaint, we have booked a case against unidentified accused for rape and abetment to suicide under sections 376 and 306 of IPC and section 5/6 of POCSO Act followed by investigation,” said Singh.He added that permission has been sought from the district magistrate to exhume her body for post-mortem examination and DNA test to ascertain the cause of death and find the rape accused respectively.Uttarakhand braces for wet spell after MeT office sounds rain alertMeanwhile, another police officer privy to the investigation, said on the condition of anonymity that it could be a case of dishonor killing, “So far in the initial investigation, the case seems to be of honour killing. It is surprising how quickly the girl’s family members cremated her without informing the police about it.”The officer quoted above said that the incident was being discussed in the whole village and the police was alerted through its sources and decided to investigate.“It was the Police that informed the mother about the incident and asked her to lodge a complaint with the police for initiating a probe,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-family-claims-pregnant-minor-committed-suicide-police-suspect-murder/story-rsVvfdYUpxW5Wb0Pc5BsrO.html
09-07-2020||India||Disclose identity of Covid-19 patients for safety of others: PIL urges HC||Mumbai: A student of the Government Law College at Mumbai and a farmer from Maharashtra’s Solapur district have jointly moved the Bombay high court (HC) seeking a direction to the state authorities to disclose identities of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients because of the safety of “others, who may have come in their contact, and can take appropriate precautionary steps to protect themselves from the contagion”.Law student Vaishnavi Gholave and farmer Mahesh Gadekar filed the public interest litigation (PIL) through advocate Vinod Sangvikar.The plea contended that on several occasions Covid-19 patients are unable to recognise and give complete information about the people, who had come in their contact, because of which contact tracing becomes an arduous task and many suspect cases fall through the crack.The petitioners have cited the example of a meat seller from Muraji Peth in Solapur, who was found to be Covid-19 positive, and later it came to be known that about 1,000 people had unwittingly come in contact with him.“However, the infected meat-seller didn’t know all his customers’ names or their whereabouts,” it said.The plea stated that since there are about 25 meat-sellers in Muraji Peth and the name of the infected meat-seller was not disclosed, people did not know whether they had exposed themselves to SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and as a result, if they needed to take precautionary measures, triggering all-round panic and confusion.The plea expressed serious concerns about the growing risk of community transmission and argued that it is necessary to disclose the names of Covid-19 patients in a bid to make contact tracing easier and also appropriate precautionary measures can be taken such as self-isolation. The PIL cited that Maharashtra has been reporting a surge in Covid-19 positive cases even though the state government is still maintaining that community transmission has not occurred yet.It also questioned the policy of keeping the identity of Covid-19 patients under wraps while expressing fear that such unwarranted lack of voluntary disclosure might deepen the healthcare crisis, as the community transmission in the state appears to be a distinct reality soon.The PIL it is likely to come up for hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disclose-identity-of-covid-19-patients-for-safety-of-others-pil-urges-hc/story-wiFrWxGSo4lYIM7mhvdppL.html

District magistrate (DM) Nawal Kishor Chaudhary on Thursday issued a notice of this effect.All private shops and business establishments would remain closed except pharmacies, shops selling grocery, milk, fruits, vegetables and meat, which can remain open from 6 am to 6 pm.At least 226 people in the district, including policemen, medicos and other officials, have tested positive so far.In Purnia town areas, a weeklong lockdown will be enforced from July 10. Purnia district has reported 347 Covid-19 cases so far, of which 50 were reported from town areas during the last one week.In Supaul, where Covid-19 cases have grown sharply during the last few days, the lockdown will be enforced from July 10 to July 12. The district has reported 316 cases so far. A three-day partial lockdown in Kishanganj ended on Thursday.In Nawada, a three-day lockdown will begin on July 10.In Darbhanga, district magistrate Thiyagrajan SM said any decision on lockdown will be taken on or after July 13. “In view of the weather forecast, which has predicted heavy rainfall from July 9 to 12, a lockdown would affect relief operations in case of a flood-like situation. Heavy rains are expected in the basins of river Kamala and Bagmati in neighbouring Nepal and adjoining plains in this part of region,” he said.Meanwhile, Muzaffarpur District Magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh, who chaired a meeting with district officials to assess the condition, said, “The decision on imposition of a lockdown will be taken at the right time.”He, however, asked the office-bearers of North Bihar Chambers of Commerce and Industries to open their establishments only between 10 am to 5 pm and remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-more-districts-in-bihar-clamp-lockdown-to-contain-covid-19/story-57DAH8cjjJ9NsKbUEAcH9K.html

The present is not an adversarial litigation and it is the duty of the State to find shortcomings and lapses, wherever found, and to do the needful. The state cannot claim that unless the state is informed of the materials, it cannot reply or act”, the court said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe SC bench, which also comprised justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MR Shah, asked the Maharashtra government to file a fresh affidavit giving details about migrants who are still awaiting return to their hometowns.The Maharashtra government had stated in its affidavit that none of the migrant workers left in the state were desirous of returning home since the resumption of economic activities provided them with employment opportunities.“Ask Maharashtra to file a proper affidavit. Your (Maharashtra) affidavit is adversarial. This is not an adversarial case,” justice MR Shah told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Maharashtra government. The case will now be taken up on July 17.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The case on migrant workers was initiated suo motu (on its own) by the top court on May 26, nearly two months after migrants’ exodus from cities began after clamping of a nationwide lockdown on March 25. The top court was initially reluctant to entertain petitions relating to the troubles faced by migrant workers. Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, who had lost their jobs due to the lockdown, made frantic efforts to reach their home towns and villages from metro cities. Scores of them had set out on foot, to cover thousands of kilometers, in a bid to reach their homes. Many perished in road and rail accidents on the way and some others died of heart attack.In late April, the home ministry came up with a protocol to transport them by buses. Soon after, on May 1, the rail ministry announced special Shramik trains to carry them home. But the problems continued despite these measures, which eventually led to a suo motu case by the apex court.The court, on May 28, ordered state and central governments to adopt a slew of measures to alleviate the sufferings of the migrant labourers. The measures included free travel to home states, making provision for food and water and registration of migrant workers who are waiting to return home.During the hearing on Thursday, senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, representing the state of Bihar, pointed out that after the lockdown was lifted, the process of reverse migration had started with migrant labourers returning to the metros from their home states.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had called it a healthy sign of reopening of the economy leading to job opportunities for migrant workers. “In their home states, they were not getting work as per their skills. Now they are returning (to cities) after the economy is opening. It is a healthy (sign)”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-response-on-migrants-issue-makes-sc-remind-state-of-duty/story-ZxMzzqgNoMOEdktTxscBiP.html

Raghurama Krishnam Raju has been making wild allegations against us for his selfish political benefits,” the minister complained.A Similar complaint was lodged by YSRCP MLA from Narsapuram Mudunuri Prasada Raju with the local police.

Chances of multiple clusters forming in city regions and leading to superspread cannot be ruled out with the rising number of daily cases, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Thursday.“In Kerala, Poonthura is witnessing superspread of Covid-19. We have increased the number of testing and put in place strict measures,” the Kerala CM said.“We are going through a critical phase. We have to see whether we are edging close to community spread.

The leader also tweeted before and after pictures of the railway station suggesting the neglect over the years without naming anyone.Representing Amethi since 1999, Rahul Gandhi lost to BJP’s Smriti Irani at the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Gandhi now represents the Wayanad constituency in Kerala. “A heartfelt thank you to Piyush Goyalji for bringing about a transformation in Amethi’s Gauriganj station which has been lying in neglect for years,” tweeted Irani in Hindi. वर्षों से जर्जर स्थिति और नागरिक सुविधाओं के अभाव में जूझ रहे अमेठी के गौरीगंज स्टेशन का कायाकल्प करने हेतु रेल मंत्री @PiyushGoyal जी का हार्दिक धन्यवाद।स्टेशन पर यात्रियों के लिए Wi-Fi, कोच जानकारी प्रणाली जैसी सुविधाओं के सफल कार्यान्वयन हेतु @drmlko25 जी के प्रति भी आभार। pic.twitter.com/ewzUPooRWzThe station also boasts of facilities like Wi-Fi, coach information system for passengers, she said.A railway project linking Amethi to Unchahar in Rae Bareli, conceived originally in the 80s when Amethi was represented by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, is also something Smriti Irani is pushing hard at.The union minister, on her multiple visits to the constituency, has also discussed development of lesser known but locally important temples and sites.Right from her campaign time, Irani has been highlighting how Amethi despite being represented by Gandhi continues to lack in infrastructure and basic amenities. In April, just days after nationwide lockdown was imposed to check the spread of coronavirus, Rahul Gandhi sent 12,000 sanitisers, 20,000 face masks and 10,000 soaps for distribution among the people of Amethi.On his visit to Amethi in July 2019 days after the loss to Irani, Rahul said he would not abandon the UP constituency and would continue to visit it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smriti-irani-s-before-after-pic-jab-as-railway-station-in-ameti-gets-makeover/story-RfV3hK2FxcVoyqzQGSH5zO.html

It will be put out in public domain soon,” said Rajesh Bhushan, an officer on special duty (OSD) at MoH&FW, during a press briefing.He also announced that a follow-up sero survey by ICMR was also being conducted.“There is another sero-prevalence study being planned by ICMR across India as a follow-up to its mid-April study. Besides, the data of at least 22,000 samples that were collected as part of the Delhi sero-prevalence survey between June 25 and July 5 across 11 districts by the state government and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is being analysed in 15-odd laboratories of both Delhi and central governments,” Bhushan said.The blood samples are tested for detecting Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Usually, the IgG antibodies start appearing after two weeks of the onset of the viral infection and last for several months even after a Covid-19 patient has recovered. The IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infection but indicates an episode of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, according to experts. “Merely knowing the volume of people, who have been infected, will only provide a sense of the extent of the spread of the disease. However, what we must try to know is the quantity and quality of antibodies being produced against the virus. Also, for how long these antibodies stay in human blood in a bid to know if it’s enough to offer protection against the disease,” said Dr. Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology division, ICMR.ICMR is working towards making Covid-19 testing available even at a district level and in some states even at a block level in a bid to prevent the spread of the contagion.“We are focusing on the test, track, and treat approach for which we have to ensure that Covid-19 testing is accessible even at the grassroots level for early diagnosis. If we manage to detect the disease in its early stages, then the burden on our health infrastructure, especially hospitals, will be greatly reduced,” said Dr. Nivedita Gupta, scientist, epidemiology division, ICMR.ICMR has made the testing process smoother by waiving off the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) certificate for a private laboratory while applying for approval to conduct Covid-19 tests.“We are allowing even those laboratories that have applied for NABL certification to seek ICMR validation for Covid-19 testing. However, these laboratories will be given a month’s time for obtaining the certificate and to submit it to ICMR,” said Dr. Gupta.Bhushan seeks to ensure that the country’s healthcare infrastructure isn’t unduly burdened amid a widening gulf between Covid-19 active and recovered cases.At present, India has 3,914 dedicated Covid-19 facilities complete with 3,77,737 isolation beds (without intensive care unit, or ICU, support), 39,820 ICU beds, and 1,42,415 oxygen-supported beds along with 20,047 ventillators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-localised-outbreaks-but-no-community-transmission-yet-govt/story-GN3IiC7rpRM3T2A1h9b0VJ.html

As a precautionary measure administration has cautioned villagers and slum dwellers residing near the river and asked them to stay away from it during the rainy season.Additional police personnel and city patrol unit (CPU) were deployed at water logged intersections and highway points to divert and manage traffic. Traffic snarls were reported for over two hours from various parts of the city.Haridwar Mayor Anita Sharma has blamed local legislator and urban development minister Madan Kaushik for not cooperating with her in providing a long term solution of water logging in the city.“For the past 20 years he (Kaushik) has been the local legislator. He is also the urban development cabinet minister but the water logging problem has still not been solved. Owing to political interests, the BJP government has been ignoring my suggestions and proposals in this regard,” said Sharma.Denying the mayor’s charges, Kaushik said that already work has started under Amrit Yojana to provide a permanent solution to water logging at Chandracharya square, the busiest square of Haridwar.Meanwhile, in Pauri Garhwal, 11 village roads were blocked due to landslides triggered by rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-braces-for-wet-spell-after-met-office-sounds-rain-alert/story-PShgn9XTzh0fhXB3POkkpI.html

09-07-2020||India||Main accused in Kerala gold smuggling racket moves HC for anticipatory bail||The ruling CPI(M) in Kerala on Thursday asked the Union Government to speed up the probe into the gold smuggling racket even as the main accused Swapna Suresh moved the High Court for anticipatory bail.“Some people are creating a smoke screen to target the state government. We have nothing to hide. The CM had sent a letter to the Prime Minister saying the state is ready for any probe. But it is getting delayed. We suspect delay is aimed at embarrassing the government,” said LDF convenor V S Vijayaraghavan.He said the state has scaled many heights in the fight against the Covoid-19 pandemic and the opposition Congress and BJP were worried over its growing popularity.The Customs department had seized 30 kg gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates to the country’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. Swapna Suresh, who was working as the operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT Ministry, had gone underground after the seizure. Later the CM had transferred his principal secretary M Sivasankar who was close to Suresh.Amid the controversy Suresh sent an audio tape to a news channel on Thursday claiming that there was a concerted move to target the government ahead of the assembly elections next year and she had been made a scapegoat. She also claimed that she made a call to the Customs to release the consignment after she was asked by the UAE consular office. She also said she feared for her life.Despite the CPI(M) and coalition rallying around the CM many party insiders say the latest incident has dented the image of the government when the elections are just 10 months away. The case has surfaced at a bad time for chief minister Vijayan who is known for his tough postures. Many political pundits had predicted an easy re-election fuelled by records in fighting the pandemic.Since the 1970s, no government has returned to power for a second successive term in Kerala but Vijayan was tipped to break that record until the gold smuggling racket blew up leading analysts to draw parallel with the 2013 solar scandal in which a woman allegedly cheated many by flaunting her connections.“If something serious happens in his office the CM is responsible for this,” Vijayan’s words during the solar scandal, has returned to haunt him. Social media activists have gone on overdrive reproducing some of his fiery speeches cornering his predecessor Oommen Chandy.“This has a familiar ring to the solar scandal that routed the ruling UDF in 2016. A scandal is a scandal and whether there is substance in the allegations is electorally irrelevant. That is the history of the state,” said senior journalist and political observer John Mary. Some of the allies of ruling dispensation have started airing their displeasure against the way Vijayan protected former principal secretary M Sivasankar. Junior partner the CPI said it warned him about the “freestyle” of his secretary several times but the CM ignored them. It said the CM’s favourite trouble shooter has started giving him enough trouble now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/main-accused-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-racket-moves-hc-for-anticipatory-bail/story-NJxIAsZnuHshdIRIZj3fWM.html

Among the properties attached is a bungalow with an estimated worth of around Rs 685 crore, located on 40 Amrita Shergill Marg in Delhi and properties worth Rs 1,411.9 crore belonging to Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) group, said officials.“The present market value of these assets is more than Rs 2,800 Crore and include immovable properties in India and abroad, bank accounts, investments, luxury vehicles etc. These assets belong to Rana Kapoor, Kapil Wadhawan & Dheeraj Wadhawan and the entities controlled by them,” an official statement by the agency said.Other attached properties linked to Rana Kapoor and related entities include an independent residential building “Khursidabad” at Cumbala Hill; three duplex flats at Napean Sea Road in Mumbai, residential flat in NCPA at Nariman Point and eight flats in India Bulls Blue, Worli, MumbaiAttached properties linked to the Wadhawans include -- 12 flats and individual houses in Mumbai and Pune apart from properties in New York, London and Australia apart from 344 bank accounts, the official statement added.The development follows a Hindustan Times report on July 7 stating the ED action in the case was imminent. The ED officials had indicated on condition of anonymity that a Central London property linked to Rana Kapoor as well as his fixed deposits worth around Rs 50 crore were also likely to be attached in the coming days.The ED is probing Kapoor’s alleged use of the bank to extend loans in exchange for “kickbacks” as detailed in a chargesheet filed by the agency on May 6 this year.Three London properties including a office-cum-guest house at 77 South Audley Street worth 11.5 million British Pounds and another residential property, both in the name of a company run by Kapoor’s daughter Rakhi Kapoor, Doit Creation Jersey Ltd, were on ED radar.Several expensive properties owned by Kapoor’s family and companies run by them have been identified by the agency.

09-07-2020||India||Incessant rains prevent Nepalese pensioners from visiting Indian banks||Incessant rains in the high altitudes of far-western Nepal caused further inconvenience for Nepalese nationals in drawing their monthly pensions from the bordering town of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district, as they have not been deprived of the facility since end-March because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, an official said. On Thursday, only 132 Nepalese nationals could draw their monthly pension from Pithoragarh district, he added. Entry points and bridges on the Indo-Nepal border at Jhulaghat, Jauljibi and Dharchula areas of Pithoragarh district have been opened for three days from Wednesday amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Around 2,000, 700 and 800 Nepalese nationals from Kanchanpur, Baitadi and Darchula districts, respectively, from far-western Nepal, have not been able to withdraw their monthly pensions after the Indo-Nepal border check-post was sealed because of the lockdown restrictions, which were imposed in Uttarakhand on March 22 to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. Earlier, the Nepalese nationals had demanded the Indian authorities for the opening of the international border check-post in a bid to withdraw their pending monthly pensions from the Indian banks amid their deepening financial woes and acute cash crunch.On Wednesday, incessant rains prevented many Nepalese pensioners from visiting Pithoragarh district, even though the border check-post is opened from Wednesday till Friday.Official data showed that 86 and 51 Nepalese pensioners visited banks at Jhulaghat and Dharchula, respectively, on Wednesday to withdraw their monthly pensions, while nobody turned up at Jauljibi area because of heavy rainfall.Nepalese pensioners are allowed to enter India only after they produce a medical certificate declaring them Covid-19 negative at the international border check-post, officials said. “I had to obtain a fitness certificate from Dasharathchanda, the headquarters of the Baitadi district. I could only enter India after I showed the certificate and underwent a thermal screening at the border check-post,” said Mahadev Bhatt (62), a pensioner and a resident of Baitadi district in far-western Nepal.The monsoon fury makes it an arduous trek to India for the Nepalese pensioners, who have a tough time to make the journey amid negotiating gushing mountain streams and overflowing nullahs that are swollen due to incessant rains.“Most senior citizens are avoiding the journey to India because it has become doubly risky to travel to their respective district headquarters for obtaining the fitness certificate and then visit an Indian bank in Jhulaghat to withdraw the monthly pension,” said Prem Chand, a Nepalese pensioner’s son, who accompanied his elderly father to Pithoragarh district.Some of the veteran ex-servicemen pensioners were carried on backs by their sons on Thursday, as they are too weak to walk.Jhulaghat market was shut on Wednesday in the wake of the Nepalese nationals’ arrival amid fear of a community transmission following a spike in Covid-19 positive cases in some districts in far-western Nepal.“Jhulaghat market was shut down on Wednesday amid fears of Covid-19 pandemic that’s spreading in far-western Nepal and the arrival of Nepalese nationals. So far, Baitadi district has reported 239 Covid-19 positive cases,” said Pramod Bhatt, who owns a mobile phone shop in the market.Kamlesh Joshi, the bank manager at State Bank of India’s Jhulaghat branch, said: “132 Nepalese pensioners withdrew their monthly pension till 2 pm on Thursday. Wearing of masks and maintaining of social distancing is our priority. The bank premises were sanitised on Wednesday, as a precautionary measure.”Dhan Singh (78), a Nepalese national, died on Wednesday evening after withdrawing his monthly pension. He was suffering from asthma, his son had told the police. Singh died on the Indian side of the border check-post on his way back home. Later, his body was handed over to the Nepalese authorities, the police added. Nepalese are recruited in the Indian Army as per 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty.The Nepal government allows its citizens to serve in Indian Armed forces and in return India permits Nepalese to work anywhere in the country, except the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), in accordance with the treaty.Many Nepalese nationals serve in the Indian Army and after retirement they return to their respective native places in Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/incessant-rains-prevent-nepalese-pensioners-from-visiting-indian-banks/story-o86G0Go8xg0XoMqDC2Jf0K.html

Dubey, who was spotted a day ago at a hotel near Faridabad, turned up at Ujjain’s Mahakal temple when he was reportedly identified by the temple guard who informed the police. Upon arrest, the notorious criminal, in dramatic fashion, yelled “main Vikas Dubey Hoon, Kanpur wala”, promoting the policeman standing behind him to thwack him on the head, while other policemen around him were seen guarding him. The criminal, who has 60 criminal cases against him, has been on the run since last Friday after allegedly killing eight policemen in an ambush who had gone to arrest him. He was finally arrested in Madhya Pradesh. Here are the top 10 developments in the story:* Vikas Dubey was arrested outside a temple in the pilgrimage city of Ujjain on Thursday after purchasing prasad and an entry ticket to the shrine. However, temple sources, according to PTI, say Dubey reached the temple gate in the morning and purchased a Rs 250 ticket from a counter near the police post. When he went to a nearby shop to buy prasad for the deity, the shop owner identified him and alerted police. Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra said two of Dubey’s associates were also arrested.* Dubey will be brought to Uttar Pradesh on a transit remand. “Our campaign against all those involved in the Kanpur case will continue till not even a single member of the Dubey gang is left,” said UP ADG, Law and Order, Prashant Kumar. A police team, led by the investigation officer (IO) in the case from Kanpur, will reach Ujjain as soon as possible to bring Dubey to the state, the officer added.* Asked whether it was a joint operation of the Madhya Pradesh police and Uttar Pradesh police, The Uttar Pradesh top cop said, “No, our team was not there.” * Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted, “Those who feel that after going to the Mahakal temple, their sins will be wiped out, they do not know about the Mahakal. Our government will not spare any criminals.” Chouhan said he spoke to his UP counterpart Yogi Adityanath after the arrest.* Dubey’s mother Sarla Devi said that her son is with the Samajwadi Party, a claim denied by the party. On being asked what should be done by the government after her son’s arrest, Sarla Devi said, “The government should do whatever it feels appropriate (sarkar jo uchit samjhe, woh kare).”“At this time, he is not in the BJP, he is with the SP,” she told reporters.* Two more aides of Dubey were gunned down in separate encounters in Uttar Pradesh today, police said. * Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has sought a Central Bureau of Investigation probe in gangster Vikas Dubey’s case, raising questions over grant of “protection” to him.* Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav asked the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday to clarify whether it was a “surrender” or an “arrest”.* The UP administration bulldozed Dubey’s house and his cars and launched a massive hunt for him. Over the last week, five of Dubey’s accomplices were killed. * Eight policemen, including a deputy superintendent of police, were ambushed in Bikru village in the Chaubeypur area of Kanpur, where they had gone to arrest Vikas Dubey and fell to bullets fired from rooftops last Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vikas-dubey-s-dramatic-run-from-up-ends-at-madhya-pradesh-temple-10-points/story-jgnUYrqTLJ0Cixt6ynDXtM.html

We are keeping abreast with the information coming from WHO headquarters on this aspect,” Rajesh Bhushan, OSD, Ministry of Health said.The WHO had initially maintained that the SARS-CoV2 primarily spreads through droplets expelled from the nose and mouth of an infected person that quickly sink to the ground.But in an open letter to the WHO, published on Monday in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal, 239 scientists in 32 countries outlined evidence that they claim shows floating virus particles can infect people who breathe them in. The scientists gave urged the WHO to update its Covid-19 guidance because the smaller particles can linger in the air.Despite a surge in new cases of Covid-19, India has maintained that there is no community transmission of the disease yet.“World Health Organization (WHO) has also not provided any standard definition of the localised outbreak and community transmission. They have given its member states the right to report after assessing the local conditions,” Bhushan said.India’s Covid-19 tally on March 25 when the lockdown began stood at 618 including 562 active cases. In the next three and a half month, the tally has risen to over 7.67 lakh including 4.76 lakh recovered cases, 2.7 lakh active cases and over 21,000 casualties.

District collectors have already been empowered to take over wards, rooms and blocks and if necessary, entire hospitals in the private sector, based on the requirement.The government has instructed private hospitals to start isolated rooms, wards and blocks to treat suspected Covid-19 cases duly following safety measures. The allocation of beds will be monitored by the respective district administrations to ensure optimal usage of resources.Accordingly, the state government has classified all private hospitals into three categories: exclusive Covid-19 hospitals which will treat only Covid-19 patients, Covid-19 and Non-Covid-19 hospitals which can cater to both types of patients with separate facilities for Covid-19 patients and non-Covid-19 hospitals which will be allowed only to treat non-Covid-19 patients.The hospital management is responsible for transferring the normal patients to Covid-19 hospitals, if they develop any symptoms of the viral disease.The order further fixed the rates to be charged by the private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. For patients who have mild symptoms for Covid-19 with no abnormality, they would be charged a fee of Rs 3,250 per day. For critical care patients who need treatment in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) but without ventilator, the fee would be Rs 5,480 per day.For patients, who are admitted to ICU with oxygen support, the hospitals can charge Rs 5,980 per day. Those who are put on ventilator support in the ICU, the charges will be Rs 9,580; for patients with Sepsis the charges are Rs 6,280 without ventilator and Rs 10,380 with ventilator.“If the patient falls under the Dr YSR Arogyasri scheme, the treatment will be free and the government will reimburse the fee as per the fixed rates to the hospital management. Those who do not fall under the scheme will have to pay the charges as fixed by the government,” the special chief secretary said in the order.If the non-critical Covid-19 patient prefers to stay in a private room, the private hospitals can charge an additional amount of Rs 600 apart from the price fixed for non-critical Covid-19 cases.The government instructed that no patient who requires immediate medical attention can be turned away by any hospital and treatment should be administered without waiting for the results of the Covid-19 test. “Until the patient tests negative, he/she should be treated as a Covid-19 case,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patients-below-poverty-line-to-get-free-treatment-in-andhra-s-private-hospitals/story-8wDmXSMI95HDZvrJTakhBJ.html

The block is located about 20 kilometres (km) from Almora town, the district headquarters, in the hill state’s Kumaon region.Earlier on Tuesday, state forest department officials had declared the leopard a “man-eater” after it claimed five lives in the area.Sanchita Verma, range officer, Almora, said, Anandi Devi (70), wife of late Hari Ram of Petshaal village, had gone missing since Tuesday evening. Her half-eaten body was found by villagers around 100 metres away from her house the following evening. “She used to live alone, as her husband had passed away. Forest officials reached the spot after the villagers informed them and took the body in their possession. Later, the body was handed over to her relatives after an autopsy was done, ” Verma said.Petshaal village is located 15 km away from Almora town.“We have installed a cage in Petshaal village and deployed forest officials there to catch the man-eater leopard. Two cages have also been set up in Udal village,” she saidShooter Shaifi Ashif from Bijnore in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh reached Almora on Wednesday evening at the invitation of the state forest department officials and a hunt has been launched for the man-eater leopard.A delegation of local Congress workers has handed over a memorandum to Nitin Singh Bhadauria, district magistrate (DM), Almora, urging him to pass it on to Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat.The memorandum has demanded an immediate elimination of the man-eater leopard from the Bhaisiyachhana block of Almora district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-after-18-month-old-baby-leopard-now-kills-elderly-woman-in-same-area/story-Kbj17MxU58IFMzTcwQcfGP.html
09-07-2020||India||Harish Rawat has bounced back in Uttarakhand politics with lockdown protests, say experts, BJP calls it show off||Former Uttarakhand chief minister and party national general secretary Harish Rawat has held several protests against the BJP-led Central and state governments in the past two months, marking the party’s presence in the state. In the past few days, Rawat has held at least three individual protests including the bullock cart rally, sit-in demonstration near the Governor’s house and a rally over the fuel price hike issue. All these were held after he came out of home quarantine followed by a visit to Delhi amid the pandemic. Believing that Rawat had managed to build a momentum in favour of the party, the top leadership of the Congress asked him earlier this week to guide the party to victory in 2022 state Assembly elections. Rawat assured the party leadership including state unit president Pritam Singh and leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh of contributing fully for the stated party cause. Also Read: Uttarakhand CM says state won’t use Chinese equipment and devices in govt projectsRawat said the party needed to pull together under Pritam Singh’s leadership to defeat the BJP, “I am ready to be present for the party wherever and whenever it needs me. We all have to put our differences to rest by sitting together and resolving them. Then only we can fight BJP in the state.”Indira Hridayesh said Rawat’s position as a senior leader in the state was an important factor, “We all have to leave our differences behind with the sole motive of defeating the BJP in the 2022 elections. We all asked Rawat to guide the party towards that goal as he is a senior leader.”Political experts believe Rawat has played his hand well to remind the party of his importance in Uttarakhand politics. “Rawat is a very well seasoned politician. He knows when to play which card as he, too, is aware of his importance in the state Congress and Uttarakhand’s politics,” said MM Semwal, political expert and professor of political science at Garhwal Central University in Srinagar, Pauri Garhwal,Also Read: Uttarakhand fixes distance for setting up of stone crusher, hot-mix plants near Ganga, other riversHe added that Rawat’s individual protests refurbished his image of a leader with political heft and acumen.“With the individual protests away from the party line, he was very successful in getting all the limelight and bringing Congress back into focus. It was evident from the fact that many top leaders of the ruling BJP had to come forward to counter him as they know him to be clever,” said Semwal. Semwal claimed that Harish Rawat had reminded the Congress that his popularity, both in Garhwal and Kumaon regions of the state, made him difficult to sideline despite the loss in the last elections. He added that “Rawat definitely has his eyes set on fighting 2022 elections.”The BJP however, took a dig at the developments in the state Congress and brushed it off as mere “show-off”.“They are showing unity because they have been given a dose on the issue from their national leadership. Having said that, no matter what they do, we have a very strong worker base in every booth of the state which Congress can’t match,” said Bansidhar Bhagat, BJP state president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harish-rawat-has-bounced-back-in-uttarakhand-politics-with-lockdown-protests-say-experts-bjp-calls-it-show-off/story-rC6OA3BDmE1zO7ZnvRzo2H.html

The 2011 Census shows the state’s population of around one core and by that figure, it has tested 732 people per lakh population. While the UTs of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) and Ladakh have conducted 3,388 and 4,944 tests, respectively. Only Mizoram ranks after Uttarakhand with 708 tests per lakh population,” he said.The average figures were calculated based on the 2011 Census for all the states.In the case of UTs of J&K and Ladakh, the population is considered to be 1.22 crore and 3 lakh, respectively. In Uttarakhand, Dehradun is the first district to conduct over 1,000 tests per lakh population.In the plains, Haridwar district, the most populous district, has conducted the least number of tests.While hilly districts like Rudraprayag and Champawat have done most tests per lakh population in that category of far-flung parts of the Himalayan state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-uttarakhand-s-testing-18-lesser-than-national-average/story-y5CG5I2GIyKprIHtxa5I8J.html
09-07-2020||India||India, China diplomats to meet on Ladakh stand-off tomorrow to expedite pullback||India and China will on Friday discuss ways to build on the disengagement process that was started this week after the conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, people familiar with the development said. Friday’s meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on Indo-China Border Affairs (WMCC) is the first formal interaction at a diplomatic level after the Doval-Wang icebreaker video call on Sunday on the Ladakh stand-off. The WMCC, set up in 2012 to address tensions along the Line of Actual Control, is headed by Naveen Srivastava, the joint secretary (East Asia) in the external affairs ministry, and Wu Jianghao, director general in the Chinese foreign ministry.Naveen Srivastava and Wu Jianghao had their last meeting on June 24 when they concurred that the two sides need to quickly implement disengagement and de-escalation steps agreed on by senior military commanders. But this agreement did not lead to any change in the ground situation and a belligerent Beijing continued to attempt to amp up pressure on India, accusing New Delhi of violating bilateral agreements and provoking the June 15 clash in Galwan Valley that led to casualties on both sides.Also Read: At top panel meet on China border, India reviews troop pullback and possible red flagsGovernment sources told Hindustan Times that Friday’s meeting was being held under different circumstances, largely on account of the seven-hour-long video call between Doval and Wang. The two leaders had agreed that diplomatic and military officials would continue discussions at their level including under the WMCC framework.Doval and Wang are expected to touch base in another 2-3 weeks to review the progress made on the ground.For now, the Chinese troops have pulled back about 1.5 km at the Galwan valley standoff point - also the site of the June 15 violent scrap - where they were at a clear disadvantage. India was in control of the heights at this location while the Chinese People’s Liberation Army soldiers had been camping near the Galwan river bank. At one point, their camps were also flooded due to a rise in the water level.“The PLA made a virtue out of necessity,” an army commander said, underlining that the PLA’s position in Galwan Galwan valley had been untenable. At the other two standoff points in the Galwan region - Hot Springs and Gogra - the process of disengagement is in progress but is proceeding at a slow pace.The thinning out of Chinese soldiers is, however, the slowest around the fourth standoff point near Pangong Tso, the saltwater glacial lake spread across 700 sq km.Beijing, which has been facing pressure on other fronts including the South China Sea, stressed that the “situation along the border is stable and improving.The two sides will continue dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels including by holding (a) meeting of the WMMC on border affairs,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian told a news conference on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-diplomats-to-meet-on-ladakh-stand-off-tomorrow-to-expedite-pullback/story-m5pwHrTMxKycWzCd4w2KMM.html

Despite a population of 1.3 billion people, India has been able to manage Covid-19 relatively well. If you look at cases per million populations, it still remains amongst the lowest in the world,” Rajesh Bhushan, OSD, Ministry of Health said.Amid a sudden surge in coronavirus patients across states over the last few weeks, the country’s viral caseload is an estimated 2,69,000 people. “When we talk of the caseload of Covid-19 in India, it is 2,69,000 people. This tells us that at the end of the day we’ve managed a situation where our health care infrastructure is not unduly burdened and is not creaking due to the pressure,” Bhushan said.ALSO READ | India’s pharma industry an asset for entire world, says PM Narendra ModiCurrently, India has 538 cases per million population, which is as per the World Health Organization’s situation report. Cases per million population in some countries are at least 16-17 times more than what it is in India. The country has 15 deaths per million population whereas there are countries where it is 40 times as much, the health ministry data indicated.“The number of Covid-19 tests has increased, on an average, we are testing more than 2.6 lakh samples per day. We hope to see a further rise by the use of the antigen test,” ICMR’s senior scientist Nivedita Gupta said.About 10 per cent of India’s population (60 years and above) accounts for 53 per cent of the country’s Covid-19 related deaths, the health ministry official said.National capital Delhi which recently crossed the 1 lakh mark of Covid-19 cases has showed remarkable improvement, with a recovery rate of over 72 per cent, according to the ministry’s latest data.

09-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand CM says state won’t use Chinese equipment and devices in govt projects||Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Thursday weighed in on the India-China border stand-off and announced that the state government would refrain from using any Chinese equipment and devices in state-run projects, while lavishing praise on the Central government’s Atmanirbhar or self-reliant programme that seeks to tide over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced economic distress.Rawat made the announcement during a press conference in the state secretariat in Dehradun while replying to a question from a media person on stopping Chinese involvement in government projects amid the growing boycott Chinese goods call following a violent clash between India and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops in eastern Ladakh on June 15.The incident had occurred in Galwan Valley along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.“Our government had discussed this issue a few days ago. We have decided not to use Chinese equipment and devices in any manner in our projects,” said Rawat.The CM’s announcement came days after state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj had said that his department would reconsider all projects that have had Chinese involvement or raw materials are sourced from China.Earlier, the hill state’s pharmaceutical industry had cautioned against the boycott Chinese goods call while drawing the state government’s attention to an overwhelming dependence on China for sourcing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for manufacturing life-saving drugs.It had warned that a boycott call could lead to an acute shortage of several drugs.The sector has urged the state government to work out an alternative strategy before implementing a blanket ban on Chinese raw materials.Earlier during the press conference, CM Rawat addressed the media persons on the steps taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government to make the country Atmanirbhar or self-reliant.“To revive the economy affected by the pandemic, PM Modi in a significant move has announced a stimulus package of Rs 20 lakh crore for various sectors. It will be very helpful in not only boosting the economy but also generating employment in the country,” said Rawat.Citing the “major” steps taken in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, he said, “The Centre has focussed on the MSME sector. It is one sector, where employment could be provided to a significant number of people for a small investment. One major step in it was the announcement of the Centre on granting of loans without any guarantee for four years. It is a big gift for those, who are associated with the sector.”The CM also lauded the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana.“About 80 crore people have benefitted from the scheme under which each intended beneficiary is being provided with a monthly free ration of five kilograms (kg) of rice and one kg dal. Senior citizens were given three months pension in advance in a bid to ensure that they don’t face any difficulties during the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions.”The CM also heaped praise on the Centre’s Agriculture Infrastructure Fund worth Rs 1 lakh crore in a bid to boost the country’s farm sector, including an uptick of minimum support price (MSP) for crops by at least one and a half times. He also justified the government’s move of desisting from direct cash transfer but a raft of schemes and programmes in a bid to generate self-employment.“Our government doesn’t believe in giving an egg to a needy for a day, but a hen for him to have eggs throughout the year. Cash will run out after a while, but schemes will help him earn a livelihood for long,” he said.However, the opposition Congress took a potshot at the CM and punctured holes in his airy-fairy claims. “Measures that have been taken to boost the economy and help the public during the lockdown restrictions and the raging Covid-19 pandemic are plain lies. The ground reality is vastly different, as no green shoots of government’s measures are visible,” said Suryakant Dhasmana, the party’s state vice-president.“Atmanirbhar is a farce. It has left the public to fend for themselves and their own devices,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-says-state-won-t-use-chinese-equipment-and-devices-in-govt-projects/story-0M9Df65EC3TEDiBbZiCMQN.html
09-07-2020||India||J-K police say LeT terrorists stalked BJP leader before killing him||A day after former BJP district president Bandipore, Wasim Bari, his father and brother were killed, the Jammu and Kashmir Police said on Thursday they have identified the Lashkar-e- Toiba terrorists who had planned the attack.Waseem Bari was killed Wednesday evening inside his shop along with his father Bashir Ahmad and brother Umar Bashir who were also affiliated with the BJP. Police said that two men were involved in the attack on the trio in their shop which is on the ground floor of their house close to the Bandipore police station.Inspector General of Police, Kashmir Range, Vijay Kumar who visited the spot along with senior police and army officers and later examined the CCTV footage of the incident said the attack was pre-planned and the BJP leader was killed inside the shop as the militant had fired on him from a very close range. “The Laskhar group is behind this killing and the attack was carried by a local militant, Abid and a foreigner. One militant targeted him while the other was giving directions.’’Kumar said Bari had returned to his house after visiting his in-laws house. He later went downstairs to the shop where his father and brother were already present. The personal security officers (PSOs) of the three men then went to their room. “One terrorist walked into the shop and shot the three men from close range. All three were shot in their heads.” IG Kumar said that after watching the CCTV footage along with senior army and the CRPF officials they have come to the conclusion that Bari was being followed. “When he had left his house early in the evening for his in-laws house, a person could be seen in the CCTV footage and when he returned, the same person was there. It was a planned attack. We have identified the militants and they will be neutralized very soon.’’Kumar said that the entire incident was recorded in the CCTV cameras installed in the police station which is close to the place where the BJP leader was killed. ‘’Bari had 10 PSO’s (eight from district police and two from security wing) which is more than enough. Even if two of his PSO’s had remained with him they would have killed the militants. All the PSO were suspended yesterday and arrested. They will be dismissed from their services for this security lapse.BJP state president, Ravendra Raina and general secretary Ashok Koul visited the house of Bari and paid condolences with the family members of the BJP leader. Bari, his father and brother were laid to rest close to their house in the afternoon amid tight security in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-police-say-let-terrorists-stalked-bjp-leader-before-killing-him/story-Vdd0T5MkXUhiXVIBTkRJFM.html
09-07-2020||India||Chinese tourist entered Himachal Pradesh without key papers, detained||Himachal Pradesh administration on Wednesday apprehended a Chinese national at Kaloha in Kangra district of the state, while he was trying to enter the state without the necessary documents required as per state government’s guidelines for movement of tourists during the current phase of restrictions imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus pandemic, according to agency news reports.“Last evening a Chinese national was stopped at our border in Kaloha. His purpose was tourism, so he was asked for the standard requirements by the Himachal Pradesh government -- a within 72 hrs Covid 19 negative test and a 5-days advance booking at a hotel. Those things were not with him,” news agency ANI quoted the Kangra SP as saying.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesEarlier this month, the Himachal Pradesh government opened up the gates of the state for tourists after three months of ban while making their entry incumbent on a set of standard operating procedures that have laid out the conditions for tourists’ movement in the state.The conditions set by the state tourism department include a Coved 19 free certificate issued not more than 72 hours ago by an ICMR accredited laboratory and an advance hotel booking for at least five days. Only a handful of tourists have entered the state ever since the restrictions were lifted.The credentials of tourists are being checked at the border checkpoints connecting neighbouring states. Kangra SP Vimukt Ranjan said the Chinese national had been detained and put into an institutional quarantine facility. He added that the Chinese tourist had also not registered himself with the tourism site of the state.“He had not registered himself with the tourism site of the Himachal Pradesh government. So we detained him there and put him in institutional quarantine. Today we’re getting him tested. Further action will be taken as per the report of the Covid-19 test,” said Ranjan.Also Read: Border situation ‘improving’, next round of meeting soon, says ChinaThe detention of the Chinese national comes close on the heels of a three month long border stand-off between the two countries in eastern Ladakh sector that resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers in violent clashes with the Chinese PLA.

09-07-2020||India||Congress tweets video, says it shows Vikas Dubey’s arrest is scripted||Vikas Dubey, the Kanpur gangster on the run after he killed eight Uttar Pradesh policemen trying to arrest him on July 3, turned up at Ujjain’s Mahakal temple in Madhya Pradesh early on Thursday morning. Dubey, 48, is reported to have been spotted by the temple’s private security guard who called the police. He was arrested by Ujjain police and the Uttar Pradesh police informed.The Madhya Pradesh government rushed to take credit for the arrest. “Those who think their sins will wash away by going to Mahakal, they have not understood the Lord. Our government won’t spare any criminal,” Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan tweeted, praising Ujjain Police for the breakthrough.The pushback from opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi came soon after. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted the first shot, asking the government to clarify if his arrest was a surrender or an arrest. He also asked the Yogi Adityanath government to make his phone records public so that people who had collaborated with the gangster could be exposed.Also Watch l Vikas Dubey arrested: Watch what Priyanka Gandhi & Akhilesh Yadav said Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra had told reporters that Vikas Dubey was arrested by the police after the Ujjain police received a tip-off. He also told television channels that his government had told the police across Madhya Pradesh to stay on “alert mode” right after the July 3 ambush in Kanpur, over 650 km away.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said Vikas Dubey’s arrest reflected that the UP police had “completely failed” to act with alacrity. “Despite an alert, the gangster reaching Ujjain exposes the chinks in security and points to collusion,” she said in a tweet in Hindi. Gandhi also referred to reports that local police officers in Kanpur haad kept Vikas Dubey’s name out of the list of most wanted criminals to allege collusion.The harshest attack on the MP government, however, came from Srinivas BV, the Indian Youth Congress, who spotlighted a video circulating on social media that showed Vikas Dubey walking out of the temple barefooted, the private security guard walking along with him. “From what angle does it appear that this terrorist Vikas Dubey has been arrested by the police. This was scripted. This video is the proof,” he said.इस वीडियो में कौनसे ऐंगल से आतंकवादी विकास दुबे को उज्जैन पुलिस ने 'गिरफ्तार' किया है ?सब कुछ स्क्रिप्टेड था, ये वीडियो गवाही है । pic.twitter.com/cSF6FfN5BWThere has been no word on who shot this video. Or the one in which Vikas Dubey is heard telling policemen that “I am Vikas Dubey, from Kanpur” before a policeman slaps him on the head.Srinivas, responding to home minister Narottam Mishra’s statement about the MP police being on alert, called it a “good joke”.The police were so alert that Vikas had to shout to identify himself. “That is when the police got to know that Uttar Pradesh’s Vikas had appeared in Madhya Pradesh,” Srinivas tweeted.Congress leaders also asked how Vikas Dubey travelled from Kanpur to Faridabad near Delhi and then to Ujjain when the borders were sealed and the police were on alert. Did Vikas turn into ‘Mr India’ to reach Ujjain,” he said, a reference to Anil Kumar-starrer movie from the 1980s where the superhero could turn invisible at will.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrest-or-surrender-congress-takes-a-swipe-at-bjp-with-a-video-of-vikas-dubey/story-kHxQWF4FFwmS0Uvowb7VZL.html

09-07-2020||India||PM Modi reconciles India’s call for investments with message of self-reliance at India Global Week||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday underlined the central role he sees India playing in helping the world fight back against the twin challenges, on the health and economic front, posed by the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic and stressed that his government’s policy of self-reliance launched through Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan was key to neutralising the setbacks while remaining integrated with the rest of the world.Modi made the point while delivering the inaugural address at the India Global Week 2020, a virtual conference being organised in the UK, with the theme of Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign running through it.“Aatmanirbhar Bharat (is) not about being self-contained or closed to the world; it is about being self-sustaining, self-generating,” PM said while reconciling the call for global investments in India with the message that India was walking the path of self-reliance.Having made it clear that self-reliance didn’t mean closing the country’s doors to the rest of the world, the PM pitched India as the land of opportunity for global businesses.“India remains one of the most open economies in the world. We are laying a red carpet for all global companies to come and establish their presence in India. Very few countries will offer the kind of opportunities India does today,” PM was quoted as having said at the virtual meet by news agency ANI.The India Global Week 2020 is themed, ‘Be The Revival: India and a Better New World’ and the event boasts of 5,000 global participants from 30 countries including 250 global speakers participating in 75 sessions.While India’s the currently placed number three globally among countries that have registered the most number of coronavirus cases, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said far from letting the disease overwhelm it, India was focused equally on defeating the pandemic and releasing the economy from its throes.Watch: ‘India will play leading role in global revival’: PM Modi at India Global Week“Indians are natural reformers. History shows that India has overcome every challenge be it social or economic. On one hand India is fighting a strong battle against the global pandemic with an increased focus on people’s health (on the other), we are equally focussed on the health of the economy,” he was quoted as saying by ANI at the meet.The PM’s pitch came at the global meet organised by the business fraternity which has brought together global thought leaders and captains of industry to discuss opportunities in India as well as the global economic revival in the post-Covid era, the prime minister’s office had said yesterday.Prime Minister Narendra Modi built further on the theme by highlighting that India’s pharma industry was proving to be an asset not just for India but for the entire world during these challenging times by producing life saving drugs at a reduced cost, especially for developing countries.“When India talks of revival it’s revival with care, with compassion, which is sustainable both for the environment and economy.

09-07-2020||India||SC pulls up Maharashtra govt for claiming everything fine on migrant workers’ issue||The Supreme Court Thursday pulled up the Maharashtra government on the migrant workers issue and refused to accept its claim that there was no problem in the state on this front, saying it is its duty to find out the lapses and act on them.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, S K Kaul and M R Shah asked the state to file a fresh affidavit listing the steps taken to mitigate the problems of migrant workers wanting to return to their native places amid the Covid-19 crisis.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt is not an adversarial litigation, the bench said, posting the matter for further hearing on July 17.During the hearing of the case taken up suo motu (on its own) by the top court on the miseries of migrant workers during the Covid-19 lockdown, the bench said: “What is happening in Maharashtra? Large number of migrant workers are still in the state.” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, said that the latest affidavit has been filed on July 6 in compliance with the apex court’s order.He said that a list was provided to the Centre with regard to migrant workers, who have been sent to their native places by the state.Mehta said the crux of the affidavit was that the migrants who wanted to leave earlier have now decided to stay back as the state opened up employment opportunities and since May 1, around 3,50,000 workers came back to work in Maharashtra again.The bench said it is the responsibility of the state to find out which group of migrants are getting food, transport and other facilities or not getting them.Mehta said that whoever wanted to shift has been shifted and those who went back may not be getting jobs as per their skills, like a carpenter cannot work as a labourer in an agricultural field.“Your affidavit is not up to the mark... We cannot accept the State’s claim that there is no problem in the State of Maharashtra. They have treated this as an adversarial litigation. You (Mehta) must advise them to file a proper affidavit by next date of hearing,” the bench said.Mehta said he would do so and personally do the vetting of the State’s affidavit and ensure that more relevant details are provided on the issue.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for Bihar government said that reverse migration has started happening in the state and most of the trains originating from Patna to other cities are running full. Mehta said that this is a healthy thing as the reverse migration is happening because industries and business are now opening up.Meanwhile, the top court tagged the PIL filed by NGO CPIL, seeking various reliefs including a national plan on Covid-19 management with the suo motu case.During the hearing of the PIL, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said that there is a theoretical national plan on Covid-19 management and want that Solicitor General Tushar Mehta place it on record. Mehta said that the national plan for Covid-19 management as averred for in the PIL filed by Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) has already been placed on record in other matter.The bench accepted the contention of Mehta and told Sibal that this issue has come up earlier also and now they have placed the plan on record.Sibal said that they need a system in place which are in consonance with the Statutes, in this case it is a national plan.The bench asked Mehta to supply the copy of the Covid management plan to Sibal and senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing in the matter.Singhvi added that he wanted to give some suggestions that help and rehabilitation should work in tandem and registration should not be the basis for availing government schemes as it excludes lots of people.He said that government can consider a constructive scheme for insurance for migrants and a work plan and centralised system to rehabilitate the migrants.Mehta told Singhvi that he should go through the reply affidavit as it contains all the relevant details.The bench posted the matter for further hearing on July 17.On June 19, the top court had asked the Centre and all the State to ensure that all stranded migrant workers willing to return must be sent to their native places without any fare being charged from them.The top court, on June 9 had directed the Centre and state governments to identify and send back within 15 days by train or bus the stranded migrant workers willing to return to their native place, and also asked them to help the returnees find jobs lost during the national lockdown.Noting there have been instances of “excess” by police and paramilitary personnel against the migrant workers, the court also asked authorities to consider “withdrawal” of criminal cases against some of them for violating social distancing norms. The suffering people without jobs have to be dealt with in a “humane manner”, it had said.A help desk should be set up for those who wanted to return to their old places of work, it had said while taking suo motu (on its own) cognisance of the “problems and miseries” of lakhs of migrant workers.The top court, which had on May 28 passed a slew of directions including asking the states not to charge any fare from the returning workers, had noted that fresh requests for 171 ‘Shramik Special’ trains have been made so far by the states from the Centre, and directed that any additional demand be fulfilled by the Railways within “a period of 24 hours”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-pulls-up-maharashtra-govt-for-claiming-everything-fine-on-migrant-workers-issue/story-u13fckb86iCicBfuHt64aL.html

I would like to congratulate them on completing this important task with great skill.”He added: “Continued construction of roads and bridges in the border areas of the country with total commitment by the BRO would help in realisation of the efforts of the government to reach the remotest areas. Roads are the lifeline of any nation,” he added.“Roads in the border areas are not only strategic strengths, but also, act to connect remote areas with the mainstream. In this way, be it the strategic necessity of the Armed Forces or other development work related to health, education, and trade, all these are possible only with connectivity,” he said.He hoped that the construction of modern roads and bridges would bring prosperity to the region.“Our government is committed to promoting infrastructure on our borders and the necessary resources will be provided for this.

Interacting with representatives of various Varanasi-based non-government organisations via video link, he said Kashi has vigorously countered the unprecedented coronavirus crisis. Varanasi, which is also known as Kashi, is the prime minister’s parliamentary constituency. He recalled that a 100 years ago, a pandemic had struck.

This time too, during the outbreak of coronavirus, experts had raised concerns about India, he said adding that issues such as rise in virus cases due to movement of migrants and food for the needy were flagged. There were doubts and apprehensions about Uttar Pradesh too, with a population of 23-24 crore. With the hard work of the people and their cooperation, the apprehensions were overcome, he said.

09-07-2020||India||‘Act of sheer cowardice’: J&K BJP president on killing of party leader||A day after Lashkar terrorists shot dead BJP leader Sheikh Waseem Bari, his father and brother in Bandipore district of Jammu and Kashmir, the Bharatiya Janata Party called it an act of cowardice and avowed to avenge their killings.Besides Sheikh Waseem Bari, 27, his father Sheikh Bashir Ahmad and brother Sheikh Umar were also office-bearers of the BJP. The attack happened right outside the Bandipore police station when the three were at the family shop.“It was an act of sheer cowardice carried out of sheer frustration at the behest of Pakistan. Since the Army and security forces have eliminated a large number of terrorists in Kashmir, Pakistan is desperate and frustrated. Sheikh Waseem Bari was a tiger. He, along with his brother and father, was killed in the dark of night”, an outraged J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina told HT from Bandipore.He further said, Bari was a true patriot and kept Tricolor aloft. “His perpetrators will have to pay a heavy price. I have spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda. He was our lion, who challenged Pakistan and its proxies openly. We will avenge their killings”.“The wolves attacked them in the dead of night but they won’t be spared. We salute Sheikh Waseem Bari, his brother and their father for their supreme sacrifice. Pakistan, terrorists and separatists will have to pay a heavy price for this act of cowardice,” he asserted.Former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta said, “killings of our leader, his brother and their father are very painful and heart-wrenching for us. However, terrorists shouldn’t forget the fact that the history of the BJP is replete with sacrifices right from Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.”Gupta said that it was Sheikh Waseem Bari who was leading nationalist movement in Kashmir.“Their killings are a major set back to us, to the nation and the nationalist forces in Kashmir. Terrorists should not misconstrue that their killings will dishearten us and the nationalist movement will come to an abrupt end,” he said.The former deputy CM also avowed to avenge their killings. “We convey our heartfelt condolences and stand by their family. I also urge our party leaders and cadres in Kashmir valley to remain alert to the sinister designs of terrorists and their sympathizers because they are always on a lookout,” he said.J&K BJP vice president Narinder Singh said that the targeted killings may have demoralized party rank and file in Valley. He, however, added that the BJP was the only party carrying out political and social activities in Kashmir.“Certainly, security must be reviewed and accordingly enhanced and provided to party leaders and workers depending upon threat perception to them,” he added.“Sheikh Waseem Bari was also provided eight PSOs. How the attackers succeeded in their designs remains a subject of investigation but security certainly needs a re-look,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/act-of-sheer-cowardice-j-k-bjp-president-on-killing-of-party-leader/story-jeSaM5WE9HvOGPfdJr7xQK.html

The Centre has eased lockdown restrictions with a focus to lift sentiments and pull the economy out of the deep slumber that the lockdown had induced it into.“On one hand India is fighting a strong battle against the global pandemic.With an increased focus on people’s health, we are equally focussed on the health of the economy,” said PM Modi at the inaugural Global India Week, a virtual conference being organised in the UK.Themed ‘Be The Revival: India and a Better New World’, the event features 5,000 global participants from 30 nations and will be addressed by 250 global speakers in 75 sessions.Explaining that economic revival for India means a win-win situation both for people and the economy, the PM said the results of that effort are already visible in the country. “When India talks of revival it’s revival with care, with compassion, which is sustainable both for environment and economy. Indians have the spirit to achieve what is believed to be impossible. No wonder that in India, we are already seeing green-shoots of economic recovery,” said the PM.Over the last six years, the PM pointed out India has made gains in areas such as “total financial inclusion, record housing and infra construction, ease of doing business, bold tax reforms including GST, roll out of the world’s largest healthcare initiative - the Ayushman Bharat”.The reforms in agriculture, the PM highlighted, provide a very viable investment in storage and logistics and urged companies to come and invest directly in the hard work of farmers. Laying out the proverbial red carpet for the companies, the PM stressed that India is one of the most open economies of the world and invited them to come and invest in the country. “Very few countries will offer the kind of opportunities India does today,” said the PM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/story-of-global-revival-will-have-india-playing-leading-role-pm-modi-at-india-global-week/story-lDgqD01827uniT5QypxvXO.html
09-07-2020||India||Congress Working Committee may have to give extension to Sonia Gandhi||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) is expected to meet soon to take a call on extending the tenure of Sonia Gandhi, who completes a year as the party’s interim chief on August 10.A Congress functionary said the extension would be a technical requirement as per the party constitution because a regular president is yet to be elected. The party also has to inform the Election Commission of India (ECI) of its decision as a prerequisite condition.He said the process of electing a new president could not be initiated because of the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and the nationwide lockdown restrictions enforced since March 25 to contain the pandemic.“Soon after her appointment, there were assembly polls in Maharashtra and Haryana in October-November last year, followed by elections in Jharkhand and Delhi. Then, the Covid-19 struck,” he added. The CWC had named Sonia Gandhi as the party’s interim chief on August 10, 2019, after Rahul Gandhi refused to take back his resignation.He had quit the Congress president’s post following the party’s humiliating defeat in last year’s parliamentary elections.The Congress had managed to win 52 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) tally of 303.At the fractious CWC meeting on May 25, 2019, Rahul Gandhi had slammed the veterans for “placing the interests” of their sons above the party and cited that some leaders had even lost the election from their strongholds. He had also criticised a section of the GenNext leaders for hankering after posts.Rahul Gandhi brought finality to his decision to step down as the party president on July 3, when he tweeted a four-page farewell note listing the reasons for his resignation.In the letter, Rahul Gandhi took a dig at his party colleagues for the electoral drubbing the Congress had received and spoke about the lack of support to him, saying he had stood completely alone in the fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).“I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS, and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, I stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it,” he had written.In the August CWC meeting last year, Sonia Gandhi had accepted to lead the party once again after repeated pleas by her colleagues and only on the condition that she would stay on as the interim chief till the election to choose a full-time president was held.The Congress’s highest decision-making body had taken the call out of deference to the sentiments of Rahul Gandhi, who was anointed the party president on December 16, 2017.Sonia Gandhi (73) had then said that her move would again give a handle to the opponents to attack the Congress on the grounds that the Gandhi family was unwilling to give up its hold over the party.She had also insisted that this point be included in a resolution that read: “Consequently, the CWC unanimously resolved to request Smt. Sonia Gandhi to take over Interim President pending the election of a regular President by the AICC.”The Congress constitution empowers the CWC to appoint a provisional president pending the election of a regular chief by the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the party’s central unit comprising around 2,000 members from across the country.There has been a renewed pitch for Rahul Gandhi to take over as the party chief once again, but at least four Congress leaders said on the condition of anonymity that he is still adamant about his decision and is unlikely to assume the reins of the organisation in the near future.The CWC would again make a last-ditch attempt to persuade Rahul Gandhi (50) and in case he refuses to relent, it would consider extending Sonia Gandhi’s term as the interim party president, said the party functionary quoted above.In her previous stint, Sonia Gandhi remained at the helm for nearly two decades from March 14, 1998, to December 16, 2017, when Rahul Gandhi took over from her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-working-committee-may-have-to-give-extension-to-sonia-gandhi/story-g8q7xnvLCKHKci0GSvT9KO.html

09-07-2020||India||‘Uninformed commentary’: Govt on row over cut in CBSE course||Union minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Thursday, in a series of Twitter posts, hit back at critics who alleged a conspiracy in reducing the syllabus of the Central Board of Secondary Education amid the coronavirus pandemic. The minister said those criticising were resorting to “sensationalism” and were “uninformed”. The cut has been made across subjects but what has run into controversy is the axing of concepts like federalism, social movements in India, colonialism, Partition, among other topics, in social sciences.“There has been a lot of uninformed commentary on the exclusion of some topics from CBSE syllabus. The problem with these comments is that they resort to sensationalism by connecting topics selectively to portray a false narrative,” tweeted the minister this morning. The Central minister urged the doubting Thomases to “leave politics out of education” and called upon them to make efforts to lift the political discourse by being “more educated”. While announcing the 30% cut in the CBSE syllabi for classes 9 to 12, the minister did say that core concepts will be retained.  It is our humble request: #Education is our sacred duty towards our children. Let us leave politics out of education and make our politics more educated. 🙏“It is our humble request, education is our sacred duty towards our children. Let us leave politics out of education and make our politics more educated,” said Nishank.Defending the charge against the government of being selective in dropping topics, the minister listed out in examples from other disciplines where topics have been excluded.“In Biology, portions of Mineral Nutrition, Digestion & Absorption have been excluded. It can be no one’s argument that these topics have also being excluded by malice or some grand design which only partisan minds can decipher.“Similarly, some of the excluded topics in Maths are Properties of Determinants, Consistency, Inconsistency, and Number of Solutions of System of Linear Equations by Examples and Binomial Probability Distribution,” the minister added.Nishank underlined that the exclusions were a “one-time measure” due to coronavirus. “While it’s easy to misconstrue exclusion of 3-4 topics like nationalism, local govt, federalism and build a concocted narrative, a wider perusal of different subjects will show that this is happening across subjects,” he added.The exercise has been carried out, the minister said, following the advice and recommendations of various experts and considering the suggestions received from educationists through the ministry’s “SyllabusForStudents2020 campaign”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uninformed-commentary-government-on-row-over-cut-in-cbse-course/story-Jvh8HAAhOmEZBDdOnXOADI.html

He had told reporters that the ED investigators had posed 128 questions to him over three sessions.“This is political vendetta and harassment against me and my family and I do not know under whose pressure they (investigators) are working,” Patel had said.  The Congress party treasurer has faced ED questioning for about 27 hours till now during sessions held on June 27, June 30 and July 2.Patel was allowed to be quizzed at home after he refused to visit the Enforcement Directorate (ED) office, citing the prevailing COVID-19 guidelines that discourage senior citizens from going out.The officials said the Congress leader’s statement is being recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).He is being questioned about his purported links with the Sandesara brothers, promoters of the Vadodara-based Sterling Biotech pharmaceutical company, and alleged dealings of his family members with them.The agency had questioned Patel’s son Faisal and son-in-law Irfan Ahmed Siddiqui in connection with the case and recorded their statements last year.The two were questioned in the context of the statement of one Sunil Yadav, an employee of the Sandesara group, which was recorded before the agency.In his statement to the ED, Yadav had said he bore the “expenses of Rs 10 lakh” for a party which was attended by Faisal, “arranged” entry into a night club for him and once delivered “Rs 5 lakh” to his driver in Delhi’s Khan Market on the instructions of Chetan Sandesara, one of the promoters of Sterling Biotech, sources had said.He had told the agency that the cash was “meant for Faisal Patel”, the sources had said.The ED was also told by Yadav that Siddiqui “occupied” a house in Delhi’s Vasant Vihar, which reportedly belonged to Chetan Sandesara.The money-laundering case pertains to the alleged Rs 14,500-crore bank-loan fraud, said to have been perpetrated by Sterling Biotech and its main promoters and directors -- Nitin Jayantilal Sandesara, Chetankumar Jayantilal Sandesara and Deepti Sandesara -- all of whom are absconding.Nitin and Chetankumar are brothers.The ED has alleged that this is a bigger bank scam in volume than the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud involving fugitive diamantaires Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.The amount involved in the PNB case is pegged at about Rs 13,400 crore.The Sandesaras are also facing separate probes by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Income-Tax department for their alleged nexus with high-profile politicians and charges of corruption and tax evasion respectively.At present, the Sandesaras are stated to be based in Albania in Europe. Efforts are on to extradite them.The ED registered a criminal case in connection with the alleged bank-loan fraud on the basis of an FIR and a chargesheet filed by the CBI.It is alleged that the company took loans of over Rs 5,383 crore from a domestic consortium led by the Andhra Bank, which later turned into non-performing assets, and the ED has alleged that the promoters laundered the money using shell or dubious firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-questions-congress-leader-ahmed-patel-for-4th-time-in-pmla-case/story-xFU5rv3TddE85BLRmdx38H.html

Soon, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against him and he was produced before a local magistrate for remand. The stipulated 90 days, prescribed by Section 167(2) of CrPC to file a charge sheet, lapsed on April 30 amid the nationwide lockdown restrictions.On May 2, he applied for bail in the special POCSO court, which was denied two days later, citing that the timeframe for filing a charge sheet has been extended because of the pandemic.The prosecutor opposed the bail plea on the ground that the police submitted the charge sheet thrice between March and April, but the special POCSO court didn’t accept it.The special POCSO court accepted the charge sheet on May 4 and rejected the accused’s bail plea on the ground that the timeframe for filing a charge sheet has been extended due to the prevailing lockdown restrictions.Justice Joshi, however, said it is imperative to ascertain whether the charge sheet was filed in the first instance in March and the reasons for the inordinate delay and beyond the stipulated timeframe.The HC granted bail to the accused because he had exercised his indefeasible right on expiry of 90 days to file a charge sheet and as a result, is entitled to the legal relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-no-reason-for-not-filing-chargesheet-hc-grants-bail-to-man-accused-of-raping-minor/story-aBgIr5lHTXXC51lAGkbOSP.html

09-07-2020||India||Four months on, Maharashtra Covid count, related fatalities continue to remain highest in the country||Mumbai: Maharashtra’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) count and related fatalities remain the highest in the country exactly four months after the first viral infection case was detected in the state, according to a report compiled by the state’s medical education department on Wednesday.The Covid-19 related toll stands at 9,448, including 1,442 deaths over the last eight days alone.Earlier on March 9, Maharashtra had reported its first of Covid-19 positive case after a couple in Pune, who had returned from Dubai, was found to have contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease. The following day, three more persons, who had come in contact with the infected couple, tested Covid-19 positive.The report stated Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu are ranked after Maharashtra on the fatality count with 3,165, 1,977, and 1,636 deaths, respectively.The north-eastern states such as Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Sikkim have not reported a single Covid-19 death as yet.Gujarat tops the case fatality rate (CFR) at 5.26%, followed by Maharashtra at 4.22%.On Wednesday, state health minister Rajesh Tope said efforts are on to bring down the CFR by increasing the daily test count.“An increase in daily test count will help bring down the CFR and the positive rate can also be reduced to below 10%,” the minister said.At present, Maharashtra’s positive rate against total tests is at 18.77%, which is a worrying trend.Maharashtra reported 223,724 Covid-19 positive cases until Wednesday, including 91,065 active ones, according to the report.On Wednesday, hotels, and lodges that were shut for the past four months were opened as part of the state’s Mission Begin Again campaign to give a fillip to commercial activities and revive the economy.Mumbai reported 1,347 Covid-19 positive cases on Wednesday after the previous day’s count of 785 had broken a 57-day pattern with the lowest single-day spike.Health experts maintained a one-day low count is an aberration, as it needs to be sustained for a while to be considered a trend.“Though a single-day low Covid-19 positive cases in Mumbai are an encouraging sign, nothing can be ascertained from it. A trend can only be determined after analysing the data over a period of time,” Dr. Anant Bhan, researcher, global health, bioethics, and healthcare policy, had told HT in an earlier interaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-months-on-maharashtra-covid-count-related-fatalities-continue-to-remain-highest-in-the-country/story-gIOuZg4VTHrKNRAadI5aoL.html

09-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand forest officials declare killer leopard ‘maneater’, wildlife experts unhappy||The leopard which killed a one-and-half-year old child in Udal village of Almora in Uttarakhand has been permitted to be tranquilised and caged, a forest official said.“We have been permitted, through an order issued on Tuesday by chief wildlife warden, to cage or tranquilize the leopard first which is posing threat to human life. In the condition of failing to catch the leopard, then we have been instructed to destroy it,” said Mahatim Singh Yadav, divisional forest officer (DFO), Almora.A one-and-half-year old child in Udal village under Bhaisiya Chhana block of Almora was killed by the leopard in front of his mother on Monday while he was playing in the courtyard of the house. Furious villagers staged a protest with the deceased body for 18 hours and demanded the leopard be shot down.Also read: Uttarakhand man booked for posting child pornography on social mediaMeanwhile, Yadav handed over a cheque worth Rs 90,000 as compensation to the family of the deceased child. Rest of the amount - Rs 2.10 lakh - will be provided later.Following the protest and pressure by villagers, the DFO informed the chief wildlife warden regarding the continuous threat to human lives by the leopard and sought permission to capture or kill it.Yadav said, “We have installed camera traps and a cage where the body of the child was found. Another cage is being installed in the village on Wednesday. Since this was the fifth incident of human killing in the last two years in that area by the leopard, we sought permission from the chief wildlife warden.”Also read: Heavy rains trigger landslides across Uttarakhand, one dead in car accidentForest officials who are experienced in such operations have been deployed in Udal village to catch the big cat. A hunter from Bijnore area of Uttar Pradesh is also reaching Almora to eliminate the leopard, said an official.The move, however, has been questioned by wildlife experts.AG Ansari, Ramnagar-based wildlife expert, said, “If five human beings have lost their lives in attacks by a leopard and it is posing a threat to humans, it is in law to destroy such a wild animal. But the bigger question is how can forest officials say it is the same leopard. They should focus on catching the leopard by caging or tranquilising it instead of killing it so that an animal’s life could be saved.”The increasing man-leopard conflict in the state often leads to protests by villagers whenever anyone, especially a child, is killed in a leopard attack. In June 2018, angry villagers in Harinagari area of Bageshwar set a forest on fire after a leopard killed a seven-year-old boy.Chief wildlife warden, through the invocation of Clause 11 (1) (a) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, can declare any wild animal as a threat to human life and fit to be destroyed. The Act states that ‘chief wildlife warden of the state may - if he is satisfied that any wild animal specified in Schedule I has become dangerous to human life or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery - by order in writing and stating the reasons, therefore, permit any person to hunt such an animal or have it hunted’.The power was limited through an amendment in the Act in 2003, with insertion in section 9 that states, “no wild animal shall be ordered to be killed unless the chief wildlife warden is convinced that such an animal cannot be captured, tranquilised or translocated”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-forest-officials-declare-killer-leopard-maneater-wildlife-experts-unhappy/story-tHUMhXutJSAGoIQdOwqOoM.html

The list of coal blocks that will be auctioned is being prominently displayed on the ministry’s website since January while categorising them as ‘high conservation zones’. The Centre should pay heed to the state government’s plea and take off these five coal blocks on environmental grounds,” said Shukla.He also called the Centre’s bluff to the media that eight rounds of consultations have been held with the state government on the auction list.“If that’s the case, then why does the state government have to write several letters to the Union government citing environmental concerns?” he asked.He alleged that minister Joshi could be trying to distract public attention because of non-compliance of norms and a raging controversy surrounding the auction of coal blocks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/auctioning-of-coal-blocks-near-hasdeo-arand-halted/story-YpTl1FQZPygRlVsu3H8RqI.html

09-07-2020||India||At top panel meet on China border, India reviews troop pullback and possible red flags||India’s top strategy group on China led by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval met on Wednesday to review the withdrawal of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers from the standoff points in eastern Ladakh and decide the government’s next steps.This was their first meeting after Chinese troops started withdrawing troops from three of the standoff points after Ajit Doval’s two-hour-long conversation with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Sunday evening, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.Doval will have a second conversation with Qang Yi in about three weeks when the two sides will discuss the border situation again before the next step of de-escalation is ordered.Apart from the country’s top civil servant Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, officials of the ministries of defence, external affairs and home, Wednesday’s meeting of the China Study Group was also attended by some special invitees including some senior ministers.Also Read: NSA Ajit Doval talks to China’s Wang Yi, troops pulled back along LAC: Read full statement hereGovernment and military officials said the Chinese troops are falling back from Patrolling Point 14 (Galwan Valley), Patrolling Point 15 (Hot Springs) and Patrolling Point 17 (Gogra) in Ladakh’s Galwan region. The Galwan Valley, or Patrolling Point 14, was the site of the violent scrap of June 15 that led to casualties on both sides. It is here that the Chinese PLA has withdrawn around 1.5km with its tents dismantled and armoured personnel carriers pulled back.The thinning out of Chinese soldiers is the slowest around the fourth standoff point near Pangong Tso, the saltwater glacial lake spread across 700 sq km. It is here that, according to the Indian assessment, the Chinese forces had an edge over Indian troops since they have built a road up to Finger 4 - the finger area refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range that overlooks the lake - and had set up bunkers, pillboxes as well as observation posts.Field reports have indicated that the Chinese PLA Air Force activity has declined considerably in the Ladakh sector but the PLA ground troops are fully deployed, and on high alert in the depth areas of both Tibet and Xinjiang region. There is also a build-up across the Arunachal Pradesh LAC.Also Read: ‘India on treasure hunt to find what happened in Galwan’: ChidambaramAt Wednesday’s meeting, government sources told Hindustan Times, the study group also made an assessment of the deployment of PLA troops close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). A point made at the meeting more than once was that the PLA needs to withdraw from all areas along the 1,597 km LAC in Ladakh as well as along the 1,126 km LAC in Arunachal Pradesh.For one, government and military officials pointed that the Chinese troops continue to remain in an aggressive posture in the Depsang Plains at 17,000 feet or the Raki nullah area. The Raki Nullah near Burtse is key to Indian patrolling in the Depsang plains and has seen incursions by the Chinese side on more than one occasion. One such incursion that was quickly detected by the border guards in April 2013 also led to a face-off between two sides. This Depsang incursion at Raki Nullah was designed to prevent the Indian patrols from reaching Points 10, 11, 11A and 13. Patrolling Point 12 lies outside the patrol line.A top military commander said the army had also scaled up its presence in the area to match the adversary in troop numbers and support elements as a precautionary measure.Also Read: Analysts in Beijing link Doklam to Galwan, say India aggressor in both casesGovernment officials said it was on account of a gradual, and graded pullback of troops by the Chinese side that New Delhi had adopted a cautious approach and in the Ladakh sector, closely tracking troop movements around Pangong lake and Depsang plains as well.Some officials believe that the softening in Beijing’s stand, which came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Ladakh visit, could have been influenced by Washington deploying its two US supercarriers for exercises in South China Sea and the need for Beijing to focus its energies on that side of its boundary dispute with ASEAN, Japan and Australia.There may not be a link between the American stepping up pressure over the South China Sea and the Ladakh standoff, an official said, “but it just turned out to be bad timing for the Chinese”.The official suggested it is possible that China may believe that there was a link between India’s stand in Ladakh and the US belligerence in the South China Sea and could calibrate its troop withdrawal from Ladakh in line with easing of tensions with the US in the South China Sea.The United States is working hard to mobilise support against China and will reach out to the European Union, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a news conference on Wednesday.Pompeo referenced the large number of boundary and maritime disputes that China had opened with its neighbours to accuse it of practising a revisionist approach to enlarge its territory. “There aren’t many neighbours that can satisfactorily say that they know wheretheir sovereignty ends and the Chinese community party will respect that sovereignty. That is certainly true now for the people of Bhutan as well,” Pompeo - who referenced his conversations with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar - said, underscoring that the world will come together to respond to China “in a way that is powerful and important”.The Trump administration, who had earlier declared that the US was moving its military resources from Europe to focus on the threats from China, has already parked its two US aircraft carriers - USS Ronald Regan and USS Nimitz - to add muscle to its allies in southeast Asia. Analysts say that the US and PLA are using missions in the South China Sea to send a message to each other in the absence of any direct communication.US aircraft carriers Ronald Reagan and Nimitz are exercising full spectrum in the South China Sea and clearly laying down red lines for China on Taiwan. Of particular interest is the Bashi Channel, the waterway between the Philippines’ Y’Ami Island and Taiwan’s Orchid Island from where undersea internet cables run down to South East Asia, and Taiwan. The channel is also an important passage for military operations by the US and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-top-panel-meet-on-china-border-india-reviews-troop-pullback-and-possible-red-flags/story-YUUf6GlXPzAB4OUKTXgjdI.html

09-07-2020||India||Is Covid-19 airborne? Indian experts react to latest finding, say there is no need to panic||A state of panic has overtaken people after the World Health Organization, earlier this week, was approached with a group of scientists with their finding, supporting the possibility of Covid-19 virus to be airborne. However, experts at India’s CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) say there is no need to panic. As per an expert, the latest finding could mean that the pathogen can be ‘at least temporarily’ in the air and does not mean it is flying all over and will infect everyone. “Those are good studies. Based on that, what is being communicated to WHO is that the virus can be at least temporarily airborne, which means it can travel in droplets of smaller size less than five micron which will mean that it will be hanging in the air for longer than bigger droplet which settles down in a few minutes,” director of the CSIR-CCMB, Rakesh Mishra, told news agency PTI. Also read: Remdesivir shortage hits Delhi as requirement soarsMishra calls for people to continue to take the same precautions and avoid close contact with people and large gatherings. The scientist said social distancing should be maintained at all cost and people must avoid rooms where multiple people are present, particularly those lacking aeration such as AC rooms.He added that very little is known about the virus and it would be too early to say that enough had been known about it. Over 230 scientists from 32 nations have written to the WHO, saying there is evidence that coronavirus is airborne and even smaller particles can infect people, a report in the New York Times stated. The global health body has long maintained that Covid-19 primarily spreads through coughs and sneezes and is not airborne. The virus has infected over 11 million across the globe while more than 5 lakh people have lost their lives to the deadly contagion worldwide.

09-07-2020||India||Uttarakhand fixes distance for setting up of stone crusher, hot-mix plants near Ganga, other rivers||The Uttarakhand government on Wednesday fixed the distance of setting up of stone crusher and hot-mix plants 1.5 kilometre away from the bank of river Ganga under its Stone-Crusher, Mobile Stone-Crusher and Hot-Mix Plant Policy, 2020. The decision was taken during the state cabinet meeting held in Dehradun which was chaired by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. Informing the mediapersons on the important decision, Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and government spokesperson said, “Under the policy, stone crusher and hot-mix plants could be set up at a distance of 1.5 km away from the bank of Ganga, 1 km away from the banks of rivers in plain areas and 500 metres away from the banks of a rain-water fed river in the state.”“Apart from this, there were also some decisions taken regarding stone-crushers plants and storage of minerals under which the rights to grant permissions for the same will now be with the district magistrates and not administration. The applicant will now have to seek permission from the respective DMs and not the state government,” said Kaushik. He also informed that the license for retail storage of minerals would be given for five years instead of existing two years. “Similarly the license period for the Stone-crusher and hot-mix plants would be given for two years and not the existing one year. After two years he would have to renew the license,” said Kaushik adding “all the transactions in this will have to be made through cheque or demand drafts and not cash.”The minister also informed that the government has “put a complete prohibition on bringing in and taking out riverbed materials from the state”.Informing about other decisions made in the Cabinet meeting, Kaushik also revealed the fund collected in the Chief Minister Relief Fund (CMRF) during the pandemic period while taking a dig at Opposition Congress. “A total of Rs 154.56 crore was collected in the CMRF through donations from various sections of society from March 15 to June 26. Out of this, the government has spent a total of Rs 85.60 crore,” said Kaushik. He said, “Majority of the fund was spent in fighting the pandemic, developing quarantine facilities, providing food and ration to needy ones, arranging transport facilities for the migrants returning home and helping tourists stranded here.”Taking a dig at the Congress he said, “We decided to reveal the figures as the Congress has been raising questions on its credibility despite the fact that they didn’t contribute a single penny in it.”The Congress hit back. “Revealing the funds collected in CMRF is no big feat as it can be availed by a simple RTI application also,” said Suryakant Dhasmana, the vice president of Congress’ Uttarakhand unit.“As far as their claim of spending the fund in relief works is concerned, it’s all lies because nothing is visible on the ground. Instead of contributing to this dubious fund, we have helped the needy ones directly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-allows-setting-up-of-stone-crusher-hot-mix-plants-near-ganga-and-other-rivers/story-2hnrlVrg5rjIBOwkxsLmZO.html

09-07-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||In a country riven by fractures, the coronavirus disease has introduced a new one. In the absence of a cure or a vaccine, masks and social distancing (even isolation) are the only ways to stay safe. And four months and a bit into the pandemic in India, it is clear that there are people who can afford this — they work remotely; their children learn remotely; they even socialise remotely — and those who can’t. I say “they” and “their” but it should be “we” and “our” — if you are reading this column, chances are you probably belong to the minority that has seamlessly (but perhaps not entirely painlessly) been pulled a decade or two into the future. This is the how-will-life-be-in-2030 school assignment (due in December 2019) in all its masked reality.In the first phase of their response to the virus, everyone rushed to lock down. This was the right decision, and backed by science. Countries that didn’t do this — Sweden is an example — have paid the price. In Sweden’s case, for instance, its number of deaths per million of population is much higher than that in many other countries (including the US), and the latest numbers suggest that its economy will contract significantly, indicating that its approach, once touted around the world, was flawed.In the second phase, as the infection curves began to flatten, or as countries became confident that their health care systems were primed to handle the pandemic (despite the number of cases continuing to rise), everyone rushed to open up. India is one example of the second — a country that opened up despite the number of cases continuing to rise (and quite sharply at that); in the first seven days of July, the country added 157,122 cases, 21.2% of its total case tally.This, too, was necessary. The economic costs of lockdowns were beginning to hurt. It was also clear that countries could open up, provided they ensured everyone wore masks, practised social distancing and hand-hygiene — and if they continued to test aggressively. India has continued to open up without doing enough tests (although it has increased testing significantly), and this column has repeatedly called for it to test more, something that experts say is possible. Many of them who spoke to Hindustan Times said that India could conduct a million tests a day if it put its mind to it.Science and data, this column has repeatedly pointed out, should drive our response to the coronavirus disease. If this isn’t always the case, blame it on the uncomfortable relationship between the two on one side, and politicians on the other. The President of the United States appears in public without a mask, and many of his followers, who know no better, emulate his example.Science now tells us that the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the coronavirus disease can be airborne, especially in closed spaces. The World Health Organization finally accepted earlier this week that the virus may be transmitted over air; the New York Times quoted Dr Benedetto Allegranzi, the head of WHO’s committee on infection prevention and control, as saying that this was a possibility in “crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings”.This is very different from what we knew previously — that the virus was largely transmitted by coughing or sneezing, exhalations and expectorations. It means the virus can stay for hours in the air in closed environments.This knowledge (which perhaps explains why the virus is highly infective) should form the basis of the third phase of our response to the coronavirus disease — yes it’s that significant. It calls for a review of what can be allowed to open, and what can’t (schools, for instance). It means offices that have just reopened, or are considering reopening, should have the right kind of air filtration and circulation systems, and also ensure that workers are socially distanced and masked. Yes, masked. Wearing them in the workplace may be the safest and surest way of getting back to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-zxh5pIeYiHaMM7QTMCVRHM.html
09-07-2020||India||Onus of finding donor now on nodal officers||The Delhi government on Wednesday shifted the onus of finding a replacement donor for convalescent plasma from the Delhi Plasma Bank to nodal officers of each hospital. The government, in an order issued by principal health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt on Wednesday, directed all hospitals in Delhi – government and private — to appoint a nodal person to coordinate with the plasma bank at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS).According to the protocols of the plasma bank set up last Thursday, those in need of plasma have to provide at least three documents signed by the ‘nodal officer’ from the hospital where the patient is admitted.“For the sake of coordination, requisition and issuance of convalescent plasma from ILBS for treating eligible sick Covid patients, all the MS (medical superintendent)/ in-charge of hospitals in government sector and private/ corporate sector are required to nominate a nodal officer from their respective hospitals,” the Wednesday order reads.In addition, it says, “the nodal officer/hospital requisitioning COPLA (convalescent plasma) will be required to provide voluntary plasma donor, including replacement donors keeping in view the projected requirement of COPLA and scarce availability of the meagre resource.”So far, the onus was on the family of the patient in need of plasma to find a replacement donor. This comes a day after HT reported the teething troubles faced by those in need of plasma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onus-of-finding-donor-now-on-nodal-officers/story-TfGg3e8TCZSrSR7cMe3FLI.html
09-07-2020||India||Science panel head opposes RS bar on online participation||Congress lawmaker Jairam Ramesh, who heads the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science & Technology, Environment & Forests, on Wednesday expressed displeasure over Rajya Sabha secretariat’s decision disallowing online participation of some of the panel’s members for a meeting to discuss Covid-19 pandemic.He called Rajya Sabha officials’ arguments against his proposal for the virtual participation “silly and bogus” and complained about the “disinformation virus”.Ramesh wrote to Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu saying some panel members be allowed to participate virtually as he feared a lack of quorum for the meeting. At a meeting under Naidu’s chairmanship on Wednesday, Rajya Sabha officials pointed out that quorum is necessary only for taking decisions and adopting reports and not for discussion. “Officials maintained that 22% of the meetings of science and technology committee had no quorum in last 3 years or during the tenure of the current chairman, Naidu,” said a functionary of the Rajya Sabha. “Details of meetings of committees without quorum were referred to only to bring out that committees used to meet without quorum even in normal times and it has been the case with all 8 committees of Rajya Sabha. This information has been widely shared so that MPs willing to attend the meetings convened in the next few days should not be in any doubt whether such meetings will be held or not, on account of quorum requirement,” added one official. Many opposition lawmakers have been demanding online meetings of Parliamentary panels due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Naidu and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla have held meetings and asked officials to find out a solution, but permissions for digital discussions have not been forthcoming. Parliamentary panel meetings have always happened inside the House complex amid much secrecy.In a tweet, Ramesh said, “Since I took over as Chairman of the Committee on Science & Technology, Environment, Forests & Climate Change, we have held 11 meetings from September 2019 to March 2020 with quorum in all meetings.”He said the point was not about quorum alone. “It is about facilitating those MPs [members of Parliament] who want to attend & are unable to because of containment zone & quarantine restrictions in their home states. Very different from not attending due to other commitments in normal times...” He referred to the lack of quorum in earlier meetings. “On those occasions we did not have advance information always on who will attend and who will not. This time around MPs have informed before the meeting. Some have even requested for virtual meeting,” said Ramesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/science-panel-head-opposes-rs-bar-on-online-participation/story-JCwFkQCgLXCwW48FIpMi3L.html
09-07-2020||India||Govt sets up panel to probe 3 Gandhi family-run trusts||The Union government on Wednesday set up an interministerial committee headed by an Enforcement Directorate (ED) officer to investigate the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust (RGCT) and the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust (IGMT) — institutions closely associated with the Nehru-Gandhi family and the Congress — for possible money laundering, income tax violations and foreign funding irregularities. Congress president Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson of RGF while other trustees include former prime minister Manmohan Singh, former finance minister P Chidambaram, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Sonia Gandhi also heads RGCT and oversees the work of IGMT as well. The Congress alleged this was an effort to intimidate the party leadership, which would not succeed, and asked the government to probe finances of organisations closely associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).  A home ministry spokesperson confirmed the creation of the committee in a tweet, adding that a special director rank officer in ED will supervise the probe. An official familiar with the development, who did want to be named, said officials of home and finance ministries as well as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will be part of the committee. CBI is empowered to investigate any violations under FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act), while ED and the income tax department, which come under the finance ministry, are responsible for investigations into money laundering and tax violations.The interministerial committee will verify if the three trusts run by the Gandhi family and other Congress leaders manipulated any documents while filing income tax, and laundered money received from foreign countries. “If it is found that there were irregularities, the concerned agency — CBI, ED or I-T department — will go ahead with a formal probe,” said the official who did not want to be named.RGCT was set up in 2002 to address the needs of the underprivileged, especially the poor, and primarily works in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Congress president Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson of the foundation and its trustees include former PM Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, P Chidambaram, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Suman Dubey, Ashok Ganguly and Vijay Mahajan.The decision comes in the backdrop of allegations by the BJP that RGF received donations from the Chinese government, which had influenced the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s economic and trade policy towards China to India’s detriment. BJP president JP Nadda alleged that money from the PM relief fund was diverted to the family trust, and that it also received funds from fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi. The Congress claimed this was a diversionary ploy adopted by the ruling party to cover up its own association with the Chinese Communist Party, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s deep relationship with the country from the time he was the chief minister of Gujarat.The trading of charges came against the backdrop of the situation on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a violent altercation that resulted in 20 casualties on the Indian side and an unknown number of casualties on the Chinese side. The Congress has been critical of the government’s response to the June 15 clash, and also PM Modi’s comments during an all-party meeting on June 19 that were ambiguous about the border transgression by the Chinese and were clarified by the Prime Minister’s Office the following day. The party has continued to be critical of the government on this front.On Wednesday, the Congress alleged there was a “new conspiracy” by the BJP, and the trusts had nothing to fear and would answer all questions and follow the law. Without specifically referring to the creation of the committee and announcement of the investigation, former party chief and member of Parliament Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Mr Modi believes the world is like him. He thinks every one has a price or can be intimidated. He will never understand that those who fight for the truth have no price and cannot be intimidated.”Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi dared the government to deploy all its machinery in probing the financial sources of the trusts, and said that while they would answer all questions, the government needed to be “exposed” because it did not ask questions of its “many blue-eyed sanctified holy cows”. “You are harassing each opposition segment, individual and institutional, but not your holy cows. Whose special arc of protection they have?” he asked while referring to the Vivekananda Foundation, the India Foundation, Overseas Friends of BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the ruling party.BJP general secretary Muralidhar Rao said: “Activities of the RGF is in the public domain. There are many aspects to it, related to FCRA, income tax audit, etc. The Modi government believes in transparency. We are committed to it, so it is natural to have investigation. No foundations are private, and the investigations are in public interest. If it (the investigation) was political (motivated) would we have waited six years?”Political analyst Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay said the BJP wants to revive the 2013-14 narrative of the Congress and the Gandhi family being corrupt. “The move is completely on the expected lines because they have always been looking for an opportunity to target and establish that the Congress and the Gandhi family are corrupt. This is also to overcome whatever setback and discomfort the people may be facing due to the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and will give another reason to cheer and jeer to BJP supporters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-sets-up-panel-to-probe-3-gandhi-family-run-trusts/story-ITti0LTlMLbhAtDJBU0CzM.html

Temporary buffer zones between rival troops have been created there. The Finger Area will be the hardest part of disengagement,” said a second official who asked not to be named.  The Finger Area refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong lake.The disengagement process began after military-level talks on June 30, and a subsequent conversation on July 6 between national security adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. There is no clarity on the nature of discussions that took place on the Chinese presence in Pangong Tso — whether any decision was taken to disengage now, or to leave it for subsequent discussions after making progress in other areas. The army did not officially comment on the matter.Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4 overlooking Indian deployments, the army would patrol right up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers 4 and 8 are 8km apart.The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger 8, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger 4 where the PLA has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes, observation posts and tented camps over the last two months.Military experts, too, said the Finger Area will test the disengagement process.“Disengagement appears to be making reasonable progress in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra. The Finger Area will now be the focal point of the disengagement process and will be a true test of China’s commitment and sincerity to resolve the situation,” said former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd).But even as uncertainty persists on Pangong Tso, the army has begun a rigourous verification process to monitor the withdrawal of the PLA from Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra, where 4-km buffer zones between troops have come up, as reported by HT on Wednesday.While the PLA has withdrawn up to 2km from Patrolling Point 14 (Galwan Valley) and PP-15 (Hot Springs) over the last three days, a similar retreat is expected to be completed at PP-17 (Gogra) within a 24-hour time frame (by Thursday evening), said a third official. The Indian Army, too, is pulling back proportionately in these areas.The disengagement effort involves rival troops pulling back a specified distance from face-off sites, with further retreat taking place in phases as the complex plan progresses on a verifiable basis on the ground every 72 hours by both sides. It also entails the phased withdrawal of weapons and equipment to a mutually agreed distance, and finally the restoration of status quo ante (the situation as it existed in early April).The creation of buffer zones will temporarily restrict the patrolling activities of both armies in the region. While some experts saw this as a necessary step, others cautioned that the temporary curtailing of patrolling rights should not become a long-term feature undermining Indian presence and control.The army is also keeping a strict vigil along the contested border in the Depsang sector, where a 2013 Chinese intrusion blocked the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes, including the ones leading to PPs-10, 11, 11A, 12 and 13.The military buildup in Indian and Chinese depth areas hasn’t thinned, with both sides keeping their guard up. The deployment of thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence weapons continues in the region.At the June 30 meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, the Indian side reiterated its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and sought the restoration of status quo ante in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang plains, apart from emphasising the need for thinning the military buildup in the region. The first part of this process is underway at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-shifts-to-finger-4-as-pullback-progresses/story-ghOkTWHadBF2fQXsZadoqO.html

09-07-2020||India||Kin among 23 booked for forging will of last ruler of Faridkot state in ’82||Relatives of the last ruler of Punjab’s erstwhile princely state of Faridkot were among 23 people booked for fraud on Wednesday for allegedly forging his will in 1982. The case was filed a month after the Punjab and Haryana high court ruled that Harinder Singh Brar’s will was forged in Maharwal Khewaji Trust’s favour.Members of the trust, including its chairman and the ruler’s grandson, Jai Chand Mehtab, are among those booked on the complaint of Brar’s daughter, Amrit Kaur. Mehtab’s sister, Nisha D Kher, who is vice-chairperson of the trust, has also named in the case. The other accused include the trust’s CEO Jagir Singh Sran.The property dispute dates back to 1989 when Brar’s will bequeathing his properties to the Trust, with his daughter, Deepinder Kaur, as its head, surfaced after his death.The court observed the Maharwal Khewaji Trust’s trustees conspired to create the will to take over the property. “The will is proved to be forged, fictitious, fabricated, and shrouded with suspicious circumstances,” the court said.The accused have been booked under the Indian Penal Code’s sections, including those pertaining to cheating, forgery, and criminal conspiracy.Senior police superintendent Swarndeep Singh said Amrit Kaur filed a complaint on the basis of the court order and they registered the case after taking legal advice. “She has stated, in her complaint, that the accused have committed forgery by preparing a fake will of the Faridkot ruler.”The court upheld a Chandigarh court’s order awarding the majority share in the ₹20,000-crore property of Brar to his two daughters —Amrit Kaur and Deepinder Kaur. Brar died in 1989 and left behind prime properties in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, and Chandigarh. Deepinder Kaur died while the legal battle was on. Amrit Kaur lives in Chandigarh. Brar’s son, Harmohinder Singh, died in a road accident in 1981. His third daughter, Maheepinder Kaur, is also dead.The property dispute reached the high court in 2018 after a Chandigarh court declared the trust void and gave the property to the daughters. In June this year, the high court upheld the Chandigarh court’s order.Jagir Singh Saran, chief executive of the Maharawal Khewaji Trust, said they were awaiting the details of the FIR. “There was no forgery... we have all record and facts. After the high court verdict, we got 90 days to move the Supreme Court. We are consulting legal experts and will soon challenge the high court verdict in the apex court. The FIR was lodged to put pressure on the trust before the proceedings start in the SC,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kin-among-23-booked-for-forging-will-of-last-ruler-of-faridkot-state-in-82/story-iwDpWexU3lwAYTj9HRw4JK.html

A bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde was hearing a plea seeking action against ashrams (religious retreats) run by fake spiritual gurus, which have allegedly confined inmates, particularly women, in unhygienic conditions, risking the spread of the coronavirus disease. “There is a lot of money involved and criminal activities are happening. See what can be done? This kind of practice gives a bad name to everyone,” CJI Bobde told the central government’s second senior-most law officer, solicitor general Tushar Mehta. The petitioner, Dumpala Ramreddy, was asked by the apex court to provide Mehta with a copy of the petition so that he can suggest solutions to deal with the problem. Reddy approached the top court in April alleging that his daughter was confined in the Adhyatmika Vidyalaya Ashram at Rohini in Delhi founded by Veerendra Dev Dixit, who has been absconding since 2017 after being charged for raping a minor girl in 1999.Reddy submitted that central and state governments were not taking action against fake babas and were allowing such illegal ashrams to function, often from unauthorized premises. “Considering the urgent prevailing situation due to spreading of Corona virus in the country particularly in places where social distance is not maintained….the petitioner prays for the intervention of this Hon’ble Court for the rescue of the women/persons in the ashrams,” the petition stated.The petitioner also sought guidelines to be laid down to govern the establishment and functioning of such ashrams and to close down those run by people with criminal records.He also cited a list released by the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, a body of Hindu religious ascetics, declaring 17 babas including Veerendra Dev Dixit, Asaram bapu, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and Radhe Maa as fake religious gurus. Even so, ashrams run by the 17 people, Reddy contended, are continuing to function with thousands of disciples residing on their premises. “If this man (Reddy) says the Akhara has declared that there are 17 ashrams that are fake, it raises serious questions,” the bench remarked. Reddy sought the evacuation of inmates from the ashrams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The authorities are not verifying the facilities available in the ashrams and the ashrams are in very poor condition. They do not have basic amenities and conditions are very unhygienic”, the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-babas-bring-disrepute-to-real-spirituality-sc/story-AbrszxUbqfdP60Zl5qKieP.html
09-07-2020||India||BS-IV vehicles sold after Mar 31 can’t be registered, says SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday recalled its earlier order in which it allowed the sale of BS-IV vehicles for 10 days across India, except in Delhi-NCR, after lifting of a national lockdown, warning automobile dealers of not taking advantage of the apex court by “playing fraud”.A bench headed by justice Arun Mishra observed that its earlier directive from March 27 was violated and BS-IV vehicles were sold during the lockdown in the last week of March and even in the next month.When the bench was informed about the sale of such vehicles during the lockdown, it recalled the order by which it permitted automobile dealers to sell 10% of their BS-IV stock for further 10 days after the lockdown. The order was passed after dealers complained that they lost seven days from March 25 to March 31 due to the lockdown. “You cannot befool us. You cannot take advantage of this court’s order by playing fraud. How could you have opened for sale during lockdown? This is not just violation of the lockdown but violation of our order too,” said the three-judge bench of justices Mishra, S Abdul Nazeer and Indira Banerjee.The bench said BS-IV vehicles sold after March 31 this year and those whose details have not been uploaded on the e-vahan portal of the government will not be registered. In October 2018, the court said no BS-IV vehicle would be sold or registered in India from April 1, 2020. During the hearing on Wednesday, the bench observed that sale of BS-IV vehicles had increased in the last week of March, when the nationwide lockdown was in force, and there were online transactions also.The Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) submitted a tabular chart to the court giving date-wise sales of two-wheelers, three-wheelers, passenger cars and commercial vehicles made by FADA members and non-members during March 12-31.The court was surprised to note that the bulk of sales took place during the lockdown. FADA members sold 61,861 BS-IV vehicles in the period March 12-31, of which sale of 33,328 vehicles pertained to the lockdown period. Similarly, non-member dealers sold 72,532 vehicles during the period of March 12-31, out of which the sale of 40,184 vehicles occurred during the lockdown week.Senior advocate KV Vishwanathan, who appeared for FADA, informed the court that most sales took place online during the lockdown.With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bs-iv-vehicles-sold-after-mar-31-can-t-be-registered-says-sc/story-Kgp3VTFxLz58ujTWB4Xm8L.html

In its four FIRs, the agency has listed four loans in which Central Bank had to face losses of Rs 47 crore and Rs 39 crore while BoI faced losses of Rs 98 crore and Rs 112 crore.The agency has named AGPL, CEIPL and their promoters Bharatbhai Ratanshi Shah and Fenil Shah among others as accused in its cases. Interestingly, CBI had registered two case against the group companies in 2019 as well for cheating Bank of Baroda (BoB) of Rs 39 crore and Rs 68 crore respectively.

09-07-2020||India||ITDC may get to run Parliament canteen; decision likely soon||State-run ITDC may soon replace Northern Railways in running the Parliament canteen. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and tourism minister Prahlad Singh Patel held a meeting with ITDC and parliament officials—described many as the first step for change of guard in the canteen that feeds up to 5,000 people daily during the sessions. Officials clarified that no final decision has been taken yet but the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) made a detailed presentation on Wednesday to discuss its plans for the Parliament canteen. ITDC, the government’s tourism arm, runs the luxury five-star Ashok Group of hotels. The Northern Railway has been serving food in the canteen since 1968. The process to find a new vendor was started last year after concerns about the quality of food were raised. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla was personally looking into the issue. “A decision is likely to be taken in a week or two,” said a senior official. “We have had an in-depth discussion,” Union minister for tourism Prahlad Patel told Hindustan Times. “ITDC has presented the plan, we will have to wait to see how the tie-up works out.”Officials present at the meeting told Hindustan Times that Birla emphasised the need to ensure the “quality of the food.” “The Speaker wanted to ensure that the quality of food is maintained,” said an official on the condition of anonymity. “It is the most important factor but at the same time, the canteen will have to be run on a no-profit, no-loss basis.”ITDC, the above-mentioned official said, was also told that they will have to deal with both, ‘common people and VVIPs’, so a plan that suits all must be finalised. At present, the canteen serves a total of 48 food items for lunch and evening snacks, from boiled vegetables to kesari bath. But items such as poha, mutton cutlet or bonda are not available regularly. According to canteen officials, the vegetarian thali (Rs 40) and chapattis (Rs 2 each) are the most sought-after food in the Parliament complex.According to data available with Lok Sabha officials, out of the Rs 17 crore subsidy, only Rs 24 lakh was spent on account of the MPs. Visitors, security personnel, government officials, and journalists covering Parliament accounted for the rest. During a session, an average of 4,500 people eat daily at Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itdc-may-get-to-run-parliament-canteen-decision-likely-soon/story-IJIWO18Fjr7N0lgMEY6cKI.html
09-07-2020||India||After spat with J&K top cop, MHA suspends officer for ‘misconduct’||Announcing the suspension of Basant Rath, the order stated that disciplinary proceeding is being considered in connection with “repeated instances of gross misconduct and misbehaviour”.The suspension order comes two weeks after Rath had filed an official complaint against director general of police (DGP) Dilbag Singh, and publicly criticised him on the microblogging site Twitter, setting of a social media storm.On June 25, Rath filed a written complaint against Singh at the Gandhi Nagar police station in Jammu, stating that Singh posed a threat to his safety and reputation. In the letter, written in what his colleagues call his trademark irreverent style, Rath referred to the DGP as “worthy worthy’’. “Requesting you to take note of my apprehension about my life, liberty and bald head the reason being certain activities of Sh Dilbag Singh, IPS batch 1987 batch, presently DGP,” Rath wrote.Rath further asked the Gandhi Nagar station house officer Gurnam Choudhary to make a note of the complaint and to not file a First Information Report (FIR).“I’m not asking you to lodge an FIR against the person mentioned above,” the letter read. “I’m just asking you to make this letter a part of the Daily Diary in your police station. Today. Now. In case something bad happens to me, you should know whose number you should dial. With due respect,” it stated.Since then, his twitter handle @KangriCarrier has openly criticised Singh, referred to him as “Dilloo” and made allegations about the latter running after “land at prime locations”. Singh, in turn, is reported to have dismissed these allegations and called him a “joker’’ in a WhatsApp group. With the order, the government has moved to put this public fight between the two officers to rest.Rath is known for his unconventional ways of reaching out to the public in Jammu and Kashmir. Over Twitter, he asks his followers to email him if they need books and study material, and his timeline is filled with messages of grateful students. Even as the story about his suspension was breaking, Rath tweeted on Wednesday: “Salaam, World. Only for MBBS students of J and K and Ladakh who find me trustworthy. If you want some of these books, please mail me the details ...” IPS officers and colleagues contacted by Hindustan Times were divided in their opinion of Rath. While one colleague called him “brilliant”, another described him as “playing to the gallery”. Both officers requested anonymity. During the period of his suspension, Rath will remain in Jammu. The order, issued on Tuesday evening, said the officer is immediately attached to the police headquarters in Jammu.“He shall not leave the headquarters without obtaining the permission from the DGP J&K Police Dilbag Singh,” it added. Rath didn’t respond to calls and messages seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-spat-with-j-k-top-cop-mha-suspends-officer-for-misconduct/story-qWaAmfI4XGIImzTYXzcJZI.html
09-07-2020||India||Row after CBSE prunes syllabus, body says one-time measure||New Delhi: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)’s announcement a day earlier that it has dropped topics like citizenship, secularism, federalism, and partition to rationalise syllabuses to make up for the academic loss due to the Covid-19 pandemic has triggered a political storm with Congress and other opposition parties condemning the move.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was shocked to know that these topics have been dropped in the name of course reduction. “We strongly object to this & appeal @HRDMinistry [Union human resource development ministry], GoI [the government of India] to ensure these vital lessons aren’t curtailed at any cost,” she tweeted.Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi condemned the move saying secularism and federalism are pillars of Indian democracy. “What message are you trying to send?” Singhvi said. He added he was planning to move court.The Left parties accused the government of using the pandemic as an excuse to “advance” its agenda. “Atrocious. Using the pandemic, Modi government is deleting sections dealing with India’s diversity, plurality, democracy etc that uphold our Constitutional values from the Higher Secondary syllabus,” Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted.“All to advance the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] vision of an exclusivist, theocratic, intolerant, fascistic nation. This is nothing but the destruction of our Constitution. Unacceptable.”The Communist Party of India (CPI) condemned the syllabus reduction and called it a “nefarious attempt to implement the Hindutva agenda of RSS”.“The CPI strongly objects to the move to remove chapters on human rights, social movements, citizenship rights, etc. The party condemns the move to condition the minds of our youth so that fascist poison can be easily injected into them,” CPI said in a statement.“Ever since the RSS-BJP government came to power, they have been trying to communalise and commercialise education. The present move is part of their hidden agenda towards that purpose. There is already an attempt to centralise education in the name of New Education Policy.”The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said the BJP wants to do away with democracy and secularism. “The BJP’s agenda is very clear. They want to do away with democracy and secularism. Hence the best way is not to teach it to the young. In the days to come, the BJP may even rewrite history in a different way and add it to the syllabus,” said NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase.CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi issued a clarification, saying the issue had been interpreted “differently” and the syllabus reduction was only a one-time measure due to Covid-19 to reduce stress on students.“The rationalization of syllabus up to 30% has been undertaken by the board for nearly 190 subjects of class IX to XII for the academic session 2020-21 as a one-time measure only,” he said. Tripathi added the board has clarified that no question should be asked from the syllabus which has been removed.“Each of the topics that have been wrongly mentioned in the media as deleted has been covered under Alternative Academic Calendar of NCERT [National Council of Educational Research and Training] which is already in force for all the affiliated schools,” said TripathiBut many of the dropped topics have not been included in the calendar put out on NCERT’s website. But they soon may be part of it, as the council revises the calendar, CBSE and HRD officials said.NCERT website showed a four-week academic calendar. Secularism, nationalism, and citizenship do not feature in it. A CBSE official, who sought anonymity, said NCERT would come up with another alternative academic calendar for more months and more topics will be included. Another government official said NCERT was expected to soon release an eight-week calendar. “The NCERT is likely to include them [topics like citizenship, nationalism or secularism] as it expands this calendar. This is purely based on learning outcomes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-after-cbse-prunes-syllabus-body-says-one-time-measure/story-A39ASipqIK2orMHvs0HS9J.html
09-07-2020||India||2 cops named in case being probed for one more custodial killing||Chennai: Two of the Sathankulam station policemen arrested for the murder of father and son P Jayaraj (59) and J Bennicks (31) have been implicated in another case of alleged custodial torture that led to the eventual death of a 28-year-old man in June.The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday issued notice to the Tamil Nadu government, the state director general of police (DGP), home secretary and the superintendent of police of Thoothukudi, Jayakumar, to respond to the case filed by S Vadivu, the mother of S Mahendran, who died on June 13 reportedly due to injuries sustained while he was kept for a night at the Sathankulam police station in May. Jayakumar told Hindustan Times that a response will be filed after the inquiry into Mahendran’s death by additional superintendent of police, Selvam, is complete.Bennicks and Jayaraj died after they were reportedly beaten with lathis through the night of their arrest on June 19.Mahendran’s mother Vadivu (65) claimed in her affidavit that her son was picked up by sub inspector Raghu Ganesh of the Sathankulam police station on May 23 and tortured in connection with a murder case in which Mahendran’s brother, Durai, was a suspect. Her affidavit also names inspector Sridhar. Mahendran, a construction worker, was not an accused in the case, she added. Sridhar and Raghu Ganesh along with three other policemen are charged with the murder of the father and son duo and are currently lodged in the Madurai central prison.According to an affidavit filed by Vadivu, sub inspector Raghu Ganesh along with few other cops visited her house on May 22, searching for Durai as they suspected his involvement in the murder of a certain Jeyakumar on May 18 in Peikulam. On May 23 at 2 am, the police landed up at Mahendran’s aunt’s house. “They dragged my younger son Mahendran out and started to beat him brutally all over the body, including his private parts,” the affidavit said. “The policemen attacked him in his head also and he sustained head injury. Raghu Ganesh dragged him to the police station (Sathankulam) saying that he will not release him unless Durai surrenders and kept my son illegally.” Depending on his work Mahendran would stay in Peikulam (in Sathankulam) with his mother, or at his aunt’s home in Papanakulam, Thoothukudi. His father died in 2009 while his brother Durai, 35, and sister Santhanam, 30, are married and live in neighbouring villages.Mahendran was let off after a day in police custody and his mother took him to the Thoothukudi government hospital on June 11 after he couldn’t move his right hand and complained of headaches. A scan revealed that he had suffered brain injury, and he died two days later.“They are a very poor family and were too scared to go to the police to file an FIR or even ask for a post-mortem report,” Mahendran's paternal uncle M Perumal told HT. “As per medical reports the death of my son was due to a blood clot in his brain which happened only due to the brutal attack by Raghu Ganesh and Inspector Sridhar (who is also arrested for Bennicks’ murder),” Vadivu’s affidavit stated. The Crime Branch, Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) charged five policemen with the murder of Bennicks and Jayaraj, who died on June 22 and 23 respectively. Five more policemen were arrested on Wednesday for wrongful confinement, among other sections of the Indian Penal Code. The father and son were arrested for keeping their mobile repair shop open beyond the curfew imposed due to the lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). On Wednesday, the Central Bureau of Investigation sent a team to the state to take over the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-cops-named-in-case-being-probed-for-one-more-custodial-killing/story-bbI5i2YPEGJOZkwVYGdtEJ.html
09-07-2020||India||CBI takes over probe, files first FIRs in Tamil Nadu torture case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has taken over the probe into the alleged torture and custodial killings of a 59-year-old man and his son at a police station in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district late last month. P Jayaraj and J Bennicks, 31, were arrested on June 19 and allegedly tortured for keeping their shop open in violation of restrictions imposed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. They were admitted to the Kovilpatti government hospital on June 22 after being allegedly tortured through the night in custody. Bennicks died on the same night, while Jayaraj passed away on June 23. The alleged custodial killings triggered outrage across the country.CBI registered two cases on Tuesday based on Tamil Nadu police’s First Information Reports in the case. “CBI has taken over the investigation of these cases... and constituted a team. The team is being proceeded to the said place [Tamil Nadu] for investigation,” said CBI spokesperson RK Gaur.The special team from Delhi will question the five police personnel arrested for the alleged murders and take them into custody. The five include an inspector. On Wednesday, five more police officials were arrested. They have been charged with wrongful confinement and disappearing of evidence, among other sections.CBI officials said that they will first collect forensic evidence from the police station with the help of experts and then collect the case documents.The federal agency took over the case days after Tamil Nadu chief minister K Palaniswami wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah and sought a CBI probe into the deaths amid the outrage.A policewoman is the only eyewitness in the case. She told judicial magistrate M S Barathidasan, who investigated the incident, that the two were beaten through the night on June 19. The Madras high court on June 30 said there are prima-facie grounds to book the policemen at the Sathankulam police station for Jayaraj and Bennicks’s murder. It made the observation after going through preliminary post-mortem reports as well as the judicial magistrate’s report. The magistrate’s report said the two were thrashed through the night with sticks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-takes-over-probe-files-first-firs-in-tamil-nadu-torture-case/story-YVMhFc9AYAGlTo3MiO6FUJ.html
09-07-2020||India||Kerala CM seeks central probe into gold smuggling as Oppn questions state’s role||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi Wednesday seeking an investigation by central agencies on the large quantity of gold that was seized by Customs officials on July 5, even as the Union minister of state for external affairs urged the Kerala state government to clarify its role.“The fact that the attempt to smuggle huge quantity of gold was concealed in diplomatic baggage makes the matter extremely serious…The case has serious implications as this undermines the economy of the Nation. In fact, it has more than one angle warranting a thorough investigation. It is requested that an effective and coordinated investigation into this incident by all central agencies concerned is the need of the hour,” Vijayan wrote. On July 5, the customs department had seized the gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to the country’s consulate in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram. The action came after a green light from the ministry of external affairs.The Kerala government on Tuesday transferred its information technology secretary, M Sivasankar, a day after the dismissal of IT consultant Swapna Suresh, whom Sivasankar knew, amid allegations of her links to a gold smuggling racket.Swapna Suresh, who was working as the operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT ministry, is said to be on the run after the seizure even as the Customs department has intensified its search for her.The transfer of M Sivasankar, a senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer who is also a secretary to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, came after opposition parties in the state stepped up pressure.Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan on Wednesday said there was a serious lapse on the part of the state government.“Our investigation is on. We will also bring to light those who helped smugglers. The main accused [Swapna Suresh] was given a plum posting when she was mired in another cheating case. Often she was treated more than a high-ranking diplomat and after her role came to light now the CM says he has no idea how she got the job,” he said.As the opposition BJP and Congress stepped up pressure seeking the resignation of the CM, state industry minister E P Jayarajan said this was a move to discredit the popularity of the CM and the state’s fight against the pandemic. “Opposition parties are worried over the popularity of the state. That is why they are raking issues to target the government,” Jayarajan said.Sarith Kumar, an accused in the case who had previously worked as a public relations officer (PRO) in UAE Consulate-General’s office in Thiruvananthapuram was arrested on Monday and remanded to 14 days.Earlier this week, Sivasankar had said that he was ready for any investigation and would share all information with the customs department.A petition was filed on Wednesday before Kerala High Court seeking a probe by central agencies into the case of gold smuggling through a diplomatic channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-seeks-central-probe-into-gold-smuggling-as-oppn-questions-state-s-role/story-FwAXhtsn6Su5yTOPGJHU5M.html

His extradition proceedings are pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-confiscates-nirav-modi-s-assets-valued-at-329-crore/story-WLr6JOXRWKeu15MgmbltaL.html
09-07-2020||India||Army directs soldiers to delete 89 apps over security concerns||The Indian Army has asked soldiers to delete 89 apps from their smart phones including Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat and several apps already banned by the government, people familiar with the developments said on Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.The apps, including dating apps such as Tinder, OkCupid and Couch Surfing, have been banned for security reasons, they said. The social media apps that are a no-go area for soldiers include messaging platforms, video-hosting sites, gaming and dating apps, and also some e-commerce options, the people said.The apps that are of bounds for the India Army now include WeChat, Viber, Zoom, Vigo Video, Cam Scanner and gaming app PUBG. “Such guidelines are issued periodically. These are more significant now in the context of the current border tensions and the need to secure information,” the officials said.The apps banned by the army are not limited to the 59 Chinese mobile applications banned by the government. The Chinese apps earlier banned are Club Factory, SHAREit, Likee, Mi Video Call (Xiaomi), Weibo, Baidu and Bigo Live. They have been removed from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store for India. China has strongly reacted to India’s move to ban 59 mobile applications last month, most of which are linked to China. The Indian government’s decision was based on security concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-directs-soldiers-to-delete-89-apps-over-security-concerns/story-dUi0qtcqjz8v2WTGU5yNRI.html
09-07-2020||India||India backs Bangladesh efforts to repatriate Rohingya home||India has acknowledged the urgency on the issue of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and backed efforts for their early, safe and sustainable repatriation to Rakhine state in Myanmar.India’s position was conveyed in a letter written by external affairs minister S Jaishankar to his Bangladesh counterpart AK Abdul Momen on July 2. Jaishankar expressed India’s appreciation for the “humanistic spirit of the government and the people of Bangladesh in hosting displaced people from the Rakhine state of Myanmar”.“As a neighbour of both Bangladesh and Myanmar, we fully understand the urgency of this issue and an early, safe (and) sustainable repatriation of displaced persons from Rakhine is in the collective interest of all,” said the letter which was accessed by HT.India has maintained a cautious position on the Rohingya refugees in view of its good relations with both Bangladesh and Myanmar.In recent years, India has strengthened connectivity and trade with Bangladesh and also stepped up security cooperation. Bangladesh, on its part, has urged India to impress on Myanmar the need to begin the process of repatriating nearly one million Rohingya refugees living in massive camps at places such as Cox’s Bazar.India, which depends on security cooperation with Myanmar to curb the activities of militant groups in its northeastern states, has so far been reluctant to push the issue of the Rohingya refugees.Jaishankar wrote the letter in response to the congratulations offered by Momen for India’s recent election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2021-22 term. He also thanked Bangladesh for its support for India’s candidature.He also reassured Momen of India’s “steadfast and continued support to the government and people of Bangladesh” in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-backs-b-desh-efforts-to-repatriate-rohingya-home/story-md0slAvgkV9Yz7Dy9QvvYI.html
09-07-2020||India||Those fighting for truth are not intimidated: Cong on RGF probe||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday led the party’s counter-attack on the government for setting up a committee to look into the alleged violation of various laws by three Nehru-Gandhi family linked trusts, as he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “intimidating those who fight for truth”.Hours after the Union home ministry set up an interministerial committee to coordinate investigations into alleged violation of various legal provisions of money laundering act, Income Tax Act and foreign contribution act by Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust (RGCT) and Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust (IGMT), Gandhi took to twitter to attack the Prime Minister, without directly referring to the government decision. “Mr Modi believes the world is like him. He thinks every one has a price or can be intimidated. He will never understand that those who fight for the truth have no price and cannot be intimidated,” the former Congress chief tweeted.His party colleagues, earlier in the day, accused the government of carrying out a “blind witch hunt” against it and applying “double standards” by not questioning “holy cows” associated with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the trusts have nothing to fear and will answer every question like law-abiding persons. He dared the government to deploy all its machinery in probing the financial sources of the three trusts, and said they would answer each question as “law-abiding persons”. Addressing a virtual press conference, Singhvi said, “You (the government) need to be exposed fully because you don’t even ask these questions of many blue-eyed sanctified holy cows. You are harassing each opposition segment, individual and institutional, but not your holy cows. Whose special arc of protection they have,” he asked while referring to the Vivekananda Foundation, the India Foundation, Overseas Friends of BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the ruling party. Such entities are not asked questions about the 9th Schedule exemptions unlike the Gandhi-family run trusts, added Singhvi.Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan tweeted, “The greatest irony is that the Prince from the mega-factory of corruption whose ‘family’ put a price on everything they could lay their hands on and intimidated anyone coming in their way of power continues to sling mud on others. Introspection is not a lost art @RahulGandhi ji”.A second BJP leader said VIF does not accept any foreign donations and RSS is not a public foundation similar to the RGF.Earlier in the day BJP general secretary Murlidhar Rao said investigation is not politically motivated.“Activities of the RGF is in the public domain. There are many aspects to it, related to FRCA, income tax audit etc. Modi government believes in transparency. We are committed to it, so it is natural to have investigation. No foundations are private, and the investigation are in public interest. If it (investigation) was political (motivated) would we have waited six years?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-fighting-for-truth-are-not-intimidated-cong-on-rgf-probe/story-8fMbrHameYhWUQOuwJjy4H.html
09-07-2020||India||Pak forcing Jadhav not to file review petition: India||India on Wednesday accused Pakistan of coercing Kulbushan Jadhav, a former naval officer sentenced to death on charges of spying, not to file a petition seeking a review of his case and of not complying with the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) verdict to review his conviction.New Delhi’s response came hours after senior officials in the Pakistani capital claimed Jadhav had refused to file an appeal in the Islamabad high court against the death sentence given by a military court despite an offer to do so.Pakistan also offered consular access to Jadhav and to arrange a meeting between him and his father and wife, though there was no immediate response from the Indian side.Jadhav was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. In April 2017, Pakistan announced he had been sentenced to death by a military court.The ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and stayed his execution while calling on Islamabad to take all steps for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his sentence, including “enacting appropriate legislation”.The Pakistan government promulgated an ordinance on May 20 allowing Jadhav, his legal representative or the Indian government to file a review petition in the Islamabad high court within 60 days, which will end on July 19, additional attorney general Ahmed Irfan and Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry, director general (South Asia) in the Foreign Office, told a news conference in Islamabad on Wednesday.“Exercising his legal right...Jadav refused to file a petition for the review and reconsideration of his sentence and conviction. He instead preferred to follow up his pending mercy petition,” said Irfan, adding Pakistan has written to the Indian mission to file a petition in the high court before the deadline.In New Delhi, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava described Pakistan’s position as an attempt to “mask its continuing reticence to implement the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit”.“Pakistan’s claim that Jadhav...has refused to initiate a review petition is a continuation of the farce that has been in play for the last four years. Jadhav has been sentenced to execution through a farcical trial. He remains under custody of Pakistan’s military. He has clearly been coerced to refuse to file a review in his case,” he said.Srivastava noted that Pakistan passed the ordinance in May to allow the high court to review the sentence after maintaining for long that its laws allowed for effective reconsideration.“Now, after almost a year, they have made a U-turn and issued an ordinance to ostensibly provide for some sort of review. We have already expressed our serious concerns at the content of the ordinance and how it violates the ICJ judgment. Pakistan is only seeking to create an illusion of remedy,” he added.India has pushed for the full implementation of ICJ’s judgment and sought “unimpeded access to Jadhav to discuss his remedies under the ordinance”, he said.Srivastava described the latest turn of events as a “brazen attempt to scuttle even the inadequate remedy under the ordinance” since Pakistan has “obviously coerced Jadhav to forego his rights” to seek implementation of the ICJ judgment.Despite India’s repeated requests, Pakistan has denied free and unimpeded access to Jadhav, he said. India has repeatedly asked for a lawyer from outside Pakistan to be allowed to appear for Jadhav in any review proceedings but Pakistan has denied this, he added.Since 2017, when the military court carried out its trial, Pakistan has refused to hand over any documents, including the FIR, evidence or court order. “Clearly, Pakistan is attempting to create a mirage of compliance with the ICJ judgment,” Srivastava said.Noting that ICJ has already said Pakistan is in “egregious violation of international law”, Srivastava said the Indian government will do its utmost to protect Jadhav and ensure his safe return home. “To that end, it would consider all appropriate options,” he said.The Pakistani officials referred to India’s request to allow an Indian lawyer to represent Jadhav and said only a lawyer holding a licence of the Islamabad high court can appear in the proceedings. An Indian lawyer cannot appear for Jadhav but may be allowed to assist his counsel, they said.The officials said Pakistan had allowed consular access to Jadhav twice and offered to do so again. It has also offered to arrange a meeting between Jadhav and his father and wife, they said, adding Jadhav’s mother and wife were earlier allowed to meet him in December 2017.Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson also said late on Wednesday that Jadhav’s mercy petition is a separate matter that isn’t connected to the review process. While Jadhav’s mercy petition is pending, “India is invited to file review and reconsideration petition to give effect to the judgement of ICJ”, the spokesperson said.After the Pakistan Army chief endorsed the death penalty for Jadhav in April 2017, he filed a mercy petition in June the same year. The current status of this petition is not known.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-forcing-jadhav-not-to-file-review-petition-india/story-iZFhdLu1w3IKiLVWZjfhHI.html
09-07-2020||India||Cong questions disengagement process along LAC||The Congress on Wednesday posed a set of questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the disengagement process agreed to by the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and objected to the creation of a “buffer zone” on India’s side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.“Dear PM, National Security is sacrosanct. Territorial Integrity is non-negotiable. Pl answer-: 1. Is it correct that under the new protocol with #China, Indian Forces can’t patrol PP-14(Galwan Valley), PP-15(Hot Springs) & PP-17(Gogra)?,” the party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala asked on Twitter.He also tagged a Hindustan Times report, published on Wednesday, about the focus on patrolling in the area.“Is it not true that there has never been dispute with #China on alignment of LAC in these three areas of Galwan Valley, Hot Spring & Gogra? (See Gen DS Hooda’s comment),” Surjewala said in another tweet, referring to a comment by former Northern Army Commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) in the report.The PLA has withdrawn up to 2km from Patrolling Point 15 (Hot Springs) and a similar retreat is expected to be completed at PP-17 (Gogra) by Wednesday evening, with the Indian Army pulling back proportionately.The disengagement is based on an understanding reached by top Indian and Chinese military commanders and the Special Representatives of the two countries, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and China’s foreign minister Wang Yi on a phased de-escalation of the ongoing border conflict in the Ladakh theatre, the report said.The Bharatiya Janata Party did not respond to Surjewala’s questions, and declined to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-questions-disengagement-process-along-lac/story-UzuQShpHB2XiQXqfzQvE0K.html
09-07-2020||India||Fully prepared to deal with any rise in Covid-19 cases, says Goa CM||Goa has reported a surge in Covid-19 cases after doing well initially in checking the spread of the pandemic. Pramod Sawant, the Goa chief minister, spoke to HT about the pandemic, and opposition to approval of infrastructure projects in the state. Edited excerpts: Goa has low positivity and high testing rates compared to the national average and yet the cases are rising? What has gone wrong?Our testing rate is very high compared to the rest of the country and the recovery rate is over 50% with 936 patients having recovered. We are providing very good treatment. Symptomatic patients are being admitted to the [dedicated] Covid-19 Hospital, which has a capacity for 250 patients. Asymptomatic patients are being admitted to the Covid-19 care centres with 1,500 beds. We are creating awareness about wearing face masks and everyone including me, our administrative staff, health department officials, and police department officials are in the field. Is the government prepared for a bigger surge?We are fully prepared. ...there are facilities [to deal with] any rise in the number of cases. We have a capacity of 2,500 [hospital beds] and if necessary, we will increase them. We have ventilator and ICU [intensive care unit] facilities which can also be increased. If required, we will establish one more Covid-19 hospital in the state. The pandemic has hit Goa hard financially and forced it to go for unprecedented borrowing, (₹900 crore in the first quarter). How far have the austerity measures helped? Only time will tell how much. We are taking austerity measures and have reduced expenditure of all departments. How would you respond to criticism over clearance granted to three infrastructure projects, including a railway line double-tracking, in reserve forests?This [railway] project was sanctioned by the earlier government. It came before us for the no-objection certificate (NOC). For the state’s development, we gave the NOC. ...all the mitigation measures like underpasses for wildlife, wherever required, would be implemented.But now with the opposition mounting pressure, you also agreed to a resurvey...It is always so. When any development [proposal] comes, people have questions. We are not doing a resurvey but [ascertaining] what exactly the facts are…You inherited a cabinet, which included ministers senior to you. How have you been dealing with this?No minister is putting any pressure on me. Everything is going well in coordination with all ministers. They all are supporting me in whatever work I am doing either in the Covid-19 management or in other matters. In coordination with the health minister, we are doing a very good job with the management. Besides 2-3 ministers, who are senior legislators, the others became MLAs [members of legislative assembly] along with me. I have a good working relationship with all [ministers].||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fully-prepared-to-deal-with-any-rise-goa-cm/story-MDMa6HKmXEGSnNnyElx8hL.html
09-07-2020||India||AIIMS supports state docs through tele-consultation||Seeking to reduce the number of deaths among coronavirus disease patients, the Union health ministry has asked specialists from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi to guide doctors in state hospitals treating Covid-19 cases admitted in intensive care units (ICU) through tele-consultation.The first batch of doctors from 10 state-run hospitals, of which nine were in Mumbai and one in Goa, were trained by the specialists on Wednesday.“Tele-consultation is a critical component of the clinical intervention protocol for Covid-19. A specialist team of doctors from AIIMS, New Delhi shall provide guidance on effective clinical management of COVID-19 patients in the ICUs of different State hospitals through tele/video consultation. They will handhold the states in clinical management of COVID-19 patients to reduce the case fatality rate,” the health ministry said in a statement.The consultation will be conducted for select hospitals twice every week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. The hospitals selected for consultation will have 1,000 or more beds for Covid-19 patients, including isolation beds, oxygen-supported and ICU beds. Most experts say it is a good idea to be able to handhold peripheral hospitals in managing critical patients.“We do not have adequate number of critical care specialists in the country. Most of those managing critical patients, especially in case of Covid-19, are physicians, and it will work better if they get guidance from a specialist. At Medanta also we provide tele-consultation to peripheral hospitals and it works well. In countries like US also; e-ICUs is a growing concept,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care department, Medanta Hospital. Dr Nikhil Tandon, professor, department of endocrinology, AIIMS, Delhi, said tele-consultation can help scale up outreach in a pandemic. “At AIIMS, we have started the facility quite effectively, especially for follow-up patients. In a lot of departments such as derma and medicine, it has worked very well,” he said. The first session of this exercise began on Wednesday afternoon, and was led by Dr Anand Mohan, head of pulmonary medicine department, AIIMS, Delhi. The hospitals that were chosen include Nair Hospital; MCGM Seven Hills; Mumbai Metro Dahisar Jumbo Facility, Jio Convention Centre Jumbo Facility; NESCO Jumbo Facility, P South (Phase II); and Government Medical College and Hospital, Panaji, Goa. The facility will be extended to another 61 hospitals with a bed capacity ranging from 500-1,000 on twice-a-week basis. A calendar of tele-consultation sessions has been drawn up to cover the states till July 31. A total of 17 such states will be covered: Delhi, Gujarat, Telangana, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Jharkhand and Maharashtra. Up to two doctors handling ICU patients from each hospital along with the director general of health services of the state concerned will participate in the sessions. Some experts cautioned that tele-consultation has its limitations. “To some extent, in dealing with smaller problems, it can work well, but can’t say the same for handling larger medical problems. There are limitations,” said Dr Arup Basu, senior consultant, chest medicine department, Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-supports-state-docs-through-tele-consultation/story-EJnnHpmOyQDOFU9RLvPS5H.html
09-07-2020||India||UGC issues detailed procedure for conducting exams amid Covid-19||The University Grants Commission (UGC) on Wednesday released a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) on how to conduct tests in the midst of a global pandemic, stating that students with cold, cough, fever or other symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) should be given a chance to sit for their exam on another day, or at the very least be made to sit in another room to write the paper.The UGC, which has mandated that all varsities hold final year exams by September 30, said that a minimum distance of two meters between candidates should be maintained, and invigilators should wear masks and gloves.In a letter to all 40 central varsities sent out on Wednesday, the UGC said that the Human Resources Development ministry had formulated the SOP, and it has been vetted by the Health ministry.The SOP clarified that in areas where movement is restricted such as in containment zones, students’ admit cards or student identity cards could double as travel passes. States should issue instructions to ensure that invigilators are issued passes as well, it stated.Exam functionaries would have to submit a self-declaration form about their health status and thermo-gun checks should be made available at all entrances. In case any functionary fails the self-declaration criteria or the thermo-gun check, they should be asked to leave the exam centre immediately.There should be signs on social distancing in the campuses of exam centres, and the SOP recommended that everyone involved in the exam process use the Aarogya Setu app on their mobile phones.The SOP further said that all floors, gates, walls, doors, furniture, elevators and even staircase railings in an examination centre would have to be disinfected. Sanitisers and liquid handwash dispensers would have to be placed at the entrance and other places in the exam centre.Crowds must be avoided at entrance and exit points, the SOP said. It further stated that records of exam functionaries and students should be maintained in case contact tracing needed to be done in the future.COVID-19 has played havoc with the academic year. In a move backed by Human resources development minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, the UGC decided that exams were a must for all final year students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ugc-issues-procedure-for-conducting-exams/story-EsOd3EdLFjRxhWrZrGz3LO.html
09-07-2020||India||Demand for MGNREGS exceeds govt estimates||In the past two months, work granted under India’s flagship rural job guarantee programme has surpassed the government’s estimates, indicating immense demand and lack of alternative livelihoods following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the subsequent lockdown that forced an exodus of millions of migrant workers employed in the cities back home to the hinterland.From a tepid start in April—a large part of it was lost in sweeping lockdown measures—the generation of persondays under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) bounced back in May and June as the return of migrant workers caused demand for work under the programme to soar. The rural development ministry had made an early estimate at the beginning of FY 2020-21 on the generation of persondays of work under MGNREGS over different months. According to the official estimate, 679.8 million persondays of work had been expected to be logged at the end of May. But actual persondays generated until May stood at 709.4 million.Similarly, 1.255 billion persondays of work was done up to June as against the initial estimate of 1.102 billion, government data shows. According to senior officials,who requested anonymity, the trend underlines how the prolonged pandemic has led to delayed recovery of economic activities, forcing rural jobless to settle for work under the rural jobs scheme, which guarantees 100 days of work a year to at least one member of every rural household.The government’s estimate for July too, may be outpaced by increasing demand. Until the first week of the month itself, 1.257 billion persondays have been generated while the estimate up to July was 1.359 billion This massive pressure on MGNREGS may also lead to a shortage of funds for the programme, experts feel. The world’s biggest job guarantee programme has been allocated more than Rs 1 lakh crore for this fiscal year, with Rs 40,000 crore added as a part of the Centre’s Garib Kalyan package. A closer look at government data also shows that the surge in demand for jobs under the MGNREGS is directly related to the states that have received a large number of migrant labourers who left the cities. Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand have seen the number of persondays of work generated by MGNREGS soaring .In Bijhar, the number of persondays increased to 75.4 million up to June against an estimated 60 million. In Uttar Pradesh—home to the highest number of returnee migrant workers—the figure doubled to 146 million against an estimated 70 million. Madhya Pradesh has seen 17 million additional persondays of work and Odisha 23 million. An official maintained that it may not be feasible to pump all government resources into MGNREGS and the need of the hour is to open up more work opportunities. He also hoped that the recently announced Rozgar scheme,under which work worth Rs 50,000 crore will be is generated for migrant workers who have returned home would lessen the pressure on MGNREGS. “MGNREGS is anyway demand-driven and works of Swachh Bharat were already included. Creating job opportunities for unskilled workers is good but the main question is, where is the money? The government has hiked MGNREGS budget by Rs 40,000 crore but the budget won’t be sufficient for the entire year given the very high demand for work,” Himanshu,an associate professor with Jawaharlal Nehru University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-mgnregs-exceeds-govt-estimates/story-4HxRmbXDqnIhAQ4h315xGI.html
09-07-2020||India||Cabinet approves agri fund, rental scheme for migrants||The cabinet on Wednesday approved an agriculture infrastructure fund worth Rs 1 lakh crore, by far the National Democratic Alliance government’s largest federally funded programme in the farm sector, and green-lighted an affordable rental housing scheme for migrant workers, millions of whom left cities and returned home to the hinterland in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease pandemic and the lockdown imposed to stop its spread.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced both plans in May as part of the Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus and relief package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fight the slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown. The fund, in the form of special loans with discounted interest rates, is meant for farm entrepreneurs, aggregators of farm produce and for building infrastructure such as refrigerated storage, markets and farm supply chains. The scheme running the fund shall begin in this fiscal year and end in 2029.While announcing the fund, the finance minister said the loans would benefit private agricultural entrepreneurs and start-ups that aimed to buy the produce of farmers and aim to reach global markets, but which did not have the infrastructure. “This fund will immediately address the issue. It will be created at the earliest,” she said on May 15.The total credit will be disbursed over four years, starting with an initial sanction of Rs 10,000 crore in the current financial year and Rs. 30,000 crore each in the next three fiscal years.The Rs 1 lakh crore fund, aimed at boosting farm infrastructure and logistics, will offer medium to long term debt facility for investment in harvest management projects and community farming assets. It will work on a model of discounts on interest along with financial support, a Cabinet note said.All loans under the fund will have interest discount of 3% per year up to a limit of Rs 2 crore. This benefit of this discount will be available for a maximum period of seven years. Also, credit guarantee coverage – where loans are underwritten -- will be available for eligible borrowers under the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises scheme for loans up to Rs 2 crore. The infusion of Rs 1 lakh crore in the rural-agri infrastructure space will generate rural employment and reduce farm wastage, according to Arindam Guha, partner and leader, government and public sector, Deloitte India. The cabinet also approved the development of affordable rental housing complexes for urban migrant poor as a “sub-scheme” under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana -- Urban (PMAY–U) . Existing vacant government funded housing complexes will be used for the scheme through concession agreements for 25 years. The housing scheme for urban poor entails a funding of Rs 600 crore, which will be released for projects with innovative technologies for construction. The government hopes the scheme will benefit nearly 300,000 migrant poor.Existing and vacant government-funded housing complexes will be converted into such complexes. Concessionaires will make the complexes livable by undertaking repair and maintenance and filling gaps in infrastructure including water and drainage connections and roads. Special incentives such as permission to use existing vacant land, 50% additional Floor Area Ratio or Floor Space Index, concessional loans at priority sector lending rates and tax relief at par with those offered to affordable housing will be given to private and public entities to develop such complexes. According to internal ministry data accessed by HT, 1.2 million government houses are available; they were built under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), PMAY and housing schemes of state governments. Of these, Maharastra has the maximum number of dwelling units available ( 35,000) and Delhi has 30,000 houses, officials aware of the development said on condition of anonymity.The Centre will also be issuing model tenancy agreement guidelines which the states can follow, they added . Millions of migrant workers who either lost their jobs or were concerned about losing their livelihoods left the cities in an exodus to their homes in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal after the post-Covid-19 lockdown’s enforcement on March 25. Many complained that they were under pressure from landlords to vacate their rented houses. “The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in massive reverse migration of workers/ urban poor in the country who come from rural areas or small towns for seeking better employment opportunities in urban areas. Usually, these migrants live in slums, informal/ unauthorized colonies or peri-urban areas to save rental charges. They spend a lot of time on roads by walking/ cycling to workplaces, risking their lives to cut on the expenses,” the ministry of housing and urban affairs said in a statement.“A large part of workforce in manufacturing industries, service providers in hospitality, health, domestic/commercial establishments, and construction or other sectors, labourers, students etc who come from rural areas or small towns seeking better opportunities will be the target beneficiary under affordable rental housing complexes ,” it added. The affordable rental housing scheme will strengthen the government’s commitment of Housing for All, said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-approves-agri-fund-rental-scheme-for-migrants/story-Cuy3H22YZNqzhhR3z1tXbK.html
09-07-2020||India||Bihar polls: 5 parties protest postal ballot move||After the ministry of law and justice amended the rules to enable those over the age of 65 years and people infected with the coronavirus disease or suspected of having contracted the infection to vote by postal ballot ahead of the upcoming Bihar elections, five opposition parties are up in arms against the move. Congress, Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M), Rashtriya Janata Dal and Trinamool Congress have all written to the chief election commissioner (CEC) to review the move. The controversy started last week when CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the amendment will “help the ruling party.” Following Yechury’s comments, Congress sent a representation to CEC Sunil Arora to review the decision.“The manner in which this decision has been taken demonstrates a complete non-application of mind and a shocking circumvention of any consultation process with the key stakeholders (i.e. any other political parties other than the ruling regime). Even upon a cursory examination, the numerous legal deficiencies in this decision become apparent,” the Congress said in its representation.Bihar is due to go to the polls later this year. The state is ruled by a coalition of the Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party. In February, Delhi became the first state to experiment with postal ballots, extending the facility to those with severe disabilities or above the age of 80 years.Earlier, casting votes through postal ballots was an option available only to the armed forces and officials assigned poll duties.Yechury said that extending the postal ballot would give the ruling party an edge and that wider consultations with political parties were needed. The Commission responded to Yechury on Wednesday, stating that the chief electoral officer of Bihar had held consultations with various political parties before the decision was taken.EC officials told Hindustan Times that they had heard the parties’ representation with an “open mind”. “Everyone is entitled to a viewpoint,” an official had earlier told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity. “State and district-level talks were held before the decision was taken. This is an enabling provision.”The official further added that same practice had been tested in the Jharkhand and Delhi elections. “No one opposed it then, why now,” the official had said. CPI General Secretary D. Raja said the digital propaganda during the election campaign will be extremely expensive, and it will deprive political parties of a level-playing field. “It (the postal ballot) will lead to malpractice and foul play by those parties that are in power and have resources. These two proposals, if accepted, will definitely jeopardise the democratic process of free and fair elections,” Raja wrote to the Commission. He asked the commission to hold wider and transparent consultations with all political parties.The Trinamool Congress also wrote to the Commission, saying the move of wanting those over 65 years of age to vote through postal ballots is arbitrary, mala fide, unconstitutional and ex-facie, a violation of secrecy of vote, right to free and fair elections and right to health. “Our party is of the opinion that this amendment, issued without adequate consultation with the political parties, is antithetical to a robust and inclusive democracy,” the party said in its letter.“This amendment seeks to effectively disenfranchise those above the age of 65 from exercising their right to vote while denying them a fair, equal and reasonable chance to participate in elections,” party general secretary Subrata Bakshi wrote. The RJD too joined the chorus, with spokesperson Manoj Jha writing to the CEC. “We primarily opposed the manner in which the decision was taken,” Jha said. “With the postal ballot for those over 65, the ruling party will get an edge. There is a grey area which shouldn’t be there.” Former CEC SY Quraishi, however, says that the secrecy of the vote will not be compromised because of the postal ballot. “People over the age of 65 are not allowed to move out {because of Covid-19}, so the decision to allow them to vote using postal ballots is reasonably justified. It is logical,” Quraishi said.“The Commission always works with the cooperation of political parties, they call them and explain the rationale behind their decision,” he added. Another former CEC, who did not wish to be named, said that the reason the postal ballot had become a bone of contention was because there is a “trust deficit” when it comes to this government. “Everyone is suspicious of any decision as they don’t trust government enough,” said the former CEC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-polls-5-parties-protest-postal-ballot-move/story-INKaWI68MQPN9D1wSyz93N.html
09-07-2020||India||Police arrest Vikas Dubey’s 3 aides from Faridabad||It was around 12.30pm on Tuesday that Vikas Dubey, now being hunted for the murder of eight policemen who went to arrest him on July 3, checked out of a hotel in Faridabad’s Badhkal Chowk, seemingly always a step ahead of the police.Missing since the July 3 gunfight, Dubey is believed to have reached Faridabad sometime over the weekend to escape police in Uttar Pradesh, where he now has a bounty of Rs 5 lakh. In the NCR suburb, the gangster is believed to have stayed at multiple location, including first at a residence in Sector 87, form where three people were arrested on Wednesday. Among them was a man identified as Prabhat, who also goes by Kartikey, and is one of Dubey’s close aides to accompanied him from Kanpur. The other two were residents of the house, including one person who has tested positive for Covid, and are now under arrest for harbouring a fugitive. We received a tip-off about Dubey’s presence after which raids were carried out, said Anil Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime), Faridabad. According to him, UP police too was alerted and had arrived to scan CCTV footage and question the hotel staff. “Dubey was seen leaving alone. We received another secret information and crime teams worked on technical surveillance and a raid was conducted in Indira Complex in Sector 87 following which three close aides tried to escape the spot while firing at police teams but were arrested,” he said.Romi Passi, the manager of hotel Oyo Shri Sasaram said a man resembling Dubey left the hotel before the cops reached. “They checked in around 12:45 am and gave a copy of Aadhar card of Ankur Mishra who accompanied him, though the copy was not clear and I asked him to give me the original copy but he was not carrying it. He said he will arrange by morning as it was already too late,” he said adding that the duo took room number 208, on the second floor.Passi said on Tuesday afternoon around 12:30 pm, both left the hotel. “We were shocked to see news channel flashing news and picture of our hotel on the television screen. Before we could react or understand the matter, police teams reached and started investigating. I had never seen any poster or picture of the gangster so how would I know he is one of the most wanted criminals,” he said.According to officials in Faridabad police, who asked not to be named, close to 250 security cameras has been monitored to determine where Dubey may have gone. Police identified the people arrested from the Sector 87 house as Prabhat, who comes from Dubey’s village and Dubey’s relatives Ankur and Shravan Mishra. “We have recovered 44 live cartridges, four pistols of 9 mm and Rs 3,000 from the possession of the suspects including two pistols which were looted from the UP Police,” said Yadav.“Dubey left for Delhi as he suspected police was tracking his locations and he was willing to surrender before the Delhi court as he feared for his life and he told his aide that police will kill him in an encounter,” he added, citing the questioning of the people.After watching the CCTV footage, police officers said it is likely Dubey was wearing padding around his abdomen to avoid recognition. He did not remove his face mask even once to ensure he was not recognised by the hotel staff, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-arrest-dubey-s-3-aides-from-faridabad/story-QjRnZEbcamP0APDIyyzSrO.html
09-07-2020||India||Search for most-wanted UP gangster reaches Delhi||A manhunt for Vikas Dubey, the Uttar Pradesh-based gangster sought for the July 3 ambush that killed eight policemen, shifted to the National Capital Region on Wednesday even as police teams separately shot dead one of his top aides and arrested eight others – including two policemen – for helping or sheltering him.On Tuesday, Dubey was spotted at a hotel in Faridabad, the first time his whereabouts was known in what has been a game of cat and mouse since his escape from the scene of the predawn gunfight in a village near Kanpur last week. Dubey has till now stayed a step ahead of the cops, who have discovered his hideouts and his getaway vehicles but only after he left them. On Wednesday morning, a team of UP Police engaged Dubey’s accomplice, Amar Dubey, in a gunfight in Hamirpur. Amar Dubey succumbed to injuries hours later.Additional director general (ADG) of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar told reporters in Lucknow that the state police will ensure the strictest action against Vikas Dubey, “which will be cited as an example in the future”.“Amar Dubey, who carried a reward of ₹50,000 and was a co-accused in the FIR registered in connection with the killings of police personnel, was killed in an encounter at Maudaha village in Hamirpur district,” Kumar said.The July 3 murder and the escape that followed brought the spotlight back on law and order in Uttar Pradesh, with the police discovering that some among its own were feeding information to the gangster, possibly even playing a role in how the eight policemen walked into a trap since Dubey was tipped off about his impending arrest by the group. On Wednesday, the police arrested two sub-inspectors posted in Kanpur and are believed to have alerted Dubey. An official involved in the manhunt in NCR, while asking not to be named, said it is likely that the suspect is still being fed information from inside the police since he seems to be leaving his hideouts shortly before raids are carries out. In the Capital, security was increased in Noida after reports poured in about Dubey planning to surrender at the studio of a TV news channel. This came hours after police disclosed that the gangster had arrived in Faridabad on Monday, at one point checking into a hotel where CCTV footage showed him dressed in a dark black T-shirt, a pair of jeans, and a mask.Police in Faridabad also detained an accomplice of Dubey’s who had been with him when the gunfight took place, as well as two relatives at whose residence the gangster stayed. “We received secret information and crime teams worked on technical surveillance and a raid was conducted in Indira Complex in Sector 87 following which three close aides tried to escape the spot while firing at police teams but were arrested,” said Anil Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime), Faridabad.Officials in Lucknow slowly pieced together how Dubey escaped Kanpur: he and his aides first took motorcycles, before they hitched a ride on sand-laden trucks to reach close to Delhi. Dubey has nearly 60 criminal cases against him including murder and attempt to murder. On July 3, when the police personnel were on their way to his house to arrest him, his men took position on rooftops and opened fire, killing eight of the group: a deputy superintendent of police, three sub-inspectors and four constables. The state has since then raised the bounty on Dubey’s head to ₹5 lakh, and put posters with his face at all highway toll plazas.After Dubey was spotted in Faridabad, checking of vehicles and commuters was stepped up on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, said police in Noida. Authorities also put up barricades around Noida’s Film City area after unconfirmed reports suggested he would surrender in front of a news channel “Dubey left for Delhi as he suspected police was tracking his locations and he was willing to surrender before the Delhi court as he feared for his life and he told his aide that police will kill him in an encounter,” said Faridabad ACP YadavPolice in Faridabad said they scanned close to 250 CCTV cameras but were yet to discover leads on where Dubey may have headed. In the footage from the hotel, police officials said, Dubey was wearing some sort of a padding around his abdomen to alter his appearance. Throughout the duration when he has been seen on camera, the gangster did not remove his face mask.The three suspects held from the Sector 87 house in Faridabad were produced before a court and Prabhat – who had accompanied Dubey from his village - -was taken on transit remand by Special Task Force (STF) of Uttar Pradesh while the two otherss were sent to 14-days judicial custody. Shravan Mishra, one of the two, tested positive for coronavirus and was placed in an isolation ward before being sent to jail, said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/search-for-most-wanted-up-gangster-reaches-delhi/story-UvEuTnqzyYjNBm0D9np53O.html

The effects of that are being seen in terms of declining positivity rate, new cases and hospital bed occupancy. By working together with industry stakeholders, the Delhi government is keen to come out stronger from the economic shock caused by Covid-19,” said Jasmine Shah, the head of the 12-member committee.Shah, who is also the vice-chairperson of the Dialogue and Development Commission, an advisory body to the Delhi government, said, “In the next three to six months, the focus will be on ensuring the survival of businesses and various industry sectors by revisiting licensing norms, simplifying Covid related regulations and taking measures to revive demand… Several industry members expressed the urgency of undertaking measures to revive demand by taking industry-specific measures such as permitting outdoor sitting and extending hours of operations of restaurants.”“In three years, the committee agreed to focus on revival of the business environment by accelerating the pending reforms related to ease of doing business. Key pending reforms are needed to be taken up now that would further improve the ease of doing business in Delhi and ensure a full economic revival from the impact of Covid-19, especially for MSMEs,” he said.Brijesh Goel, a member of the committee, who represents trade bodies, said, “Proposals on rebate on commercial power bills, at least for the lockdown period, and automatic renewal of all licences and no-objection certificates, including those in the areas of trade, factory operation, fire and environment, till March 31, 2021, were tabled in the meeting.”The committee has representatives from the government, municipal corporations and trade and industrial bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-panel-on-economic-recovery-to-focus-easing-licensing-norms/story-Awz2rEDGBinSSGizVN7FKP.html

I was surprised to witness the new normal and now we have to live with this god knows for how long. Now we give shots and retire to our respective rooms. No bonding and having lunch together anymore. We reach the sets and get sanitized from head to toe and our temperatures are recorded. But it’s good at the same time to be back to work,” said Vishal over the phone.Vishal, who made his debut with Crazy Stupid Ishq, feels that he has been lucky to get different characters. “I truly consider myself lucky for playing characters with different shades. My debut as a lead happened absolutely by chance. Then getting roles like Baldev Singh of ‘Ek Veer Ki Ardaas...Veera’ and Sagar in ‘Gangaa,’ where stories are well written and characters well sketched. Also, as an actor I believe in polishing ones skills all along the journey as you always learn and unlearn in life. Keeping this in mind, I have been part of a couple of theatre workshops too.”Currently, Vishal is all set for the launch of his new show where he plays a grey character. “This was a surprise for me too but the conviction producer Mamta (Y Patnaik) maam had in me got me on board to play an antagonist for the first time in the show ‘Ishq Mein Marjaawan. The character of Kabir is so different yet so similar to me that I completely enjoyed playing him. The show was suppose to go on air in March but due to Covid crisis all went on hold. Only now we have started to shoot again for further episodes.”Vishal was all geared up to also start an OTT series but that too went on hold. “For me playing lead is not a priority. I want to play characters where I am strong part of the story. This is what this OTT series is about. Sad that it couldn’t materialise till date due to the ongoing crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/good-to-be-back-to-work-vishal/story-IVaoKEmt6YAfMA0bTvYlTN.html

The district administration recently issued a letter saying those not doing their duties will be replaced. The activists have complained that they are overloaded with work. The state has a total of almost 50,000 ASHA workers who get Rs 2000 every month (divided equally between Centre and state government) apart from incentives for different procedures.Sarswati Punetha, an ASHA worker from Champawat, said: “ASHA workers here have been working continuously for the past three months. There are Covid-19 patients also at the quarantine centres posing a risk to our health, yet the government is not helping us. We are overworked and work without sanitisers, masks or gloves.”“Despite working so much we are now learning that ASHA workers will be replaced if we do not work properly,” she added.Apart from working in quarantine centres, ASHA workers also ensure vaccinations, institutional deliveries of pregnant women, the surveillance work of people returning to the state among other duties.Kamla Kunjwal, state president of Uttarakhand ASHA Workers Union, said: “ASHA workers are the frontline warriors in the state’s battle against Covid-19. We are not just monitoring those who have been quarantined but also doing our traditional duties. We demand that Rs 10,000 monthly Covid-19 allowance should be given to us in such a situation.”Kunjwal demanded that outstanding payment for the past three months should be given to the workers at the earliest.ASHA workers from Nainital recently staged a protest supporting workers from Champawat district.Last week, a delegation of ASHA workers met the director general of health regarding their demands of being given a proper honorarium like aanganwadi workers or other government professionals involved in ground level Covid-19 surveillance.Shiba Dubey, state head of ASHA Swasthya Karyakati Union associated with Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) said that they gave a memorandum to the director-general of health with their demands of giving an incentive to ASHA workers for their duty during Covid-19.“We were assured by the director-general that ASHA workers would be given an incentive. We have also demanded that ASHA workers should not be removed from their posts in Champawat district,” said Dubey.Dr RP Khanduri, chief medical officer of Champawat district said that no ASHA worker has been removed from their posts in the district.“We have not removed any ASHA workers in the district. They are working a lot and helping the health department in its fight against Covid-19. We have just issued an order saying that those who are not working will be replaced, but no action has been taken yet,” said Dr Khanduri.On June 26, honouring ASHA workers for their role in the state’s fight against Covid-19, the state government announced that it will give Rs 1,000 to every Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and Aanganwadi workers in the state.(With inputs from Ankur Sharma in Haldwani)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/work-sans-masks-sanitisers-uttarakhand-asha-workers-seek-covid-allowance/story-Woa7pWPhjf8C3aoDd1hjtI.html
09-07-2020||India||Ecologists ask Javadekar to stop rail line across Western Ghats||New Delhi: A 20-year-old rail line project in the Western Ghats in Karnataka, which was rejected by several statutory bodies in the past and remained shelved amid fears the extent of irreparable damage it could cause to primary forests and unique biodiversity, has got the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) authorities’ nod March 20, reversing its rejection move 11 days earlier.The SBWL approval was granted after the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), started reviewing the rail project and asked about the reasons behind the inordinate delay in implementing it, documents suggest. However, the SBWL’s approval has raised several serious environmental concerns that had held up the project for the past two decades.At least 101 scientists have endorsed a letter written by 11 ecologists and wildlife biologists to the NBWL member-secretary and Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar on July 2, raising several concerns about the Hubballi Ankola Railway Line Project (HARP) in Karnataka, including irreversibly damaging forests, fragmenting wildlife habitats in the Western Ghats, a global biodiversity hotspot and a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) world heritage site.The project is likely to cone for NBWL’s nod before other requisite clearances are sought.The proposed rail track will pass through a wildlife corridor between Bedthi Conservation Reserve (BCR) and Kali Tiger Reserve (KTR), a natural habitat for many species, including tigers and elephants. The project involves deforestation of around 1.9 lakh trees.The habitat of Great Pied and Malabar Pied Hornbills, both keystone species -- species critical for the survival of other species in the region -- are likely to have a major impact due to the project.It also passes through habitats that host many endemic and endangered species such as the Malabar Tree Toad, cited the letter that has quoted from various peer-review papers in a bid to bolster their argument.The letter and details of the project are also published on Conservation India website that is spearheading a campaign to protect ecology.“No amount of mitigation will compensate for the damage to the ecosystem that will be lost for good. Ultimately, the well-being of local communities will be jeopardised,” the letter said.The Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot has already lost 33,000 square kilometres (km), or up to 40% of its forest cover, in the last 100 years, according to scientists.A significant proportion of this forest loss is attributed to linear projects such as power transmission lines, highways, and construction of dams.“The existing railway line (Tinai Ghat-Castlerock), located around 50 km north of the proposed site, along with several state roads and power lines have significantly contributed to fragmenting forests of the region and creating edges. Implementing HARP will create many more edges by splitting 10 large forest patches of conservation significance into 15 smaller patches,” said the letter, endorsed by over a hundred scientists from various research organisations.They have argued that mitigation measures would not be able to counter the ecological impacts.Earlier, this project was rejected by the Supreme Court (SC)-constituted Central Empowered Committee (CEC) in 2015 and by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in 2018, according to documents seen by HT.The MoEFCC’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) had also raised several issues regarding the project.“The CEC is of the considered view that the project would cause huge and irreparable damage to forests, wildlife and biodiversity of the Western Ghats, which would far outweigh the actual tangible benefits of the project. The CEC report was based on a number of hearings, documents, and meetings with various senior Karnataka government officials,” the CEC had said while rejecting HARP.A MoEFCC letter to principal secretary (forests) Karnataka dated September 29, 2018, had stated that a site inspection committee of NTCA has rejected the project because out of the six tiger occupied landscapes in India, Western Ghats tops on habitat connectivity and contiguity counts.The project has come up, pending NBWL and other national-level approvals, despite a spate of rejections in the past.HT has seen the minutes of Karnataka SBWL meeting, which suggests that the project was rejected unanimously by board members and special invitees on March 9.The minutes suggest that a majority of SBWL members had opposed the project.The additional chief secretary (ACS), forests, Karnataka had said since the rail network is already strengthened between Tinnaighat-Castlerock-Caranzol, HARP is redundant.Karnataka chief secretary (CS), who was the special invitee in the SBWL meeting, cited the Centre’s enquiry regarding the delay in the project’s implementation.In the March 20 meeting, the Board contradicted its own decision.The minutes show that a number of special invitees attended the meeting, including the state minister of industries and the CS along with chief minister BS Yediyurappa.The Board recommended the project in view of development in north Karnataka region.Environmentalists have found holes in SBWL’s nod to the project.“The decision taken on March 9 to reject the proposal was in conformity with legal and statutory procedures. However, hand-picked Special Invitees with no expertise in wildlife were allowed to deliberate at a hurriedly convened meeting on March 20 violating all procedural norms. This smacks of arbitrariness. There is no legal provision under the Wildlife Act, 1972, that empowers the State Board to review its own decision taken after completion of a statutory process,” said Praveen Bhargav of the Bengaluru-based Wildlife First, a conservation advocacy group.“Supreme Court-appointed expert committees, senior government officials, ecologists and conservationists have repeatedly recommended against approving this project. They have questioned the very necessity of the project and raised serious reservations on impacts on tribal and other forest-dependent communities. Serious impacts on important wildlife habitats, tree and fragmentation of important corridors have also been raised. The state government’s decision to approve this project against such advice undermines the purpose of legally mandated expert appraisals. Mitigation measures are a feeble justification for a project of severe consequences and which has been in a regulatory tug of war for several years,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.HT had sent queries on whether Javadekar had received the scientists’ representation on Monday but did not get a response till Tuesday evening.Another NBWL, member, however, said on condition of anonymity that all members had received the representation and it would be deliberated upon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ecologists-ask-javadekar-to-stop-rail-line-across-western-ghats/story-qmOGyFkPofmE4ZMe0l1QpN.html
09-07-2020||India||HT Salutes: Helping migrants during a crisis||Shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the 21-day nationwide lockdown to fight the Covid-19 pandemic in March, Sanjay Singh, a 45-year-old resident of Mirzapur village in Jalaun district realised that there was a crisis in the making.Jalaun lies in the plains of Bundelkhand, a region from where several thousand men and women migrate to Mumbai in Maharashtra, Surat and Ahmedabad in Gujarat, Bengaluru in Karnataka and other metropolises, in search of work. When the lockdown began on March 25, Singh saw residents of nearby villages make frantic calls to their family members living as migrants in big cities, fearful of their survival. Within a few days, one of the country’s biggest reverse migration movements began, as migrant workers took to the roads, often on foot, to go back to their home states.Towards the end of March, such a group of migrant workers had reached Madhya Pradesh’s Datia district, but to enter their home state, permissions from top officials like the chief secretary and additional chief secretary (Home) in Lucknow were required. In the meantime, the police had a tough task controlling the workers who were impatient to cross into Uttar Pradesh. It was also an arduous task for the administration of districts to supply food and water. Watch | HT Salutes: UP man helping migrants labourers with food, work as they returnThat’s when Singh, who runs a voluntary organisation called Parmarth Samaj Sewi Sansthan which works on livelihood and water conservation in Bundelkhand districts across both states, approached the authorities with an offer to help. His volunteers —many of whom themselves had migrant family members — would have no problem in managing the crowd, Singh told the officers.As the crowd multiplied on the border, the Datia and Jhansi district administrations gave a green signal to Singh to set up a kitchen near the border at of these two districts, to distribute food and water among the migrants. He also set up a help desk to guide migrants to buses and shelter homes as well as transport those exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19, like cough or fever, to health centres.“The volunteers ran the community kitchen and the help desk till the end of May. They took the assistance of local residents of these districts, including adjoining Lalitpur in Uttar Pradesh, as well as traders and farmers who supplied grains and edible items to run the kitchen,” Singh said.Singh also ensured that the group of 18 volunteers wore personal protective gear as well as distributed masks and sanitizers among the migrants many of whom had returned from hotspots like Mumbai, Surat and Indore.From March 27 to the first week of June, around 3.5 million migrant workers have returned to Uttar Pradesh of which 1 million were from Bundelkhand’s districts of Jhansi, Lalitpur, Jaluan, Hamirpur, Banda, Mahoba and Chitrakoot. A majority of them have little money and no source of employment other than the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme (MNREGS). In Uttar Pradesh, already 2.5 million migrants have applied for new job cards under the scheme, but till mid-June, 1 million were yet to receive them.In June, Singh also began to motivate returned migrants to work in water conservation schemes. “We roped in some of the returning migrants to revive the ponds, lakes and rivers in the Bundelkhand region which is in midst of a water crisis. Work has already begun in Manpur pond in Jhansi district. A canal to connect the pond with nearby agricultural land is being repaired in time for the paddy crop,” he said.Paddy sowing begins from the end of June.“We told them that if they do not wish to migrate again, they need to revive and conserve the water bodies. Along with Lalitpur and Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh we have also organised similar revival activities of ponds and lakes in Tikamgarh and Chattarpur areas of Madhya Pradesh,” Singh said.“We were trapped in the lockdown. We faced hardship and hunger. Now, after returning to the native village we are working for the revival of the pond and the canal to ensure we don’t have to face this again,” said Meera Ahirwar, a migrant worker who returned to Manpur from Indore in May.Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you 15 stories of HT Salutes.

09-07-2020||India||Aravalli Biodiversity Park reopens: Eager visitors venture wilderness with masks, follow social distancing||Face masks, social distancing, avoiding large groups, careful on the benches, no-eatables, one-way signages — visiting the popular nature spot Aravalli Biodiversity Park, during the ongoing pandemic era, won’t be the same considering the new rules put in place to avoid the spread of coronavirus. Gurugram’s favourite spot has reopened, on July 1, and Gurugrammers are kicked to visit even if it means following some strict guidelines. “The park is finally open after the lockdown,” says Priti Sanwalka, one of the board members, adding, “It’s a great time to be at the park and enjoy its flora and fauna; there is a burst of activity on all fronts and lots of flowering, fruiting and bird activity to enjoy. And to ensure the safety of all visitors and our staff, we have put in place measures as per the unlock guidelines of Ministry of Home Affairs.”Latika Thakral, co-founder of the NGO, iamgurgaon, says, “People were eagerly awaiting for the park to reopen and some even checked on call... Now that the park is open, we have arrows put up to identify one-way movement in the main stretch. It’s very difficult to control (once visitors start coming), but we are assuming that people will follow the rules.” Among those who are regular visitors at the park is photographer Dinesh Khanna, who visits with his pets. He says, “Considering the circumstances, I think these are excellent rules and will, hopefully, be adhered properly by all walkers. I definitely will make sure to be responsible as it’s in everyone’s interest.” Another park regular and Gurugram resident Sarika Panda Bhatt says, “We Gurugramers were eagerly waiting for BDP to open! Unfortunately, the Covid-19 crisis is here to stay for some time as we don’t have a cure or a vaccine. A number of studies from around the world have shown that when people maintain the rules of hygiene and protection — like wear face masks, avoid large gatherings, and maintain physical distancing — then the chance of catching the infection is negligible. Therefore, the new regulations at the park are a welcome step. We definitely need outdoor activities to fight with other health issues and going to the forest is the best remedy.”Ecologist Vijay Dhasmana says the place is a “delight” for any nature lover. “The park has been thriving with this year’s early rains. Monsoon is a most productive time, with caterpillar, bugs, and flowering. At the park too, many plants are flowering and fruiting. Unfortunately, people could not witness the spring flowering this year. But now birds are nesting and you can hear the jungle with crickets, cicadas sounds. Lockdown has been tough on people. So when they will now get to go in the wilderness, it will give them positivity and hope. There is so much life happening there; people who understand nature will get to witness all that.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/aravalli-biodiversity-park-reopens-eager-visitors-venture-wilderness-with-masks-follow-social-distancing/story-F4nLmbQ7zhv0fiDy1NUVxM.html
