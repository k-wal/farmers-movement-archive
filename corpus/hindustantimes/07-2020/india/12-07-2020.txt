Relations between the two countries are based on understanding and mutual respect of each other’s interests and concerns, and the media plays a vital role in disseminating the correct information and advancing these ties, it added.Nepal’s cable TV operators had said they were irked by objectionable and derogatory references to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Chinese envoy Hou Yanqi in the media reports. One Indian news channel had suggested the premier could be “honey trapped” by the ambassador.The Chinese envoy in Kathmandu has had a series of meetings with the president and leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, including Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who are seeking the ouster of Oli. The move against Oli has come at a time when his government issued a new map showing the Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal, triggering a border row with India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-complains-to-india-over-reportage/story-CSVljdH17ID1cLqkkOzpdP.html
12-07-2020||India||India, EU to focus on multilateral order with rise of assertive China||New DelhiIndia and the European Union (EU) will focus on strengthening multilateralism during their upcoming summit this week amid uncertainty created by the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of an assertive China, people familiar with developments said on Sunday.The 15th India-EU Summit, which was delayed by the Coronavirus outbreak, will be held via video conference on July 15. The summit will be co-chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both sides felt the need to take the lead in bolstering multilateralism and cooperative international relations against the backdrop of the US ceding its leading role on the world stage.“This has created a vacuum that needs to be plugged, or else an aggressive China will only become more assertive,” one of the people cited above said. “The whole multilateral system is under stress and many experts have expressed doubts about the future of the global system.”In a blog titled “In a world of disorder, Europe needs partners” written on July 10, the EU’s high representative for foreign and security policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, noted that China has become increasingly assertive, while the Covid-19 pandemic was the first major world crisis “where the US is not in the lead” as the US administration has “mostly withdrawn from the global order it has built”.He further wrote of a “real crisis of multilateralism”, with the G7 and G20 being absent and the UN Security Council paralysed. He added: “Europe feels somewhat lonely, trying to hold the multilateral ring. For sure we know that we need partners.”Some preparatory work has already been done in this regard and external affairs minister S Jaishankar joined his European and other counterparts for a virtual meeting of the informal Alliance for Multilateralism on June 26, the people said.This alliance was launched by France and Germany in April 2019 after they felt the need to protect the rules-based multilateral order to ensure international stability and to resolve common challenges through cooperation.The alliance met in February and April before holding a virtual ministerial meeting on June 26. While participating in that meeting, Jaishankar reiterated India’s call for reformed multilateralism along with purposeful reform of existing structures so that they continue to serve the world even more in this complex and uncertain time.Jaishankar also referred to the two-pronged attack of “a viral pandemic and misinformation going viral”, and highlighted the need to strengthen scientific approaches to analyse the causes of the Covid-19 pandemic, assess multilateral health mechanisms, and take concrete steps to counter the “infodemic” in the context of a statement adopted by more than 130 states and observers on Covid-19 at the UN.The EU has already stated that multilateralism, with the UN and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core, is the cornerstone of the grouping’s foreign and security policy. As part of its efforts to strengthen multilateralism, the EU intends to act on three fronts – upholding international norms and agreements, extending multilateralism to new global realities, and reforming multilateral organisations.In a recent letter to the prime minister, European Commission President von der Leyen suggested common engagement of India and the EU for effective multilateralism and a cooperative approach to international ties, based on their shared values of democracy and pluralism.The people said India is hoping the July 15 summit can frame their partnership to preserve multilateralism and promote dialogue and cooperation to address global challenges.The external affairs ministry earlier said the summit will review India-EU cooperation in political and security relations, trade and investment, and economic cooperation. The summit is also expected to discuss developments related to the pandemic. The EU, in a statement, said the summit will be an opportunity to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two sides and to discuss cooperation in climate, environment, digital economy and connectivity.The last India-EU Summit was held in New Delhi in October 2017. The EU is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for trade in goods worth 80 billion euros in 2019 or 11.1% of total Indian trade, on par with the US and ahead of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-to-focus-on-multilateral-order-with-rise-of-assertive-china/story-2yWMVCaNVjjHsYRotmecWK.html

12-07-2020||India||India to levy taxes on measuring tapes amid dumping from China||New Delhi: India has imposed anti-dumping duty on steel and fibre glass measuring tapes and their components originating from China and other countries after finding that the Chinese products were entering India through locations such as Singapore and Cambodia to circumvent Indian laws, government officials said.The finance ministry not only imposed the anti-dumping duty on Chinese measuring tapes on July 8, but also extended it to imports from other sources so that the Chinese products are not re-routed through a third country, the officials said, requesting anonymity.As influx of measuring tapes and their components from China had been hurting the domestic industry, prompting the government to impose anti-dumping duties on them from July 9, 2015. The punitive duties would have expired on July 8.An investigation launched in December last year found that while imports of these items from China had declined after the imposition of the duties, there was a significant jump in their imports from other countries such as Singapore and Cambodia although they do not manufactures these products, the officials cited above said.The finance ministry then imposed anti-dumping duty of $1.83 per kg on steel measuring tapes and their components, and $2.56 per kg on fibre glass tapes and their components originating from China or any other country for five years from July 8, 2020, one of the officials said.The decision was taken after a thorough investigation by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) on this matter, a second official said. DGTR is a single-window agency seeking to provide a level playing field to domestic industry against unfair trade practices of countries like China.Evidence show that there are no producers in Cambodia and Singapore, and Chinese producers are apparently exporting through these countries, the official cited above said, quoting DGTR’s investigation report. HT reviewed a copy of the report.“Examination of the evidence is indicative of the fact that significant imports have been reported from Cambodia and Singapore, which are allegedly Chinese origin products,” the report said. Dumping is an unfair trade practice that entails the export of a product at a price lower than its value and is countered by a punitive duty, which is an acceptable measure under multilateral trade agreements.Mekhla Anand, partner at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas said the numerous such cases were noticed by the government that saw amendment of the Customs Tariff Rules, 1995 last year to widen the scope of anti-circumvention measures. “Anti-dumping duty measures have to be coupled with measures to prevent circumvention of the rules so as to ensure that the domestic industry is not unfairly targeted by non-domestic players,” she said.DK Aggarwal, president of the PHD Chamber of Commerce & Industry, said China had been resorting to unfair trade practices. “As a result, unfair competition from low-cost imported (Chinese) products has impacted the sentiments of domestic manufacturers, resulting in significant effect on production processes and employment creation,” he said.“Anti-dumping duties significantly help in supporting the domestic industry, however, it is not very much helpful in case of China due to its extreme unfair trade practices,” he said, adding that the government should strictly impose quality assurance norms to check import of counterfeit products.HT reported on May 11 that India could extend anti-dumping duties and safeguards on more than two dozen Chinese goods ranging from calculators and USB drives to steel, solar cells and Vitamin E amid concern that a flood of imports would kill domestic manufacturers who will lose duty protection soon against such products. Anti-dumping duties on these products were imposed five years ago and are expiring this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-levy-taxes-on-measuring-tapes-amid-dumping-from-china/story-6UgFfQ4KlgnvSyyHrshSfL.html
12-07-2020||India||Varavara Rao’s health deteriorating: Family||HyderabadThe health of poet and activist P Varavara Rao, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case, is deteriorating, his family members said on Sunday, seeking better medical aid for him. The 81-year-old is lodged in the Taloja jail in Mumbai.Rao’s wife, Hemalatha, and daughters, Sahaja, Anala and Pavana, told reporters that they were worried about his health following a phone call with him on Saturday.“He appeared to be in a state of delirium and hallucination, as he was talking about the funeral of his father and mother, the events that happened seven decades and four decades ago respectively. His co-prisoner took the phone from him and informed us that he is not able to walk, go to toilet and brush his teeth on his own. We were also told that he is always hallucinating that we, family members, were waiting at the jail gate to receive him as he was getting released,” Hemalatha said.She added that Rao’s co-prisoner also told the family that he needed immediate medical care. “The confusion, loss of memory and incoherence are the results of electrolyte imbalance and fall of Sodium and Potassium levels leading to brain damage,” Hemalatha said.She said that her husband’s health had been deteriorating ever since he was taken to JJ Hospital in Mumbai in an unconscious state on May 28. “Even as he was discharged from the hospital and sent back to jail three days later, there has been no improvement in his health. The earlier two calls on June 24 and July 2 were also worrying with his weak and muffled voice, incoherent speech and abruptly jumping into Hindi, which was quite worrying,” she said.“His life is the top most concern for us right now. Our present demand is to save his life. We demand the government to shift him to a better hospital or allow us to provide required medical care. We want to remind the government that it has no right to deny the right to life of any person, much less an undertrial prisoner,” the family members said.In April, around 40 prominent writers wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting Rao’s release in the wake of outbreak of Covid-19. Several MPs, cutting across political lines, also wrote to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with a request to provide medical care for Rao and to shift him to a hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varavara-rao-s-health-deteriorating-family/story-YRx2nzEUZnEnVMC1gD4xbO.html

They also burnt down some bikes. They had snatched away the mobile phones and threatened to kill anyone trying to phone or switch on any light. This led to information of the incident reaching the police late this (Sunday) morning,” Mahatha said.The SP added that the CPI (Maoist) extremists were led by Central Committee member (CCM) Misir Besra and assisted by area commander Mocchu. There were some women members in the group who beat up women guard officers, the officer said. “We are talking to senior forest officials to shift the employees and over a dozen families to the Chaibasa Township for their security,” added Mahatha. Police and CRPF have launched intense operations in Sarjamburu-Sangajata forests where another CCM-cum-Politburo member Prashant Bose alias Kshan-da has been camping ever since Maoists shifted their eastern region bureau from Saranda forests to Sarjamburu. “They have also pasted posters denouncing the Forest Right Act and calling upon the innocent tribal villagers to join and intensify the armed struggle to drive away the forest officials to secure their rights on jal, jangal and jameen (water, forest and land). They have been asking the village heads to send youths to join their ranks and kill police and SPOs. This is another ploy to incite villagers against forest officials, another government apparatus. They want to create a free buffer zone bereft of any police and administrative presence to have complete domination over the area and villagers under their reign of terror,” said the SP.Kolhan DIG Rajiv Ranjan said this was old tactics of the Maoists. “Whenever they lose their foothold and become organizationally weak, they blow up schools, panchayat buildings, health centres, forest offices and guest houses to spread panic, protect their levy network. They are asking villagers to send their sons and daughters to join ranks because they have lost many extremists and control over the villagers. I appeal to the people to ponder who actually benefited from these so-called misleading fights for jal, jangal and jameen,” said Ranjan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-blow-up-several-buildings-of-jharkhand-forest-dept-torch-cars-bikes/story-eE7N4QJcn8T2qGjiP7NTJK.html

On a regular interval, he used to convert the cash into Rs 500 or Rs 1,000, he said.All the three were not aware of the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 5,000 currencies, he maintained.Somu said he has sent a memorandum to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami to help his family.Police said they would inquire into the matter. In a similar case last year, two elderly sisters in neighbouring Tirupur district found their live-time savings of Rs 46,000 were in the demonetised Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes.However, District Collector K Vijayakarthikeyan played the role of a good samaritan and had arranged for old-age pension for Thangammal (78) and Rangammal (75).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visually-impaired-couple-find-savings-of-rs-24-000-in-demonetised-currencies-in-tamil-nadu/story-z6IYQbjQf4SC9iYG2PGowO.html
12-07-2020||India||India-EU Summit to focus on multilateral order in face of increasingly assertive China||India and the European Union (EU) will focus on strengthening multilateralism during their upcoming summit this week amid uncertainty created by the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of an assertive China, people familiar with developments said on Sunday.The 15th India-EU Summit, which was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak, will be held via video conference on July 15. The summit will be co-chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both sides felt the need to take the lead in bolstering multilateralism and cooperative international relations against the backdrop of the US ceding its leading role on the world stage.“This has created a vacuum that needs to be plugged, or else an aggressive China will only become more assertive,” one of the people cited above said. “The whole multilateral system is under stress and many experts have expressed doubts about the future of the global system.”In a blog titled “In a world of disorder, Europe needs partners” written on July 10, the EU’s high representative for foreign and security policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, noted that China has become increasingly assertive, while the Covid-19 pandemic was the first major world crisis “where the US is not in the lead” as the US administration has “mostly withdrawn from the global order it has built”.He further wrote of a “real crisis of multilateralism”, with the G7 and G20 being absent and the UN Security Council paralysed. He added: “Europe feels somewhat lonely, trying to hold the multilateral ring. For sure we know that we need partners.”Some preparatory work has already been done in this regard and external affairs minister S Jaishankar joined his European and other counterparts for a virtual meeting of the informal Alliance for Multilateralism on June 26, the people said.This alliance was launched by France and Germany in April 2019 after they felt the need to protect the rules-based multilateral order to ensure international stability and to resolve common challenges through cooperation.The alliance met in February and April before holding a virtual ministerial meeting on June 26. While participating in that meeting, Jaishankar reiterated India’s call for reformed multilateralism along with purposeful reform of existing structures so that they continue to serve the world even more in this complex and uncertain time.Jaishankar also referred to the two-pronged attack of “a viral pandemic and misinformation going viral”, and highlighted the need to strengthen scientific approaches to analyse the causes of the Covid-19 pandemic, assess multilateral health mechanisms, and take concrete steps to counter the “infodemic” in the context of a statement adopted by more than 130 states and observers on Covid-19 at the UN.The EU has already stated that multilateralism, with the UN and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core, is the cornerstone of the grouping’s foreign and security policy. As part of its efforts to strengthen multilateralism, the EU intends to act on three fronts – upholding international norms and agreements, extending multilateralism to new global realities, and reforming multilateral organisations.In a recent letter to the prime minister, European Commission President von der Leyen suggested common engagement of India and the EU for effective multilateralism and a cooperative approach to international ties, based on their shared values of democracy and pluralism.The people said India is hoping the July 15 summit can frame their partnership to preserve multilateralism and promote dialogue and cooperation to address global challenges.The external affairs ministry earlier said the summit will review India-EU cooperation in political and security relations, trade and investment, and economic cooperation. The summit is also expected to discuss developments related to the pandemic. The EU, in a statement, said the summit will be an opportunity to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two sides and to discuss cooperation in climate, environment, digital economy and connectivity.The last India-EU Summit was held in New Delhi in October 2017. The EU is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for trade in goods worth 80 billion euros in 2019 or 11.1% of total Indian trade, on par with the US and ahead of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-summit-to-focus-on-multilateral-order-in-face-of-increasingly-assertive-china/story-fKtuFbti9en3gXQ47NssaI.html

That order was also made through the fast track procedure (FTP) prescribed in India’s defence procurement rules.ALSO WATCH: Explained | Missiles, fighter jets: How India’s boosting forces amid China rowThe Sig Sauer rifles are being bought to meet the army’s requirement of a total of 8 lakh assault rifles, said a second official. The new assault rifles will gradually replace the flaw-ridden 5.56mm INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) rifles inducted around 22 years ago.The remaining requirements of the army will be met through a Make in India project for the local production of AK-203 assault rifles at Amethi’s Korwa, and this procurement is in its final stage with a committee ironing out pricing issues, said a third person.The FTP can be invoked in cases where “undue/unforeseen delay” in buying weapons is seen to be adversely impacting the military’s capacity and preparedness.According to rules, weapons sought under the FTP should already be in the military’s armoury, have been trial evaluated or be in service in foreign militaries so that the time required for evaluation is minimised.India has also ordered more stocks of Excalibur precision guided munitions from the US for its artillery guns, while Russia assured swifter delivery of weapons and ammunition during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to Moscow last month.Indian, Chinese commanders to meet this weekA fourth meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders is expected to take place along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh this week. Both sides are working on finalising the date, officials said. The military talks between corps commander-ranked officers are expected to focus on the critical Finger Area and the strategic Depsang plains. The next phase of the complex disengagement process is expected to begin after the fourth round of talks, the officials said. Previous military talks on June 30, set the stage for disengagement in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-to-order-72-000-assault-rifles-from-united-states-amid-border-row/story-1VBWcld6EDwOxe279f3n3H.html

12-07-2020||India||I-T dept’s utility helps banks, post offices ascertain TDS rates on cash withdrawals||The Income Tax Department on Sunday notified facilitating a new functionality for banks and post offices to help them ascertain the applicability rates of Tax Deducted on Source (TDS) on cash withdrawal of above Rs 20 lakh in case of a person who hasn’t filed income tax return and that of above Rs 1 crore in case income tax return has been filed.Under this facility, the bank or post office will now only have to enter the PAN of the person who is withdrawing cash for ascertaining the applicable rate of TDS. On entering PAN, a message will be instantly displayed on the departmental utility: “TDS is deductible at the rate of 2% if cash withdrawal exceeds Rs. 1 crore” [if the person withdrawing cash is a filer of the income-tax return] and “TDS is deductible at the rate 2% if cash withdrawal exceeds Rs. 20 lakh and at the rate of 5% if it exceeds Rs. 1 Crore” [if the person withdrawing cash is a non-filer of the income-tax return]”, according to the notification issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).CBDT said that this functionality available as “Verification of applicability u/s 194N” on the income tax department website www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in since 1st July 2020, is also available to the banks through web-services so that the entire process can be automated and be linked to the bank’s internal core banking solution.Data on cash withdrawal has shown that large amounts of cash is being withdrawn by people who have never filed income tax returns. Therefore, to discourage cash transactions, keep track of cash withdrawals by non-filers, increase tax compliance and curb black money, the government changed TDS rules for making cash withdrawals from banks and post offices from this month.As per the amended Income Tax Act, which came into effect from July 1, 2020, the threshold of cash withdrawal has been further lowered to Rs 20 lakh for the applicability of this TDS for the non-filers and also mandated TDS at the higher rate of 5% on cash withdrawal exceeding Rs. 1 crore by the non-filers.The CBDT note said that so far, more than 53,000 verification requests have been executed successfully on the new facility provided to banks and post offices by the income tax department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-t-dept-provides-utility-to-banks-post-offices-to-ascertain-tds-applicability-rates-on-cash-withdrawals/story-GSgxoMYgZqT2DpsHH12bQL.html

It is only after a project becomes successful you get your identity,” says the actor who had been part of hit show such as ‘Mirzapur’ and film such as ‘India’s Most Wanted’. “But my role was not much noticed before Jamtara,” says the actor over phone. Lucknow has played an important role in his journey as he his first major show ‘Mirzapur’ was shot here. “Season two of Mirzapur and my upcoming film ‘Pagglait’, which stars Sanya Malhotra have also been shot in Lucknow,” he says while insisting that he plays bigger and significant roles in both the web series and the film.“This year has been a tough for everyone, including myself, but career-wise it surely has given me a lot. Having said that, I will still say, ‘mera kaam utna important nahi hai jitni logon ki jaan (my work is not more important than lives of people,” says the actor who belongs to Nimbahera in Chittorgarh district. “My brother Imran was topper and me his opposite — to the extent that I failed in Class 3. My first artistic work was participating in school’s musical prayer on annual day where I played Congo. I grabbed a small role in a play, which was rejected my many.”His journey began with comedian Raju Srivastava’s ‘shaadiwallah’ stand-up act in 2003. “I was so impressed with the show that I took part in a stand-up comedy competition where I won the first prize. Winning the prize motivated me and started participating in events,” he says.After his father expired he started doing small jobs. “In 2010, I convinced my mother (Firdaus) and I went to Mumbai to become an actor. To sustain, I started working as waiter at a hotel. After few months, when I was working in the kitchen department, we had a party which was Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor’s reception. First time I saw film stars and Mr (Amitabh) Bachchan. Soon after, I left that job, started working in a mall and giving auditions. I was told to learn acting and do theatre,” he recalls.He went to Jaipur and joined a theatre group. “For 6 years I did theatre which became my passion. For a NSD group I did ‘Midnight Summer Dream’ for which I travelled all over India.” He returned to Mumbai and joined Abhishek Banerjee and Anmol Ahuja’s casting company. “I did casting for a year. Abhishek is my mentor and friend. If I am stuck anywhere, my first phone call is always to him. I did ‘Humorously Yours-2’ and ‘Pataal Lok with him.”Aasif also did cameo in films ‘Toilet Ek Prem Katha’, ‘Pari’ and ‘India’s Most Wanted.’“My life experiences are coming very handy. I have a large ‘emotion bank’ of my struggle period which I try to bring out in my roles.

12-07-2020||India||At loggerheads with Ashok Gehlot, Sachin Pilot is angry. Here’s why||Three days ago, Rajasthan plunged into a political crisis when Special Operations Group (SOG) registered a case of sedition in an alleged attempt to topple the Ashok Gehlot government. The FIR was based on interception of two mobile phones. Two people, whose numbers were intercepted, have been arrested and the SOG has issued notices to Gehlot, deputy chief minister Sachin deputy Pilot, chief whip Mahesh Joshi and some legislators to record their statements in the case.Pilot left for Delhi on Friday and at least seven Congress legislators also reached the capital at different times. All of them are first-time MLAs. The presence of Pilot and Congress MLAs in Delhi fuelled speculations that there was an attempt to topple CM Gehlot but people close to Pilot said the deputy CM went to bargain hard with the party leadership because he felt sidelined in the state government.ALSO WATCH | Rajasthan political thriller: Gehlot-Pilot tussle, SOG probe, resort politicsAlso read: Ashok Gehlot marginalised Pilot, Congress failed to settle issues in RajasthanThe problem with them started after Congress won the December 2018 Assembly elections and instead of Pilot, who had steered the party to victory, Gehlot was named the CM. After that, both of them have targeted each other in a subtle manner, without naming each other.The latest trigger was the issue of the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief. Pilot has been party president in the state for a long time and there’s talk of appointing someone else on the post to follow ‘one person, one post’ rule. People close to Pilot say he wants either his man in the saddle after him or an important portfolio.Before this, during the recent bureaucratic reshuffle of IAS and IPS officers, political commentators said Pilot didn’t get even a single officer of his choice posted. “Forget about IAS and IPS officers, he cannot even get a BDO (Block Development Officer) transferred or posted,” said one of the commentators who didn’t want to be named.Also read: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot to meet party lawmakers tonightThe buzz in the state bureaucratic circles is that Pilot has differences with bureaucrats in his departments, especially in the public works department (PWD). Political appointments are also due in the state and Pilot, obviously, wants some of his people accommodated.But, there has been friction between the two top leaders since the time of the government formation, which had led to a delay in the formation of the state government. The Congress party leaders said that after much persuasion, Pilot was able to get the post of deputy chief minister and some important departments. Pilot also had to bargain a lot to get some ministerial berths for legislators considered close to him.Since the government was formed in 2018, Gehlot and Pilot had been at loggerheads. Both Gehlot and Pilot have passed comments against each other without taking each other’s names on several occasions. Pilot had questioned his own government over the death of 107 children in a government-run hospital in Kota and had also repeatedly raised the issue of no meeting of the coordination committee constituted by Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to iron out differences between him and Gehlot. Political analyst Narayan Bareth said that there is a process in the political system and you have to invest time and hard work to reach a post. “Sachin Pilot is angry because he wants a lot of things in very less time. He is the state party chief, deputy chief minister holding various portfolios. Just like party invested in Ashok Gehlot, the Congress is also investing in Pilot,” Bareth said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-political-tussle-why-is-sachin-pilot-angry/story-6SViC35e5uATeqvCnY1EbJ.html

It was claimed that Dubey tried to escape after one of the vehicles which was part of the convoy overturned.ALSO READ | Vikas Dubey was hit on his chest, arm as he tried to escape from police: Report“After being chased by the police team, he was asked to surrender but he did not and started firing with the intention of killing them. The police team fired back in self-defence after which Vikas Dubey was injured. He was taken to a hospital, where he died during treatment,” Kanpur Police said in a statement.On July 3 - the day eight policemen were killed - two of Dubey’s associates, Prem Prakash Pandey and Atul Dubey, were killed by the police in an encounter in Kanpur. On July 8, the police killed another aide, Amar Dubey, who carried a reward of Rs 50,000, in Maudaha village in Hamirpur district.On July 9, two more aides, Prabhat Mishra and Praveen alias Bauwa Dubey, wanted in connection with the Kanpur ambush, were killed in separate encounters in Kanpur and Etawah districts.Sharma and Sirohi submitted before the Supreme Court that an investigation by UP police will not be fair and impartial and has asked the top court to transfer the case to CBI or any other independent investigating agency.The petitioners also prayed that a direction should be issued to the UP Police that interrogation of Sharma should happen at Mati Jail, Kanpur Dehat in UP where Sharma is currently lodged and that he should not be taken outside the Mati jail.“Rule of law is supreme in the country and every accused has a right to fair trial guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Thus, the petitioners are seeking protection of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution,” the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cop-accused-of-tipping-off-vikas-dubey-moves-sc-for-security-cbi-probe/story-pheKfQVDhv2Q4pLYA7CKLL.html
12-07-2020||India||First time in history, Jammu and Kashmir gives skip to martyrs’ day||For the first time since 1948, there will be no holiday and official functions to commemorate martyrs’ day in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.“In December last year, the list of gazetted holidays had no mention of martyrs’ day on July 13 and December 5, the birth anniversary of former J&K Prime Minister Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah. Therefore, the question doesn’t arise of holding any official function or declaring a holiday on Monday,” said a senior official.Following the revocation of Article 370 on August 5 last year, the government had issued a list of gazette holidays for the newly carved union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. However, July 13 and December 5 were omitted from the list inviting an outcry by the Kashmir centric parties.Also read: Authorities order partial lockdown in parts of Srinagar due to spike in Covid-19 casesThe then prime minister of J&K, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, had declared July 13 as martyrs’ day in memory of those who revolted against the Dogra rule on July 13, 1931. Twenty-two people were killed in the protest against the then Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh.While Kashmir commemorated the day as martyrs’ day and chief minister, ministers and DGPs used to pay tributes at the official programmes across the then state of J&K, in recent years Jammu had started observing it as a ‘black’ day.Pro-Jammu parties used to hold protest rallies wearing black armbands to express their resentment against the decision of successive Kashmir centric governments.The parties also included Kashmiri Pandits, who called July 13, 1931, as the first-ever communal attack on religious minorities in J&K.In the new list of gazette holidays, the government, however, declared October 26 as a gazetted holiday. On this day in 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh had signed the “Instrument of Accession” with the dominion of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-time-in-history-jammu-and-kashmir-gives-skip-to-martyrs-day/story-NtlNiC2NXnUjw50LQys3DK.html
12-07-2020||India||Indian online grocery market can exceed USD 3 bn sales in 2020: Goenka||The Indian online grocery market could exceed sales of USD 3 billion (about Rs 22,500 crore) in 2020, a substantial 76 per cent jump over the previous year, Spencer’s Retail Chairman Sanjiv Goenka said.  The preference for online delivery of products became more visible following the Covid-19 outbreak, he added. Spencer’s Retail, part of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka (RPSG) Group, had acquired online supermarket and grocery store Nature’s Basket in July 2019. Consumers opted to buy essentials and other products from home in a bigger way than they had done in the past, he said. “The result is that India’s online grocery market could exceed USD 3 billion in sales in 2020, a substantial 76 per cent increase over the previous year following a demand spike for the home delivery of fresh produce,” Goenka said in his address to shareholders in the company’s Annual Report for 2019-20. With increased access to smartphones and low data costs, shoppers now prefer an omni-channel shopping experience, he added. Spencers Retail is attractively positioned to capitalise on the omni-channel opportunity, he said. “The company did not just respond to this sectoral inflexion point with a relevant mobile application and home delivery; it invested in enhancing proximity to consumers through phone call-based delivery, Chatbots and WhatsApp-driven product delivery using its stores as hubs,” Goenka said. Besides, the retail chain collaborated with Uber and other delivery partners for product supply, strengthening its last-mile capability. According to Spencer’s Retail CEO Devendra Chawla, the company’s online business experienced a milestone in FY20 where it not only consistently scaled the number of monthly active users but also positively turned around its unit-level economics. “Our unit-level economics grew 45 per cent with a substantial increase of 125 per cent in our registered customer base. On the overall, the number of orders grew 175 per cent, which helped us significantly moderate delivery costs,” he said. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the company operated 90 per cent of its stores across the country “We will accelerate our transformation and deepen our relevance,” said Goenka. “We believe that our competitiveness will be derived from omni-channel consumer access, judicious store rollout, distinctive positioning in the minds of our consumers, a balance of lifestyle and essential products, a shift towards nonfood & apparel in the product mix.” Headquartered in Kolkata, Spencer’s Retail operates 191 stores (including Nature’s Basket) of various formats in 42 cities. Spencer’s Retail posted a revenue of Rs 2,373.29 crore in FY 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-online-grocery-market-can-exceed-usd-3-bn-sales-in-2020-goenka/story-4qhkMBm2pnlQqm7Pcoo5TN.html
12-07-2020||India||SC to deliver verdict on 9-year long Padmanabha Swamy temple management case tomorrow||After a nine-year legal battle, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court will deliver its verdict over the management of the Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram, one of the richest shrines in the world, on Monday.Devotees are upbeat as they hope uncertainty over the management of the temple will be over facilitating smooth functioning of the shrine. A spokesperson of the royal family also expressed confidence that a favourable verdict will be given to preserve the age-old shrine.“Sanctity of the temple is supreme. We hope everything will be settled,” said Velayudhan Nair, a regular at the temple for 52 years. The Fort Association of Residents, an umbrella organisation comprising devotees around the temple, is also upbeat.The temple shot to fame after an estimated wealth of Rs one lakh crore was unearthed during the SC-ordered inventory from one of the subaltern vaults of the sixth century temple in 2011. After this the number of visitors increased manifold and it turned into a major pilgrimage and tourism spot in south India.The erstwhile royal family of Travancore had moved the apex court in 2011 against the High Court order that handed over the temple management and assets to the state government. The apex court had later stayed the HC verdict and ordered the inventorying of the temple.When one of the secret vaults was opened in 2011, treasure estimated at Rs one lakh crore was found. There are six chambers-- later coded A to F-- under the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. Of these, two are usually opened during the daily pooja and two twice a year and the remaining two (A&B) are secret vaults.The second secret chamber “B” is yet to be opened and devotees and temple officials claim it may contain more wealth than the “A” vault. But the erstwhile royals, former custodians of the temple, opposed it strongly saying “it was against tantric customs and rituals and may bring trouble to the city which originated from the name of the presiding deity” (Thiru Ananatha Puram-- the land of Sree Padmanabha, Lord Vishnu).During the hearing both the state government and the royal family had said they had no claim over the wealth found in one of the vaults as it belonged to the deity and the temple. The sixth century Vishnu temple was believed to be rebuilt by then King Marthanda Varma who defeated Dutch colonizers in the Battle of Colachal in 1741. The legend goes that after he won the war he dedicated his victory to the presiding deity and ruled the kingdom as ‘Padmanabha dasan’ (servant of Lord Padmanabha).A retired IPS officer T P Sundararajan, a staunch devotee, was the first to move the court in 2008, alleging large-scale pilferage at the temple. He claimed that many precious ornaments and jewels were smuggled out replacing them with lookalikes. Later the case was moved to High Court which handed over the management to the state government. While staying the HC order in 2011, the Supreme Court had ordered inventorying and later divested the royal family from managing temple affairs and formed an apex body to run the temple till the final verdict. In 2012, Sundararajan died while inventorying was half-way through.As the legal battle prolonged there were suggestions to preserve the wealth of the temple, now manned by a battalion of commandos. During the earlier NDA regime, Minister of State for Tourism K J Alphons mooted a high-security museum to keep the treasure.He had called on the royal family with an idea to build a Rs 300 crore underground museum near the temple. He assured the Centre will bear all expenses for the world-class museum and convert it into a major attraction of the country but the royals were not moved. With the final settlement round the corner, many feel there will be a decision on the wealth as well, lying in underground vaults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-deliver-verdict-on-9-year-long-padmanabha-swamy-temple-management-case-tomorrow/story-Rh6xbtCYoHoTP1LnBFiVeP.html
12-07-2020||India||Finance Ministry amends rules to disallow global firms from govt contracts up to Rs 200 cr||The Finance Ministry has amended rules for all government procurement disallowing global firms from participating in tenders up to Rs 200 crore, a move that is in line with the ‘Atamnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (self-reliant India) economic stimulus package announced in mid-May.“Now, no Global Tender Enquiry (GTE) shall be invited for tenders up to Rs 200 crore, unless prior approval is obtained from Cabinet Secretariat,” the ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The move aims to benefit domestic micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), it added.The statement was issued after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman reviewed implementation of various announcements of the Rs 20 lakh crore package that related to ministries of finance and corporate affairs. Sitharaman is also minister for corporate affairs.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an address to the nation on May 12, had announced about the financial package to stimulate Covid-19 pandemic-hit economy following which the finance minister unveiled details of the package in five-tranches from May 13 to May 17, 2020. While announcing the last tranche of the package on May 17, Sitharaman had said the Centre had also accepted the demand of states to raise their borrowing limit from 3% of their respective GSDP to 5% that would give them additional resources of Rs 4.28 lakh crore at this time of Covid-19 crisis. The increased limit was, however, conditional and depended on implementation of reforms by them in four areas — one-nation-one-ration-card, ease of doing business, power distribution and urban local body revenues, she had said.Sunday’s statement by the finance ministry also issued a formal communication to state governments raising their borrowing limits by 2% of their projected gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 2020-21 subject to implementation of specific state-level reforms, the statement said.In order to give relief to contractors, the department of expenditure (DoE), an arm of the finance ministry, has issued instructions to central agencies such as railways, ministry of road transport and highways and Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to give them additional time up to six months for completion of contractual obligations, it said.Giving details of the Rs 3 lakh crore collateral-free automatic loans for businesses, including MSMEs, it said loans worth Rs 1.20 lakh crore have been sanctioned under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and moans worth Rs 61,987 crore have been disbursed. “Fund was registered on 26.05.2020. In a short period of about one and half months noticeable progress has been achieved in identifying units, sanctioning as well as disbursing of loans to MSMEs,” it said.The package also announced a Rs 45,000 crore Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme to strengthen non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and micro finance institutions (MFIs), where the Union government would provide 20% first loss sovereign guarantee to public sector banks. “Banks have approved purchase of a portfolio of Rs 14,000 crore and are currently in process of approval/negotiations for Rs 6,000 crore as on July 3, 2020,” the statement said.It said that Rs 24,876.87 crore has been disbursed to small and marginal farmers as on July 6, as a special facility for kharif sowing. The scheme envisages Rs 30,000 crore additional emergency working capital funding to farmers through the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).The statement said the Central Board of Direct taxes (CBDT) had already issued refunds in over 20.44 lakh cases amounting to more than Rs. 62,361 crore between April 8 and June 30. “Remaining refunds are under process,” it added.It said the ministry of corporate affairs is finalising a special insolvency resolution to provide relief to the MSMEs and the same would be notified soon.Reacting to the finance ministry’s Sunday notification, Ranen Banerjee, leader - Economic Advisory Services at consultancy firm PwC India, said that there is a need to speed up the disbursements under the guaranteed collateral free loans as it is still under 25% of the allocated Rs 3 lakh crore.“The additional borrowing limit to the states is conditional. It will have to be seen how many states are able to move quickly to be able to meet the conditions. Some states may not need the additional limits as they have been constrained in their ability to spend,” he said.The government has moved fast in putting the necessary notifications and guidelines in place, he said. “It will now be for the implementing agencies to demonstrate the urgency. The actions clearly work in progress and we need to move fast with the approvals and disbursements under the various liquidity measures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finance-ministry-amends-rules-to-disallow-global-firms-from-govt-contracts-up-to-rs-200-cr/story-MpMq6Trz5sD5fyC4fBGKUM.html
12-07-2020||India||CCTV monitoring, powerless water coolers on trains soon as Railways to launch 20 in-house innovations||The Railway Board has decided to implement 20 innovations by its employees to make train journeys safer and improve passenger comfort - such as a bell warning to alert travellers minutes before a train departs, real-time CCTV monitoring inside coaches, printing of unreserved tickets through mobile applications - on a mass scale.The Railways launched a dedicated portal in 2018 to solicit the good ideas attempted by its employees across zones, aiming to implement some of them across its network. Since then, zonal railways have uploaded their entries on the web portal.From September 2018 to December 2019, the portal received 2,645 entries.Of which, the Board has identified 20 for initial mass scale implementation across the railway network, according to an order issued by it on July 10.An official said that an order has been issued to all zonal general managers and production units to gear up for the implementation of these ideas.Most of the 20 innovations are aimed at technical improvements to boost safety.The North Central Railway has developed a vehicular system for ultrasonic flaw detection of rails, which is currently done manually. The Malda division of Eastern Railway has used pyrometers to monitor speed and temperature of tracks. The carriage and wagon department of Allahabad division of North Central Railway has developed a detector for hot axle box in running trains much before a possible derailment due to seizure.Some of the innovations are also directed at passenger comfort.The Western Railway has developed natural water coolers, with zero electric consumption, each at a cost of Rs 1.25 lakh and a lifespan of ten years. The system works on principle of heat transfer where water is passed through copper coils which are covered with cooling fabric active through a water dripping system. These coolers have been installed at Borivali, Dahanu Road, Nandurbar, Udhana and Bandra railway stations.A bell system -- developed by Allahabad division -- alerts passengers at platforms that the train is ready to depart within two minutes and they should occupy their seats. This is already in use on platform number one of Allahabad junction railway station.On the list is also a system to monitor real-time CCTV footage on board trains. While the coaches in Humsafar trains have CCTV surveillance, the footage is not monitored in real time. The NCR has developed a system for real-time monitoring inside trains and has installed it in all 18 coaches of Humsafar trains.The CCTV display unit is provided in the guard’s compartment and the videos can be recorded and viewed later; it is aimed at quick resolution of crimes on board trains.Another innovation the Railways is looking at is air quality monitoring equipment developed by NCR and installed at Allahabad railway station.With the coronavirus pandemic encouraging people to go contact-less, the Northern Railway developed a system through which they issued unreserved tickets through mobile apps and bluetooth printers.This pilot project helped Railways to open online UTS ticketing counters at stations, platforms, tent cities and passenger holding areas without UTS connectivity and uninterrupted power supply as these devices work on lithium-ion batteries and SIM cards.The Railway Board has instructed the zones to furnish implementation reports of these 20 innovations within the next three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cctv-monitoring-powerless-water-coolers-on-trains-soon-as-railways-to-launch-20-in-house-innovations/story-pd0iXJfwKo4mJsG87tm7CK.html

12-07-2020||India||Not a conducive time for polls; impose President’s Rule if needed: Tejashwi Yadav||Leader of Opposition in the Bihar assembly, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)’s young face, Tejashwi Yadav will encounter his biggest political challenge in the upcoming state assembly polls he has to contest in the absence of his incarcerated father, Lalu Prasad. He spoke about the political landscape in an interview:1) Is the ground situation conducive for free and fair polls in Bihar, given the pandemic? A: On Covid-19, I have been requesting the government since March that testing be done on larger scale and the capacity of institutional care be enhanced. However, it fell on deaf ears. The abject failure of the Nitish government in handling the pandemic and the migrant workers issue has led to chaos and insecurity among the people. There seems to be no containment and mitigation strategy in place. Bihar is worst hit and health experts fear countless deaths primarily because of the abysmally low testing and dilapidated medical infrastructure. In my opinion, this is not the appropriate time to conduct elections considering the alarming spread of this disease. I will be the last person to have an election on dead bodies. If Nitish Kumar acknowledges that Covid is still a crisis, elections can be postponed until the situation improves but if he thinks Covid is not a problem, elections must be conducted with traditional means of electioneering. Let there be a fair ground for all parties, and allow rallies, door-to-door and full-fledged campaigns. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United) are parties of capitalists and have immense resources. (So) restricting the medium of campaign would be antithetical to the very purpose of election in a democracy. President rule could be a stop-gap interim arrangement if constitutional obligation requires it.​​​​2) Is the RJD ready to contest if elections are held on time? How prepared are you to reach out virtually to the electorate?A: RJD’s campaign will not be about spending big monies. We will enter the election with principled-politics that speaks to the marginalised and the poor in a down to earth manner. Our campaign will not be a spectacle, it’ll be based on genuine communication of our plans rooted in the aspirations of the people. We shall go to the people with a robust blue-print for transforming Bihar in education, health, agriculture, employment and industrialisation.The political wisdom of the people from my state is unmatched. They are fed up with the ever rising corruption, crimes, unemployment, inflation and flip-flops of Nitish Ji. Yes, it’s going to be a challenge to switch to virtual canvassing. For poor parties like us and others, who don’t have money to pay for such huge expenditures to counter them, it would be unfair and amount to robbery of democracy and mandate. Sensing defeat, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has started tweaking the rulebook of Election Commission (EC). Postal ballots for Covid patients, virtual rallies and all should be seen in that context. Physical canvassing helps in understanding the problem and needs of the voters as its more interactive.3) The RJD-led alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls could win only one seat that was in the Congress quota. So there are questions about the combine’s viability. A: Parliamentary and assembly elections are two different things. Issues and circumstances are different. Assembly elections are fought on local day to day governance issues concerning the people’s basic needs: education, migration, infrastructure development, job creation, and of course, health. Despite the machinations at the BJP-JD-U’s disposal, our alliance will sweep this election. This ruling combine can’t always fool and cheat the people with false promises and by fomenting fears. They have pushed Bihar further into backwardness in their 15 years of rule. Everyone in Bihar knows how the mandate was hijacked in 2017 (when Nitish walked out on RJD). The BJP is in power with Nitishji without any reason and vision.4) Some of your smaller allies including Jitan Ram Manjhi have reservations about your projection as the combine’s chief ministerial face. You also have detractors in the Congress’s state unit.A: This is not the time to be bogged down with such considerations. We must have credible plans for a historical alternative for Bihar. Democratic politics is nothing without such pushes and pulls. Only a delusional person can think that he has no opposition or no detractors. My eyes and mind are all open. In any alliance, it’s a settled principle that the party having a larger presence is chosen its leader.5) How confident are you of keeping the alliance intact? Have you had talks with Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders to expedite an electoral pact?A: Consultation and deliberation on seat sharing and common minimum program are underway. I am confident of bringing together a credible, committed and progressive alliance. Anyone familiar with the history of RJD knows that we have a stellar record of building alliances. Laluji facilitated the most historic, progressive alliances that gave alternatives in politics. But it’s important to note that the RJD has been equally comfortable in the opposition. We never climbed into any “winning permutation”, we never abandoned our principles in exchange of morsels of power. 6) You recently sought forgiveness for mistakes, if any, during the 15 year rule (from 1990-2005) of your father and mother. Is that your way of reaching out to forward caste communities with whom your party has a history of troubled relations? The question’s pertinent as Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, an old colleague of your father recently quit as vice president of RJD.A: No person or regime can be perfect. If anyone thinks he’s perfect, he is mistaken. Our 15 years took governance to the doorsteps of the poor and marginalised. That’s why the people rewarded us for 15 years. I wasn’t around then, still I don’t hesitate to accept shortfalls if there were any.One needs to understand the history of Bihar which has been a victim of chronic neglect. The problems are many and difficult to tackle. Laluji and Rabriji privileged social justice in a deeply feudal society. A sense of equality, a possibility of egalitarian governance was communicated to the people.We are committed to reaching out to all sections of the society. Bihar cannot progress if all communities do not participate. Raghuwansh Babu is a senior leader and a fatherly figure to me. He is there in the party. But will Nitishji tender apology for the mandate he violated before the 2014 polls and by walking out on the RJD in 2017? Will he seek forgiveness for 55 scams, the Muzaffarpur shelter home case, the migrants’ issue, highest unemployment and deteriorating education, health and law and order in Bihar?7) The regret you qualified with an IF is seen also in the context of chief minister Nitish Kumar’s challenge to debate his 15 years with those of your party’s rule.A: Nitish Kumar is such a winning face that in his entire life he hasn’t ever fought elections on his own. Why doesn’t he fight alone and see the result of his 15 years of rule? Let him showcase his achievements if he has any and seek mandate. The fact that he constantly talks about the predecessor government is a testament that he has nothing to talk about his own performance. He should explain as to why Bihar ranks the lowest on all indicators of NITI Aayog, NHM and other evaluating agencies. Can we progress if we constantly talk of the past? I would not let fear mongering drive the upcoming election.8) In the 2015 elections, you had your father by your side and Nitish Kumar on your side. Now Nitish is with BJP and you have to make do without Lalu Yadav’s real-time presence in the campaign. The odds seem daunting….A: Laluji is always with us. His guidance comes not just from his words in real time but from his principles and his example. The magnitude of the task is big but I’m not alone. I belong to a party of people who stood their ground in the era of horse-trading. I belong to a generation of young people who are inspired by his brand of Laluwadi politics.Lalu Ji’s absence is something which can never be compensated but as party workers we have his blessings, motivation and guidance. We have taken the resolve to fight and win this election as a tribute to the sufferings Lalu Ji is made to go through by this fascist government. I am confident that the resilience, hard work and passion of each RJD worker would bear fruit in the upcoming polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-conducive-time-for-polls-impose-president-s-rule-if-needed-tejashwi-yadav/story-KLflIHjhjNm66Twq35605O.html

The DGTR is a single-window agency providing a level-playing field to domestic industry against unfair trade practices of countries like China.“Evidence show there are no producers in Cambodia and Singapore, and Chinese producers are apparently exporting through these countries,” the official said quoting DGTR’s investigation report. HT reviewed the report.“The examination of the evidence is indicative of the fact that significant imports have been reported from Cambodia and Singapore, which are allegedly Chinese origin products,” the report said. Dumping is an unfair trade practice that entails the export of a product at a price lower than its value and is countered by a punitive duty, which is an acceptable measure under multilateral trade agreements.Mekhla Anand, partner at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said numerous such cases were noticed by the government that saw amendment of the Customs Tariff Rules, 1995 last year to widen the scope of anti-circumvention measures. “Antidumping duty measures have to be coupled with measures to prevent circumvention of the rules so as to ensure that the domestic industry is not unfairly targeted by non-domestic players,” she said.DK Aggarwal, president at the PHD Chamber of Commerce & Industry said that China has been resorting to unfair trade practices. “As a result, unfair competition from low cost imported (Chinese) products has impacted the sentiments of domestic manufacturers, resulting in significant effect on production processes and employment creation,” he said.“Anti-dumping duties significantly help in supporting the domestic industry, however, it is not very much helpful in case of China due to its extreme unfair trade practices,” he said, adding that the government should strictly impose quality assurance norms to check the import of counterfeit products.On May 11, HT reported that India could extend anti-dumping duties and safeguards on more than two dozen Chinese goods ranging from calculators and USB drives to steel, solar cells and vitamin E amid concern that a flood of imports would kill domestic manufacturers who will lose duty protection soon against such products. Anti-dumping duties on these products were imposed five years ago and are expiring this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-imposes-levy-on-all-imported-measuring-tapes-as-chinese-dumping-continues-via-third-countries/story-HSR5eKcZNjYvrntAq3JSsN.html

With passing time, that role changed to performing the last rites of people who lost their lives in road mishaps and their bodies were not claimed.Amid these pandemic-ravaged times, the organisation continues to serve the city quietly and selflessly to grant dignity to the dead.For three years, urns containing the ashes of the unknown are preserved with the organisation before they are immersed in the Ganga at Soron, near Kasganj. Even for Covid-19 fatalities, Kshetra Bajaja retains the ashes of the dead so that if a bereaved next of kin turns up, they may be handed over the ashes of their loved one.Also read: Kejriwal says Delhi is able to minimise Covid-19 deaths due to ‘protective shield’Kshetra Bajaja Committee is a body active since 1885. At that time, the cloth merchants of Agra gathered together and decided that instead of doing charity on a small, personal level, the society would benefit more if a collective effort, channelled towards a single cause was made. And thus, was born the Kshetra Bajaja Committee.Over the years, so concerted and well-directed have the efforts been that they were asked to manage the traditional crematorium, and in 1996, when the electric crematorium was built, the Agra district administration immediately handed over affairs of its functioning to the Kshetra Bajaja Committee.Today, its members - some 700 cloth merchants of Agra - contribute to arrange for the requirements of the electric crematorium and wood for the traditional crematorium and other requirements, like the running of the five vehicles used to take bodies to the crematorium.And it is not just the crematoriums the organisation runs but also an ayurvedic hospital in the city and is also actively involved in meeting the needs of the impoverished sick in the city’s hospitals, like providing medicines, arranging for oxygen cylinders, etc.At the electric crematorium, there are 15 to 25 bodies cremated every day in its three furnaces. “Sometimes, the number goes up to 30 as bodies of Covid-19 patients are also brought for cremation,” said Kshetra Bajaja Committee president Sunil Vikal.“Our members are selflessly contributing to this service despite them facing a tough time themselves in these times. In such a situation, we do expect the administration to extend a helping hand to the Kshetra Bajaja Committee in serving mankind,” Vikal added.He said that when the lockdown was imposed, there was a restriction on vehicles which drastically brought down the number of fatalities in road mishaps and the number of unclaimed bodies coming for cremation dropped.“We have been preserving the ashes of those unknown or unclaimed bodies which we cremated and immerse them in Ganga at Soron near Kasganj after every three years. In these times of the pandemic, family members of a deceased Covid-19 patient are in quarantine and are unable to attend the last rites or collect the ashes. We have been preserving ashes in such cases also and wait for family members to come and collect them.“There are 50 to 60 urns of such Covid-19 cases cremated at the electric crematorium and we have saved the ashes with dignity with a condolence message wrapped around them, awaiting family members to come and collect them. Many came in the unlock phase and took the ashes, thanking the committee,” Vikal said.“The acceptability of the electric crematorium among citizens has seen a surge in these times of the pandemic,” he said.However, this acceptability is new-found. “In the beginning, no one was prepared to cremate their dear departed in the electric crematorium even though it saved precious trees from being felled. There were various awareness campaigns launched to make the electric crematorium acceptable among people but that acceptance was slow to come,” Vikal said.“There was a time when only the socially aware and environmentally concerned would come to the electric crematorium but slowly and steadily, people have begun to opt for the electric crematorium without any bar of caste or economic status. That acceptability has been enhanced due to the pandemic as the cremation here at the electric crematorium is less cumbersome and manageable by a few,” he said.“With the pandemic raging, cremations at the electric crematorium have exceeded those in traditional crematoriums as our staff extends help to the few next of kin accompanying the body while wearing personal protective equipment. Otherwise too, cremations in the electric crematorium are less cumbersome and get over faster as we have three separate furnaces operating at 800 degrees Celsius,” Vikal said.“The number of cremations at the electric crematorium is thrice the number of traditional cremations where family members have to carry wood and prepare funeral pyre on their own. Now, only a limited number of family members accompany the dead, even if it’s a non-Covid death and thus, the utility of electric crematorium is being realised by Agra residents,” he added.The Kshetra Bajaja Committee also working toward creating eco-awareness among Agra citizens by organising seminars and talks about the utility of an electric crematorium while listing the ecological damage in preparing for a traditional cremation. With that aim in mind, it also organises walks for school children. However, it is left to family members whether to opt for the traditional method or use the electric crematorium. The committee never contacts bereaved families but has its staff at the electric crematorium which arrives to work the furnace if a body is brought in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agra-s-kshetra-bajaja-committee-is-providing-dignity-in-death-to-deceased-covid-19-patients/story-vEaoDkwkvk1hBhfeSZrK9N.html

The commission will submit its report within two months, he said.The constitution of the judicial commission comes a day after the Yogi Adityanath government set up a three-member special investigation team (SIT) headed by senior IAS officer Sanjay Bhoosreddy to probe different aspects of the Kanpur ambush case.According to a state government statement, the SIT will also look into a failed raid that eventually led to the ambush, the nature of action taken against Dubey and his group in the past few years, and the gangster’s alleged links with policemen and government employees.Dubey was killed on the morning of July 10 when he allegedly tried to escape the custody of Special Task Force (STF) following an accident involving the vehicle in which he was being taken to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh.The STF had come under fire from various quarters with the opposition alleging that the encounter was staged to eliminate a criminal who could have possibly revealed uncomfortable details of a police-criminal-politician nexus in the state.The STF claimed that Dubey was shot dead after he opened fire and refused to lay down the weapon. He had been arrested in Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday morning, a week after he and his gang members ambushed a police team killing eight policemen.The gangster and four of his aides have been killed in separate encounters between July 3 and 10.The one member judicial commission, which will be headquartered in Kanpur, will probe into the ambush on the police team by Vikas Dubey and members of his gang on the intervening nights of July 2-3 in which eight policemen were killed and several others were injured, the government spokesman said.It will also probe into the July 10 encounter between police team and Vikas Dubey as well as all the encounters between police personnel and members of Vikas Dubey gang that took place between July 3 and July 10 at various spots, he said.It will also inquire into the nexus between the Vikas Dubey, members of his gang with policemen as well as the personnel of other government departments and people. The Commission in its report will also give its recommendation to the state government to check the repeat of such incidents, the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-forms-judicial-commission-to-probe-kanpur-ambush-vikas-dubey-encounter/story-odRx9RjUwBHaK6BkrkC6NO.html

12-07-2020||India||Dubey aide Arvind Trivedi sent to judicial custody, will be taken to UP for interrogation||The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) produced Arvind Ramvilas Trivedi, a close aide of slain gangster Vikas Dubey and Trivedi’s driver Sushilkumar Suresh Tiwari in Thane court on Sunday and both the men were sent to judicial custody till July 21. ATS officials said, the Uttar Pradesh police are on their way to Mumbai and will take them to Kanpur to investigate their roles in connection with the case of eight policemen killed by Dubey and his associates.According to an ATS official, Trivedi and his driver fled from Uttar Pradesh soon after the killing of eight policemen at Bikru village near Kanpur, in the intervening night of July 2 and 3, by Dubey and his associates. “Both went to Madhya Pradesh and from there they came to Pune hiding in a truck. After that they changed the vehicle and took another truck and arrived at the Kolshet area in Thane,” he said.ALSO READ | Vikas Dubey’s close aide arrested from Thane by Maharashtra ATS team“The Juhu unit of the ATS received a tip-off regarding Trivedi, known by the alias Guddan. The Juhu unit under the guidance of superiors laid a trap at Kolshet Road, Thane and nabbed accused Arvind Ramvilas Trivedi and his driver,” ATS officials mentioned in their statement.Dubey, who was a history-sheeter and has approximately 60 criminal cases against him, absconded and was ultimately arrested in Ujjain on July 9. He was killed in an encounter on July 10, while being brought back to Kanpur by UP Police. Trivedi is suspected of being involved in the murder of UP state minister Santosh Shukla, who was killed inside the Shivli police station in Kanpur, in 2001. Dubey was the main accused in the case, which saw 25 policemen, brought in as eyewitnesses to the murder, turn hostile in court. The UP state government had announced a reward of Rs 50,000 in exchange for information on Trivedi’s whereabouts.Following Trivedi’s arrest, the UP Police issued a press statement confirming Trivedi was an associate of Dubey. “Following the arrest made by Maharashtra ATS, it has come to light that Arvind Trivedi is an old member of Vikas Dubey’s gang. Investigations are being conducted to ascertain if he was involved in the incident at Bikru village. Arvind has not been named in the FIR,” the UP Police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dubey-aide-arvind-trivedi-sent-to-judicial-custody-will-be-taken-to-up-for-interrogation/story-XKr66ehP0Vi2pOWzOYAXvJ.html
12-07-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot marginalised Pilot, Congress failed to settle issues in Rajasthan||The simmering tension between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot reached a tipping point when the latter got summoned by his state police on July 10 for an investigation into a plot for destabilising the government.It underlined, according to a senior Congress leader, the deep distrust of Rajasthan CM towards his able deputy chief minister and a bid to marginalize Pilot in the party and in the government that was formed in 2018. Although a similar notice was sent to Gehlot, asking him to record his statement, but a Pilot loyalist said that the deputy chief minister felt the probe is set to target him. A similar notice was sent to Gehlot but pilot loyalists said that the deputy chief minister felt he was the target of the probe.There were several bids to undercut Pilot in the past two years. But the Congress central leadership chose to ignore the warning signals. Finally, the party formed a coordination committee for Rajasthan in January this year but that panel so far has held just one meeting.The Congress’ inability to nip problems at the bud was aptly expressed by Kapil Sibal. As news of Sachin Pilot screamed headlines, Sibal tweeted, “Worried for our party... Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables ?” Just four months ago, the Congress lost its government in Madhya Pradesh in a similar script: party veterans sidelining Jyotiraditya Scindia. Worried for our party Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables ?To be sure, the start of the new Congress government in the desert state was not exactly a smooth affair. Pilot, who left his family in Delhi to sweat it out, led the Congress campaign as the president of the party to victory, but Gehlot outstepped him to become the chief minister, primarily weighing on caste equations.Party insiders added that for the past few months, the Gehlot camp has been demanding a change of guard in the Rajasthan Congress in a bid to remove Pilot from the state president’s post. They have started lobbying with Congress functionaries in Delhi that a new state chief is required (Pilot is holding the position for 6 years) before the ensuing panchayat election in the state.Even as then Congress president Rahul Gandhi met the two leaders over several rounds to hammer out a solution, the uneasy equation between the Congress’ old generation and the new generation came to the fore.Last year, chief minister’s son Vaibhav Gehlot lost the Lok Sabha election, and senior Gehlot lost no time to blame Pilot for the defeat. He publicly stated that “Pilot should take responsibility” even as many party leaders questioned the chief minister’s inability to ensure victory for his son.Earlier this year, Pilot had expressed concern about deteriorating law and order situation in some areas of the state - seen as a comment on Gehlot who holds the home portfolio in the government.A few months ago, the Rajya Sabha elections too saw tension rising between the two. Gehlot fielded Neeraj Dangi, a secretary of Congress party, for the coveted Rajya Sabha seat. Pilot wanted a bigger, well-known name but Gehlot stuck to his choice. And then, ahead of the polls, Gehlot alleged that Congress MLAs are being lured, indicating the party might lose a seat. The results proved to be otherwise and Congress secured seats for both candidates.Pilot, who was credited for the victory, maintained that “Any kind of doubts and suspicions spread around earlier were baseless.”The death of 107 children in Kota also brought out the difference between the two in which Pilot maintained that the state government needs to do more to prevent such incidents.Another party insider points out that Pilot’s people are not being rewards. Many posts for political appointment are lying vacant and Gehlot is in no hurry to accommodate Pilot loyalists in these posts.Last month, at a function at party headquarters to observe Sanjay Gandhi’s death anniversary, Pilot announced that as the party president in Rajasthan, he owes it to the Congress grassroot workers who worked very hard and therefore they need to be rewarded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-marginalised-pilot-congress-failed-to-settle-issues-in-rajasthan/story-YG59eQqehsVI6Zl1dy1ddJ.html
12-07-2020||India||Authorities order partial lockdown in Srinagar to combat Covid-19; over 60 containment zones designated||Authorities on Sunday ordered a partial lockdown in Srinagar by designating over 60 containment zones amid a surge in coronavirus cases over the past week, officials said. The lockdown will be imposed in 68 containment zones of the city from Monday and no movement would be allowed in these areas without permission, they said. “In view of the major spike in Covid-19 cases, we will have to carve out containment zones for effective restrictions in different areas of Srinagar. Local cooperation is solicited in best interest of public health,” District Magistrate, Srinagar, Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said. He confirmed the reimposition of the lockdown. The decision to reimpose the lockdown in these areas of city was taken at a meeting late Saturday evening, the officials said. The city has witnessed a spike in the number of coronavirus cases over the past one week. The total number of positive cases has reached 1,611, out of which 1,075 are active. While the union territory administration had first announced a lockdown across Jammu and Kashmir on March 22 as part of its efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus, restrictions were imposed in many parts of the valley, including in the city, on March 19 after the UT saw its first positive case from Srinagar. The lockdown was then gradually eased in June and the markets in the city reopened after about three months in the second week of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/authorities-order-partial-lockdown-in-srinagar-to-combat-covid-19-over-60-containment-zones-designated/story-UTVTXy7mzq2LeBi8QmVx4L.html
12-07-2020||India||Those testing negative for Covid-19 but showing symptoms should be treated: Experts||Test results may come out  negative even if one has contracted Covid-19, experts have warned, advising that those showing symptoms of the disease must be treated without waiting for a confirmatory test to prevent aggravation of the infection.There have been several cases where patients showing clinical symptoms of Covid-19 have tested  negative for the virus multiple times.They were confirmed positive after repeated tests, doctors said.The general perception of the experts now is that a high degree of suspicion arising out of the clinical symptomatology and the CT scan reports should be the guiding factor for treatment rather than relying only on the RT-PCR test which has a sensitivity of only 70 per cent, Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor in the Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, said.Even the rapid antigen test has a sensitivity of only 40 per cent.“So many patients will be missed if we rely only upon these tests,” Dr Gupta said.The antibody tests has a sensitivity of 90 per cent but they are only useful for confirming past exposure for SARS-CoV2 and have no value in the early stages of the disease.“All the treatment strategies should be guided  towards preventing the progress of the disease from its mild to moderate or moderate to severe and for that we cannot wait on test reports. We have to go by clinical symptoms,” he explained.Dr Vijay Gurjar, an assistant professor in the department of Geriatric Medicine at AIIMS here, said there have been several instances where the patients tested negative even after three or four RT-PCR tests despite clinical presentations and CT scans indicating atypical pneumonia which is highly suggestive of Covid-19.  Later on, they were found to have antibodies against coronavirus which means they had the infection but their results had not come out positive in the RT-PCR tests, he said “Thus, if patients have the symptoms, more so, if he or she is an elderly or has co-morbidities, they should be treated on the lines of Covid-19 and managed accordingly without waiting for the test confirmation,” Dr Gurjar said.According to Dr Nikhil Modi, senior consultant of Respiratory, Critical care and Sleep Disorder at the Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, one of the main reasons behind incorrect test results is the improper procedure of sample collection from the throat and the nose.“If the sample is not collected in a proper manner, then it may lead to incorrect results. Also the viral load plays an important role, as when low, the test results may come out negative even if the patient has the infection,” Dr Modi said.“In cases where symptoms are highly suggestive of Covid-19 and the RT-PCR test continues to be negative even after repeated tests, a CT scan of the lungs can be useful in reaching a correct diagnosis,” he elaborated.The AIIMS’ Resident Doctors’ Association recently had written to the ICMR seeking formation of an expert committee for provision of professional enquiry for the unexpected, unexplained deaths during the pandemic.  A comprehensive diagnosis of Covid-19 verified by the expert committee involving clinical history, examination, imaging, biochemical, molecular testing and forensic investigations must be considered as cause of death in absence of an alternative diagnosis so as to help the bereaved families of the frontline healthcare workers to get compensation, it said.“This is to bring to your kind notice that many of the healthcare workers have lost their lives in line of their duty in Covid-19 pandemic. As per the literature sensitivity of none of the tests performed for Covid-19 diagnosis is 100 per cent.“This has led to alleged misdiagnosis of some health workers who succumbed to Covid-19-like illness,” the letter stated.The AIIMS RDA mentioned the recent death of Dr Abhishek Bhayana, junior resident, from the department of Dental surgery at Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences, New Delhi, who presented with symptoms of sore throat and breathlessness.The death summary clearly mentions manifestations consistent with Covid-19 but his test results had come out negative, the RDA said. Dr Gurjar said that major policies regarding compensation for corona warriors should not be decided just on the basis of microbiological reports.  “The clinical presentation and other findings shouldn’t be ignored.We should have a comprehensive approach for Covid-19. Timely response and intervention will definitely help in improving patient’s outcomes with suspected Covid-19 clinical presentations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-testing-negative-for-covid-19-but-showing-symptoms-should-be-treated-experts/story-8tsLKYLLXobInHBQZUoDqK.html
12-07-2020||India||Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot’s supporters come to Gurugram resort, call police summon a joke||At least 19 Congress legislators are now supporting Sachin Pilot, the deputy chief minister of Rajasthan who by his absence from the state this weekend has fuelled major speculation about an imminent exit and split of the party. The absence came soon after the special operations group (SOG) of the state police’s anti-terror squad posted a notice at his residence to appear for questioning.The questioning is to take place in connection with the case registered on Friday by the ATS that there was a plot to bring down the Ashok Gehlot government. The first information report (FIR) and the alleged tapped phone conversations have put on record what has otherwise been an open secret—that chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy do not get along. Also read: ‘No meetings with Sachin Pilot,’ maintains BJP; says ‘no role in trying to topple Gehlot govtWhat everyone is now wondering is if this episode will push Pilot to quit the Congress party.A central Congress leader who reached out to Pilot said that he has not been taking their calls. “This was taking humiliation to a different level. He just got a call on Saturday that they had posted this notice and left. Is this how a deputy chief minister is treated?’’ a leader, who is close to Pilot, asked.While officials of the Rajasthan government say that the notice was also sent to the chief minister as well, the leader quoted above called the summon a “joke”.“The chief minister also holds the home portfolio, so how can they question him? This is all very sinister as this FIR will give them a reason to put surveillance on the deputy chief minister,’’ the BJP leader said.As the fallout of this very public saga slowly unravelled, the resort drama has now started.Pilot’s supporters are lodged in various resorts, including an ITC Grand Bharat in Gurugram.

Some media outlets are presenting it in a different way which is not right,” Gehlot tweeted in Hindi. एसओजी को जो कांग्रेस विधायक दल ने बीजेपी नेताओं द्वारा खरीद-फरोख्त की शिकायत की थी उस संदर्भ में मुख्यमंत्री, उपमुख्यमंत्री, चीफ व्हिप एवम अन्य कुछ मंत्री व विधायकों को सामान्य बयान देने के लिए नोटिस आए हैं। कुछ मीडिया द्वारा उसको अलग ढंग से प्रस्तुत करना उचित नहीं है।The SOG had sent notices to these leaders seeking their time for recording statements in connection with the alleged attempts to topple Congress government in the state.The notices stated that the SOG had urged the leaders to provide a suitable date and time for recording their respective statements.The SOG had said on Saturday that it has arrested BJP members Bharat Malani and Ashok Singh for allegedly trying to topple the government by offering Rs 20-25 crore bribe each to unspecified legislators - a charge levelled by Gehlot. A First Information Report (FIR) was filed against the two under Indian Penal Code’s sections related to sedition and criminal conspiracy on Friday.The complaint is based on a purported conservation between the two over the phone. According to the FIR, the attempts to topple the government started last month.The Congress has 107 members in the 200-member House and also enjoys the support of 18 other lawmakers. The half-way mark in the assembly is 100; the BJP has 72 legislators.Gehlot had on Saturday accused the BJP of trying to “buy legislators like goats” for the purpose amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He had further said at a virtual press conference that the BJP’s “brazen attempt” was thwarted by the Congress.“The BJP needs to realise that it is not Madhya Pradesh. They have succeeded in MP, but we are alert now, they will not be able to destabilise the government here,” he had said.Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia dismissed Gehlot’s allegations and said they were a result of infighting within the Congress. “This entire strategy has been worked out by the chief minister to prevent factionalism from coming out in the open.”His reference was to the alleged uneasy relationship between Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-sog-sends-notices-to-rajasthan-politicians-chief-minister-clarifies/story-aVA1wNyPQhnwzObUQnbtzO.html

Pawar also said that India’s main opponent is China and not Pakistan but New Delhi cannot afford a direct war with it.Pawar, in the second part of the three-part interview to Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, said that the Modi government tried to take a different stand on India’s relations with other countries but it did not work.“We never changed our foreign policies for the relations with other countries and they were in continuation since Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi or even Atal Behari Vajpayee’s rule. Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to take a different stand by calling Chinese President Xi Jinping on friendly visits and treated him on a swing (at the banks of Sabarmati). Modi tried to create a picture of having created ties of friendship with the neighbour. But these efforts have not worked,” he said.Also read: CM made a cautious decision to ease lockdown - Pawar in Saamana interviewPawar said that China has successfully wooed all neighbouring countries including Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka against India. “PM Modi’s first visit after taking over as the prime minister was to Nepal, but the neighbour now stands by China. Pakistan has already shifted its loyalty. India played a major role in the liberation of Bangladesh, but the country recently inked an agreement with China. Same is the case with Sri Lanka. This means all the countries surrounding India have started talking against it. The disagreement in relationship with these neighbours is the ‘latest contribution’ (of Modi government),” he said.The NCP chief said that the issues with China cannot be resolved by war. “Our military strength is just a tenth of China’s and in such a backdrop, we cannot have direct war with the neighbour. It is true that we have readied our military forces and could have a war and are ready to pay the price if the need be. But instead of that, we should try to solve it with diplomatic strategies and dialogue. We have lost our territory to China more than 50 years ago and we have our dispute with it over it. We should build pressure with the help of other countries and the United Nations to regain it,” he said.Pawar said that though China’s first enemy, almost three decades back, was the United States or Japan, it has now started posing against India and it was its strategy. “When I visited China as defence minister in 1993 and met the then president of China, he had hinted at this. He had said that the country does not want to have any clashes with the neighbouring countries as their main target at that point of time was the US. He had said that they will look at neighbouring countries after about 25 years,” he said.Pawar, while replying to a question by Saamana’s executive editor Sanjay Raut, said that the country’s economic crisis needs to be handled differently. He said that the Modi government needs to adopt a different policy for the revival of the economy which has been in the crisis in the view of the global Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-main-opponent-is-china-not-pak-govt-s-foreign-policy-has-failed-pawar/story-zmsbw8V8CAzC4Bs0EflKdN.html

Shah spoke after participating in a mega plantation drive initiated by the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) that has a target to plant about 1.37 crore saplings in their country-wide campuses by this month-end. “The world is seeing that if a successful battle has been fought anywhere across the globe against the coronavirus it is India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. “It was feared that how would a large country like ours would face this challenge given that we have a federal structure of governance, dense population of 130 crore people and no single chain of command,” Shah said. He was speaking after planting a peepal tree at the CRPF officers’ training academy campus in Kadarpur village here. The 130 crore people of the country, all the states and every individual fought this battle against Covid-19 as one nation, he said. Across the globe, governments are fighting this disease but in our country everyone has joined hands, Shah said. “We are at a good position in this coronavirus battle and will continue this fight with determination and there is no atmosphere of fear. We have the passion to battle it and enthusiasm to defeat it (coronavirus),” Shah said in his address to the chiefs of various CAPFs and troops who heard him over a webinar link. As the home minister of the country, I can proudly say that the security forces of the country have a “big role” to play in this battle fought by India, he said. Shah noted that Covid-19 is a very contagious disease that challenges the very existence of the human kind. Saluting the ‘corona warriors’ of the CAPFs and other security and police forces, the minister said they have set a new example of rendering their duty and fighting the pandemic at the same time. He said over 31 CAPF personnel have laid down their lives while rendering Covid-19 duties out of which ten personnel are from the Central Reserve Police Force. “I assure you that your sacrifice will not go in vain. Your sacrifice will be written in golden words,” he said. Talking about the importance of trees in environment protection, the home minister urged the personnel of these forces to adopt at least one plant and ensure that they protect it till it grows bigger than them. “Consider the plant like your child and treat it with the affection and care that you bring up your children,” he urged the personnel. “We are facing challenges of global warming, rise in temperature and depletion of the ozone layer.Only trees can save us from environmental challenges and they can help to lessen the existing pollution and nothing else,” he said. He said the home ministry, under the ongoing mega plantation drive, has chosen the maximum of those plants which have a life span of over 100 years so that they can help preserve the nature for long. Shah also said that he believes that his ministry should have a culture that all projects or initiatives launched by it should reach successful completion. The Modi government, he said, is working to bring in more clean fuel and as part of that we are enhancing the usage of ethanol over petrol. “I am happy to say that between 2014 and 2020 the production and consumption of ethanol in the country has risen by 20 per cent and we further plan to increase it by another 10 per cent,” he said. During the event, CRPF chief A P Maheshwari informed the minister that all the CAPFs are undertaking the mega plantation drive and his force will plant over 22 lakh saplings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-at-good-position-in-battle-against-covid-19-home-minister-amit-shah/story-03lcSg4OiQbMKl0EZGduAO.html

12-07-2020||India||Covid-19, Amphan help RSS to spread wings in rural West Bengal||In the last three months the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) intensified its activities to provide food and medical help to migrant workers during the coronavirus pandemic and relief to those affected by Cyclone Amphan as it made a political point that the ruling Trinamool Congress failed to manage the two simultaneous disasters.RSS, the ideological parent of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has around 1,800 sakhas (branches) in West Bengal. It could not hold daily assemblies because of nationwide lockdown that started in March but its members have tried to help people during the crisis.“The Covid-19 pandemic is the worst thing that has happened in India. Helping people should be our sole objective,” Jishnu Basu, general secretary of the RSS state unit, said while speaking to HT. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the RSS’ trade union arm, in a bid to provide work to migrant workers has set up help desks to provide employment opportunities in the eastern state as well as in others like Kerala, Maharashtra and Gujarat. The BMS claims it is contacting local employers as well.“We are operating 38 help desks across Bengal. According to our estimate, 80% migrants will leave the state again. We are preparing records of these people and helping them to get work,” said Ravi Singh, the BMS’ state working president. “Our 121 active unions in Bengal have distributed food and sanitisers among 1.62 lakh families at 665 locations in 23 districts. Tarpaulins, food and relief materials were distributed in Amphan-hit areas as well,” Singh added. The National Medicos Organisation (NMO), an organisation of doctors and volunteers of the RSS, along with two other outfits, have so far held 80 medical camps in East Midnapore and the South and North 24 Parganas, the Amphan impacted districts.“We have treated about 25,000 people so far, thanks to 80 doctors, 250 volunteers and help from the BJP medical cell. Masks and medicines have been distributed. We are preparing a list of people who need surgery,” said Dr Prabhat Singh, state president of NMO.Sahakar Bharati, a nationwide cooperative movement backed by RSS, has in recent years set up multipurpose, agricultural and fisheries cooperatives depending on location and requirement, said Vivekananda Patra, its organising secretary in West Bengal, Sikkim, Odisha and the Andamans.These cooperatives are now helping people affected by lockdown.Basudeb Sarkar, who is associated with Sahakar Bharati, said he has been able to help the families of many of his neighbours who went to other states for work and faced crisis during the lockdown.Sarkar is a resident of Nandangram village of North Dinajpur district in north Bengal.“Around 2.24 lakh people from North Dinajpur were stuck in other states. We helped some of them through the Sahakar Bharati network in those states. Now our main objective is to help women whose husbands have not returned. We are inducting them in cooperative societies for packaging and marketing organic farm products,” said Sarkar.Political fallout:Political observers say that with RSS cadre working on the field helps the BJP for the crucial 2021 assembly polls. The humanitarian work, they say, gives the BJP the same strong platform that the RSS ensured for the party in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Assam and other states. The BJP bagged 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, unsettling the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the districts. The party’s leaders are now publicly saying that they will win 200 of the 294 assembly seats in 2021 assembly polls.Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, former principal of Presidency College, said the RSS was doing a great job for people affected by the lockdown and Cyclone Amphan.“I don’t support the RSS ideology but TMC activists are not doing anything of this kind. They are more interested in robbing the money that has come from the government as a grant,” said Mukhopadhyay.“Because of these welfare activities the BJP is trying to have its strongholds, particularly in the rural areas that represent the majority of the voters. If RSS continues this work it will surely help the BJP do much better in the coming election,” he added.The outreach of the RSS could hurt the TMC, a senior minister, who did not wish to be named, admitted. “In 2011, we could overthrow the Communist Party of India (Marxist) despite its phenomenal cadre-based organisation because voters turned against the Left. In the coming war, our main weapon against the BJP is the TMC government’s performance,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-amphan-help-rss-to-spread-wings-in-rural-west-bengal/story-eT6bcvLDwDyG5Vb2330XJO.html

Deepak Paliwal, didn’t feel inhibited or have second thoughts before deciding to volunteer for a human trial for coronavirus vaccine led by the Oxford University.In an interview with the BBC, Paliwal said he kept thinking how could he contribute to the global fight against coronavirus and decided to enrol as a volunteer for the human trial. He thought his brain may not be of any use but his body can certainly contribute.Also read: India now recording 12% of daily global Covid-19 cases, shows dataPaliwal said he learnt about the trial on April 16 and visited one of the five centres in London for his preliminary check-up and screening on April 26. His wife did not support his decision at first. He said he had only informed his close friends and wife about his decision.Paliwal said his friends played a huge role in supporting him. During the course of the trial, he was told about various hazards that he could face, the possibility of him collapsing or suffering organ failure. He even read a report about a volunteer dying amid the trial. But all this could deter Paliwal in his resolve. Forty-two-year-old Deepak Paliwal hails from Jaipur, Rajasthan and lives with his wife in London, United Kingdom. After the successful completion of his trial, his dauntless, courageous move was welcomed by his family but his wife swore never to let him go through anything similar again.Meanwhile, experts at Oxford University continue to conduct their trial on thousands of volunteers to quickly arrive at a Covid-19 vaccine.Paliwal and many others like him steer the effort of researchers and scientists in a direction which is one step closer to a potential antidote to the deadly contagion. Ever since its outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year, Covid-19 has infected over 12 million globally while more than 5 lakh people worldwide have lost their battle with the infection till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-deepal-paliwal-man-who-risked-his-life-to-help-oxford-experts-develop-covid-19-vaccine/story-CNMsnKHIm06xqRzdPVPpeM.html
12-07-2020||India||Revolutionary writer Varavara Rao is unwell in, hallucinating, says his family||The health of prominent revolutionary poet and Maoist ideologue P Varavara Rao, who has been lodged in Mumbai’s Taloja Jail, has deteriorated, his family said on Sunday.Rao is facing trial in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence case of January 1, 2018, and also on charges of being part of a plot hatched by Maoists to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.He was arrested in by Pune Police first in August 2018 and after he was released on bail following a court order, he was rearrested in November 2018. He was first lodged in Yeravada Jail in Pune and later moved to the Mumbai prison.Rao’s wife Hemalatha and daughters Sahaja, Anala and Pavana said while speaking to reporters they were worried about his deteriorating health, as was evident from the phone call they had received on Saturday.“He appeared to be in a state of delirium and hallucination, as he was talking about the funeral of his father and mother, the events that happened seven decades and four decades ago respectively,” Hemalatha said.“His co-prisoner took the phone from him and informed us that he is not able to walk, go to the toilet and brush his teeth on his own. We were also told that he is always hallucinating that we, family members, were waiting at the jail gate to receive him as he was getting released,” she said.Rao’s co-prisoner also told the family that he needed immediate medical care for not only physical but also neurological issues.“The confusion, loss of memory and incoherence are the results of electrolyte imbalance and fall of Sodium and Potassium levels leading to brain damage,” Hemalatha said.She pointed out that her husband’s health has not been good for over six weeks now, ever since he was shifted in an unconscious state to the JJ Hospital from Taloja Jail on May 28.“Even as he was discharged from the hospital and sent back to jail three days later, there has been no improvement in his health. The earlier two calls on June 24 and July 2 were also worrying with his weak and muffled voice, incoherent speech and abruptly jumping into Hindi, which was quite worrying,” she said.The family said they were not bothered about issues like whether the case against the revolutionary writer was fabricated, that he had to spend 22 months in jail as an undertrial with the process turned into punishment and his bail petitions getting rejected at least five times now.“His life is the topmost concern for us right now. Our present demand is to save his life. We demand the government to shift him to a better hospital or allow us to provide required medical care,” the family said in a statement.“We want to remind the government that it has no right to deny the right to life of any person, much less an undertrial prisoner,” they added.In April, around 40 prominent writers wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting Rao’s release in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Several members of Parliament, cutting across various political parties, also wrote to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with a request to provide medical care to Rao and to shift him to a hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/revolutionary-writer-varavara-rao-is-unwell-in-hallucinating-says-his-family/story-oGX4FhshP8Hekeonst8HYJ.html

They enter the deep jungles of south Sukma, a severely Maoist-affected region of Chhattisgarh, with their elaborate medical kit for screening and treatment of malaria patients under a campaign started by the state government.Under the Malaria Mukt Bastar Abhiyan, the state government is conducting community-based active screening and treatment in seven districts of Bastar division to reduce malaria parasite load.Bakshi and his team have covered six Maoist-affected villages, where no one from the government other than health workers can enter, in the last 10 days under the campaign.“We are actually working in the core area of Maoists… This is the Chintagufa area, which is dominated by Maoists but they have never interrupted our movement for work,” Bakshi said while speaking to HT.“As we enter any village, we are stopped by some lower-rung cadres and once they are assured that we are health workers and working for the eradication of malaria, they let us go,” he added.There are 6,607 people deployed in 2,804 teams to conduct the anti-malaria campaign in these seven Maoists-hit districts. The teams comprise Mitanin workers and trainers of the community health volunteer programme and Anganwadi workers.Supervisors, medical officers, AYUSH doctors and rural medical assistants (RMAs) have also been also engaged for supervision at the local level.These survey teams have to cross rivers and streams on boats and travel on foot—sometimes walking for around 10 to 15 kilometres—through forests and hilly areas to reach the targeted villages.Tulsi Thakur, who covers the borders of Dantewada and Narayanpur that are not easily accessible, said villagers in deep jungles give easy entry as malaria is the biggest problem in the region and tribals want to get rid of it.“I have to cross two rivers to reach my area and till now I have covered about 1,000 people under the campaign,” said Thakur.According to state government data, 318 people have died in the Bastar division in the last 10 years due to malaria. Bijapur district with an annual parasite incidence of 44.31 and Sukma with 31.33 were among the worst-hit districts by malaria in the country in 2019.The government says malaria is also the main cause behind anaemia and malnutrition in pregnant women and children in these areas.“One of the various objectives of this screening is also to reduce IMR (infant mortality rate) and MMR (maternal mortality rate) in the area. Reduction of malaria prevalence in such areas would also lead to an improvement in the socio-economic condition of the tribal community as it would lead to less expenditure on morbidity and also would prevent wage loss happening due to constant morbidity,” Priyanka Shukla, the director of National Health Mission (NHM), said.The first round of the Malaria Mukt Bastar Abhiyan was held from January 1 to February 23 this year during which door to door visits were made by health teams to around three lakh households.“Usually there is a spike in cases during and immediately after monsoons. Therefore, we started the second phase now and have combined surveillance for Covid-19 along with it since our teams are going door to door anyway,” Niharika Barik Singh, the state’s health secretary, said. The second round of the campaign is currently continuing in a phased manner in the seven districts of Bastar division. A total of 23.46 lakh population has been targeted for this round.Till July 10, health teams made the door to door visits to 177,985 houses in which 17,509 people were found to have malaria. Out of the positive cases, 10,890 or 62.8% cases were asymptomatic.“As compared to 2018 (same period), a 27% decline has been observed in malaria cases after the first round. With the second round ongoing and third round to be organised in November after the intensive implementation of the campaign, more promising results are expected in the days to come,” said NHM’s Shukla.“This would also have a tremendous long term impact on health indicators especially maternal and child health,” she said adding that the second phase is ongoing and 65% of the target population still remains to be covered.People in Bastar say they are expecting positive results for this campaign and are supporting the health workers engaged in Maoist-hit areas.“The health workers are doing a tremendous job by giving us treatment and creating awareness about malaria. We people have also supported them and sometimes we accompany them to other deeper villages,” Dharmendra Sethiya, a resident of Chintagufa village, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-foot-boats-health-workers-visit-1-8-lakh-houses-for-malaria-eradication-drive-in-bastar/story-c5etmG1lCRHVchK078HLnM.html
12-07-2020||India||Amid reports of turmoil in Rajasthan govt, Sachin Pilot meets Ahmed Patel||Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot and his supporting legislators in the state may have left Jaipur on Saturday, setting off alarm bells about a split in the Congress party in the state, but he had tried to warn the top brass two weeks ago.Hindustan Times has cofirmed from leaders of both sides that Pilot came to Delhi and had a special one on one meeting with senior leader Ahmed Patel to discuss this issue. In the meeting, Pilot told the senior leader known to be a close aide of party president, Sonia Gandhi, that his differences with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had gone too far.“There were a long list of grievances that he spoke about,’’ said one leader aware of developments. However, it is unclear if there was any follow-up action to that meeting. Pilot also met other senior leaders like general secretary in charge of organisation, KC VenugopalThe two leaders have had a rivalry that’s well known in party circles. When Congress won the 2018 elections by 107 in the 200 strong assembly, the fight between the two factions came to the fore as Pilot refused to sit back after having worked as the state president and claiming the victory as part of his efforts. Gehlot dug in his heels as well and finally then party chief Rahul Gandhi found a middle path where he made Pilot the deputy chief minister.However, as one leader pointed out, this turned out to be more on paper than in reality. “The deputy chief minister had limited powers and wouldn’t be consulted on any decisions in the state. Most of the times he found out about cabinet decisions from media reports,’’ said one leader who didn’t want to be identified.While it is unclear what emerged from the Delhi meeting, as both Ahmed Patel and Sachin Pilot were unavailable for comments, senior leaders are now speaking out. Congress MP and former minister Kapil Sibal tweeted, ``Worried for our party. Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables?’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/before-the-crisis-sachin-pilot-met-ahmad-patel/story-eRBhpDMBNy4C6iHOxm8OiN.html

Besides him, about a dozen other members of the Jamaat-e-Islami have been taken into custody, Singh said.The police action comes days after veteran separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani announced his complete disassociation from politics.Sehrai had taken over from Geelani and was representing the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat at All Party Hurriyat Conference, a conglomerate of 26 separatist parties.This faction of the Hurriyat is different from the one led by Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, who has favoured dialogue as a means to end the violence in Jammu and Kashmir. Sehrai’s son, Junaid Sehrai, a divisional commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen, was killed in an encounter in the city’s Nawakadal area in May this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/separatist-hurriyat-leader-ashraf-sehrai-jamaat-members-detained-in-kashmir/story-UlGBgoxyM05m9AtNQAx4XP.html

And in all inter-state checkposts you need an entry pass. It is certain high-ranking officials had escorted them,” said president of the BJP’s Kerala unit K Surendran. He added that it was another blot on the state government.The Congress has also sought a high-level probe. “Almost a week has passed since the case came up. Not a single FIR was filed against Swapna Suresh though many cheating incidents against her surfaced including fake degree certificate. Her escape adds to the mystery,” said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala.The police, meanwhile, said they will investigate how Suresh and Nair escaped amid triple lockdown and travelled more than 800 kilometre. Suresh is set to be produced at the NIA office in Kochi on Sunday.The scam came to light after the Customs department seized 30 kg of gold from an air cargo consignment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to the country’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram last Sunday. Suresh, who was working as an IT consultant under the state IT Ministry, had gone underground after the seizure.Later, chief minister Vijayan had transferred his principal secretary M Sivasankar who was reported to be close to Suresh. The Union home ministry had later handed over the probe to the NIA which arrested the accused from a hotel in Bengaluru.Who is Swapna Suresh?The life of Suresh (42) is shrouded in mystery. She is believed to be close to many high-ranking officials and politicians. An Inspector General (IG) of Police had made a complaint to Kerala police chief Loknath Behra to order an inquiry against Suresh.She was employed in Space Park and Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited (KSITL), which comes under the state IT department. Suresh has earlier worked with Air India-SATS (a joint venture between Air India and SATS Limited for airport service and ground handling operations).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-bjp-congress-question-how-swapna-suresh-other-accused-managed-to-cross-state-s-border/story-PcUvtmTBkLYmyvUAuUa7VK.html

12-07-2020||India||Interstate bus services in Delhi may resume this week. What you need to know||Authorities have said interstate bus services to and from Delhi are likely to resume from Monday or Tuesday after they were suspended in March following the coronavirus pandemic.All the three interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi—Anand Vihar, Kashmere Gate, and Sarai Kale Khan—would reopen after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) gave its nod to resume interstate buses in the national capital.The three ISBTs witnessed a combined footfall of more than 250,000 every day before the pandemic.More than 3,400 buses from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Chandigarh would ply daily.According to government reports, the transport department is losing more than Rs 5 crore every month after the three ISBTs were shut.Here is what you need to know:* Officials have said fewer passengers than usual may board buses and no passenger will be allowed to stand once the ISBTs are operational.* Provisions are being made for the disinfection of buses after each trip along with the screening of passengers.* Departures and arrivals of buses will also be staggered to avoid crowding.* Passengers can travel across state borders without travel passes under the Unlock 2.0 guidelines issued by the central government on June 30.* Transport officials said some neighbouring states are apprehensive about resuming services as of now because of the high number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital.* They said Rajasthan has shown an interest in resuming interstate services with 70 buses initially.* Dheeraj Sahu, Uttar Pradesh’s transport commissioner and managing director of Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC), has said the state is not plying any buses outside UP as a precautionary measure. * “The UP government will decide when our interstate bus service will resume,” Sahu said.* Dr Amarpal Singh, Punjab’s state transport commissioner, said the state has resumed interstate transport services.* “As far as we know, the Delhi government’s interstate bus services are shut. We will consider restarting our bus services to and from Delhi once we hear from them,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interstate-bus-services-in-delhi-may-resume-this-week-what-you-need-to-know/story-YDsVKXri1jueqDbYXl0UtI.html
12-07-2020||India||No buffer zone on LAC, only suspended patrolling to avoid flareup on border||Soldiers of China’s People’s Liberation Army and Indian Army have moved back at least 600 metres from the four friction points in east Ladakh where they were in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times after an on-ground verification by the army.The PLA soldiers, who had maintained an aggressive posture, have also taken a step back at other locations along the 1,597 km Line of Actual Control in the western sector.Initial reports had indicated that the PLA troops had moved 1.5 km from the stand-off point.Military officials said this implied that there was no buffer zone.“All we have done is that both sides have withdrawn to rear positions so that no accident or flare-up takes place,” a senior military commander said.It was in this context that external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Saturday described the “disengagement and de-escalation” process with China as “work in progress”. Jaishankar said the process had been mutually agreed upon and just commenced.“What’s happened is that we have agreed on the need to disengage because the troops on both sides are deployed very close to each other,” the external affairs minister told an event organised by India Inc, a UK-based media house. India and China on Friday said they would push forward efforts aimed at complete disengagement and easing of tensions along the LAC even as differences remained over issues such as Beijing’s insistence of claiming ownership of Galwan valley.Officials said the disengagement had been completed at Galwan with neither of the forces sitting on or next to the LAC. The situation at Patrolling Point 15 (Gogra) and Patrolling Point 17 (Hot Springs) is that troops on both sides have disengaged although they are still some distance away from their positions on April 20, the day when the PLA’s troop buildup started. The first violent clash between Indian and Chinese patrols on the northern bank of Ladakh’s Pangong lake took place a fortnight later. Scores of soldiers (from both sides) were injured in the skirmish involving 250 men.At Pangong Tso, the Chinese PLA has withdrawn from Finger 4 relief but some troops on both sides are still sitting on the ridge-line above it. Troops are also in close proximity at the Depsang Plains area but the broad indications are that both sides want to end the impasse.Military and diplomatic officials said the two sides had decided to halt patrolling at the four stand-off points - Galwan, Gogra, Hot Springs and Pangong Tso - without prejudice to their patrolling rights as a precaution. This will help reduce temperatures on the border and avoid any chance of an accident.India and China had agreed to a similar suspension of patrolling after similar stand-offs at Finger 8 in Pangong Tso in 2008 and at Depsang Bulge in 2013 were resolved.The senior military commander cited above said the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is dismantling structures and moving vehicles back at the stand-off points in daylight to maintain transparency. It also wants Indian troops to move back the same distance as there is a trust deficit between the two sides. “It only requires a spark to catch fire and undo all the dialogue,” said a senior military commander.Military commanders of the two countries are expected to hold the fourth round of dialogue next week to build on the icebreaker conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. On Friday, the joint secretary-level Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs held their meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-buffer-zone-on-lac-only-suspended-patrolling-to-avoid-flareup-on-border/story-agU8TnnMk0EjhdLzfz6GFM.html
12-07-2020||India||Political killings cause fear among youth leaders in J&K, BJYM Baramulla chief tenders resignation||After killings of a number of political leaders by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir, a sense of fear and insecurity has started creeping into politicians in the Valley.And first to express it is BJYM president from Baramulla, Marouf Bhat, who on Saturday tendered his resignation.“I hereby resign from the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) as a member and from any post I held in BJYM. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to work for the Party,” Bhat posted on his Facebook account. BJYM is the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).BJP leader Sheikh Waseem Bari, his brother and their father, and Congress Sarpanch Ajay Pandita were recently killed in the Valley.Talking to HT over phone, Bhat said, “We can sacrifice our life for the nation but not of our children. I have been attacked twice in the past but nothing has been done so far. I have not been given even a single PSO (personal security officer).”Bhat informed that he would send his resignation in due course of time to J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina.“They (the militants) are not only targeting us but our families also. We have not been given any security and accommodation in a secured place. Now, our families are at risk,” he said.Bhat claimed he has support of over 400 workers with him in Baramulla.“We have small children. God forbid, if something untoward happens to them, we won’t be able to forgive ourselves,” he said.The BJYM president from Baramulla claimed that many BJP leaders like him in north and south Kashmir were scared after what happned to Bari and his family.He urged the party high command to look into the matter in right earnest.BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav is likely to visit Kashmir on Sunday to meet the family of Bari who was killed in Bandipora last week (July 8).His visit was being seen as an attempt to boost the morale of the party leaders and cadres in Kashmir Valley.On the evening of June 8, 40-year-old sarpanch Ajay Pandita was killed in Anantnag district by the terrorists. Pandita aka Bharti was associated with the Congress and belonged to the minority Kashmiri Pandit community that was first persecuted and then driven out of their homes by terrorists in 1990.Following Pandita’s gruesome killing, over half a dozen Panchayat members - all Kashmiri Pandits - had fled the Valley and reached Jammu. They had sought security cover.J&K lieutenant governor GC Murmu in a recent interview to Hindustan Times had said that security cover to Panchayat members could be thought of in cases where threat perception was more.Following the killing of Bari and his family, the BJP’s senior vice president Narinder Singh has also demanded an immediate security review and enhancement wherever required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-killings-cause-fear-among-youth-leaders-in-j-k-bjym-baramulla-chief-tenders-resignation/story-3oYHB3zq9pgNgboQHqyG1O.html

Talking about the restrictive practices and roadblocks created by certain countries for the Indian film industry, he said India will reciprocate in similar manner, if such issues are brought to the notice of the Government. “Goyal said that single-window clearances for various permission for film shooting in the country, simplification of processes, online clearances, implementation of e-governance are genuine demands of the industry which need early consideration,” the commerce ministry said in a release. Goyal also expressed concern “at the unregulated OTT platforms, where the content is sometimes objectionable, contains misinformation, portrays poorly our country and society, and is just not worth watching with family”.Goyal lauded the role of the Indian Cinema for its contribution in fight against Covid-19, and playing an important role in spreading the awareness about various health precautions. He said that film industry, which is a symbol of Indian soft power, has been contemporary, and reflects the aspiration of the young Indians. He said that 1.35 billion people of the country have the aspiration and big appetite for entertainment, and the film industry always rose to the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unregulated-otts-a-concern-says-piyush-goyal/story-YUeEOCGt4Mil5m6h5mw71L.html
12-07-2020||India||Existential WFH Qs for the weekend (it is the weekend, right?)||If I’m working from home, do I need to get dressed for work every day? In the interests of decency, yes, unless you are not going to be doing any video conferences — in which case, it’s entirely up to you. Victor Hugo, legend has it, did his best work when nude.a. Do I need to dress up for work every day? Most workplaces went casual long before the pandemic (Brooks Brothers has applied for bankruptcy), and athleisure has been a trend for well nigh a decade-and-half, so there is no need to dress up. Try and avoid shorts, though, especially if you are going to be on a video conference that requires a jacket.P.S. In general, avoid shorts. Most people pay scant attention to their legs when working out and, therefore, to quote a line from a film magazine I read in a doctor’s waiting room in my school years, have legs that look like “a road roller ran over their bottom half”.b. What do you wear to work every day? Now, we are getting personal. Still, my work uniform (that’s how I have defined it for years now) has changed — from jeans and a white shirt (the same brands and styles always) to linen trousers and a T-shirt made by an Indian start-up which makes the best T-shirts in the world (no names). And once in a while, I wear one of my old Grateful Dead T-shirts — but I used to do that even when I was going into office.Will people judge me by my Zoom background? You bet they will. People think books are a neutral background, but if the video conference is long and boring (most are), enough participants will read the spines and then judge you for not just the background, but also your reading habits.a. What’s your Zoom background? We are getting personal again. Right now, it’s the album cover of King Crimson’s The Court of the Crimson King (Great music, Mellotron and all that; and it turned 50 late last year).It’s also a good way to judge people in reverse — depending on whether they are able to recognise the background. I’ve been in three work-related Zoom calls in the past few days (I usually use MS Teams, which is boring when it comes to backgrounds), one with economists and fund managers from a sovereign wealth fund (no one recognised it), another with consultants from a global consulting firm (no luck again), and a third with a panel of people including the director of the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta (she did, so you know the answer if your next question is on what I consider to be the best B-school in the country).Should I have a time by when I log in to work and a time when I log out? Ideally, yes, but the unfortunate truth is that most managers (including me, I’m sorry to add) believe that they can call anytime and also set impossible deadlines (I’ve noticed that I am suffixing most of my requests with, “After all, you are working from home...”)a. When do you log in and log out? Personal again. But you don’t want to know lest your manager reads this.Is it alright to take an unscheduled break from work to throw a ball for your dog in the garden? It is alright to take a break from anything, and at any time, to throw a ball for your dog in the garden.What day of the week is it? I don’t know.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/existential-wfh-qs-for-the-weekend-it-is-the-weekend-right/story-qB0YDWCZVuuMVcegOboCpI.html
12-07-2020||India||No deaths in home isolation in 10 days, says Delhi govt||The Delhi government on Saturday said its home isolation model for Covid-19 patients is largely successful with no reported deaths among those recovering at home in the last 10 days.Data provided by the government, which was also presented before chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by the health department on Friday, showed that the number of Covid-19 deaths in Delhi has declined over the past two weeks. Delhi’s fatality rate also declined from 3.64% (before June 24) to 3.02% (between June 24 and July 8).According to Saturday’s bulletin, 34 people died in a single day, which is the lowest number of deaths reported in a single day in a month. The number of Covid-19 cases in the Capital now stands at 110,921, which includes 87,692 recoveries and 3,334 deaths.During the fortnight between June 24 and July 8, 691 people died of Covid-19 in Delhi (an average of 46 deaths per day), the government said. The daily health bulletin reported 93 fresh deaths on a single day on June 16—the highest number of deaths in a single day in Delhi so far.While sharing the data, the government, however, did not give the number of Covid-19 deaths in Delhi based on the ages of the deceased persons. The categorisation of deaths based on co-morbidities and non-co-morbidities was also unavailable when this report was filed.“Of 691 deaths that took place during the last fortnight, only seven deaths took place in home isolation (between June 24 and June 30). Not a single patient in home isolation died in July. We can attribute this to the chief minister’s decision to distribute pulse oximeters to all patients in home isolation. The use of these oximeters alerts the patients of a drop in oxygen levels, which is an early sign of deteriorating health,” read the government statement.The report prepared by the health department also stated that Delhi’s overall death rate in June came down to 3.02% from 3.64%. It stated that during these two weeks, the delay in hospital admission was among the cause of death of 28 Covid-19 patients. Of the 691 deaths, 505 patients were in serious condition when admitted to hospitals. Of the 505 patients, 291 were already in a hospital by the time their test results came out, government officials said.A media advisor to the chief minister said that 15% of the 691 deaths took place during the first 48 hours of hospital admission, while nationally, 45% deaths in India have been taking place within this time frame.“One reason for the declining fatality rate is that the condition of moderate patients is not turning severe because of plasma therapy. The therapy seems to have favourable initial results. This could further bring down the mortality rate in Delhi,” a government official said.On Friday, Kejriwal led a review meeting to discuss what measures need to be taken to further reduce mortality.“Since now, almost all deaths are taking place in hospitals and not in home isolation, it was felt that systems in each hospital need to be examined in detail. The CM has asked for the ratio of deaths to the total number of patients discharged in each hospital,” the CM’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-deaths-in-home-isolation-in-10-days/story-MIxXmyldMXlus9sG5ul2UL.html

However, the counsel for the Delhi government contended that the emails were sent from the mobile phone of a contractual employee.Two branches of Apeejay School-- Saket and Sheikh Sarai-- were sealed by the Delhi government’s education department on May 4 for charging hiked fees from students in violation of the directions issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, enforced in the city amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Later on May 5, the schools were de-sealed by the high court.The Delhi government had also ordered the registration of an FIR against the schools, alleging that they had forged emails to justify hiking the fees. The police are investigating the matter and an FIR is yet to be registered. Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said, “This is a fraud fee enhancement case. Fee is not decided on emails sent to individuals like this. How can a fraud email be used to justify fee enhancement when the department (education) is saying it has not given any such order.”During the hearing in the case on Thursday, the Delhi police submitted an affidavit, saying that the IP addresses from which the schools claimed they received emails were registered with Google in the name of the Deputy Director of Education Act-1. However, additional standing counsel Gautam Narayan, told the court that all the emails were generated from the mobile phone of a contractual employee. The court will now hear the matter on August 6. Calls and text messages to Binay Bhushan, director of education, remain unanswered.“Delhi Police report has vindicated the stand of Apeejay Schools,” the Apeejay School said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apeejay-case-cops-say-emails-sent-from-ip-address-of-education-dept/story-42fkWXrQAgWFV0psdLconL.html

12-07-2020||India||Cong flays govt over handling of Covid-19||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s sustained attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government on their handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and Chinese transgressions in Ladakh came in for praise from the party’s Lok Sabha members at a virtual meeting on Saturday, people familiar with the developments said.The leadership issue also resonated at the meeting, chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, with many members demanding that Rahul Gandhi should once again assume the reins of the party, a Member of Parliament (MP) said on condition of anonymity.“It was decided that members would take the issues raised by Rahul Gandhi to the people in their respective constituencies over the Centre’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the India-China border standoff,” the MP said. Of the 52 Congress MPs in the Lok Sabha, 41 spoke at the meeting in which the issues that came up for discussion included the pandemic, the impact of Covid-19 lockdown and Chinese transgressions.Rahul Gandhi once again highlighted the alleged failures of the government in tackling Covid-19 and its handling of the lockdown.A Lok Sabha MP from Kerala said Rahul Gandhi also said the “impact of lockdown on the economy will be huge” but the government does not have a plan to bring the economy back on track. On China, he alleged the PM had been lying to the people, this person said. Rahul Gandhi also targeted the PM CARES Fund and asked for the government to be transparent about its funding, people at the meeting said. Sonia Gandhi said the government is not convening Parliament and shying away from important questions on critical matters.BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said the statements praising the Gandhis are scripted. “The party is divided into two camps, those who support the party and those who support the family. So these scripted statements are being made,” he said. On questions being raised by the Congress on the standoff with China and the PM CARES fund, Hussain said the Opposition has no issues to raise, and, therefore, is creating controversies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-flays-govt-over-handling-of-covid-19/story-iLZf9dspAZ6RLm3e89SMrI.html
12-07-2020||India||Disengagement in progress: Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Saturday described as “work in progress” the “disengagement and de-escalation” process with China in East Ladakh. Discussing the India-China face-off in Ladakh at India Global Week 2020, organised by India Inc, a UK-based media house, Jaishankar said the process had been mutually agreed upon and just commenced. “What’s happened is that we have agreed on the need to disengage because the troops on both sides are deployed very close to each other.” On-ground verification in East Ladakh has shown that Indian and Chinese troops have moved back from positions where they were in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation by at least 600 metres at the four stand-off points as well as all along the 1597 km Line of Actual Control in the western sector, top military and diplomatic officials said on condition of anonymity. According to the officials, the two sides have decided to temporarily halt patrolling at the four friction points, Galwan, Gogra, Hot Springs and Pangong Tso — but without prejudice to their patrolling rights — so that temperatures are reduced on the border and any chance of an accident is avoided. This is not the first time that India and China have agreed to such measures, they pointed out; it was done at Finger 8 in Pangong Tso in 2008 and at Depsang Bulge in 2013 after similar stand-offs were resolved.The officials denied that there was a buffer zone. “There is no buffer zone. All we have done is that both sides have withdrawn to rear positions so that no accident or flare-up takes place. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is dismantling structures and moving vehicles back at the stand-off points in daylight to maintain transparency. It also wants Indian troops to move back the same distance as there is trust deficit between the two sides... it only requires a spark to catch fire and undo all the dialogue,” said a senior military commander.During the third virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on Friday, India and China said they would push forward efforts aimed at complete disengagement and easing of tensions along the LAC even as differences remained over issues such as Beijing’s insistence of claiming ownership of Galwan valley. A date for the meeting of senior military commanders next week is being worked out, and the situation on ground reveals a complete disengagement at Galwan with neither of the forces sitting on or next to the LAC. Jaishankar also emphasized that there is bipartisan consensus in the US to strengthen the relationship with India. “ Think back of the last four US Presidents—Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George Bush and Bill Clinton—and you would agree that you cant’ find four people in world less similar.... Yet one thing on which they agreed is importance of India.... Maybe some of it is our charm but I think a lot of it is also their thinking. We have a very strong political, strategic, security, technology, economic cooperation and defence cooperation with United States,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-in-progress-jaishankar/story-sEhYmNfVxYJDo75AbtfNXJ.html
12-07-2020||India||A peek inside Covid-19 war room: Tales from the ER||When the pandemic began to grip Delhi in early April, the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) hospital was the first in the city to be declared a dedicated Covid-19 facility. So far, LNJP has successfully treated 3600 patients. Even as Delhi now has seven dedicated Covid-19 government hospitals, LNJP remains the biggest facility in the city, housing 522 patients at the moment. LNJP is also a teaching hospital that houses the prestigious Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), and in the fight against the pandemic, the service of around 450 postgraduate students of the college — resident doctors — has been invaluable. They form the backbone of the medical force on the ground, taking care of the wards in 14-day shifts, of varying hours, at a time. The “senior residents”, or doctors in their final year of postgraduation, were to have appeared for exams in April, received their degrees, and got jobs by now. But the pandemic put a halt to that, and they were pressed into service. This is the story of the experiences of two senior residents, Dr Saurav Kumar, 26, doing his MS in general surgery, and Dr Richa Narang, 29, doing hers in anesthesiology, as recounted by them over multiple phone calls. The conversations highlight the Covid-19 journey from the viewpoint of health care professionals on the front line – their anxieties and challenges, and the emotional and physical load it has taken on them. It also highlights the shortcomings in the medical infrastructure and system — many of which, particularly at LNJP, have been addressed, improved and strengthened over the past three months, which these accounts also reflect.Dr Richa Narang: During my first posting, I was very scared. This was in April. The hospital was unprepared. We had an ICU [intensive care unit] on the fourth floor with 15 beds, already occupied with patients, and then suddenly, Covid-19 patients started coming and we had to make another ICU. We scrambled to turn some disused rooms into ICUs.The isolation was not proper at all and we were very scared. Our counter was right in the patient’s room. The PPE [personal protective equipment] kits were faulty. In those initial days, we did not have enough ventilators, oxygen masks, cannulas. It was chaos. We did not know who was doing what or going where, whom to admit, whom not to admit... then things got better. Dr Saurav Kumar: The day we had to shift from the surgical block in the first week of April was very hard. Some of our friends who were working at the casualty called and said, ‘Today we will get around 150 Covid patients’. I said, ‘Boss that must be a rumour, we can’t possibly get that many patients in one go’… then they started to come, and we got a message that we will have to clear out the surgical ward. That’s 36 beds. I had been working in that ward for three years and I knew it like the back of my hand. In one hour, we were completely uprooted. When the order came, the first thing we did was go around and ask patients who could be discharged if they wanted to be discharged and sent to another hospital since LNJP would become a Covid hospital. Some of them agreed. But we also had eight patients with open wounds or in post-surgical care whom we had to shift out. There was one diabetic patient whose foot and leg had become gangrenous and had to be amputated from below the knee. His wound was open and required dressing every day, his immunity was low, electrolytes were all over the chart, he needed close monitoring, lots of care. Shifting someone like him was so hard, but we managed, and he was safe.But now (in the new ward) we did not know where the duty room was, where the nurse’s station was, where the toilets were.PPE CHALLENGE Narang: The day before my first posting, I got a message saying I was to be on Covid duty from the following day. In the morning, I attended a seminar at 11am on safety, basically how to don and take of the PPE. My first thought was, ‘When will I get to see my parents?’ We had our final exams scheduled for April, so I was busy preparing for it and had not gone home since February. Then the pandemic started, and all plans went out of the window, and now here I was, heading into a Covid ICU. I did not tell my parents about my posting.Kumar: We took the place, which used to be our OPD [out-patient department] block in non-Covid days, to create a donning area. It is not connected to any Covid wards, so no cross-infection would happen. You change there, and then you go to whichever ward you are posted in. Four doctors are posted together on a floor with two wards (each floor has 72 beds), and we reach the donning area together and help each other. First we do our handwashing, then we wear the first layer of gloves, then the shoe covers, then the coverall, then an N95 mask and a surgical mask on top of that, then the cap, then a second layer of gloves, then goggles or face shield.Narang: PPE suits are heavy and depressing. I felt suffocated; the headgear, the mask, the goggles, everything has to fit tightly. After a few hours, the goggles start to fog up and there is no way to wipe it, so you have to work with poor visibility. It is so hard to do anything. Imagine intubating a patient while wearing all of that, and sweating in that heat.Communication was such a problem. No one could hear me unless I screamed. When you are handling critical patients, every word is important. So we put in place a system of hand gestures between the doctors and the nursing staff. Also, you can’t go to the bathroom after wearing your PPE, or drink water, or eat. ICU shifts were of six hours, so we had to endure that for the entire duration. There were times when I would be terribly thirsty, desperate to go the washroom, drenched in sweat and finding it difficult to see through the fogged goggles — all at the same time.Kumar: May 13 was the first time I worked in the Covid ward. I worked for the next 14 days. That’s the first time I wore PPE. Within 15 minutes, I was drenched in sweat. It was like someone had poured a bucket of water on me. It’s supposed to be impervious to water, so it has a laminated layer of plastic. In May, with the heatwave on, it was terrible. After half an hour, sweat was dripping like a waterfall from my forehead. The donning area is on the fourth floor — we stopped using lifts, and we blocked off the walkways so that people don’t walk between the wards. So I wore my PPE, walked down four floors, out of the OPD building, walked 200 metres, and then climbed up four floors again to my Covid ward. As I was walking down the stairs, my first thoughts were: ‘Is this thing open from somewhere? Is there a gap I missed? Did I wear it correctly?’When I reached the ward, the first thing I did was to ask the nursing staff to recheck everything. Then I was telling myself, there is nothing to fear, you have been here for three years, it’s the same hospital, there is nothing to worry about. I was reminding myself, that I am the kind of person who wants to volunteer, who wants to be challenged... But before I started my shift, I had spoken to a colleague who had already finished his. First thing I asked was: ‘How scared should I be?’ I was posted at the Covid ward in the surgical block, where the stable patients are housed. The conditions of patients at the Covid ICU and Covid medical block is worse; this is where they are shifted when they need oxygen support. My colleague told me, ‘These patients are stable, but they all have surgical elements, fractures, abscesses, some need dialysis, so treat the patient as a whole, don’t only think Covid, Covid, Covid’. He said, ‘Before you change into your PPE, you should know what you are supposed to do, step by step, when you enter the ward. Don’t plan after you put on your kit. The main work in the morning shift is to do the patient round, and to take samples that are listed for testing. Also, you have to be very cautious with Covid patient because they can deteriorate very quickly.’ SILENT KILLER Narang: Covid is known to create Silent Hypoxia — oxygen levels decrease, but the patient is not symptomatic till the level falls to a critical value. Normally the oxygen saturation in our blood is 99-100%. If it falls to a level below 92%, you need oxygen support to prevent possible damage to your organs. Normally, when the saturation falls below 92%, there are symptoms like difficulty breathing, restlessness, drowsiness. But in Covid patients, the saturation can fall to 80% without the patient showing any symptoms. That’s Silent Hypoxia, that’s what makes this disease so dangerous. So one of our main jobs is to constantly monitor saturation levels.Kumar: On my first day, one patient, a 58-year-old male, was not in a good condition. He was the only one on oxygen support at my ward. He was not able to maintain saturation, it kept dropping. After two days, I had him transferred to the ICU. On the second-last day of my shift, a 70-year-old woman was not maintaining oxygen saturation. We did an X-ray. It did not look too bad, but she was deteriorating. I spoke to another doctor, and then we decided that she needed to be given oxygen and monitored for 24 hours. After this conservative approach, her condition did not improve, and I had to transfer her to the ICU. She was also hypertensive and she had diabetes.Narang: Patients suddenly develop critical symptoms when the saturation drops below 80%. We call this “air hunger”. Normally, we would intubate a patient whose oxygen saturation is so low without thinking twice. With Covid, we learnt that we need to keep a higher threshold, because we saw that once a patient is on a ventilator, there is not much more you can do, and very few came back from that stage. So we adopted an unconventional approach. First, supply oxygen through a non-rebreather mask. If that didn’t work well, then we use a technique called “awake proning” — put the patient on the stomach while continuing oxygen therapy. This opens up the lungs more. This is a technique used for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) patients, which is a critical illness of the lungs, a seizure form of pneumonia, and Covid symptoms closely resemble ARDS. I have had great success with putting patients in the prone position. I had a 64-year-old hypertensive patient, admitted with great respiratory distress. His saturation was 80% when he came in. We put him on a non-rebreathing mask and the oxygen saturation began to improve... 80 to 86, then 90, then 94. Two days later, his condition deteriorated again; this time I applied high-flow nasal oxygen — it provides oxygen at 60-65 litres per minute, compared to non-rebreathing mask which provides 10-15 litres. His condition stabilised for another 2-3 days but again began to deteriorate. At this point I started doing proning. The very first night, he felt so relieved that he fell asleep in the position; his saturation was at 97%. After 18 days, the patient was discharged. Kumar: The first order of the day at my ward was always to take samples. The night shift keeps everything ready — swabs, vials, ziploc covers, pens, micropore, cotton and a chart with the details of who has to be tested. The samples need to be collected and ready before noon, because after 1pm, the lab will not receive new samples. The way it’s done is an art. We had seen videos and demonstrations, but nothing compares to actually inserting a swab into a patient’s nose or oropharynx. There is a gag reflex. The patient might vomit on you, which happened to a colleague. Or the patient will grab hold of your hand really hard.Narang: The first time I went to test a patient and I inserted a swab in a patient’s nose, the patient coughed really hard, straight at me. I was standing right in front of him because I had no experience of doing this. That first incident was scary.Kumar: Once you put on PPE, you can’t be heard. I am screaming from behind my mask and shield, and the patient still can’t hear me. All the ACs had been shut down to prevent the virus from aerosolising in the central ducts; we had arranged for some coolers to run, and they make a noise too.I line up the patients with social distancing, and call them one by one.‘What’s your name?’ I shout, as if declaring war.Then, at the top of my lungs, I explain the procedure. I tell them, ‘Now we will test you for the virus. This cotton bud here, I will put it inside your nose, and touch it to a place at the back of the nose...I will just dab it, I won’t hurt you, and then I will take it out again’ it will take 20 seconds. But when this swab goes in, you will feel uncomfortable, maybe nauseous, like stopping me or holding my hand, but if you can just bear it for a few seconds, it will be done, and you will get the right report.’ You get patients who are very calm, and patients who panic.LURKING FEAR Narang: In April, I had two mortalities on my shift. One of them was a lady who was there throughout my shift but died on my final night. She was 54, diabetic. She was on my mind for many days. I had become close to her. I used to stop by at the end of the day and chat with her. Her granddaughter’s birthday happened when she was at the ICU and she told me about it. To see her craving for oxygen, it was very hard. I had to do prone position with her every day, and her breathing was really improving. She was showing good signs. But in the last seven days, her X-rays showed that her lungs were deteriorating. We could not understand why or what to do. The last two days, she was on ventilator. Then on my 14th day, she passed away at 4am. I was there with her. I cried very hard.In May, by the time my second rotation came, I was full of enthusiasm and excitement that I will save every person under my care. I was very affected by the way patients died on my first shift: unable to breathe, no family members around, having spent all the time in hospital in isolation without your loved ones. Under any other circumstance, you can have any disease, but at least you can meet your family and friends. Here you are lonely, isolated, disconnected. Isolation for a healthy person is difficult, for a suffering patient it must be doubly hard. It’s so depressing for us as well, we are isolated too. Nobody could meet us, we could not meet anybody — it was just isolation and quarantine (which every doctor must go through after a shift).Kumar: There is one good reason to segregate patients according to the severity of their symptoms, so that those who are alright don’t get to see others in critical conditions. Then the patients who are stable start developing a fear. ‘Is this where I am headed? Will this happen to me in 10 days?’ For me, it was a different kind of exhaustion. For us, it was two doctors and four nursing staff working in a 12-hour shift for 72 patients. We had patients on dialysis, patients on drip, patients who needed bloodwork done, someone was anaemic, someone needed a wound dressed, an ECG [electrocardiogram], a X-ray, someone needed to be seen by a specialist. You are consumed by your work for those 12 hours, you think of nothing else. After sweating everything out, you get back to your room, drink lots and lots of water, or ORS, and just pass out. Those 14 days that’s all I did: work, sleep, work, sleep. Even then, the most time -consuming thing was the paperwork. Why not take some of the paperwork off the doctor’s hands? Doing data entry can easily be outsourced and it will halve our burden. That way, patients would get much better care. Narang: Most patients in the ICU were diabetic or had heart disease. We had 10 beds in the ICU to start with, then 15. We were two doctors, my senior and I,and four nursing staff; total shift was six hours.In my May rotation, I did not have a single mortality while on duty. I was very proud of myself. There were mortalities — our own OT [operation theatre] technician, a 13-year-old diabetic girl, a patient with a kidney failure, an elderly patient with cerebral aneurism — just not on my shift. We’re the ones who go and declare the passing of the patient to the relative. For me, facing a crying relative is the hardest part of my job.My first posting in ICU — that was in 2018 — was also the first time I had to tell a relative that we could not save someone. I remember two incidents. I can’t remember which one came first. Both were young, both were in RTAs (road traffic accidents). One was a girl, 10 or 12, and one was a man in his mid-20s. Both were on bikes. The man was riding; the girl was pillion on her brother’s bike. She had fractures all over her hips, legs, and spinal cord; her bladder was gone. The man’s face had been smashed, his skull fractured, and he bled profusely; the whole bed was soaked in blood.We could not save them. I still remember the bed numbers; the man was on 3, the girl on 14. It was very, very hard for me to go and tell the relatives. My first feeling was intense anger. I want to take all the people who drive badly and give them a tour of the ICU and show them what it actually looks like and feels like to be in an accident. I don’t think they will ever drive badly again.Kumar: Once a patient was brought in by a whole lot of men, aggressive, shouting, threatening us (to save that man)... on investigation, I found that he had perforations in his intestine, we needed to operate, we needed blood. We told that large crowd that we needed at least four people to donate blood, and most of the people vanished. One person came and said, here’s a thousand rupees, make some arrangements. Humanity comes naked to you when you are a resident doctor in a government hospital.INDOMITABLE DRIVE Narang: A time comes when there is no one except the lonely patient. I have a drive, I want to save lives, I want to keep trying. I have always wanted to be a doctor, ever since I can remember. My sister who is 12 years older to me is a doctor. We are four siblings, I am the youngest. The oldest is my brother, who is 15 years older. He is an advocate in the Delhi high court, like my father. My mother is 80 and she has polio so one of her legs doesn’t work, but through this entire lockdown, she and my father did everything by themselves in their house. There was no one else with them; I was very worried. I grew up in a single-storey house in Karnal. Even though I have always wanted to be a doctor, it did not feel like I was living my dream when I started my MBBS. It was just studying, studying, studying, it was quite a nightmare! The first time I felt like I was living my dream was when I walked into an ICU. The rush of being in the ICU, where there is only thing to think about — save lives — is what drives me.Kumar: I want to specialise in GI [gastrointestinal] surgery and liver transplantation. In three years you get to know what you want to do. For me, when I open the abdomen up, it fascinates me. Suturing a bowel is technically demanding. Imagine you have a puncture in a cycle.You patch it, if it leaks again, you patch it again. But here, when we suture, if there is a leak again, the patient will die. If you suture too tightly, the blood supply will get cut off. There is no room for a mistake. It’s fine work, very fine work.When I was growing up, I was fascinated by farming. The harvest season was the best time: all the tractors, threshers, everyone out on the field. All day long, I would follow them. My ears would be tuned to hear if Papa’s bike was coming up the road. My father taught botany at the government college in Araria (Bihar), and he was a strict man. There was great discipline at home; even though we lived in a large joint family. I was the older child, and I was told that I must always lead by example. My brother is also a doctor, doing his internship at the Army hospital in Jammu.When I got into MBBS, I was not just becoming a doctor; for me, it was a generational leap. In 26 years, I’ve seen two completely different lives, one in the village where I grew up, and one here in the city. And now I am experiencing being on the front line in a pandemic. Narang: I like to look good, so I would go to the hospital nicely made up — even in my PPE, and even though the duty was exhausting and hectic. I would also go for 45-minute runs every day, inside the park at MAMC. When I went back to the hotel room (she was quarantined at the Hotel Lalit, which was attached to LNJP), I did more reading on Covid. I searched articles in medical journals, I asked my sister to send me articles, I attended a webinar. Then I referred to my own books to read up on ARDS and ventilators. By the end of April, I told my consulting doctor that I want to do a study on the disease. At this point, something horrible happened to me. Someone mirrored my phone pretending to be a bank executive and stole ~14 lakh from my account. That’s like a year-and-half of my salary. I almost gave up. But I was back on shift in May. INFRA struggle Kumar: At some point, just because of the exhaustion, because your body is aching, you are in pain, you start to feel like you are being punished. You start to forget life was different before this.Before Covid, I spent lots of time on social media. I liked playing basketball, badminton, watching Netflix. Before all this started, a group of four or five of us friends would sometimes study or work late into the night, and then we would go out for a walk. One place we liked to go to is Alam bhai’s Maggi point, which is next to Lady Hardinge [medical college], and is open all night. But things are very bad in Delhi now. The government can deny and say there is no community spread; but clearly there is. Also, our hospital conditions are as bad as they were decades ago. Why is health and education not a priority? We have the worst doctor-patient ratio in the world. In hospitals, the biggest problem is the shortage of manpower. It’s not just about doctors but also nursing staff, sanitation workers, all of them are needed in the system.Narang: The images of dead bodies lying around in wards at LNJP — that was at the medicine block. We don’t have enough nursing orderlies, they are the ones who have to carry out the bodies. If someone dies at 6pm, the body may be removed at 10pm, after repeated requests, after searching for the orderlies... The first death I had on my shift — I spent three hours trying to arrange for a nursing orderly, then an ambulance. This should have happened in 15-20 minutes.Kumar: What people saw in the images was not the fault of health care delivery, it was a collapse of infrastructure. Actually government hospitals in Delhi are much better than the government hospitals in most other states.Narang: But since there is so much focus right now on medical care, I think things will improve. They will spend more on health infrastructure. Just to tackle the pandemic, we have had to make huge improvements already, like in the number of ventilators, oxygen support, equipment...Kumar: Right now I am talking to you from a park in front of the library; there is a slight breeze, and lots of trees so the heat is not unbearable. I tested positive for Covid, and I have just recovered. I was more or less asymptomatic, but I had a lot of fatigue, and also some joint pain. I was in Guru Nanak Eye Centre for five days. There is a special ward for health care workers, it was really good; a fantastic set-up. For me it was just depression, being stuck in a room with nothing to do but watch the fan rotate... no Wi-Fi, phone signal was not good. I carried my books, my exams were supposed to start on June 16. I was fully prepared, I had my admit card, I knew the exam centre, and then on the 15th evening, they cancelled it. Narang: My quarantine period is also over. We are very uncertain because our exams are not happening. Our contracts were extended till June 30. When will we get a degree? Where will I work? But we understand, the situation is grave. Anyway, I think I’ll go for a run now. (The final-year students’ exams began on July 10).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-peek-inside-covid-war-room-tales-from-the-er/story-46RIYFd1qvzr0RdkCtKjHP.html
12-07-2020||India||NCR areas should follow Delhi: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday appreciated the efforts of the Centre and Delhi government in containing the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the national capital and directed that a similar approach against the pandemic be adopted in the entire National Capital Region, remarks that came at a meeting to review the public health crisis.Delhi recorded 1,781 fresh Covid-19 cases on Saturday, taking the tally in the city to 110,921, while the death toll from the disease climbed to 3,334. On June 23, the national capital reported the highest single-day spike so far of 3,947 cases, but the daily cases have since reduced amid increased testing. “Priority is close monitoring and guiding the containment works in regions where the infection rate is high,” the Prime Minister tweeted after the meeting to take stock of the Covid-19 situation in various parts of the country and the preparedness of state governments.He said there was no room for complacency in the battle against Covid-19, with the review meeting focusing on ramping up testing and keeping the death rate low. The meeting was attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and other senior officials.Shah has held a series of meetings with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and senior officials over the strategy to augment Delhi’s health care infrastructure amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Kejriwal said recently the situation in Capital appeared to have come under control amid joint efforts by the Centre and the Delhi government. Among the efforts launched in Delhi recently were widened testing, a serological survey to gauge the prevalence of the disease and a more refined strategy on containment zones.People aware of the developments said Modi asked for better coordination between the Centre and other states of the National Capital Region during the meeting. This comes weeks after the Union home minister emphasised the need to have a unified strategy in Delhi-NCR to tackle Covid-19, adding that suburbs such as Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad can’t be separated from the Capital in the public health emergency.According to an official, who did not wish to be named, discussions were held on the situation of different states and Union territories including Delhi, supported by data on the Covid-19 outbreak. “The Prime Minister appreciated the concerted efforts of the Centre, State and local authorities in containing the pandemic situation in Delhi. He further directed that similar approach should be adopted with other State Governments in containing the Covid-19 pandemic in entire NCR area,” an official statement by the Prime Minister’s Office said.The Prime Minister said that real-time national monitoring and guidance should be provided to all affected states and places with high test positivity rates.He said that the need to observe personal hygiene and social discipline in public places must be reiterated. “The awareness about Covid should be disseminated widely and a continuous emphasis on preventing spread of the infection should be laid. He (the PM) said that there is no room for any complacency in this regard,” the statement said.The official quoted above said that testing will be intensified for vegetable vendors and grocery sellers as they have a high rate of mobility and interaction with people.The PM’s directions came after NITI Aayog member VK Paul made a presentation on the Covid-19 situation in the country, according to the official. The discussions focused on ramping up tests, with those present stressing that intensified diagnoses can bring down the positivity rates in several places and contain the pandemic, the official added. The meeting discussed how Delhi increased its daily tests to about 22,000 and the positivity rate in the Capital reduced to 10%.Paul’s presentation also spoke of the urgent need to curb the number of deaths, especially in states where case fatality rates have shot up in the recent weeks. The Prime Minister, according to a second official, agreed on the issues raised by Paul. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was a detailed discussion on ways to suppress the transmission of Covid-19. Paul’s presentation suggested that the best way to suppress transmission was to ensure that in at least 80% of the new cases, the patients’ close contacts are traced within 72 hours and kept in quarantine. The Prime Minister also spoke about the need to ensure quality care and that there must be a standard that is followed across the country, the official added.Other suggestions by Paul included revamping India’s ambulance system and monitoring their response time to address the needs of patients, the official said.The “successful example” of surveillance and home-based care through ‘Dhanvantri Rath’ in Ahmedabad was also highlighted, and it was directed that it could be emulated in other places, the statement said.“Also discussed ways to further step-up our capacities to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We also highlighted successful initiatives being undertaken across India to ensure the Coronavirus is kept under check,” Modi said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncr-areas-should-follow-delhi-modi/story-QLqH5zwIrgLaG7dMf8wRJK.html
12-07-2020||India||Current crisis worst of century: RBI||Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das asked banks and finance companies on Saturday to conduct so-called stress tests even as he emphasised that the central bank’s primary focus will be on reviving growth and ensuring the stability of the financial system. The economic fallout of the coronavirus disease pandemic may lead to higher non-performing assets, or bad loans, and capital erosion at Indian banks, he warned, terming the Covid-19 outbreak the worst economic and health crisis in a century.A recapitalisation plan for public sector banks and private banks has become necessary because of the compression in economic growth during and after the Covid-19 lockdown, Das said at the seventh banking and economics conclave organised by the State Bank of India (SBI), stressing the need for banks to raise capital and build cash buffers to ensure credit flow and resilience of the financial system, and to be prepared for more frequent and bigger risk events.“While the NBFC [non-banking financial company] sector as a whole may still look resilient, the redemption pressure on NBFCs and mutual funds needs close monitoring,” Das said at the digital conference, referring to the emerging stress points in the financial system. “Mutual funds have emerged as major investors in market instruments issued by NBFCs, which is why the development of an adverse feedback loop and the associated systemic risk warrants timely and targeted policy interventions.”“Increasing share of bank lending to NBFCs and the continuing crunch in market-based financing faced by the NBFCs and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) also need to be watched carefully,” the RBI governor cautioned.The RBI governor ended his speech on a cautiously optimistic note, saying the financial system was functioning well and the economy had started showing signs of getting back to normalcy after the easing of lockdown restrictions. “It is, however, still uncertain when supply chains will be restored fully; how long will it take for demand conditions to normalise; and what kind of durable effects the pandemic will leave behind on our potential growth.”The need of the hour is to restore confidence, preserve financial stability, revive growth and recover stronger, he added.Das said: “While the multipronged approach adopted by the Reserve Bank has provided a cushion from the immediate impact of the pandemic on banks, the medium-term outlook is uncertain and depends on the Covid-19 curve. Policy action for the medium-term would require a careful assessment of how the crisis unfolds. Building buffers and raising capital will be crucial not only to ensure credit flow but also to build resilience in the financial system.”India’s economy, which was already in the grip of a slowdown when the outbreak began at the end of last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly around the world, grew 3.1% in the quarter ended March from a year ago and 4.2% in the full fiscal year.India’s economy will likely shrink 5% in the year through next March, Goldman Sachs said in a report in the last week of May. The International Monetary Fund has slashed its 2020-21 growth projection for India to 1.9% from 5.8% estimated in January.“We have recently [19th June and 1st July, 2020] advised all banks, non-deposit taking NBFCs [with an asset size of ₹5,000 crore] and all deposit-taking NBFCs to assess the impact of COVID-19 on their balance sheet, asset quality, liquidity, profitability and capital adequacy for the financial year 2020-21. Based on the outcome of such stress testing, banks and non-banking financial companies have been advised to work out possible mitigating measures including capital planning, capital raising, and contingency liquidity planning, among others. The idea is to ensure continued credit supply to different sectors of the economy and maintain financial stability,” Das said in his speech, a transcript of which was posted on the RBI website.The growth woes began much before Covid-19 struck. In September 2018, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd, a major lender to all kinds of businesses, defaulted on its debt obligations, triggering a rippling liquidity crisis in the financial services market. Borrowing costs rose sharply. Private demand began collapsing too.“The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic is unambiguously the worst health and economic crisis in the last 100 years during peace time with unprecedented negative consequences for output, jobs and well-being. It has dented the existing world order, global value chains, labour and capital movements across globe and needless to say, the socio-economic conditions of a large section of world population,” Das said.RBI has cut its key interest rate by 115 basis points (BPs) since the coronavirus crisis began, having pared it by 135 BPs between February 2019 and the onset of the pandemic. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.The liquidity measures announced by RBI since February 2020, after the onset of Covid-19, aggregate to about ₹9.57 lakh crore, equivalent to about 4.7% of the 2019-20 nominal gross domestic product, according to Das, a former civil servant in the central government who was appointed the RBI governor in December 2018 to replace Urjit Patel, who resigned over differences with the government.“Consistent with this [accommodative] policy stance, liquidity conditions were also kept in ample surplus all through since June 2019. The lagged impact of these measures was about to propel a cyclical turnaround in economic activity when Covid-19 brought with it calamitous misery, endangering both life and livelihood of people,” Das said.Heading into the pandemic, the financial system was in a much improved position, owing mainly to various regulatory and supervisory initiatives of the Reserve Bank, he said.“We had put in place a framework for resolution of stressed assets in addition to implementing multiple measures to strengthen credit discipline and to reduce credit concentration. For the five years between 2015-16 and 2019-20, the government had infused a total of ₹3.08 lakh crore in public sector banks. As a result of the efforts by both the Reserve Bank and the government, the overhang of stressed assets in the banking system had declined and capital position had improved,” he said.The overall capital adequacy ratio — an indicator of financial strength expressed as a ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets — of commercial banks was 14.8% in March 2020, compared to 14.3% in March 2019. The ratio of public sector banks had improved from 12.2% in March 2019 to 13% March 2020. The gross non-performing asset ratio and net non-performing ratio of commercial banks was 8.3% and 2.9% March 2020, compared to 9.1% and 3.7% a year ago.Das said the Reserve Bank would reinforce its focus on developing financial institutions’ ability to identify, measure, and mitigate risks. “The new supervisory approach will be two-pronged — first, strengthening the internal defences of the supervised entities; and second, greater focus on identifying the early warning signals and initiate corrective action.”Ram Singh, professor at the Delhi School of Economics, said, “RBI governor has rightly said Covid-19 is the worst health and economic crisis in last 100 years. It has adversely impacted the entire economy. The RBI must take all necessary actions to keep the banking sector healthy, but at the same time it should also ensure smooth flow of credit especially to MSMSe and NBFCs so that the economy will revive expeditiously.”Niranjan Hiranandani, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), said, “Given the unprecedented total shutdown of the Indian economy, no one could guess how the restart would work out. In this reference, the RBI governor’s statement makes perfect sense. Yes, the economy does show signs of getting back to normalcy. India is on the right path, but the destination is yet to be reached, and we all need to work together, keeping the safety precautions as also social distancing norms in place, to restarting India’s economic engine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/current-crisis-worst-of-century-rbi/story-rcXaQuF22jkZWHt9awMa7M.html
12-07-2020||India||Ventilation key to mitigating Covid-19 risk||As the economy opens up, people return to work and transportation and other services resume, there is an increasing focus on optimising ventilation and managing indoor airflows to limit the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in closed spaces.The new coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) primarily spreads when infected people expel infected respiratory droplets when they cough, sneeze, or speak and these are inhaled by others around them. Reversing its earlier position, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently said airborne transmission of the coronavirus is possible indoors, especially when people spend extended periods in crowded and poorly ventilated rooms.An increasing number of outbreaks implicate the role of aerosols in the spread of infection, which can be spread by presymptomatic and symptomatic people. Aerosols are tiny droplets that stay suspended in the air for longer than large droplets.Remodelling and modifying heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems can help lower risk of infection. “Changing settings and design of HVAC systems is useful in reducing transmission. The entry of fresh air and stale air exhaust and filteration are the two key elements. Some people have tried UV, too, but I can’t say whether he UV solution works but the other two do,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, pulmonologist and director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Delhi.Indoor spreadSeveral outbreak investigation reports have shown that Covid-19 transmission is particularly efficient in crowded, confined indoor spaces such as workplaces, restaurants, parties, shopping centres, dorms, cruise ships and transport, according to the European Centre of Disease Control (ECDC) guidance on ventilation of indoor spaces. In a study of 318 outbreaks in China, transmission in all cases except one occurred in indoor spaces, with the only case of outdoor transmission identified in this study involving two people.Studies have shown that the “attack rate” (percentage of people who get infected in an at-risk population) depends on the amount of time spent indoors. Sixty-one people spending two and a half hours in choir practice in Washington, US, led to a 85.2% attack rate, with 52 people getting infected. A call centre in South Korea recorded an attack rate of 43.5% among 216 employees, indicating extensive transmission in a crowded indoor environment. There was no link infection risk and the distance from the index case, which indicated the amount of time spent in contact played a bigger role than proximity.“In labs, we increase the exhaust with maximum fresh air and don’t have crowding even at full occupancy. Currently, the lab occupancy is less than half to ensure social distancing,” said Dr Agrawal.Two outbreaks in China from recirculating air have been documented. In January, 10 people across three families got infected after having lunch in a restaurant without windows in Guangzhou, China. Their tables were more than a metre apart but those infected were sitting along the line of the air-conditioning airflow. The diners in other parts of the restaurant were not infected. People who shared a 100-minute bus ride with patient zero had a 34% attack rate (23 out of 67 passengers), but those sitting close to an open window remained healthy, with the exception of the person sitting next to the index case.Cleaning the airHigh efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters used in aircraft and in health care settings have demonstrated good performance with particles of the Sars-CoV-2 virus size (around 70−120 nm), but their role in buildings outside of health care settings in preventing transmission of infectious diseases is unclear.A NASA study documented HEPA filters stopped particles as small as 0.1 microns, which is the approximate size of the coronavirus, but other direct research is limited, according to a McKinsey paper titled ‘Can HVAC systems help prevent transmission of Covid-19?’ It noted that the official US ratings system specifies the efficacy of HEPA only for particles of 0.3 microns.Among steps suggested by the McKinsey paper to make indoor air safer are configuring ducted HVAC systems to increase the rate of exchange of fresh air to reduce recirculation, enhancing the control of airflow by replacing fixed-speed fan motors with variable-speed ones, allowing smoother adjustments of airflow by using control systems sensitive to pressure, and installing high-performance air-purification systems. HVAC systems can also incorporate ionic purifiers, ozone generators, and other devices for cleaning air, it noted.Cheaper options for airflow management are through the use of a vertical laminar for slow, steady air flow in a straight path to push out potentially contaminated air. “Vertical laminar is used in hospital ICUs, operating rooms and commercial aircraft to minimise contamination, so that the airflow systems direct air from the ceiling to the floor,” said Dr Yatin Mehra, chairman, Medanta Institute of Critical Care and Anaesthesiology, Gurugram. Simpler and cheaper changes include installing air curtains at doors and creating overpressure on the ceiling.The takeway? Recirculated air can spread new coronavirus aerosols through HVAC systems for longer distances within indoor spaces, so there’s a need to lower risk by increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation, and increasing the use of outdoor air. Still, the risk of transmission in crowded indoor remains, which makes it vital to bundle prevention measures, such as wearing masks, social distancing, washing hands, and sanitising indoor spaces||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ventilation-key-to-mitigating-risk/story-1n4HruTKfaEc05rLYtVseN.html
12-07-2020||India||DCGI approves limited use of psoriasis injection for Covid-19||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved restricted emergency use of Itolizumab injection for treating moderate to severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. The approval has been granted based on clinical trial data that has shown promise, officials aware of the matter said.Itolizumab is a monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made proteins that act like human antibodies in the immune system and fight against foreign molecules.The drug is manufactured and marketed by Biocon for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. It has been in use since 2013 under the brand name of Alzumab. This indigenous drug has now been repurposed for Covid-19 treatment.Also Read: ‘50K vials of remdesivir ordered, tie-up with firm for tocilizumab’In a statement, the Union health ministry on Saturday said Biocon presented the phase II clinical trial results generated in Covid-19 patients to DCGI. “The results of these trials were deliberated in the Subject Expert Committee of DCGI’s office. Details of primary endpoint of mortality, other key endpoints of lung function such as improvement in PaO2 and O2 saturation were presented. Key inflammatory markers IL-6, TNFα etc., were presented to have reduced significantly with the drug thereby preventing hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 patients.”Also Read: Health ministry issues revised clinical management protocols for Covid-19 and spurt in casesThe committee looked into the data related to the drug for its impact on Covid-19 patients. “After detailed deliberation and taking into account the recommendations of the Committee, DCGI has decided to grant permission to market the drug under Restricted Emergency Use of the drug for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients due to COVID-19…,” the ministry statement said.The emergency use authorisation involves fulfilment of certain conditions. They include taking informed written consent of patients and apprising them of risks and benefits of the drug and putting a risk management plan in place to manage any adverse effects. The drug is to be given only in hospitals and medical institutions and is not meant for sale at retail pharmacies.“This is done to protect the misuse of [such a] drug as it must be given under strict medical supervision,” said an official in the DCGI’s office.The health ministry said the drug is also cheaper than the other repurposed medicines approved for the treatment of Covid-19. “The average cost of treatment with this indigenous drug is also lesser than comparable drugs that are part of the ‘investigational therapies’ indicated in the clinical management protocol for Covid-19.”The drugs approved for use in Covid-19 treatment in India include antivirals such as remdesivir, and immunosuppressant tocilizumab, steroid dexamethasone, and anti-malarial hyrdoxychloroquine.Medanta Hospital’s critical care department chairman Dr Yatin Mehta said there is no specific medication for Covid-19 at the moment and world over these medicines are being tried to treat hospitalised patients. “However, there are certain contraindications in the use of these medicines. So, the medicine is not for everyone and needs to be started under strict medical supervision.”“Itolizumab is the first novel biologic therapy to be approved anywhere in the world for treating patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 complications. Biocon has repurposed Itolizumab… for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in moderate to severe ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) patients due to COVID-19,” said Biocon Ltd. in a statement.“The approval of Itolizumab, from the DCGI is based on the results from the successful conclusion of a randomized, controlled clinical trial at multiple hospitals in Mumbai and New Delhi. The study focussed on the safety and efficacy of Itolizumab in preventing CRS in moderate to severe ARDS patients due to COVID-19. The primary endpoints for reduction in mortality rate were met and other key secondary endpoints for efficacy and biomarkers were also achieved.”Also Read: NCR areas should follow Delhi: PM ModiKiran Mazumdar-Shaw, executive chairperson, Biocon, said: “As an innovation-led biopharmaceuticals company, I am proud of the successful outcome of the pivotal study we conducted with our novel immuno-modulating anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody, Itolizumab, which has proven to be an efficacious intervention in treating the serious hyper immune response seen with COVID-19. The data is compelling and I am confident that this ‘first-in-class’ biologic will save lives and help reduce the mortality rate in our country.”The drug will be manufactured and formulated as an intravenous injection at Biocon’s bio manufacturing facility at Biocon Park, Bengaluru. The company plans to take this therapy to other parts of the world impacted by the pandemic.“At the time of this COVID-19 pandemic, we do not have any specific treatment for patients who are losing the fight against the disease in spite of best supportive care. Lok Nayak Hospital was one of the sites of the Itolizumab study wherein we used Itolizumab to treat eight patients. These patients did extremely well even with a single dose of Itolizumab. Patients who were with initial oxygen saturation of less than 80% and would have been put on ventilator support with little chance of survival, recovered completely when treated with Itolizumab and got discharged…,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital, in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcgi-approves-limited-use-of-psoriasis-injection-for-covid/story-bkVPzdJ7Y9oaCiX2NJkypO.html
12-07-2020||India||As cases rise, several states impose localised lockdowns||Bengaluru/Guwahati/Lucknow Karnataka, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya on Saturday imposed or extended lockdowns for varying periods in areas reporting alarming surges in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), moves that were aimed at containing clusters and preventing the emergence of fresh hot spots in high-risk areas.The Karnataka government announced a complete week-long lockdown in Bengaluru from Tuesday, while Uttar Pradesh enforced curbs for the weekend to check the spread of the infectious disease. In the North-east, the Assam government extended the Covid-19 lockdown in Guwahati by another week.Assam chief secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna said the 14-day lockdown in the district was scheduled to end at 6pm on Sunday but the district magistrate reported that rising cases may be a major threat to public health, hygiene and safety of the general population.“Due to extensive testing, isolation and other restrictive measures, community spread of Covid-19 has been contained to some extent and this necessitates further extension of prohibitory measures to contain the spread of the pandemic,” he stated.Guwahati city has reported a surge of positive cases with 6,221 since June 24 following which a complete lockdown was imposed in the entire district on June 28.While the Meghalaya government announced a two-day total lockdown in capital Shillong from Monday, the restrictions in Arunachal Pradesh’s capital complex were extended for another week in view of the rising cases. The previous lockdown which was imposed in the capital complex comprising Itanagar, Naharlagun, Nirjuli and Banderdewa on July 6 was scheduled to end at 5 pm on July 13.State governments have been enforcing localised lockdowns amid rising Covid-19 cases even as the Centre issued guidelines around a fortnight back for the second of a three-phase plan to lift restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the disease in March. The Covid-19 cases in the country climbed past the 800,000 mark on Friday.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Saturday announced the week-long hard lockdown in Bengaluru’s urban and rural districts from 8pm on July 14 to 5am on July 22. He said everything would be shut except essential services such as hospitals, pharmacies, milk shops and vegetable and grocery stores. Bengaluru has reported a sharp spike in cases in the recent days, fuelling the outbreak in the southern state.The Karnataka government also released guidelines allowing Resident Welfare Associations, Apartment Owners Associations, as well as companies, to establish Covid-19 care centres. As of July 11 evening, cumulatively 36,216 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the state, which includes 613 deaths and 14,716 discharges, a government bulletin said. Bengaluru urban district tops the list of positive cases, with a total of 16,862 infections.In Uttar Pradesh, roads, markets, commercial establishments and offices were empty across the state as it implemented a lockdown from 10pm on Friday for the weekend. The lockdown will end at 5am on Monday. Expect essential services, everything else will be barred during this period.Municipal bodies across the state also launched a three-day cleanliness drive. A sanitisation drive was carried out in Lucknow’s containment zones and nearby areas. “We have deputed over 600 staff with backpack kits for the sanitisation purpose...,” said Lucknow municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi.In Bihar, 17 out of 38 districts have enforced three- to seven-day lockdowns. The state has reported half of its total cases this month. A lockdown was imposed in Bihar’s capital Patna from Friday.A weekend lockdown began in Odisha in 23 of the 30 districts. The weekend lockdown was imposed in the state’s 11 districts in June. Odisha has reported 57% of its total Covid-19-related deaths this month.The ongoing 14-day lockdown was also extended in Guwahati and rest of Kamrup Metro district by another week beginning Sunday evening. The region has been under total lockdown since June 28.Officials said the lockdown has helped “contain community” spread to some extent and the numbers are showing “encouraging downward trend”, which necessitates further extension of the lockdown.Meghalaya also announced a two-day lockdown in capital Shillong from July 13. Nagaland has also decided to extend the ongoing lockdown in the state till July 31.

12-07-2020||India||After Adhir’s proposal, PAC refuses to study govt’s Covid response||Attempts by Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is also the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament, to get it to study suo motu the government’s response to Covid-19 were not supported by the other members, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The committee met on Friday. It is understood that a scrutiny of the government’s response to the pandemic would have also involved going into the details of Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) and the PM CARES Fund, which was set up essentially to deal with the damage inflicted by the pandemic.Some of the members were of the view that because the government doesn’t fund these relief funds, PAC cannot and should not examine them, the person cited in the first instance added. News agency PTI reported on Friday that members of the PAC, in which BJP enjoys majority, thwarted Chowdhury’s attempt to have the PM Cares Fund examined, claiming that because it wasn’t funded by government, the committee could not do this. “It is not that the PAC has never taken up issues suo motu. It has happened in a few instances. But generally it is done when there is consensus. In this case the proposal hardly got any support,” said the person cited above.“The chairman wanted a few subjects to a be taken up suo motu by the committee. But there was no unanimity or consensus. In fact, there was hardly any support for the proposal.” In the meeting on Friday, the PAC decided to examine various subjects with special focus being given to the CAG report number 5 of 2017, a performance audit of the Sino-India Border Roads, and CAG report number 13 of 2019, which is on the provisioning and procurement of high altitude-clothing, equipment, ration and housing for soldiers.Friday’s meeting of the 22-member PAC was attended by 17 out of 20 members. Two seats on the committee are vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-adhir-s-proposal-pac-refuses-to-study-govt-s-covid-response/story-xDd2HRW5JbT1HOuxoWHUSK.html
12-07-2020||India||Hardik appointed Gujarat Cong working president||The Congress party has appointed Patidar (or Patel community) leader, Hardik Patel, 26, as the working president of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee, perhaps the first time the 135-year-old party has appointed a person so young to such a key position. The move is aimed at injecting some fresh blood into the Gujarat Congress that has been out of power for three decades in the state, and which recently saw a wave of defections. A commerce graduate, Patel hit the headlines in 2015 when he became the face of upper caste dissatisfaction against the BJP government in the state, seeking reservation in educational institutions and jobs for a once-dominant agrarian community. With no political background, Patel was able to mobilise crowds that challenged then chief minister Anandiben Patel’s rule. The violence and protests that ensued led to sedition charges against him but also established him as a man whose Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) was an entity that major parties had to reckon with. Ahead of the elections in December 2017, Patel officially campaigned for the Congress party; he joined it ahead of the Lok Sabha polls last year.”30 years we have been in exile (in the state). I want to travel to 12,000 villages in Gujarat to tell people to forget the mistakes that Congress made, to just give us one more chance,” Patel said over phone soon after his appointment. The Congress was in power since Gujarat was formed in 1960, but has failed to come back to power since Madhav Singh Solanki lost to Chimanbhai Patel in 1990.“We need to reach the people in the state. There are so many issues they have, and we need to highlight how this current government is inefficient,” he added.A senior Congress leader in Delhi said on condition of anonymity that the appointment was also meant to ensure that Patel wouldn’t walk over to the BJP like Alpesh Thakor, the OBC leader who joined Congress around the same time as Patel; he switched over to the BJP last year. Other than Thakor, the party has seen a string of exits and crossovers to the BJP. Ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls last month, three legislators quit while five others did so in March.Patel’s appointment is also part of the Congress’ efforts to address the concerns of the young, a party leader said. “Hardik isn’t just popular in Gujarat but has nationwide appeal among the young. His priorities are jobs and youth issues and these are in perfect unison with the Congress party’s . This (his appointment) part of the new plans we have for the party,’’ said Rajya Sabha MP, Rajeev Satav who was part of the team that worked on the Gujarat polls.The BJP was dismissive about the impact of Patel’s appointment. “He has never been a factor in the state,’’ said BJP’s Mukesh Dixit. “The Congress has a paucity of leaders in the state and that’s why they had to go with him. The Patel community is just 16% in the state so how can he make that much of a difference?’’While the Patels are a minority, they are politically influential. The BJP did win the 2017 elections despite Patel campaigning for Congress, but it was with a significantly reduced margin of 22 seats (it won 99 while the Congress won 77).Now with the BJP, Thakor was much more muted in his response to his peer’s promotion in his former party. “I can only wish Hardik Patel luck in this new assignment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hardik-appointed-guj-cong-working-prez/story-7kD2DwSwYRJkhWov1dK3mO.html
12-07-2020||India||Accused in Kerala gold smuggling case held by NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday detained Swapna Prabha Suresh, the main accused in the Thiruvananthapuram airport gold smuggling case, from a hotel in Bengaluru, officials said.The move has come a day after the agency filed a case under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).Suresh, the officials cited above said, was traced to the hotel in BTA Layout in Bengaluru along with her family. She is currently being questioned under ‘detention’, the officials said. Suresh was absconding since the gold consignment was seized at the airport on July 5.Suresh is likely to be formally arrested “very soon”, an official familiar with the development said.Apart from Suresh, the agency has also detained Sandeep Nair, another accused in the case, from Bengaluru.The central agency had named Suresh, Nair and two others – Sarith and Fazil -- in its FIR registered in connection with the seizure of 30 kg of 24 carat gold worth Rs 14.82 crore by Customs on July 5 purportedly found in baggage meant for UAE’s consulate in Thiruvananthapuram.The agency has said that the matter pertains to “national security” and hence the UAPA law has been invoked in the FIR.The Kerala high court had on Friday deferred Suresh’s bail application.She was working as the operational manager of the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited under the state IT Ministry.In a statement on Friday, the NIA had said that the consignment was camouflaged in diplomatic baggage from UAE that is exempted from inspection as per the Vienna Convention.“As the case pertains to smuggling of large quantity of gold into India from offshore locations threatening the economic stability and national security of the country, it amounts to a terrorist act as stated in section 15 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967,” NIA said.The statement added that the case has national and international linkages and the initial enquiries have revealed that the proceeds of smuggled gold could be used for financing terrorism in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case-held-by-nia/story-ORR3jGNH9PGzHsUYU2e7gO.html
12-07-2020||India||India’s tiger census creates Guinness record||India’s 2018 tiger census has entered the Guinness Book of World Records for being the world’s largest camera trap wildlife survey. For the survey, camera traps were placed at 26,838 locations across 141 different sites. A Union environment ministry statement on Saturday called India’s tiger conservation efforts a “gold standard” for the world. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted, “The All India Tiger Estimation is now in the Guinness World Records for being the largest camera trap wildlife survey, a great moment indeed and a shining example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat.” He also said that India fulfilled its target of doubling tiger numbers four years in advance of its promised 2022 deadline.The 2018 All India Tiger estimation had found 2967 tigers in the country, compared to 2,226 in 2014.The minister also shared an image of the World Record citation on his official Twitter handle. “The fourth iteration of the survey – conducted in 2018-19 - was the most comprehensive to date, in terms of both resource and data amassed. Camera traps (outdoor photographic devices fitted with motion sensors that start recording when an animal passes by) were placed in 26,838 locations across 141 different sites and surveyed an effective area of 121,337 square kilometres (46,848 square miles). In total, the camera traps captured 34,858,623 photographs of wildlife (76,651 of which were tigers and 51,777 were leopards; the remainder were other native fauna). From these photographs, 2,461 individual tigers (excluding cubs) were identified using stripe-pattern-recognition software…,” the citation on the website of the Guinness World Records read.The estimation methodology, however, was criticised by academics for being misleading. A scientific paper titled “How sampling-based overdispersion reveals India’s tiger monitoring orthodoxy” by Arjun M Gopalaswamy from the Indian Statistical Institute, K Ullas Karanth from the Centre for Wildlife Studies, noted tiger expert Mohan Delampady from the Indian Statistical Institute, and Nils C Stenseth from the University of Oslo, in the Journal Conservation Science and Practice on November 4, 2019 flagged photographic manipulation and mathematical flaws with the survey.A major issue, according to the authors, was the use of a survey methodology that relies extensively on models involving an ‘index of tiger abundance’ derived from field counts of tiger signs. The surveys assume that there is a strong relationship between real tiger numbers and their signs, which may not be the case.“The Wildlife Institute of India had applied for this Guinness World Record with our (NTCA) approval soon after the results were declared by the Prime Minister. We stand by our numbers and estimation methodology. In fact, out of the estimated 2967 tigers, 2461 tigers or 83 % of them have been individually captured. If anything, the numbers are conservative,” said Anup Kumar Nayak, former member secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority, who was in charge of the estimation. Nayak retired from his post on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-tiger-census-creates-guinness-record/story-GN7WK7dE0XLG4YuUBtNhBK.html
12-07-2020||India||Vikas Dubey had 22-year-old feud with slain officer||Gangster Vikas Dubey, who was gunned down by the police on Friday, had a long-running feud with deputy superintendent Devendra Mishra, one of the eight officials ambushed by Dubey’s men in Bikru village near Kanpur city, according to a person involved in the investigation into the July 3 attack on the policemen.“The seeds of their rivalry were sown almost 22 year ago when Devendra Mishra was a head constable. Over the years, Mishra rose to the rank of deputy SP,” a Kanpur police inspector said after interacting with Mishra’s family members on Saturday, requesting anonymity.“It was not the first time that Vikas Dubey opened fire on Devendra Mishra. He did a similar act when Mishra was posted as head constable at Kalyanpur police station [close to Bikru village] in December 1998. Mishra survived and opened fire in retaliation, but he missed the target. Dubey was arrested after a scuffle with police personnel in full public view,” said the inspector privy to the investigation.The inspector said records revealed that one Hari Mohan Singh was in-charge of the Kalyanpur police station in Kanpur at that time. In the 1998 firing, Dubey targeted Singh as well. Singh was under political pressure to release Dubey, but eventually the criminal was booked in two separate cases under narcotics act and the arms act. Later, a case was filed under the Gangster Act. These cases are still pending.Mishra was transferred from Kalyanpur after he was promoted to the rank of sub-inspector, and was posted in different police stations in Kanpur and districts. Mishra got promoted as an inspector in 2007 and as a deputy SP in 2016, the inspector said. He returned to Kanpur and took charge as the Bilhaur circle officer some time ago, he added.He said Mishra was aware of Dubey’s history and was going tough on him and his aides. Mishra also kept tabs on Chaubeypur station officer Vinay Tiwari, who has been suspended and arrested after the ambush.Mishra even wrote a letter to the former Kanpur senior superintendent of police, alleging nexus between Dubey and some local policemen. Officials are probing the letter.“The CO got two criminals cases registered against Dubey for extortion, murder and kidnapping since March 13 this year,” the inspector said.Dubey wanted to settle scores with Mishra, the inspector said. A tip-off on an impending raid by a police team to Dubey’s village helped the gangster plan the ambush and kill Mishra, three sub-inspectors and four constables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dubey-had-22-yr-old-feud-with-slain-officer/story-nSFPquoo2P4iDzvIsH12fJ.html
12-07-2020||India||Delhi govt cancels all state university exams amid Covid-19 crisis||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday announced all examinations, including final exams, to be conducted in universities under the city-state’s government stand cancelled in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. The minister added that degrees will be awarded to students on the basis of evaluation parameters decided by the universities. “In light of the major disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Delhi govt has decided to cancel all Delhi state university exams including final exams,” Sisodia tweeted. The move will apply to semester as well as terminal exams at various state universities across Delhi. During a press briefing, Sisodia - who also handles Delhi’s education ministry - said that schools and colleges have been shut throughout amid the Covid-19 crisis. In light of the major disruptions caused by the Coronavirus pandemic, Delhi govt has decided to cancel all Delhi state university exams including final exams https://t.co/g4SFLqaBQK“For schools in Delhi, we had decided not to conduct examinations for classes 9th and 11th and promote them based on other evaluation parameters,” Sisodia stated. “We requested the Central government to follow the same pattern for the CBSE board exams in the national capital and it is finally happening,” he added. The minister added that while the matter with schools was sorted, universities posed another challenge as this entire semester no practicals, field or lab research could be carried out. “Keeping this mind, the Delhi government believes there is no point conducting university examination for a semester where no studies took place,” he said.The education minister added that students who already have job offers need to get their degrees to start working and support their families at the time of an economic crisis created by the pandemic. “Extraordinary times like these call for extraordinary measures,” Sisodia said quoting chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Delhi has several state universities such as Ambedkar University, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi Technological University, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW), National Law University Delhi, among others. This comes after the University Grants Commission (UGC) on Monday announced that universities must conduct exams for final-year students by September. Sisodia said that the government was planning to approach the Centre on the matter.“Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will write a letter to the Prime Minister requesting him to cancel exams for students across all central universities as well,” he said.Delhi’s coronavirus cases have crossed the one-lakh mark and stand at 109,140 of which over 80,000 people have recovered from the infection. Covid-19 death toll in the national capital has jumped to 3,300.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-cancels-all-state-university-exams-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-I1JpeIFzm5dw0zVI50QtiK.html
