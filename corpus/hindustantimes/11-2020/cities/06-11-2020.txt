The revamp involves construction in a plot spread across 32 acres which will be completed in three phases over the next five years.As per the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) plan, the revamp includes upgradation of the hospital to 1,900 beds across 19 storeys, construction of a 25-storey hostel and a 20-storey medical college. It will also include redeveloping staff quarters and a three-storey transit accommodation building. The hospital will also have quarters for nurses and resident medical officers. A senior civic official said, “The reconstruction of the hospital building will be done in phases, so it does not affect the operations as they will continue throughout.”The BMC standing committee is a 26-member statutory body which handles the allotment of tenders and controls the treasury. Few corporators from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who are members of the committee strongly opposed the proposal in Friday’s meeting. Bhalchandra Shirsat, BJP corporator, said, “The work is essential and we are not opposing the work. However, the opposition is to the way this contract was awarded to the bidder. There are irregularities in finalising the contractor for the work.”Ravi Raja, leader of opposition in the civic body and Congress leader, said, “This is such an important proposal for the city. The hospital handles hundreds of patients on a daily basis and its revamp is crucial. Such baseless opposition to the proposal is unnecessary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-s-standing-committee-sanctions-sion-hospital-revamp-proposal/story-8cTBA8KB2DDxdmGcXbcSgN.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||V-Cs are against reopening of colleges and varsities: Maharashtra minister Uday Samant||Vice-chancellors (V-Cs) of all state universities are currently unanimously against reopening universities and colleges, said Maharashtra minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant on Friday. In a press conference, Samant said the state will consider expert opinion before deciding on the status of reopening colleges. “For now, V-Cs are not comfortable with bringing students back to colleges, especially because Covid-19 cases are still on the higher side across the state. We should have a clearer understanding on this topic after Diwali,” Samant said, adding that a meeting will be held between V-Cs of all state universities along with the state disaster management committee for suggestions before announcing the state’s final decision. The press conference was held a day after the University Grants Commission (UGC) released guidelines advising higher education institutes outside containment zones to reopen in phases, starting with PhD/research scholars, then postgraduate students and then final-year undergraduate students. It further clarified that colleges need to ensure that the number of students attending classes on campus at any given time should not be more than half of their total strength. Samant said UGC has left the final decision on reopening colleges to respective state governments. “States have been asked to announce their final decision in this matter after consultation with respective state departments about the current Covid-19 conditions,” he said. He further said that final-year (summer 2020) exams were successfully conducted online across the 13 state universities with over 90% students managing to appear for the exams online. Several universities have also started declaring results for these exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/v-cs-are-against-reopening-of-colleges-and-varsities-maharashtra-minister-uday-samant/story-UiI1al8wEEFmWCMuebHgMP.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||‘My Family, My Responsibility’ survey: 14% of those with cough, fever test positive for Covid-19||Under the door-to-door scheme ‘My Family, My Responsibility’, 14.2% people with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) were found infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. In addition, 23 lakh people across the state have been diagnosed with co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and cancer among others.Since the outbreak of the disease in March, doctors have observed that people with co-morbidities are most susceptible to Covid-19 which mostly affects lungs. These patients are at a higher risk of developing multi-organ failures, which increases the chances of mortality, said doctors. Taking this into account, the state government launched the survey on September 15 to create a health map of all districts. As per the latest data, till October, 27,463,793 houses have been surveyed covering a population of 11.2 crore. In Mumbai, more than 1.5 crore people have been screened under the survey. During the survey, health volunteers have found 357,173 patients with ILI and SARI. These individuals had symptoms similar to Covid-19 such as sneezing, cough, fever, among others. Of them, 322,466 were tested for Covid-19. Of those tested, 51,064 have been diagnosed with the infection with a positivity rate of 15.8%. This is lesser than the state’s cumulative positivity of 18.4% as of November 5.“We have completed covering almost 99% of the households in the state. But as many people have gone back to their hometowns during the lockdown, we haven’t been able to include such migrated residents,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.As many as 115,481 Covid-19 patients were found in home quarantine during the door-to-door survey while 239,473 recovered patients were checked and provided counselling.“This will help to create a health map at micro and macro level of health planning. Now, we know which areas have what kind of patients who can be the most susceptible to Covid-19. Then accordingly, we will design our health schemes and improve our infrastructure,” said Dr Awate.More than one lakh volunteers are working with the state health department to screen individuals by checking temperature and oxygen saturation levels through an oximeter, followed by a set of questions on symptoms, international travel history or exposure to any infected patient, among others. The survey has revealed that hypertension is the most common cause of co-morbidity. As many as 1,308,277 people were diagnosed with hypertension which refers to persistently elevated blood pressure in arteries. Following this, 8.6 lakh people were diagnosed with the diabetes that causes high blood sugar. Also, 73,055 individuals had heart diseases while 17,843 had cancer. Along with this, 106,877 had other ailments including tuberculosis, HIV, organ-related issues among others.“Even after recovery, many are developing post-Covid illnesses. So, this health map will be helpful for the state government for further references,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state’s Covid-19 task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/my-family-my-responsibility-survey-14-of-those-with-cough-fever-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-uRmOwBms0FEq53tjgWyvNI.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Despite spending crores, no respite from stray dog menace in Ludhiana||Even though the Ludhiana municipal corporation has spent over Rs 4 crore on stray dog sterilisation in the last past five-and-a-half years, there is no respite from dog bite cases in the city.The stray dog population has been on a continuous rise even as the civic body claims to have sterilised over 50,000 dogs since 2015, when the project was started. The recent incident in Tajganj area wherein an eight-year-old boy was viciously attacked by a pack of stray dogs without any provocation, has resulted in an uproar among residents, who have raised questions on the working of the civic body. The victim’s father, Amanpreet Singh said, “My son suffered injuries on his legs and back in the attack, and had to undergo a surgery. But the civic body doesn’t seem concerned. It has still not taken any steps to ensure the safety of residents.” Swaranjit Singh, a resident of Dugri Phase 2, said, “Sometimes it becomes difficult for us to step out of the house as there are four to five dogs roaming around on the streets. The MC should find a concrete solution to this problem.”On Friday, residents of SBS Nagar Block-E submitted a complaint against the menace to the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT). Arvind Sharma, a resident, said, “A large number of stray dogs can be spotted in the area, many of which try to attack the residents. The Tajganj area incident has left the residents, especially the women and children in the locality, worried.” The dog sterilisation project was commenced in February 2015 and the MC was paying Rs 760 per dog to the private company involved in the project till December 2018.The MC had entered into a new contract with the same company in January 2019 and the rate was revised to Rs 990 per dog. As per the officials, over 50,000 dogs have been sterilised in the city so far at a cost of Rs 4 crore.Requesting anonymity, an official said that even after sterilising a large number of dogs, the MC has not received a positive response from residents due to the frequent dog bite incidents. The main reason behind this is that the MC has failed to follow the ward-wise schedule while sterilising the dogs. “The target cannot be achieved if MC teams are sent to different wards every day as they should be allowed to focus on just one ward at a time. The number of complaints being received by the civic body is also not decreasing,” the official said.Dog sterilisation stalled due to shortage of manpower:Meanwhile, amid the rising dog bite cases, the city’s dog sterilisation project being taken up at the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Centre at Haibowal Dairy Complex has come to a halt due to lack of manpower.Work has been stalled since the last week of September when the workers and doctor involved in the project left citing personal reasons. This is the second time that the project has been affected in the last three months. It was also stopped in August due to a shortage of workers.Mayor Balkar Sandhu conducted an inspection at the ABC centre on Friday and said that the dog sterilisation process will be restarted in the city from Saturday. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The project came to halt due to the exodus of labourers following the pandemic outbreak. The project will be restarted on Saturday, with focus on areas from where frequent complaints have been coming. The MC is also working to expand the project under the Smart City mission so that more dogs could be sterilised on a daily basis. A new building is being established for the purpose.” MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “I have sought a report from the officials concerned regarding the project so that necessary steps can be taken to restart the sterilisation project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-spending-crores-no-respite-from-stray-dog-menace-in-ludhiana/story-cKZFLpMx0h696OVWuyrMEL.html

06-11-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC intervention ensures visually-impaired BMC employees get funds for Diwali||After the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) informed the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday that it could not comply with its October 28 order to pay the first instalment of salary arrears to its 250 visually-impaired employees before Diwali, the court insisted that the civic authority pay some sizeable amount to the aggrieved employees so that they may be able to enjoy Diwali. The civic body thereafter informed the court that it would pay a sum of ₹15,000 to the employees before Diwali and pay the remaining arrears along with the December salary. The court accepted the undertaking and kept the interim application pending for compliance till the next hearing on November 24. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the interim application filed by the BMC in the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the National Association of the Blind (NAB), was informed by civic body’s advocate, Kejali Mastakar that the application was filed to seek an extension of time to implement the October 28 order of the HC. On October 28, while disposing of the PIL filed by NAB, the bench had held that the BMC was responsible for its employees, and as they had been exempted by the civic authority from attending duty due to the pandemic situation, they deserved to be paid their salaries. The court had directed the BMC to pay the salary arrears of the visually-impaired employees who were not paid since July, in two instalments – the first instalment being before Diwali, and the second after the festival. While expressing its inability to comply with the HC order, Mastakar submitted that as the salaries of employees are generated through the SAP platform, the civic authorities could not bypass it. He said that the BMC needed time to reset the attendance of the employees. The court, however, insisted that the BMC commissioner find a way to pay the disabled employees so that they may enjoy Diwali. After taking instructions, Mastakar informed the court that the assistant municipal commissioner had confirmed that the employees would be paid ₹15,000 before Diwali, and after the technical problem is resolved, the salary arrears would be paid along with the December salary. After hearing the undertaking, the court said, “We hope and trust that in the meanwhile, the municipal corporation shall do its best to release payments to the physically-disabled employees, notwithstanding that there have been impediments in the process of disbursement of salary as depicted in the application.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-intervention-ensures-visually-impaired-bmc-employees-get-funds-for-diwali/story-8MWW3yyQIiWZAsAr5vhVWL.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||Active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra drop to 102,099, lowest in state since July 12||The tally of active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra dropped to 102,099 — lowest in almost four months — on Friday as the number of daily new infections has gradually dropped and recoveries has steadily risen. Before Friday, the state’s lowest active cases count was 103,516 on July 12. The active cases tally rose to 301,752 on September 17 — highest since the first Covid-19 cases was reported in the state in March — and dropped to 196,288 on October 14, before further dipping in the past three weeks. As of Friday, Pune has highest number of active cases (22,717), followed by Mumbai (16,817) and Thane (15,087). The state reported 5,027 new cases and 161 deaths on Friday, taking its tally up to 1,710,314 and toll to 44,965. The number of recovered Covid-19 patients rose to 1,562,342 with an addition of 11,060 on Friday, pushing up the state’s recovery rate to 91.35%.Of the 5,027 cases reported on Friday, Mumbai had the most infections at 792, followed by Pune district at 642, Nashik at 467 and Nagpur at 337. Of the fatalities, 22 were from Mumbai, 17 from Pune, 14 from Solapur and Kalyan-Dombivli reported six deaths. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) stood at 2.63%.Meanwhile, the state health department during a presentation before the cabinet on Thursday projected a rise in cases after Diwali. “Coinciding with a drop in temperature owing to the winter and opening up of more activities in the state there could be a rise in cases. The winter season is expected to witness cold waves in northern parts of the country. It will have an impact in Maharashtra like we witnessed in 2015. Since the virus survives for more time in cold temperature, there could be a spike in cases. Urban areas may see more cases than rural areas because of the density of population,” said an official, on condition of anonymity. State health minister Rajesh Tope, too, had said on Thursday that the state is prepared to face a surge in cases as they have an adequate number of beds, ventilators, medicines, drugs, and other equipment. According to data, which were presented before the cabinet, the state’s doubling rate was 217.69 days on November 4 as against 36.31 days on August 31. The weekly average of the growth rate dropped to 0.32% on November 4 from 1.31% on September 30, 3.32% on June 30 and 27.2% on March 31. The weekly CFR, too, dropped to 2.03% during October 28-November 3 period from 2.67% during October 14-20 period. The number of daily tests dropped from 73,317 three weeks ago on October 16 to 64,485 tests on November 4, stated the presentation, adding that the state government reached out to 27,463,793 households of total 27,633,982 families during the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ drive and it helped trace 51,064 Covid-19 cases. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said authorities have been working on two fronts to tackle the potential second wave. “We have been creating awareness among people for the adoption of Covid-appropriate behaviour and at the same time, augmenting our health infrastructure. During the peak time (first two weeks of September), there were more than 3 lakh active patients in the state. We are ramping up infrastructure and logistics for 10% more patients than during the peak period. All district authorities have been given fortnightly projections, asking them to ramp up the infrastructure,” he said.Awate said the drop in daily testing is owing to decrease in cases of influenza like illness (ILI) and Covid-19 infections and suspected contacts. “The daily tests have dropped to 70,000 from 85,000 few weeks ago. We are still conducting more than 250 tests per million per day against the World Health Organisation’s mandate for 140/mn/day tests. But at the same time, we are targeting the ‘super spreaders’ from whom the possibility of spread of the virus is more. Our drive to trace and track the suspected segments and outreach program My Family, My Responsibility have helped us in covering more than 90% of the population,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/active-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-drop-to-102-099-lowest-in-state-since-july-12/story-GphGI2xNN3xo4dWhQyttYL.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government plans to reopen schools for Classes 9 to 12 on November 23: Education minister||The state education department plans to reopen schools for Classes 9 to 12 on November 23, education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced on Friday. “We have proposed a phased reopening of schools post Diwali break, as the government is trying to unlock various sectors in the state. The idea is to start with higher classes first, and for this we have drafted detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs). The draft SOPs are submitted for the chief minister’s approval,” said Gaikwad in a statement. Parents said many will still be sceptical to send their children to schools. “Parents are worried about sending their children until there is a vaccine or Covid-19 cases go down substantially. They will not want to take any risks when it comes to the health of the children. The government should explore flexible options of online and offline learning,” said Anu Sinha, a parent from Thane. Gaikwad said care will be taken to ensure that all safety protocols, as suggested by the central and the state government, shall be followed while reopening schools. “The government will ensure that appropriate measures are in place for the safety of students and teachers in schools,” Gaikwad added. On Friday, HT had reported the government’s plans of conducting Class 10 and 12 board exams in May. In June, the education department submitted SOPs on online learning which also consisted of plans for physical reopening of schools. However, with the Centre’s decision of not starting schools until October, schools in the state could not reopen. Now with the Diwali break approaching, the government plans to reopen schools only by the end of November. As per previous SOPs, school management committees were asked to consider options like shift-wise running of schools, staggering school timings, changing seating arrangement in classrooms, disinfecting schools, not allowing crowding in buses, etc. Similarly, local administrations were asked to ensure sanitisation of schools and screening of teachers and students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-plans-to-reopen-schools-for-classes-9-to-12-on-november-23-education-minister/story-O51pgjva03PP1bbZZ5BgdK.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government proposes reservation change of plot at Kanjurmarg for Metro car shed||The Maharashtra government on Friday proposed to change the reservation of the contentious 43.76-hectare Kanjurmarg plot for “Metro car depot and allied uses”. The plot is at the centre of a row between the state and Union governments after the former moved the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) car shed there from Aarey Milk Colony, which was picked by the previous BJP-led government in Maharashtra to construct the depot. Nirmal Chaudhari, under-secretary, urban development department (UDD) of the state government issued a notification on Friday to change the Kanjurmarg plot’s reservation and has invited suggestions and objections from the public over the proposal. The plot has reservations for various public purposes, including affordable housing, police staff quarters, garden/park, and municipal school, among others in the Draft Development Plan 2034 and Development Control and Promotion Regulation 2034.The land parcel is proposed to be transferred to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which in December 2018 had requested the state government for its allotment to build the car shed. A row over the ownership of the plot erupted recently after the Central government’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) said that the land belongs to it. In a letter to Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, the department contended that the saltpan land is remit of the Salt Commissioner, who reports to DPIIT. This led to a clash between the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Agadhi (MVA) government – comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress – and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-proposes-reservation-change-of-plot-at-kanjurmarg-for-metro-car-shed/story-AmPpCwmMIG03ac8VyBSg7H.html

While goods and machinery at Kabir Clothing Company were gutted, major tragedy was averted as the staff was on its lunch break when the fire broke out. Around 30 labourers, who were working at the factory, had gone for lunch at 1pm. Around 1.15pm flames were spotted on the first floor of the building and alarm was raised. It took firefighters two hours to bring the blaze under control. Lack of ventilation and heat within the factory hampered efforts to douse the flames. Firefighters said no fire-safety arrangements had been made by the owners. Owner Amit Puri said, “The fire was caused due to a short circuit. Fortunately, no injury or casualty was reported as the labour was out for lunch. Goods and machinery have perished. The exact loss is yet to be ascertained.”Sub-fire officer (SFO) Maninder Singh said, “Five fire tenders were rushed to the spot. The firefighters were able to restrict the flames to the first floor and no damage was reported on the ground or second floor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/blaze-breaks-out-in-ludhiana-clothing-unit/story-Gbpf88wMwCz8OIh7lOARvM.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro-3 car shed: Why pick Aarey if experts favoured Kanjurmarg, Congress questions Fadnavis government’s move||In a fresh round of clash between the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the ruling party has asked why former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis chose Aarey Colony over Kanjurmarg, even after an expert committee was in favour of the latter. The BJP has, however, questioned if it was an attempt of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress, to open up the saltpan land for its transfer to private parties and developers. Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the Fadnavis government had been misleading the people of the city, by saying that Kanjurmarg land was under dispute. He said the government machinery has time and again clarified that the piece of land belongs to the state and there was no dispute pending. He said constructing the car shed at Kanjurmarg was originally the Fadnavis government’s plan, which was being implemented by the MVA government. Sawant has also questioned shifting the proposed shed to Aarey Colony. “The fact that the 102-acre land at Kanjurmarg belongs to the state government was endorsed by Mumbai suburban collector, divisional commissioner of Konkan and then revenue minister Chandrakant Patil as the quasi-judicial authorities between 2014 and 2018. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) had written to the collector in September 2015 for allotment of the land for the car shed. The expert committee appointed by the Fadnavis government had recommended integration of Metro line 3 and 6 by setting up a car shed at Kanjurmarg. A tender for the entry ramp at Kanjurmarg was also floated in 2018 by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. The Fadnavis government kept claiming falsely that the shed at Kanjurmarg will lead to an additional burden of ₹5,000 crore,” he said. Sawant said if the MVA government could build an integrated car shed for Metro lines 3, 4, 6 and 14, then why could the previous government not take a decision over the transfer of land for the car shed at Kanjurmarg. BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar, however, rubbished the allegations. “Only after our government realised that it was not possible to vacate the stay on the transfer that we decided to go to the car shed at Aarey. The expert committee headed by Manoj Saunik had recommended the alternative of the Aarey land for the car shed. The shifting of the shed to Kanjurmarg will delay the Metro project by more than four more years as two years will be required to level the land and two more for the actual construction. This will also result in escalation of the project cost by ₹4,000 crore,” he said. Shelar alleged the decision of the transfer of land for the government project will also make way for transfer of other plots to private parties. “Such transfer of salt pan land costing at least ₹50,000 crore will prove beneficial to private persons and developers. This is the beginning of a huge land scam,” he said. Shelar has also dared environment minister Aaditya Thackeray for a debate on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-3-car-shed-why-pick-aarey-if-experts-favoured-kanjurmarg-congress-questions-fadnavis-government-s-move/story-mt9vworbwYahw4LkBHDcjP.html

However, MFB is yet to confirm the cause of the fire as investigations are ongoing.“During firefighting at City Centre Mall [in Mumbai Central], it was observed that the fire-fighting system was non-functional. In this regard, appropriate action is under process against the licence agency,” MFB said in its response to questions raised by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) standing committee. “After inspection by the compliance team of the BMC, a notice was issued by us in October 2019, and the mall management had submitted its compliance reply in November 2019,” the MFB added.The fire brigade mentioned that while its investigation into the fire incident is ongoing, the BMC is also undertaking a probe to ascertain how many shops inside the mall were illegal, if any.A spokesperson for City Centre Mall did not comment on the MFB’s reply.MFB stated that post the Kamala Mills fire in December 2018, all malls and large establishments in the city are inspected, and compliance notices are sent to them from time to time.On October 22, a level-one fire was reported in a shop on the second floor of the mall at 8.53pm. It soon spread to other floors and the fire brigade declared it a level-five blaze – a rare event in which the chief fire officer is required to be present – at 2.42am. Overall, five fire officers, including a deputy fire officer, were injured while fire-fighting. MFB had used 203 fire tankers for freighting at the spot with more than 250 firefighters.Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party corporator and standing committee member, said, “I had complained about the unsafe condition at the mall around one year ago but despite this, the incident took place. I am demanding that a criminal investigation department (CID) inquiry be undertaken into the matter.”Javed Juneja, Congress corporator and a standing committee member, said, “The fire-fighting system didn’t function, and the MFB has said they had inspected the mall last year. If there was an inspection, and compliance was proper, why was the fire-fighting system non-functional?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fire-fighting-system-at-city-centre-mall-was-non-functional-mumbai-fire-brigade/story-EEmbufHmJ1SxNTVZWB7p4H.html
06-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020 : Final round of Bihar voting today||78 of the 243 assembly constituencies in Bihar are voting in the third and the last phase of the state elections on Saturday. Here are factors unique to this phase:Anti-incumbency factorThe same party has won the last two elections in a majority of constituencies (40 out of 78) going to the polls in the third phase. Of them, 33 were won by parties that are part of the current state government. This makes the anti-incumbency factor significant in this phase of the election. Click here to read the full coverage of Bihar Assembly 2020 electionsThe Muslim factorMuslims comprise nearly 17% of Bihar’s population. Regions voting in the third phase of the assembly elections are home to nearly half of the state’s Muslim population. Every fourth person in this region is a Muslim, making Muslims significant in terms of electoral politics in this phase. Also read | Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Who will get hold of Muzaffarpur this time?But a large chunk of the Muslim population is concentrated in a few districts. Of the 15 districts going to the polls, Muslims have a majority share in population in only one district, Kishanganj. They comprise 38%-45% in three other districts – Katihar, Araria and Purnea. The Kishanganj district has only four constituencies, while the other three districts comprise 20 constituencies. This makes Muslim vote significant in only a few areas of the region. The Muslim population does affect the performance of the parties, but not to a large degree. This is evident in the performance of the parties in the last two assembly elections. In the 2010 assembly polls, the National Democratic Alliance did well across the region but its seat share was lower in the four districts where Muslims have a share of more than 38%. In the 2015 assembly polls, the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led alliance (which included Congress) did better across the region but had a higher seat share in these Muslim-dominated districts. In case of the Congress, the party’s performance in Muslim districts was significantly better than in other districts. Also read: On Nitish Kumar’s ‘last election’ remark, JD(U) leaders say retirement not on his mindBest turnout recordIn all assembly and Lok Sabha elections held since 2010, the regions going to the polls in the third phase have always had a higher voter turnout. Last year, in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the third-phase region recorded 62% turnout, compared to 56% in the second-phase region and 53% in the first-phase region. But within the third-phase region, the turnout has always been higher in four Muslim-dominated districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-final-round-of-bihar-voting-today/story-C5d7nNbrwJ4vEP4COs0PoI.html

The rate of interest for the loan is less than 1%.The loan, said to be the highest amount issued by the company for an Indian project, will be utilised for procuring rolling stock, implementing the integrated ticketing system and multimodal integration for the 35-km line expected to cost a total of ₹15,000 crore. The civil construction cost for the project will be borne by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). The agreement between KfW and the Maharashtra government was sealed on Friday at Sahyadri Guest House at Malabar Hill. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray attended the meeting virtually. “It is a big day for us. The travelling experience of Mumbaiites will be enriched once the entire Metro network is complete,” said Thackeray. State urban development minister Eknath Shinde said that the Maharashtra government is committed to completing the project on time. The line is expected to be completed in October 2022. While 20% of the Metro-4 work has been completed, Metro-4A has achieved 6% progress. RA Rajeev, MMRDA commissioner said, “MMRDA has built a reputation over the years by successfully completing infrastructure projects and simultaneously meeting all financial commitments, even during the pandemic.” MMRDA is implementing a Metro network of 337km in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Currently, 180km of construction is in progress. Kanjurmarg plot belongs to Maha: Shinde Shinde on Friday said that the Kanjumarg plot, where the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has planned to construct the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) car shed, belongs to Maharashtra. The Central government has contested the state government’s claim on the plot. Shinde said, “We are not stopping works at the site. The land belongs to the Maharashtra government, and soil testing works have started at the plot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fillip-for-mumbai-s-metro-4-4a-as-4-000-crore-loan-approved/story-eDlSm2CLen3LJqqH0wskGI.html
06-11-2020||Gurugram||Cops question parents of 26-year-old woman who was shot by suspected robbers||The police on Friday night recorded the statement of the parents of the 26-year-old Pooja Sharma, who was shot in the head by three masked men during a suspected robbery attempt near Golf Course Extension Road on Tuesday night. Sharma, who died on Wednesday while undergoing treatment at a private hospital, was returning home in her car with her fiancé, Sagar Manchanda, when the incident took place, said the police.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that they have recovered the mobile phone of Sharma and have scanned it to know if anyone was troubling her or if there could be any other motive of her murder. “The phone will be sent to Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Madhuban, Karnal, for further scanning. We are also scanning the call details of Sharma and Manchanda to check if anyone was troubling them or had threatened them in the past. We are looking at all angles to ensure the suspects are arrested at the earliest,” he said, adding that Sharma worked with an IT company in Sector 38 in medical claims and insurance department. Sarita Sharma, mother of the victim, said in her statement to the police that her daughter had returned from Chhattisgarh to Gurugram on October 25 and was working from home. “She lived in Dwarka with her uncle and on Tuesday she had to collect her laptop from her company in Sector 48 and got late. She called me and sought my permission to meet Sagar Manchanda, who was her fiancé. They had dinner at a restaurant and went out for a long drive towards the Delhi-Jaipur highway. On their way, Manchanda suggested having a look at his apartment, which is under construction in Sector 65 where they a spent few minutes. The incident took place afterward,” she statedRavinder Sharma, who is the father of the victim and is a businessman by profession, stated that he had received a call from Manchanda, informing them of the incident. They took the first flight to Delhi and visited the hospital but could not talk to his daughter since she had not gained consciousness yet. “Pooja was my elder daughter; I have a son and another daughter who lives with us in Raipur. She was ambitious and came to Gurugram one-and-a-half years ago after she was offered a job in an IT company in Sector 48. She had no personal enmity and never discussed with us if she was facing any issues,” he said.Sharma had been on a ventilator since she was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday night and had not gained consciousness, said the police, adding that her family arrived from Raipur in Chhattisgarh on Wednesday morning.The doctors who treated Sharma told police that she was bleeding from the right side on the back of the head (right occipital region). She was put on ventilator support due to low oxygen and was under the care of a neurosurgery team. “On Thursday, around 2 pm, the patient had a cardiac arrest for which immediately cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started but despite resuscitation, the patient could not be revived and declared dead at 2.33 pm (sic),” stated a document released by the hospital.A board of doctors conducted the post-mortem examination of Sharma on Friday and her body was handed over to the cousin brother of the deceased, the police said, adding that the body was taken to their home town for cremation by flight.Dr Deepak Mathur, forensic expert, Civil Hospital, Gurugram, who conducted the post-mortem examination, said she died due to firearm injury. “A 9mm bullet was hit on the back of the right side of the ear and was stuck in the head. The bullet could not be removed despite the surgery and her right-side brain was damaged,” he said.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that there were 48 CCTV cameras on the stretch out of which 36 were operational. They have also scanned footage of service lane and crossings but they are yet to identify the suspects. “The 10 teams are investigating and have recovered some leads which could lead to the arrest of the suspects. We are conducting raids at several locations to find some missing dots in the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-question-parents-of-26-year-old-woman-who-was-shot-by-suspected-robbers/story-ejerDvV1CwGnIJZ9XK2WHL.html
06-11-2020||Gurugram||With 704 new Covid-19 cases, Gurugram reports highest single-day spike||The district recorded its highest single-day spike of Covid-19 cases with 704 new infections on Friday, indicating a rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.The number of daily positives reported in Gurugram has been steadily inching up in recent weeks — a phenomenon that the district officials ascribe to the reopening of outdoor activities, increased mobility, and a rush in markets due to Diwali. In the seven-day period, the district has averaged 536 positive tests per day. Earlier this week, Gurugram was seeing an average of around 379 positive tests per day.Between October 31 and November 6, the weekly positivity rate — the ratio of positive cases to the total number of tests conducted — jumped from 15% to 16.6%. As reported by HT earlier, a positivity rate of more than 15% is moderately high as a higher positivity rate suggests higher chances of transmission among people who have not been tested.The number of total infections also surpassed 33,000, just two days after the tally hit 32,000. On Friday, the total count of infected patients reached 33,255, out of which 28,469 have recovered from the illness and 4,562 are currently undergoing treatment, as per the health bulletin. Nearly 93.4% of patients are currently home isolated and 6.4% of the seriously ill patients are undergoing treatment at various hospitals. Two Covid-19 deaths have also been reported, taking the toll to 224.The sudden spike in Covid-19 cases has prompted the district health department to ramp up testing efforts. For the past two consecutive days, more than 4,000 daily Covid-19 tests have been administered in the district. On Friday, 4,158 samples were collected, including 3,422 Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and 736 rapid antigen tests. Compared to Delhi, Gurugram has a higher proportion of RT-PCR tests as compared to the antigen test.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that new infections are likely to reach 1,000 in the next few days. “Spike in the number of Covid cases will continue until the end of Diwali. Testing has been increased to check the prevalence of infections. The uptick in Covid-19 cases has been a cause of concern as people are no longer taking the deadly disease seriously.”As reported by HT on Thursday, experts have said that nearly 75% of the urban population is vulnerable to the infection. According to the second round of the serological survey, more than 26% have developed antibodies against the infection.Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine department and school of public health, PGIMER-Chandigarh, said, “Daily testing of 4,000 samples is not a small number. However, the increase in the positivity rate is a serious issue now. It shows that the infection is spreading rapidly. It can further increase if the transmission is not controlled. People should avoid any unnecessary movement now. Those living in high-risk areas should get themselves tested. If proper precautions are taken then its impact would be seen in the next 15 days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/with-704-new-covid-19-cases-gurugram-reports-highest-single-day-spike/story-k0Fl4xLGpJgZphEE2L9BSN.html
06-11-2020||Gurugram||Air quality improves slightly as winds transport pollutants eastward||Gurugram’s air on Friday remained in the ‘very poor’ category, with the AQI (air quality index) recorded at 392, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin. This was a slight improvement from the previous day’s AQI of 443, in ’severe’ category — the first instance of the air turning toxic this winter season. Experts attributed Friday’s improved AQI to prevailing north-westerly winds, which are transporting Gurugram’s pollution load eastward, into Delhi and beyond towards Uttar Pradesh. As a result, Gurugram was the only major NCR city on Friday to have ‘very poor’ air, while Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and even Faridabad continued to have ‘severe’ air quality, recording AQIs above 400. A marginal improvement is expected across these cities in the next 24 hours, due to increased wind speed across Delhi-NCR, a forecast by CPCB’s central control room for air quality management showed. “With winds originating from the north and west of Delhi and blowing east, some of the pollutants which accumulated in and around Gurugram on Thursday dispersed> The wind speed which increased and touched around 12kmph on Friday afternoon also helped,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist, who said that Gurugram’s air quality may remain in the upper end of the ‘very poor’ category on Saturday. “It can also easily slip back into a severe situation if there is a drop in temperature,” Panwar added. However, officials and experts both said that any further improvement in the region’s air quality is unlikely in the short term, with no major weather systems — in the form of Western Disturbances — expected for at least two weeks. “With the monsoon having departed, anti-cyclonic winds are circulating over north India, creating a high-pressure zone. High pressure zones tend to see stagnant weather and little activity in terms of rain or wind, so the current situation is likely to persist throughout November, as per long-range forecasts,” said Navdeep Dahiya, a Rohtak-based meteorologist. Dr Sumita Sharma, director of the climate change and earth sciences division at TERI, agreed, adding, “This forecast is not good news. Without any major weather activity, we should ready ourselves for a bad air Diwali. The past few days have also recorded an increase in the count of farm fires west of Delhi, smoke from which is slowly moving eastward. Together, these sources will further aggravate the present situation.” Of four official monitors in Gurugram, just one continued to record severe quality air even on Friday — the continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) in Sector 51. From an AQI of 458 on Thursday, air quality in the vicinity of this monitor (which lies just off the southern peripheral road, near Samaspur village) jumpe to 459 on Friday evening, Meanwhile, the city’s three other monitoring stations all recorded improvements in both overall AQI and particulate matter pollution on Friday.Officials attributed this to a high prevalence of local emissions sources in and around Sector 51. “Due to availability of open spaces, dumping of waste and open fires are an issue there. There is also a larger presence of road dust in that area. We will try to mitigate these by increasing patrolling, water sprinkling and dust sweeping in the region,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-improves-slightly-as-winds-transport-pollutants-eastward/story-ydgCo5BLYDL8HAuU6lY0rN.html
06-11-2020||Gurugram||GMDA to tie-up with DLF to build five pedestrian bridges on Golf Course Road||Almost four years after Golf Course Road (GCR) was redesigned to facilitate smooth movement of traffic, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and DLF are together planning to construct five pedestrian bridges on a 5.5km-long stretch of the road, said officials on Friday.In 2017, the 10km stretch between Ghata T-point and Shankar Chowk — including the seven-kilometre-long GCR — was redesigned to make it a signal-free, along with seven underpasses. Soon after its opening, the stretch came under criticism from road safety experts on the lack of pedestrian amenities and high-speed collisions. Apart from staircases and escalators of the four Rapid Metro stations on the stretch, there is no other pedestrian amenity to cross from one side of the GCR to the other. Despite the entire median being fenced, hundreds of pedestrians and cyclists either jump over the fencing or use the gaps between them to cross the thoroughfare against high-speed traffic daily. The five spots for the construction of pedestrian bridges on the 5.5km stretch between Bristol Chowk and AIT Chowk, along Raghvendra Marg on GCR are as follows: Bristol Chowk, MPD Tower, Paras Downtown, Vipul Belmonte and Time Tower. GMDA has now put up the proposal on its official website for public feedback. Officials said that as per the design plans, the pedestrian bridges have been planned in such a manner that it would ensure that pedestrians have a facility to cross GCR after a distance of every 400 metres.JS Sindhu, engineer, traffic, GMDA, said that the plan is to build pedestrian bridges with escalators to ensure that people can cross the road with ease. “The bridges will help people cross the road safely. These are being built at locations, which have large number of pedestrians crossing the road. The commuters will have the option to take the help of a pedestrian bridge within 350 to 400 metres on either side,” Sindhu said, adding that a joint team of officials from different agencies had conducted an inspection of the sites and the proposal has also been uploaded on GMDA website for public feedback. On Wednesday, a joint team of GMDA, Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), Gurugram Police, and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) also visited each of the five spots to analyse if the existing project designs are in sync with the requirements on-ground and to take a stock of utilities that may come in the way of the project. The team members will now give their respective feedbacks to DLF for implementation.Officials of DLF, the caretaker of GCR, said that barring Bristol Chowk, where the length of the bridge is proposed to be 450 metres, all the remaining bridges would be 350 metres in length, with elevators on each ends. Each pedestrian bridge is expected to cost around ₹3.5 crore, and the total project cost is expected to be around ₹15 crore, with DLF proposing the construction of the bridges as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. DLF officials further said that four of the five bridges would be constructed by DLF while the one at Bristol Chowk would be constructed by GMDA. However, the construction costs would be borne by DLF.“Our teams carried out a survey of Raghvendra Marg, based on which we decided to construct pedestrian bridges on all black spots along the stretch. We have submitted a proposal to GMDA, and they are currently seeking no -objection certificates (NOCs) from concerned public departments regarding the utilities coming in the way of the project. Once DLF gets approval from GMDA, construction will commence immediately and the project will be completed in six to seven months,” said Gayatri Paul, director, programmes, DLF foundation.After finding inadequate pedestrian amenities on GCR, the district administration’s road safety committee had recommended the implementation of pedestrian-friendly measures at eight key crossings on the GCR in July last year. As per a Haryana Vision Zero (HVZ) report, pedestrians and cyclists account for 45% of all road fatalities on GCR. Between 2017 and 2019, there have been 40 road fatalities recorded on GCR of which, 14 were pedestrians, four cyclists, two four-wheeler users, 17 two-wheeler users, and three three-wheeler users.“A high volume of cyclists use GCR every day. Authorities, therefore, need to ensure that the five proposed bridges are designed in such a manner that cyclists too can avail them. Similar to the pedestrian bridges in Delhi, the proposed bridges here should be designed with slopes instead of a staircase as it will not only allow cyclists to use the infrastructure but also be wheelchair-friendly,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, program coordinator, Haryana Vision Zero (HVZ).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-to-tie-up-with-dlf-to-build-five-pedestrian-bridges-on-golf-course-road/story-mBRCd9QkG32p5CyKpa4eYL.html
06-11-2020||Gurugram||1.4% of Covid-19 recovered patients have donated plasma since July: Data||Only about 1.4% people who recovered from Covid-19 in the district have come forward for plasma donation, as per the health department data. Though there are more than 28,000 recovered patients who have developed antibodies against the infection, only about 400 of them approached the Rotary Blood Bank in Sector 10, where the plasma donation started on July 27. Out of the 400, only 245 were found fit to donate plasma for critically ill Covid-19 patients. Government officials, however, said that there has been an improvement in the response towards the donation. According to them, at least 21 recovered patients have donated plasma twice. In plasma therapy, blood is taken from a Covid-19 recovered person who has developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Through centrifugation, the liquid part of the blood, called plasma, is separated. It contains antibodies, which are transfused in the coronavirus-infected person, boosting the immune system to fight the deadly infection.However, not all patients can donate plasma. The concentration of the antibodies is checked in the plasma before it is transfused. For this, the blood taken from the recovered patients is diluted repeatedly. The highly diluted samples, which turn to be positive, are the ones with high antibody levels. Through 245 donors, the blood bank has till now collected 488 units of plasma, out of which 476 units have been utilised by critically ill patients and remaining 12 units are available with the bank. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “One unit of plasma collected from single donors can be given to two patients. People between 18 years and 60 years are eligible to donate plasma. Within 14 days after the recovery, plasma can be donated.” One unit of plasma bag costs ₹8,500, while it is free for BPL card holders and pregnant women in the district. Motivating recovered patients to come forward, the district administration, along with the blood bank, is giving medals, appreciation certificates and shield trophies to donors. A card is also provided by the blood bank through which donors, if required, can take blood units from the bank for a year. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, said, “There is an increased awareness in masses and at least 21 recovered patients have come forward twice for plasma donation. Earlier, there were misconceptions related to plasma donation, which restricted people. Now, through awareness people have strated to come out for help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/1-4-of-covid-19-recovered-patients-have-donated-plasma-since-july-data/story-GRoReH5gWqWYWZ3r6DkfhL.html

The police filed a first information report (FIR) on October 17 after Bandra metropolitan magistrate’s court issued an order for the same. Munawar Ali aka Sahil, casting director, in his complaint had said that Ranaut’s actions “created a bad image of Bollywood in the minds of people and even created a communal divide and rift between people of two communities”. His complaint added that Ranaut has been “maliciously bringing religion in all her tweets”. Ali further alleged that Chandel, who works as Ranaut’s manager, has also tweeted objectionable messages intended to create a communal rift.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kangana-ranaut-sister-seek-time-till-november-15-to-appear-before-mumbai-police/story-kaXvIWdpHL8BkDxHGoRSrI.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||Media trial in Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Bombay HC concludes hearing, reserves judgment||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday concluded hearing arguments in the public interest litigations (PIL) filed by eight former police officers from Maharashtra, as well as others, seeking restraining orders against the media trial in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. In its concluding arguments the Union of India, while replying to the query by the court on whether reporting on the ongoing investigation in sensitive criminal matters amounted to contempt, said that it did not. The Centre, however, added that the high court was empowered to pass restraining orders on media reporting as and when required. The Centre through additional solicitor-general Anil Singh further reiterated the stand of the government and the self-regulating authorities that the existing mechanism was sufficient to keep a check on the functioning of news channels, hence there was no need for additional legislation, regulations or guidelines.After hearing all parties including self-regulatory authorities such as News Broadcasters Association (NBA) and News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA), directing all of them to file their written submissions on the petitions, the court said that the arguments were concluded and reserved its judgment, which would be passed in due course. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni, while hearing the rejoinder by the Centre to the submissions made by the news channels and self-regulating authorities, clarified that it would address the specific query of the court as to when contempt was applicable in sensitive criminal investigations. Singh submitted that while the counsel for the police officers Aspi Chinoy had submitted that the media trial, even during the stage of police investigation would amount to interference in justice, and provisions of contempt were attracted, it was not the case. Singh justified the Centre’s stand by referring to Supreme Court judgments which stated that though criminal proceedings become imminent after the arrest takes place, the provision of contempt would be applicable only after that. He, however, added that contempt would be applicable even if a charge sheet is not filed after the arrest. While countering the allegations made by the petitioners, senior counsel Arvind Datar for NBA and NBSA submitted that disciplinary action was taken against errant channels regularly, hence the demand of the petitioners and NGO’s to have additional guidelines was not necessary. He said that though the authorities were independent bodies they adjudicated complaints based on the programme code stipulated in the Cable TV Regulation Act and was answerable to the ministry of information and broadcasting. Datar added that NBSA would be issuing an advisory to all member channels to strictly adhere to the programme code after FIR’s were registered in sensitive criminal matters.After hearing all sides, the bench held that arguments were concluded and directed the parties to file their written submissions and reserved its judgement, which will be passed in a few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/media-trial-in-sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-bombay-hc-concludes-hearing-reserves-judgment/story-wGz9212WQpqNMwRWNr0fDL.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||Nearly 30% Covid patients in Navi Mumbai recovered at home||Nearly 30 per cent of the total Covid cases in Navi Mumbai never required hospitalisation. They have recovered through home isolation and treatment over a phone call from the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) doctors.As per the figures of November 3, out of the 48,311 Covid positive cases, 14,346 (29.69 per cent) have recovered at home. Of these home-isolated patients, 6,226 were females, 8,117 males and one transgender.Dr Ajay Gadade, health officer, NMMC, said, “When a person is found positive, he is given the option to get admitted or home isolate. Home isolation is allowed only if he has mild symptoms and has a room at home for himself with a separate bathroom that would be accessed only by him. If he falls under those two criteria, we let the patient get home isolated and provide the medicines.“Regular calls are made from our call centre to check on the patient and if necessary, a doctor on call is also made available. We ask the patient to regularly monitor the SPO2 level. Those who don’t have the pulse oximeter, we ask them to buy as keeping a tab of oxygen levels is very important in Covid positive patients.”A total of 4.06 lakh calls have been made by the call centre till now. Of these, 1.64 lakh were made to the home-isolated patients, 1.26 lakh to co-morbid patients and 1.15 lakh for post-Covid care.Overall, 8.54 lakh minutes were spent over calls, of which 3.45 lakh were spent with home-isolated patients, 2.65 lakh with co-morbid patients and 2.42 lakh with post-Covid patients. Of the total 4.06 lakh calls made, 4,759 calls were transferred to doctors for further guidance. Out of these, 2,155 were of the home-isolated patients, 644 of co morbid patients and 1,960 of post-Covid patients.“The call centre calls twice a day to the patients who are home isolated. Every call is recorded. If the patient seems to have developed any complications, further necessary step is taken,” assistant municipal commissioner Sanjay Kakade said.Ajay Moghe, a 45-year-old resident of Nerul, a mariner and a national badminton player, recently found himself Covid positive and chose to be home isolated at his residence in Sector 6, Nerul.Moghe, a health conscious person, plays badminton daily at least for two hours and was shocked to test positive. He chose to be home isolated.“I received calls from the NMMC checking on my health updates. I have always been a person who took care of the vitamin supplements, but I was still infected. It was only because of the healthy lifestyle and proper precautions I took after finding myself positive that I could recover without passing on the virus to any of my family members,” Moghe said.He isolated himself the day he felt he cannot play his favourite sport for two hours and felt tired. The test was done much later, but till then he kept himself isolated from his family and friends.“The day we got him isolated, I purchased disposable spoons, plates and glasses. While he stayed in a room, I stayed with my mother-in-law in her room and kids were in their room. After every meal, he would sanitise the plates he used and put in the garbage bag. Before keeping out the garbage bag for disposal, the bag was sanitised again. Healthy food, timely medicines, good amount of rest and isolation helped him recover. Home isolation treatment is possible and it’s also possible to not pass on the virus to family members by acting at the right time,” his wife Mugdha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nearly-30-covid-patients-in-navi-mumbai-recovered-at-home/story-sm3JMJtwmLs3P9WWQYULON.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||Dip in number of migrants testing positive for Covid at Thane railway station||The number of migrants testing positive at Thane railway station has reduced drastically in the last one month. It has fallen from around 250 positive cases daily in September to less than 10 cases in the last two weeks.This has also helped in improving the positivity rate within the city. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) had set up three testing counters at Thane railway station on the west side since the last one-and-a-half months, while two more were set up at east side.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC, said, “Due to the unlock practice, migrant labourers who had shifted to their hometown were returning to the city in September in large number. September saw more than 15,000 arrive at the railway station daily whereas now there are only around 2,000 arriving on a daily basis. This is also one of the reasons for decrease in the number of positive cases at the railway station. After the festive season, there could be more number of migrants visiting and we are prepared with two more counters at Thane east side of the railway station.”The health department claimed that tenacious testing of each and every migrant helped break the chain.Dr Raju Murudkar, medical health officer, TMC, said, “Initially, when we started testing, there were around 800 migrants at the railway station on an average and among these, 40-70 would test positive on a regular basis. However, the number increased around mid-September to approximately 250 migrants testing positive from among the 15,000 who used to arrive at the railway station. Each and every long distance passenger was tested. We ensured that those with symptoms were isolated and those tested positive were admitted to our Covid care centre immediately. This helped break the chain and bring the situation under control.”Dhananjay Singh, founder, Rudra Pratishthan, an organisation that works for the welfare of the north Indian community in Thane said that merely 40 per cent of the migrants have returned so far.He added, “We were expecting an influx of labourers after the Navratri festival. Most probably this will happen after Diwali now.”Each person takes around four minutes to take swab samples and provide basic details. Shashikumar Nair, chairman of Yatra Samiti, Thane, said, “There were many passengers visiting earlier, making it difficult to follow social distancing and leading to chaos at the railway station earlier. However, there are few arriving at the station now and this has led to better crowd management. These counters should continue even after the festive season, this will help keep the cases in control.”Testing at night also The antigen testing counter at Thane station is functional throughout the night to increase testing in the city, as per the Thane civic commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma’s guidelines.

The police said that the childwas alone in the house when the incident took place. The boy, Tejas, who goes by single name, stayed with his parents in their fourteenth floor flat. The police said that the boy’s father, Navneet Charan, had gone out to pick his wife at around 6.30pm on Friday. “The child was alone at home. It seems that he took a stool to the balcony and probably was standing on it when he toppled over from the fourteenth floor flat of the society. He was rushed to a hospital, but declared dead. His mother is a healthcare employee, while his father works from home during these days,” said Awaneesh Kumar, circle officer, City 2. According to the police, the father had turned the television on for the child and also locked the flat from outside while he went out to pick his wife. “Later, the child switched off the television and somehow opened the sliding door leading to the balcony, and thereafter the incident took place. The family has so far not given any complaint into the incident,” CO added. The incident took place under the jurisdiction of Sihani Gate police station area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-year-old-boy-slips-off-fourteenth-floor-flat-in-raj-nagar-extension-dies/story-adayJcFTlLoDvlTBcPLaIK.html
06-11-2020||City||TATA Steel PGTI Players Championship 2020 Day 3: Chandigarh’s Akshay stays atop leader board, Karandeep continues in second spot||Chandigarh golfer Akshay Sharma emerged as the outright favourite for the title after extending his lead to five shots in round three of the TATA Steel PGTI Players Championship 2020 presented by Panchkula Golf Club. Akshay, the overnight leader by three shots, played a five-under-67 on Friday. His three-day tally was 19-under-197 (64-66-67).Another Chandigarh golfer Karandeep Kochhar, who played a round of three-under-69, was placed second with a tally of 14-under-202.Bengaluru’s Chikkarangappa (72) was placed third at 11-under-205 while Kolkata’s Viraj Madappa fired the day’s best score of 64 to rise 21 spots to the fourth position at nine-under-207.Other Chandigarh golfers in the top-10 were Aadil Bedi (71) in tied sixth at seven-under-209, Yuvraj Singh Sandhu (68) in tied eighth at six-under-210 and Amrit Lal (72) in tied 10th at five-under-211.Akshay, who had gone bogey-free in the first two rounds, made his first error of the tournament when he dropped a double-bogey on the second after an inaccurate bunker shot. He immediately bounced back with birdies on the third, fifth, sixth, and seventh. He made a good up and down from the bunker on the sixth and excellent recovery from the trees on the seventh.“It was another solid round for me barring one error early on. My hitting was as good as the last two rounds but I didn’t hit it that close to the holes today. My placement wasn’t as accurate if one compares to the previous two days. “I made a great recovery from the trees on the seventh where I chipped out and followed that up with an exceptional 3-wood third shot which landed five feet from the pin. I made some long conversions as the greens at Panchkula are playing very soft and true so it’s easier to find the hole if you’re on the right line,” says Akshay. “I have a comfortable lead so I will look to play steady and let the others do all the attacking,” added the 30-year-old golfer.Karandeep Kochhar (68-65-69), who trailed the leader by three at the start of the day, kept pace with Akshay for most of the day collecting five birdies on the first 13 holes. Kochhar drove the green on the par-4 sixth to make birdie there and also set up four feet birdie conversions on the fifth and eighth.Karandeep then suffered a couple of setbacks towards the end dropping bogeys on the 15th and 17th. He found the hazard on the 15th and got unlucky on the 17th where his ball bounced on the edge of the green, hit a tree, and was deflected about 40 yards away.Kochhar said, “I had only one bad hole today, the 15th, otherwise it was a good round. I just got a little unlucky on the 17th. A five-shot deficit is not a very big one at Panchkula but the key for me would be playing well on the first four holes and making inroads on that stretch because the following holes do provide scoring opportunities.” Chikkarangappa (66-67-72) slipped from overnight tied second to third place as a result of his 72 that included three birdies, a bogey, and a double-bogey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tata-steel-pgti-players-championship-2020-day-3-chandigarh-s-akshay-stays-atop-leader-board-karandeep-continues-in-second-spot/story-sIcNtHlZlciRnwWcH4mVKI.html
06-11-2020||City||Noida: 22 residential bodies achieve 100% waste segregation||NOIDA: At least 22 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and apartment owners’ associations (AOAs) have achieved 100% waste segregation at their respective housing complexes in the city, said officials of the Noida authority. “So far, 22 resident associations have achieved 100% waste segregation. We appreciate that these AOAs or RWAs are doing their bit. We hope more and more associations will do the same,” said Ritu Maheshawri, chief executive officer, Noida authority. The authority had on July 1 last year started its waste segregation drive. Under the drive, each household has to segregate the waste in three separate dustbins -- one for plastic, another for dry waste and third for wet waste --and hands it over to the agency hired by the authority for collection, transportation and disposal. Noida has 165 sectors and 65 villages, where 900 metric tonnes of waste is produced daily. The Noida authority started collecting waste from door-to-door with the help of 250 vehicles and 21 compact machines that crushes the waste to transport it easily since 2018. According to the officials, the residential bodies in sectors 11, 14, 15A, 27, 30, 56, 100, 122, eight housing complexes in sector 62, sector 70 (B Block), Express View apartment in sector 105, Arun Vihar in sector 37, Ram Vihar apartment in sector 30 and two housing complexes in sector 35 have achieved 100% waste segregation, among others. The authority has decided to step up efforts to achieve the 100% waste segregation in remaining all housing complexes. “The waste segregation is being done in almost all housing complexes. But we need to make sure it happens in all households. We have not fixed any deadline to achieve the 100% waste segregation. But we want to do it as soon as possible. And to achieve this target, we are encouraging AOAs and RWAs to encourage residents to start segregating,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer of the authority heading the horticulture department. The authority has also decided to honour those AOAs and RWAs, which will help in this drive. Dharmendra Sharma, general secretary of sector 34 RWA, said, “We have achieved 100% waste segregation in our complex. And we are encouraging all complexes to join the drive and help Noida become a cleaner and better city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-22-residential-bodies-achieve-100-waste-segregation/story-CT8LMLzzOHVoElN6RL0USP.html
06-11-2020||Noida||BCA student, his friend’s father held for Greater Noida West double murder||A 19-year-old department store employee and his female friend’s father were arrested Friday for the double murder of the department store owner and his wife in Greater Noida West Tuesday night. Police said the main accused, Aman Hayat Khan, a BCA first-year student, was in a relationship with a 16-year-old girl. The girl’s father allegedly blackmailed Khan and demanded money to start a business, else he would file a complaint against Khan for being in a relationship with a minor. The man’s name is being withheld to protect the identity of the girl.Under pressure from the blackmailing, Khan murdered his 55-year-old employer Vinay Kumar Gupta and his wife Neha Gupta, 50, and stole ₹1 lakh from their flat, police said. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said the Guptas were found murdered in their ninth floor three-bedroom apartment in Cherry County on Wednesday morning by their son Kush Gupta when he went to visit them. “Vinay ran a department store – Price Smart -- in the commercial complex of Cherry County society. There were 22 staff members at the store and only Khan was missing since the murder. We checked the CCTV footage from the premises and found him entering the society at 12.15am through a small gate which connects the commercial complex with the residential side. He exited the society within 15 minutes after visiting Vinay’s flat,” he said. “The suspect was carrying Vinay’s cash bag when he exited the flat. He then went into the department store and washed his hands and face before abandoning his bloodstained shoes -- these were later identified as Khan’s by the other staff members,” Chander said. “We put his phone on electronic surveillance and found that he had called the girl’s father, about half an hour after the murders. We launched a search and arrested the girl’s father Friday,” he said.Ankur Aggarwal, additional DCP, Noida Central, said the girl’s father hailed from Mohali in Punjab and was living with his family in Greater Noida West. “He revealed that Khan was in a relationship with his 16-year-old daughter. He had booked an Oyo Room in Noida’s Sector 62 and hid Khan after the crime,” Aggarwal said. A police team Friday arrested Khan when came to meet the girl’s father near Galaxy Vega roundabout. Khan told police that the father was blackmailing him for money. “He had proposed to run a business in partnership with me. He asked me to rob my employer and arrange the money,” Khan reportedly told the police. Khan hails from Motihari district in Bihar and had completed his class 10 with 95% marks and class 12 with 50% marks. His father used to work in Dubai but lost his job six months ago. Khan had by then shifted from Bihar to Greater Noida West and started living with a friend. Chander said when Khan’s father lost his job, he stopped sending money to Khan. “The suspect nearly dropped out of his BCA programme for want of money. Four months ago, he joined Vinay’s department store and began working in the apparels section,” he said. Chander said on the night of the murder, Khan reached Vinay’s flat and rang the bell. “ Vinay opened the door and Khan told Neha that he was hungry and wanted food. Neha served him dinner and he started demanding money from her. When she refused, he lifted a candle stand and hit on the head. When Vinay rushed to help Neha, he was also attacked with the candle stand,” Chander said. Chander said Khan also stabbed them with a knife that he had purchased from the department store two days ago. The suspect then stole Vinay’s cash bag containing ₹1 lakh and a cheque book, and fled the spot. Police said Khan bought a mobile phone for ₹15,000 and the reaming cash, about ₹72,000, apart from the chequebook, the new phone, bloodstained clothes and the knife were recovered from Khan’s possession. Gautam Budh Nagar commissionerate has rewarded ₹1 lakh to the police team for solving the double murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bca-student-his-friend-s-father-held-for-greater-noida-west-double-murder/story-qJpnzR4y3FOhaj5R5ik41K.html
06-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Flights for third route between Hindon-Kalaburagi start Nov 18||Ghaziabad: Starting November 18, one new route from Hindon to Kalaburagi in Karnataka will become operational from the civil terminal near the Hindon airbase in Ghaziabad under the ‘Ude Desh ka Aam Nagarik’ (UDAN) scheme. At present, two routes -- Hindon-Pithoragarh and Hindon-Hubli -- are operational at the civil terminal. The flights to Kalaburagi will be run by Star Air, and officials of the airline said that they have already opened the bookings. The airline also operates flights between Hindon-Hubli with a 50-seater aircraft. “The flights to Kalaburagi will start from November 18, and will be operational three days a week -- Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday with starting fare at ₹3,799. The flights for the other route of Hindon-Hubli are already scheduled for four days in a week (Monday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday). For the Hindon-Hubli route, we already have about 75% occupancy. For both the routes, we will be using a 50-seater aircraft,” said a spokesperson from Star Air. The flights from the civil terminal at Hindon were suspended during the lockdown. The flight services resumed for a day on May 25. Thereafter, certain issues led to suspension of flights till August 15, officials said. In its order of May 24, the ministry of civil aviation had issued directions for operation of Regional Connectivity Services under the UDAN scheme and issued several guidelines. One of the criteria stated that all routes up to 500km were permitted to resume operations. Notably, the Hindon-Hubli route has an air distance of about 1,282km. “The issues got resolved in due course of time and our flights resumed from August 16 and continuing. The response for both the routes is encouraging,” the spokesperson of Star Air added. However, the other route to Pithoragarh is yet to be made operational ever since the lockdown. The officials of Airport Authority of India at the civil terminal said that they are waiting for response from the airline concerned. “We are yet to get any response from the airline which operates Hindon-Pithoragarh route. They had operated their last flight in March, and thereafter there is no information from their side. However, the other airline (Star Air) will be initiating the Hindon-Kalaburagi flights from November 18,” said Shobha Bhardwaj, director of the civil terminal. The Hindon-Pithoragarh route is operated by Air Heritage. Its CEO Rohit Mathur did not respond to calls for his comments over the issue. The first flight from the civil terminal was made operational between Hindon-Pithoragarh on October 11 last year, and after almost a month the second route between Hindon-Hubli got initiated on November 6. The civil terminal at Ghaziabad is proposed to operate flights to eight routes of Nasik, Pithoragarh, Kannur, Hubli, Faizabad, Shimla, Jamnagar and Kalaburagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-flights-for-third-route-between-hindon-kalaburagi-start-nov-18/story-YOmIIKNZ1MF5bKXlMr8ekK.html
06-11-2020||City||Sisodia alleges fraud in 5 state-funded colleges||New Delhi: Two days after the Delhi High Court directed the Aam Aadmi Party government to release funds to pay salaries to teachers and staff of four Delhi-government funded colleges, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said the special audit sanctioned by the government revealed financial irregularities in these colleges indicating a “big fraud” and “ghost appointments”.The deputy chief minister, who holds the education portfolio, also said they were exploring legal options. “We have received the special audit report of five colleges that show financial irregularities in these colleges led to staff not being paid salaries,” he said.According to the government, the audit report revealed that over ₹124 crore across five colleges were utilised without government approval. “The audit report also showed that these colleges created posts without getting approval from the government as the rules mandate. When the auditors asked for attendance register of these appointees, the colleges could not provide one indicating that there may be ‘ghost employees’,” Sisodia alleged on Friday. Laptops, equipment, and cars were brought without government approval, he added.“These colleges have money and yet teaching and non-teaching staff are not being paid. The government will work towards ending the practice of violating the rules of grant,” said Sisodia, explaining that the government is only required to cover the “net deficit” in grants. This essentially means that the government would cover the difference of amount between all revenue sources in the colleges and total expenditure.DU teachers have been protesting against the delay of disbursal of grants in the 12 government-funded colleges, which they said is the main cause behind pending salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff for months. The government attributed this delay in releasing funds to the alleged financial irregularities in these colleges.In September, the government released funds for six of these 12 colleges. While the initial plea in the high court included all 12 Delhi government-funded colleges, the court deleted the names of eight from the memo of parties as two colleges had paid salaries till August and no employee from the remaining six had approached court. The remaining four are: Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar College, Bhagini Nivedita College, Aditi Mahavidyalaya Women’s College and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies. On Friday, Sisodia said the audit report of two among these four colleges indicated financial irregularities.Colleges which spent funds without any approval in the past three years are — Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College (₹49.88 crore), Keshav Mahavidyalaya (₹29.84 crore), Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies (₹16.52 crore), Bhagini Nivedita College (₹17.23 crore), and Maharishi Valmiki College (₹10.64 crore). Aditi Mahavidyalaya and Laxmibai College refused to share their books with the government, Sisodia said. While Aditi Mahavidyalaya principal Mamta Sharma did not respond to requests for a comment, officials from the college, requesting anonymity, said that records were shown to special auditors. “However, the audit could not be completed as non-teaching staff could not come to college since they don’t have money to do so,” the official added. Laxmibai College principal Pratyush Vatsala was not available for a comment. He also said that colleges collected money from fee and other sources as fixed deposits and hence have surplus funds – Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College (₹ 22.44 crore), Keshav Mahavidyalaya (₹9.38 crore), Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies (₹31.58 crore), Bhagini Nivedita College (₹2.38 crore), and Maharishi Valmiki College (₹30 lakh).Colleges, however, maintain that funds from the Students Society Fund cannot be used for salary purposes. Hem Chand Jain, principal of DDU College, said, “We cannot comment unless we see the audit report and the FD’s in question are student society funds. High court orders state that we can’t spend this for salary purposes. As far as attendance is concerned, there are no provisions to record teachers’ attendance as per DU norms.”Poonam Verma, principal of Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies, said, “The central government’s CAG audit has taken place till 2018-19 and we have shown highest integrity. We have no knowledge where the current figure (of Rs 16.52 crore) is coming from. There is some misinformation which needs to be clarified because such a high office cannot be speaking without any basis. There is a communication gap.”DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said levying these allegations is an unfortunate incident on academics who run these colleges. “There has not been any misappropriation of funds as per the information collected by the university administration from these principals,” he said.While principal of Bhagini Nivedita College did not respond to requests for a comment, principals of Keshav Mahavidyalaya college and Maharishi Valmiki college could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-alleges-fraud-in-5-state-funded-colleges/story-4gBo042sncteAJkHkfGUXO.html
06-11-2020||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad suffer year’s highest PM10 and PM2.5 levels during Nov 4 to 6||Ghaziabad: Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida have fared badly in terms of PM10 and PM2.5 levels as the two primary pollutants were recorded at their highest levels at most of the monitoring stations in the three cities during the past three days, from November 4 to 6. According to data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the PM10 levels at 10 monitoring stations in the three cities spiked up to seven times the standard limits while the PM2.5 levels peaked to up to almost eight times the permissible limits during the period when the air pollution levels started deteriorating. Officials of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) have indicated that the situation is more or less likely to remain same till Diwali. “The prevailing conditions are likely to remain more or less same till Diwali. There will be low wind speeds in range of 8-10 km per hour and the wind direction is likely to change to easterly around November 10-11. Thereafter, one-two days period will see less wind speed and by this time Diwali will arrive,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. Starting November 4, Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida have witnessed rising pollution levels with thick pollution cover engulfing the three cities. CPCB’s data assessed by HT indicates that monitoring station of Loni in Ghaziabad recorded highest PM10 and PM2.5 levels in the city with figures of 732.30 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) and 456.59 ug/m3, respectively, during the period November 4 to 5, which is the highest this year so far. During the same period, Noida’s Sector 125 monitoring station also recorded highest PM10 and PM2.5 levels at 721.37ug/m3 and 468.70 ug/m3, respectively. This is also the highest spike in the current year for any of the four stations in Noida city. For Greater Noida, the highest PM10 levels of the current year were also recorded during the period November 4 to November 5 when the levels were at 612.34 ug/m3 at Knowledge Park V monitoring station. Greater Noida’s highest PM2.5 level of the current year was also recorded at 338.73 ug/m3 during the same period. The standard limits for PM10 is 100 ug/m3 while for PM2.5 is 60 ug/m3. “It is likely that the PM10 and PM2.5 levels will further spike during the days before Diwali festival and also during post-Diwali days. Bursting of crackers will have major impact on pollution levels at that time. So, authorities have to take up stringent measures to curb pollution levels at least at local level,” said Akash Vashishtha, a Ghaziabad-based environmentalist. “Further, in case the authorities are contemplating any ban on firecrackers, they should be banned at least up to whole of January from November and not just during days of Diwali,” he added. The officials of the UP pollution control board (UPPCB) said that they have intensified pollution abatement measures at local level. “We have intensified water sprinkling as well as increased vigilance at construction sites, besides continuing with regular measures in order to curb PM10 and PM2.5 levels as they have been high during the current peak,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of the UPPCB at Noida. The Ghaziabad officials from the UPPCB said that conditions have largely worsened due to external factors. “The high levels of PM10 and PM2.5 have been observed during the past couple of days. External factors which also include effect of stubble burning have impacted air quality with 42% contribution as per SAFAR forecast on November 5. At local level, we have also intensified our pollution abatement measures and will seek more directions from the district administration to bring more stringent measures if possible,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB at Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ghaziabad-suffer-year-s-highest-pm10-and-pm2-5-levels-during-nov-4-to-6/story-eNeU8ZxVVMoAO7PKF0qSLJ.html
06-11-2020||Noida||Air quality remains ‘severe’ for second consecutive day in Noida and Ghaziabad||Noida: The air quality of Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida on Friday remained under ‘severe’ category for the second consecutive day, even as the air pollutants ventilated leading to a slight improvement. The levels of particulate matter (PM) pollutants were six to eight times the safe limits, making even healthy people vulnerable to lungs and heart related ailments. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the wind speed picked up and reached 8 to10 kmph for a short span leading to ventilation of pollutants on Friday, high instances of fire or stubble burning in neighbouring states did not let the situation to improve significantly. Weather analysts said that the unsupportive meteorological conditions would lead the air pollution levels in the three cities to fluctuate between ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ categories. According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), air quality index (AQI) value of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 406 on Friday against 450 a day earlier, both ‘severe’. Similarly, the AQI values for Ghaziabad and Greater Noida were 433 (464 on Thursday) and 421 (457 a day earlier), respectively. “The situation is likely to prevail for the next three days as the wind speed will remain low. So, even if there is any improvement, it won’t be a significant one and only marginal. The wind directions will remain westerly, north-westerly coming via Punjab and Haryana,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), approximately 3,225 instances of stubble fire were observed in neighbouring states in the past 24 hours, against 4,135 the day before. SAFAR also anticipated air quality may improve but will remain within upper and middle range of ‘very poor’. “Not so calm surface winds are forecasted for the next two days favouring dispersion of pollutants, AQI is likely to improve today and tomorrow, but within the middle-end of the very poor category, deterioration is expected by the late 8th towards the higher end of very poor. SAFAR synergized stubble fire counts over Punjab, Haryana, UP, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas stood at 3,225 yesterday,” said a SAFAR forecast. Meanwhile, the average PM2.5 pollutant level for Noida was 270.67 microgrammes per cubic metres (ug/m3) which is more than six times the safe limits, against 372 ug/m3 a day earlier. The PM10 for Noida was 478.077 ug/m3 – almost eight times the safe limits, against 571.4 ug/m3 a day earlier. The PM2.5 and PM10 for Greater Noida was 276.25 ug/m3 (400.06 on Thursday) and 520.17ug/m3 (620.87 on Thursday) respectively. The permissible limits of PM2.5 and PM10 are 40ug/m3 and 60ug/m3, respectively. “The pollutants, even though they have improved in the past 24 hours, are strong and high enough to cause health impact and the situation seems same as the last year,” said Shambhavi Shukla, programme officer (air pollution) at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-remains-severe-for-second-consecutive-day-in-noida-and-ghaziabad/story-qP06LQezbKzA476B7ToHOK.html

06-11-2020||Mumbai||Two held in Navi Mumbai nearly two years after stealing LED TV from school||The Navi Mumbai crime branch arrested two men for stealing an LED television and a projector from a Zilla Parishad (ZP) school in Panvel almost two years ago. One of the accused was trying to sell the TV in scrap but the deal could not be finalised as the scrap dealer was only giving him ₹50 for it.The accused duo – Roshan Mhatre (27 years) and Vinay Joshi (22) – are both residents of Harigram village in Panvel. The ZP school is also located in the same village.On February 6, 2018, under the influence of alcohol, the two broke into the school through the window and stole the 41-inch LED TV and the projector. The duo thought they were stealing a home theatre system, the said police. But the men woke up to a disappointment the next morning.“They split the booty amongst themselves. While Joshi kept the projector, Mhatre took the TV home. When they came to their senses the next morning, they were unable to operate the electronics. They stored the items at home until recently when Mhatre tried to sell the TV,” said Sharad Dhole, assistant inspector at crime branch unit 2.When the scrap dealer was only ready to pay for the scrap value and said he would give him nothing more than ₹50, Mhatre called off the deal. An informant then alerted the police about the TV after which they picked up Mhatre for interrogation.Police said Mhatre confessed to stealing the items from the school with Joshi. The police recovered both the electronic items from the accused’s houses.Both the men have no previous criminal records and police said this was their first attempt at stealing.The state government had donated the electronics to the school and is a property of the state, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-held-in-navi-mumbai-nearly-two-years-after-stealing-led-tv-from-school/story-SJhu4eVtWjnQYeWmPV2lLL.html

In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, services on both these routes were called off by the civic transport body along with all other routes.Milind Dhat, general manager, KDMT, said, “Since the lockdown has eased and people are moving out for work, we want them to use civic buses for transportation. Many travel to Vashi and Belapur from Kalyan. For them, there was no service earlier. People used to depend on railway or private vehicles for transportation.”On the first day, nearly 460 passengers took the KDMT buses to Vashi and Konkan Bhavan. The civic body has also issued a dedicated time table for the services on these routes.The buses to Vashi will start at 7.15 am from ST depot in Kalyan (W). This bus service will be available at 30-minute frequency. From Kalyan (E) the service will be available only once in the morning at 8.15 am at Shreeram Chowk. Considering the need for social distancing inside the buses, the KDMT has made it mandatory for the passengers to wear masks.“We are trying to improve the service by adding more and more routes. Passengers taking the civic bus will be allowed in only if they wear a mask otherwise there will be no entry,” added Dhat. Presently the KDMT has 137 buses out of which only 52 of them are functioning, as many buses are to be repaired. Out of the 52 buses, twenty are given to the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation for Covid duty purposes. While the rest are plying for common public. “People have been waiting for some sort of transportation to reach their work place. The civic bus service will definitely help many but they need to make people aware of the service so that more people use the buses. I travel to Vashi daily for work, I might take a civic bus now if it is safe and on time,” said Darshan Nair,27, a resident of Kalyan (E).The KDMT that initiated its services from Kalyan Dombivli since 1999, had added the Kalyan-Vashi route in 2001 and Dombivli-Vashi route in 2007-08. The Shreeram Chowk - Vashi route service was also added in 2008. Several times, these routes were cancelled by the KDMT due to lack of passengers earlier.

Thus, a total of 70 MLD water is provided to Airoli, Digha and Ghansoli by NMMC, which receives from MIDC.However, for the last few months, MIDC has been providing only about 28 to 30 MLD water at low pressure. Bangar, in the meeting, asked MIDC to rectify the issue at the earliest.Residents and public representatives of Nerul Slum, Ramesh Metal Quarry, Mahatma Gandhi Nagar and Saroj Quarry had been demanding extra water connection. MIDC and NMMC agreed to conduct a joint survey and work on this issue.Mahendra Konde, NMMC PRO, said, “We have also asked MIDC not to delay road repair works in its area as there have being repeated complaints of such a delay from the residents.

The commissioner demanded that action be taken to find a solution to these problems and expedite the work. MIDC was also informed to remove the encroachment that had been obstructing the road concretisation work of the corporation from Uranphata to Turbhe flyover.Six plots for urban health centre and nine others for water tank and toilets under MIDC, which have to be handed over to NMMC under lease, are pending. The civic body asked to expedite the process.Satish Bagal, regional officer, MIDC, said. “The meeting was to discuss the issues and find solutions.

They had informally separated and the woman was living elsewhere with her three children,” said another investigator not authorised to speak to the media.A few weeks ago, the two brothers began suspecting that the woman was in a relationship with Suraj.“Since the victim was friends with Suraj, he urged him to stay away from his sister-in-law. But Suraj didn’t pay heed and continued speaking to the woman. That led to frequent arguments between Suraj and the victim,” said the investigator.“Suraj finally decided to eliminate the victim. He sought help from his cousin, Pawan,” said the officer.As per plan, on Tuesday night, Pawan allegedly called the victim to his house on the pretext of having a party. “At Pawan’s home, Suraj strangled the victim,” the officer said.Suraj borrowed a scooter from a friend by saying he needed to take a patient to a hospital. “Sandwiching the dead man on the scooter, they rode some distance from their house and dumped his body near a drain,” said the officer.Some passerby soon noticed the body and made a police call at 2 am on Wednesday.The police identified the victim by Wednesday morning and began enquiring in the neighbourhood about who he was last seen with on Tuesday night. “That enquiry revealed Pawan’s name. Pawan confessed to the crime and said it was all a plan by Suraj who was also the man who had strangled the victim,” said the officer.Suraj was arrested on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-killed-body-loaded-on-scooter-and-dumped-near-drain/story-ajIFjqOhrjaZDpcEnZ3I7L.html

The Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), a nodal agency to monitor the airport project, had signed a memorandum of understating with WII on August 30 last year for the preparation of a conservation plan. WII is an autonomous institute under the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. “WII had already submitted a draft report and an inception report to us on conservation plan around Jewar airport. We have asked them to make changes in the report because we have decided to make 25km buffer zone instead of 10km. They are likely to submit a final report very soon. After discussions, we have decided to spend ₹25 crore annually on protection and conservation of flora and fauna, and environment in the 25km area of airport site,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida and NIAL.Apart from ₹25 crore, Yeida and NIAL will also arrange ₹10 crore annually from corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. “We have decided to arrange ₹10 crore under CSR scheme in which corporate houses spend money on social activities. We have already in touch with interested companies for the additional fund,” said Singh.The Noida International Greenfield Airport project is spread on 5,000 hectares of area that falls in 39 villages in Jewar along the Yamuna Expressway, that connects Greater Noida with Agra. Under Phase 1, the government has acquired 1,334 hectares of land on which the development work by Swiss company Zurich International AG, the concessionaire for the airport project, is likely to be started by mid-2021. The airport will become operational as per deadline by 2023.“We have decided to rope in a central agency such as Forest Research Institute that will help us in implementation of conservation work. We are likely to set up a rescue centre for injured birds or animals that may face any trouble when the construction begins,” said Singh.Besides, there is a plan to set up a veterinary hospital and a monitoring station at the site, the officials said. In a survey, it is found that the authority needs to conserve 135 wetlands, which are located in 25km buffer zone.“As many as 129 wetlands are fed by rainy water only, and remaining six are old wetlands, which have water in all seasons. We will make sure all these wetlands are conserved,” said Singh.The officials said that expert teams will be deployed in standby mode at the site to rush help to an injured bird or animal. “The central agency to be roped in will monitor the construction closely via close circuit television cameras and provide immediate relief to any bird or wildlife animal in need. We have also decided to make a bird sanctuary at Dhanauri, that is a habitat of Sarus crane,” said the Yeida CEO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/25-crore-to-be-spent-annually-on-wildlife-conservation-around-airport-site-in-jewar/story-a3Mv9NIJECZYNCs6QyqsIO.html
06-11-2020||Delhi||Ban on green crackers leaves traders gasping for air even as Delhi chokes||Even as people in the city have started gearing up for Diwali festivities, the news of ban on sale of green crackers has lead to wholesalers and traders staring at losses. Following orders from the Supreme Court that allowed sale of green crackers in Delhi, traders had stocked up, hoping to see a good season. But the Arvind Kejriwal-led government in the Capital announced a blanket ban on sale, purchase and use of all kinds of firecrackers in the city from November 7 to November 30. In a tweet, the CM said, “Reviewed the corona situation in Delhi and preparedness with Chief Secy, health officials and all DMs. Corona cases have increased due to festival season and pollution. It was decided to ban crackers in Delhi.”Counting losses and questioning the efficacy of banning green crackers, Ravi Bedi of Bedi Traders, says, “Yeh toh zulm hua hai. We had purchased green crackers worth ₹ 7 lakh. What will we do with these now? The Supreme Court had passed the use of green crackers, toh fir yeh kyu bandh karna chahte hain? For two years when green crackers were not developed, we didn’t sell anything, but now when we have an alternative, they want to ban it too.”Read: Delhi vendors request govt to permit sale of green crackers till DiwaliThe pandemic had already left a dent on businesses, but wholesalers were still hopeful for Diwali. “Covid mein vaise hi log pareshaan hain, business khatam ho chuka hai. Thodi si ummeed jaagi thi Diwali pe ki kuch sale ho jayegi, par ab sab barabar ho gaya. Pollution ki saari report government ke paas aa rahi hai ki pollution isse nahi ho raha. Yeh paraali jalne aur vehicles ki vajah se ho raha hai. Trader toh marr gaya naa isme, voh ab kya karega,” rues Om Prakash of Fancy Fire Works.Making a case for green crackers, traders argue that the pollution caused by these isn’t even a fraction of that caused by other factors. “Green crackers only create 4% pollution and that’s the reason they were okay-ed. Har saal license dete hain par end time pe haath kheench lete hain. At least give us clarity if they want to shut down this industry, and not keep us hanging to face losses. Green crackers have a shelf life of only six months, we can’t even hope to sell them next year,” says Rajesh Khurana of Mayur Patakha Shop, who also have their own factory in Rohtak, Haryana. In the wake of losses, he plans to shut shop for good. “We have been in this business for the last 30 years, but ab hum bhi thak gaye hain. We have packed everything and this is the last year we are here.”Read: Coronavirus: Air pollution may lead to faster spread of Covid-19 infections, officials tell Par panelDiwali always comes as a time of hope, and for people employed in this industry, this ban would mean loss of livelihood for many. “Financially toh bahut logo ka nuksaan hai. From trader to manufacturer and labour, everyone will be impacted. At least 8 lakh people will suffer, meaning 8 lakh families,” explains Vinod Kumar Gupta of Hanuman Fire Works, adding, “Dilli mein pollution Navratri se shuru ho gaya tha, aur abhi tak patakahe chale bhi nahi hain. It is clear that crackers are not causing pollution. Hum vyapaari hain aur chahte hain ghar-ghar mein Diwali manaayi jaaye, par jaan se upar toh vyapaar bhi nahi.

Such action is a blow to the freedom of the press, said the representatives of Press Club. During the ongoing pandemic, they said, journalists, despite a threat of infection, have acted as a bridge between the public and the government by reporting impartially. In such a situation, the government should immediately take back the cases being registered against the journalists.Jai Ram Thakur said that the state government respects the fourth pillar of democracy and no vendetta action was being taken against anyone.He said that instructions have been given to withdraw cases against journalists registered during the Covid-19 pandemic. He assured that cases filed against journalists would be withdrawn in a phased manner.Earlier, the Press Club Shimla called an emergency meeting and expressed concern over the FIR lodged by the police on senior journalists throughout the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/journalists-urge-jai-ram-to-withdraw-cases-against-them/story-Mo7YEttCq2MNWM2SAYbZiJ.html

His son and former chief minister minced no words to criticise the BJP government for allegedly peddling lies before and after the revocation of Articles 370 and 35-A in Jammu and Kashmir. The father and son duo reached Jammu on Friday to take part in PAGD meet scheduled on Saturday. “Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah had then told Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru that our destiny lies with Mahatma Gandhi’s India and not of BJP’s India,” he said. The Abdullahs came to Jammu for the first time following their detention in Srinagar on August 4, 2019. “Let these people burn my effigies. Farooq doesn’t get intimidated by this. Come in front of me. I don’t pick batons and stones… come face me and my queries,” he said in a clear reference to BJP, whose leaders and workers have been torching his effigies after he made controversial remarks about China’s aid to restore the special status of J&K. He also took a dig at the Centre for the dignified return of Kashmiri Pandits to Kashmir. “While Kashmiri Pandits are still in Jammu hoping to get back one day, for how long will you use them for votes and for how long will you spread hatred,” he said and cautioned the people against “divisive politics” of the BJP in the name of caste, creed, and religion. The octogenarian said that National Conference won’t be deterred by arm-twisting tactics of the BJP government and the struggle to get back Article 370, 35-A and other privileges will be taken to its logical conclusion. NC and PDP have formed the PAGD seeking restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state as it existed before August 5 last year and also to initiate a dialogue between all stakeholders on the issue. NC vice-president Omar Abdullah also accused the BJP of resorting to conspiracies, fakeries and arm-twisting tactics. “Many tried to perform last rites of NC but none succeeded. History is replete when our opponents tried to write us off but this programme today here in Jammu is a message for those who tried to peddle lies that NC is now confined to some areas of Valley,” Omar said. Omar said that before August 5, 2019, several lies were peddled like there were no jobs, development and progress, people were starving, the majority endorsed separatist sentiment, penury and that people were not with the country because of Article 370. “Similarly, another lie was that if Articles 370 and 35-A were revoked, all ills plaguing J&K will vanish into thin air overnight. It has been one year and three months now. Where is development and progress that was promised,” he said. Omar also felt that revocation of special status has caused a spike in terrorism in the Union territory. “There was another false claim that revocation of Article 370 will result in the complete amalgamation of those nurturing separatist sentiment with India but today I can confidently say those harbouring such sentiment have been further alienated from us”, he said.“Not even a single citizen of J&K has accepted this draconian decision of the BJP government. While some say it openly, some confess it in whispers. Article 370 was not mentioned in Pakistan’s constitution. It was in the Indian Constitution. So, why can’t we discuss it and how does talking about it makes us anti-national,” he asked. “This fight is of not of NC or one religion but of all regions and religions and we will succeed in it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/if-j-k-had-to-go-with-pak-it-would-have-done-so-in-1947-farooq-abdullah/story-elhiAuWJZOiWx3IxkjvBmO.html

The Chinese army has killed 20 soldiers in Ladakh, but still, they (BJP) don’t speak a word against them,” she said adding that despite the Chinese army constructing permanent barracks and buildings in the occupied territory, the government is not even taking the name of China.Mentioning the eighth round of talks being held between India and China on Friday, she said, “You talk to China but you don’t talk to people of Jammu and Kashmir whose identity, culture and land you have destroyed. Today our country is not being run in accordance with the Constitution but on the BJP agenda. They have shredded the constitution of Dr BR Ambedkar into pieces.”The PDP leader recalled how her father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed used to travel by the length and breadth of the region in scorching summers because he believed that Jammu and Kashmir are two indispensable parts of the same body. “We could have easily formed government with Congress but that would have been an insult to the mandate of the people of Jammu. People in Kashmir said that PDP joined hands with a communal party and an anti-Muslim party. They said that this party demolished Babri Masjid but Mufti Sahib went ahead with his decision and formed the government with BJP,” she said. She added that the government has done away with laws that would protect land and jobs of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. “Special status of J&K, a brainchild of Maharaja Hari Singh to protect the identity and culture of Dogras, was snatched in the dead of the night,” Mufti added.In her speech, she said that she will take this struggle to its logical conclusion. “Remember, a time will come when Articles 370, 35-A, and the special status of J&K will be restored. The BJP is holding Tricolour in their hands but they want to destroy India and they have glued their eyes on J&K, which is nothing but a ploy to garner votes,” the PDP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-has-no-courage-to-speak-up-against-china-mehbooba-mufti/story-cKYWzdYcCqKMml61MeJL4K.html

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), it is expected to go below 10°C degrees in the next few days.“By Diwali, which is on November 14, the night temperature is likely to drop to 10°C. North-westerly winds, which are dry and cold, will make the mercury dip further,” said an IMD official.The maximum temperature also reduced slightly from 30.8°C on Thursday to 30°C on Friday, while the minimum temperature went down from 12.4°C to 11.2°C. Over the next three days, the day and night temperatures will remain around 29°C and 10°C, respectively.Meanwhile, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city improved further on Friday, coming down to 111 by 7pm at the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station in Sector 25. Calling the jump on Wednesday (AQI 203) an aberration, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee vice-chairman Debendra Dalai said, “When the AQI goes up for a single day, it is usually attributed to a specific wind activity going on around the station. The sensors can pick up even a small increase, but if the situation sustains, it is a cause of worry.”Dalai added that the administration’s decision to ban crackers will help keep the AQI in check, which was much needed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mercury-dips-to-11-c-in-chandigarh-air-quality-improves/story-ezVNfIEnmhBOk84uYsbK9I.html

The cameras, capable of different video analytics, are linked to a control room set up at district police headquarters.Presently, these cameras have analytics for three violations including over speeding, riding without a helmet and triple riding, he said, adding that the cameras can capture clear images in any weather and more analytics will be added at the later stages.Ranjan said the personnel monitoring the traffic in the control room can access the footage up to the last month. Once a violation is caught on camera, video footage and the picture of the number plate is stored in the control room system.“After analysis, the control room person-in-charge pushes the data to the District Centre of National Informatics Centre (NIC) and ITMS service provider and a notice to the violator is generated on his mobile phone,” the SSP said.The SSP said that they intend to implement the project in the entire district.The system would reduce human intervention in the implementation of traffic norms, besides the requirement of force to regulate traffic and bridging down the number of accidents and loss of life.“Now, no one will go scot-free for violating traffic rules. They are under constant watch,” said Ranjan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-roll-out-itms-to-rein-in-traffic-violators-in-dharamshala-town/story-AMCFWx7Qw6TbPmxzYqt0TN.html

Replying to a calling attention motion on the issue moved by Congress MLA from Faridabad NIT, Neeraj Sharma and INLD MLA Abhay Chautala, the home minister said the special investigation team (SIT) constituted to probe the killing will also look into the possibility of love-jihaad angle. Vij said the state government was also deliberating on enacting a law to check forcible religious conversions. He said the state government is also compiling information about instances where forced religious conversions took place to give effect to an interfaith wedding. Congress MLA from Faridabad NIT, Neeraj Sharma said the SIT probing the murder case should be headed by an officer of the rank of inspector general (IG) or additional DGP since there is a suspicion of involvement of a senior police official too. “The trial should be conducted by a fast-track court,” he said. Vij said an FIR pertaining to kidnapping registered on Nikita’s complaint in 2018 was withdrawn by the police. “If that criminal case was not spiked, Nikita probably would have been alive. The accused in the murder case is related to a powerful political family. I have asked the police to investigate the matter from 2018 when that FIR was registered,” he said. INLD MLA Abhay Chautala said the government needs to ensure that adequate security is provided at women colleges and examination centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-assembly-session-nikita-murder-case-to-be-fast-tracked-says-anil-vij/story-om2M63rH9EYKXpAFQKkuGL.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Assembly session: Opposition slams Haryana government on liquor smuggling probe||Opposition MLAs in Haryana assembly on Friday slammed the state government for a “half-hearted” inquiry in the instances of pilferage of liquor from warehouses during the Covid-19 lockdown. Speaking during a calling attention motion on smuggling of liquor from warehouses in Kharkhauda, Fatehabad and Samalkha, former leader of opposition Abhay Chautala questioned how the liquor freely flowed in villages and towns during the lockdown period. The calling attention notice was submitted by 10 MLAs. “When no vehicle was allowed to ply and interstate borders were sealed, how could the liquor consignments have moved without the connivance of police and excise officials,” Abhay said. The INLD MLA said the intention of the government was never to firmly probe the matter. He said the SET had no powers to summon officials and record. “Home minister Anil Vij wanted Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc) powers for the SET. However, instead of taking a decision on the matter, the chief minister referred the matter to the advocate general. The advocate general will write whatever the CM wanted,” he said, while demanding a CBI inquiry into the matter. Supporting Abhay Singh, Congress MLA from Tosham Kiran Choudhary said she sympathises with home minister Anil Vij and that there were glaring violations in the entire episode. “The excise and taxation commissioner didn’t issue written instructions for closure of liquor vends during the lockdown. Also, he stalled the visit of the SET to a distillery. This clearly shows that it was well planned,” she said, adding that action should be taken against the officials and distilleries. Congress MLA Shamsher Singh Gogi said the Crime Investigation Department (CID), the intelligence arm of the state police, keeps track of the movement of MLAs but failed to report to the CM about the unabashed movement of illegal liquor. “The excise officials refused to provide the records to SET. Now, a probe is being done by the vigilance bureau which will also turn out to be inconclusive,” Gogi said. Training his guns at Vij, Congress MLA Kuldeep Vats said Vij likes to call himself Gabbar. “But what kind of a Gabbar are you? Your efforts to bring culprits to book have not borne any results,” Vats said. Vij said the arrest of the chairman of NV distilleries Ashok Jain showed how serious the state government was about liquor smuggling. “Let me clarify. I’m not Gabbar but Anil Vij.

06-11-2020||Delhi||Like previous two surges, third wave of Covid-19 in Delhi will end soon, says CM Kejriwal||Like the previous two waves of coronavirus, the third one will end soon in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday as he urged Delhiites to make wearing mask a movement to arrest the spread of Covid-19 amid festive season and rising air pollution.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 After inaugurating a PWD project to strengthen Rohtak Road in Mundka, he urged people to properly wear face masks as it’s the best protection against Covid-19. “Till there is a vaccine for corona, consider face masks as the vaccine. These are the biggest protection against Covid-19 infection. We need to promote wearing face masks as a movement,” he said. Delhi is currently facing the third wave. In the first phase, the highest number of Covid-19 cases were reported and Delhiites helped bringing down the numbers. Again on September 17, there was a second surge, he said. “In this third wave, I’m extremely hopeful that Delhiites will continue to provide their support as always and it will come to an end soon,” he said. Citing the arrival of 32,000 Indians from virus-hit countries in March as well people coming from different parts of the country, he noted that Delhi faced a tough situation. “Delhi did not start at zero in terms of the number of Covid cases, Delhi started at thousands owing to the lack of aggressive testing of people who flew in through international flights,” the chief minister said. On the issue of air pollution, he said air quality in Delhi remains good from January till mid-October but worsens afterwards due to stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Delhi has provided an alternative in the form of a chemical developed by the Pusa Institute that converts stubble into manure. Next year there should not be any excuse by Punjab, Haryana and UP and stubble burning should stop, he said. If needed, the Delhi government or Pusa Institute may give the chemical (bio-decomposer) to the states where stubble is burnt, he said. PWD Minister Satyendar Jain said strengthening of the 13.33-km stretch of Rohtak Road from Jakhira to Delhi Border is scheduled to finish in six months but he would ensure that efforts are made to wrap it up in four months instead.Also Read | Experts, residents agree: Relaxations proving costly in fight against pandemic in Delhi The chief minister said that the Delhi government has previously also completed various projects well before time and at a lesser cost, and the time and cost-saving model will be replicated in this project as well. The total cost of the redevelopment project is Rs 25 crore, and it will be carried out with the use of the latest cold-milling technology, in which the upper layer of the road will be recycled and reused, said a PWD engineer. The road was first constructed in 2011 and was to be redeveloped in 2016. However, the project has now been taken up by the Delhi government from the Centre due to no sanction of funds by the National Highways Authority, said a government statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/like-previous-two-surges-third-wave-of-covid-19-in-delhi-will-end-soon-says-cm-kejriwal/story-Mm70pdoGBOb5XQL6VE5kNN.html

The idea is to start with higher classes first, and for this we have drafted detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The draft SOPs are submitted for the Chief Minister’s approval,” said Gaikwad in a statement. Parents said that many will still be skeptical to send their children to schools. “Parents are worried about sending their children until there is a vaccine or the Covid-19 cases go down substantially. They will not want to take any risks when it comes to the health of the children. The government should explore flexible options of online and offline learning,” said Anu Sinha, a parent from Thane. Gaikwad said care will be taken to ensure that all safety protocols as suggested by the central and the state government shall be followed while reopening schools. “The government will ensure that appropriate measures are in place for the safety of students and teachers in schools,” Gaikwad added. On Friday, HT had reported the government’s plans of conducting Class 10 and 12 board exams in the month of May. In June, the education department submitted SOPs on online learning which also consisted of plans on physical reopening of schools. However, with the centre’s decision of not starting schools until October, schools in the state could not reopen. Now with Diwali break approaching, the government plans to reopen schools only by the end of November. As per previous SOPs, school management committees were asked to consider options like shift-wise running of schools, staggering school timings, changing seating arrangement in classrooms, disinfecting schools, not allowing crowding in buses, etc. Similarly, local administrations were asked to ensure sanitization of schools and screening of teachers and students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/maharashtra-education-department-plans-to-reopen-schools-for-class-9-to-12-from-november-23/story-qXggmBqz2jus8pdQTL0XaM.html

In a meeting with top officials, Uttar Pradesh industry minister Satish Mahana gave the green signal to the proposal of the two new cities. YEIDA will also develop a heritage corridor from Jewar to Agra to promote cultural tourism along the 165km-Yamuna Expressway.Mahana conducted a review meeting with officials to track the status of Noida International Greenfield airport at Jewar. “We proposed the project of developing two new cities along the e-Way and it was approved. Now, we will start work on these two projects and also develop a heritage corridor,” said YEIDA CEO Arun Vir Singh.YEIDA will start work on a detailed project report of two cities now. “We will send the proposal to the state government for approval. We will start land acquisition for the two cities and take the project to the next stage. These projects will cater to housing needs in Vrindavan and Agra,” said Singh.The Uttar Pradesh government on April 24, 2001, had established YEIDA for development of areas between Greater Noida and Agra along the Yamuna Expressway. The objective was to set up industries to generate employment and develop urban areas. Around 2 lakh hectares from 1,187 villages of six districts, Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahar, Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura and Agra, were notified under YIEDA. The authority has been able to acquire at least 25,000 hectares of land along the 165-kilometre long e-way with an aim to allot the same for development of cities along the corridor.The UP government wants that all old cities such as Dankaur, Mathura, Vrindavan and Agra should be promoted under cultural tourism in the proposed heritage corridor. “Our government has decided to give boost to cultural tourism under heritage corridor. Our historic cities like Mathura, Vrindavan and Agra are famous internationally. Our government will provide all the support so that the tourists who come to visit Taj Mahal in Agra also go to Mathura and Vrindavan,” said Mahana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/yeida-to-develop-two-new-cities-along-yamuna-expressway/story-QQV7XH6eOQDxUvbzgOgkuL.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Probe into sharp rise in paddy arrivals in Punjab mandis||The food and civil supplies department in Punjab is investigating reasons for an unprecedented increase in paddy procurement in some of the state’s mandis and grain markets. State authorities were alerted after procurement almost touched volumes usually recorded in the entire season even as paddy arrivals continue. At a meeting held on Thursday, the state food department, mandi board and the agriculture directorate raised concerns over 170 lakh tonnes of paddy arriving in mandis in excess of projected estimates in the last week of September. Twelve districts out of 22 have reported increased arrivals as compared to the previous kharif season. Joint teams of the food and supplies, revenue and agriculture department are visiting the mandis in question. “From the mandis we will go back to arthiyas and farmers who have sold their produce to match their total yield with what has been recorded with the mandi board,” said a food department official not wishing to be named. “We will establish the link between production and procurement which is the way to identify wrongdoing. We know how much the average yield is and will find out how much arrived in the mandi,” the official added. The teams will investigate suspected bogus billing, twisting of production figures and selling of premium basmati grain, particularly the 1509 variety on MSP with the coarse grain. Reports say that as the 1509 variety has not fetched a good price a number of farmers have sold premium grains as the parmal variety which comes under MSP. Paddy procured this season is almost double the volume procured last year in the border district of Fazilka. The other districts include Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, SAS Nagar and Tarn Taran, where at least 50 mandis are under the official scanner. The food department, however, refused to release other details, saying local leaders have been opposing checks and scrutiny. “We have already touched 168 lakh tonnes and expect that total procurement will go beyond 185 lakh tonnes. So we have decided to reach the root cause (of why arrivals are increasing), especially when we are facing allegations that paddy has been smuggled in from outside the states and some qualities have been seized on the state border,” said the state’s food and civil supplies minister, Bharat Bhushan Ashu. Last month, 75 trucks loaded with freshly harvested paddy from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were stopped at the state border. With paddy arrivals at an estimated 182 lakh tonnes the state food department is making arrangements for funds, (cash credit limits) and gunny bags. “We have to make arrangement for storage of the grains,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/probe-into-sharp-rise-in-paddy-arrivals-in-punjab-mandis/story-gAUDvihb3Yw2ZSHxKhrdGJ.html

Addressing a rally of farmers at the sabzi mandi at Vallah in Amritsar Sidhu said, “Today, the Centre is supporting the corporate sector and taking revenge from the people of Punjab by framing the three anti-farmer laws. Now, when the farmers of Punjab are united and fighting for their rights by protesting against the Centre, the resignation of the Congress-led state government will be of no use. If we (the Congress government) resign, the state will be ruled by the governor and farming in the state will be in the hands of the Centre, against whom we are protesting.” The Centre’s policy of punishing farmers for stubble burning shows it is anti-farmer. “Instead of imposing fines, the Centre must find ways to help farmers financially. It only gives benefit to 5% of farmers in the state for not burning stubble but the remaining also need help,” he said. He said the state government should ensure the construction of more cold storage houses in rural Punjab so that farmers can store the produce in large quantities and sell it at a good price. He suggested farmers should adopt organic farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/resigning-won-t-help-punjab-farmers-staying-united-will-navjot-singh-sidhu/story-cGeYyVQef9p9NV0SDSDvUM.html

A day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a complete ban on the sale and use of firecrackers, including “green crackers”, in Delhi, Rai said that people caught selling or bursting firecrackers can be fined up to Rs1 lakh under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981). “Prosecutions will be made under the Air Act, which has a provision to slap fines going as high as Rs1 lakh,” Rai said on Friday.

According to Kejriwal’s announcement on Thursday, the cracker ban will be in force from November 7 to November 30. “While the regular pollution sources in Delhi continue to remain consistent throughout the year, bursting crackers ahead of Diwali and the stubble burning in neighbouring states add to Delhi’s pollution levels. Looking at the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the city, saving people’s lives is more important than the economic aspect of losses borne by cracker traders,” Rai said. Rai also announced the setting up of 15-member impact assessment panel to monitor spraying and record the effectiveness of the ‘Pusa bio-decomposer’ which promises to turn farm stubble into manure. This has been promoted as a solution for mass stubble burning in the agrarian states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which adds to the foul air in Delhi every winter.

While granting bail, the judge ordered, “Applicant will not use social media for a period of two years or till the conclusion of trial before the trial court, whichever is earlier.” Akhilanand was also asked to furnish a personal bond and sureties. The court said the applicant shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence by intimidating witnesses during the investigation or the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/keep-off-social-media-for-2-years-allahabad-hc-grants-bail-to-man-who-made-objectionable-remarks-against-up-cm/story-gA9qBgQK1ygnB7WYi3fPIN.html

Hussain is accused in ten cases related to the north-east Delhi riots including his role for hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots along with 14 others.The single-judge bench also issued notice to the corporation, represented by its standing counsel Gaurang Kanth, and sought its stand on the petition.Also read | ‘Cannot shy away from liability’: Tahir Hussain’s bail plea junkedThe court’s order came on Hussain’s plea filed through advocate Rizwan who contended that his client had not absented himself from the meetings of the EDMC for three successive months as the meetings were never held successively for three months till August when the decision to vacate his seat was taken.The counsel told the court that the meetings were held in January and February and then again in June and July. The plea read that the principles of natural justice had been violated, adding, “The proposal for vacation of his seat was taken on August 20 and decision was taken on the proposal on August 26, however, the petitioner (Hussain) was never informed or provided with a reasonable opportunity during the period.” The petition said that Hussain had been in judicial custody since March 5 in connection to one of the cases and could not be faulted in the unavoidable circumstances. EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain had cited the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act and said if a councillor remains absent from meetings of the corporation for three successive times, without permission, his/her membership can be ended.“Tahir Hussain has not attended any of the House meetings in the last 3-4 months. He has not informed me or the corporation about the reasons behind his absence. So... we have passed a proposal to terminate his membership on the grounds that he skipped at least three successive House meetings without informing the corporation,” he had said in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-stays-edmc-decision-to-disqualify-councillor-tahir-hussain/story-w6gqjvrW5EEfeQk8Sjp0qL.html

Earlier the govt said green cracker can be sold and gave us licence. We had already purchased the stock," says a vendor. pic.twitter.com/537FuRARMiOn Thursday, the average air quality index (AQI) was in the “severe” zone for the first time this season, just over a week before Diwali, a festival during which the use of illegal firecrackers in the past has led to the crisis spiralling out of control. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin, the average AQI for the 24-hour period since Wednesday was 450. The day before, it was 343. Air quality is considered “good” when AQI is lower than 50.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic was deteriorating in the Capital due to rising air pollution and appealed to people to avoid using them. “If we burst firecrackers this Diwali, we are playing with the lives of our children and families...” he added.“Reviewed corona situation in Del n preparedness wid Chief Secy, Health officials and all DMs. Corona cases hv increased due to festival season n pollution.

06-11-2020||Chandigarh||CIC allows Centre to withhold list of documents, material seized during Operation Bluestar||The central information commission (CIC) has allowed the Centre to withhold the list of documents and precious material seized by a central agency during the 1984 operation at the Golden Temple in Amritsar in which 576 people, including army personnel, were killed. A right to information (RTI) applicant, Gurvinder Singh Chadha, had demanded from the Union home ministry a list of all material seized during the operation and its present status as well as all records related to the operation and the list of all those who died during the operation conducted by the army to flush out militants holed up inside Golden Temple. Without giving the list and details of the seized material, the ministry said in its RTI response to Chadha that: “About 4,000 documents/books/files and gold/gold ornaments, silver/silver ornaments, precious stones currency, coins etc. were recovered by a central agency during Operation Bluestar. The articles and documents were handed over either to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) or to the Government of Punjab.” “As per records available with this office, 493 terrorists/civilians and 83 army officials were killed in the Golden Temple area in June 1984,” the home ministry said. Dissatisfied with the denial of specific information about the seized material, Chadha filed the first appeal within the ministry before a senior official who upheld the denial of information, invoking Section 8 1(a) of the RTI Act. The Section allows the government to withhold information, disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, relation with foreign State or lead to incitement of an offence. RTI APPLICANT CHADHA NOT SATISFIED WITH RESPONSE During the second appeal before the central information commission, the highest adjudication body in RTI matters, Chadha said that a satisfactory response was not yet provided on points related to records of Operation Bluestar and a list of material seized during it. The ministry said a point wise response was provided to Chadha but the details sought pertained to confidential information, the disclosure of which could prejudicially affect the safety and security of the country. Agreeing with the home ministry’s view, information commissioner YK Sinha held Chadha has sought “vague, ambiguous and generic information” that cannot be disclosed in terms of the provisions of the RTI Act, 2005. “Hence, no further intervention of the commission is warranted in the matter,” Sinha said. SGPC DEMANDS RETURN OF ARTEFACTS The SGPC has been demanding the return of artefacts, allegedly taken away by the army during Operation Bluestar in 1984. In June last year, SGPC chief secretary Roop Singh had said the holy scriptures, artefacts and historical books, which were part of the Sikh Reference Library, were taken away by the army during the operation. When asked that a section of media had reported that the Centre had returned the artefacts to the SGPC, Singh had claimed that only a few copies of historical books were returned. He had said still a large quantity of material and handwritten copies of the Guru Granth Sahib were with the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cic-allows-centre-to-withhold-list-of-documents-material-seized-during-operation-bluestar/story-SjdlTKYs4SSwiLpaIWwNyK.html

That does not work. One must remember that Covid-19 does not discriminate and it can happen to anyone – the poor and the affluent, the young and the old, men and women,” said Kejriwal at an event to mark the foundation of a road redevelopment project.Kejrwal added, “This is the third wave of Covid-19 in Delhi and things are in bad shape. We have seen two distinct peaks on June 23 and on September 17.”On June 23, Delhi had recorded 3,947 cases in a single day and 4,432 on September 17. “We can win the fight against Covid-19 like the way we defeated dengue but we need to work hard towards it. Unlike other cities, Delhi never started from zero. From the very beginning, in March, Delhi witnessed a lot of people arriving from countries which were already severely affected by Covid-19 – Italy, France, UK. Around 32,000 people arrived in the city at a time when the testing facility was not adequate and they spread across the city. In our fight against Covid-19, we need to keep such things in mind,” said Kejriwal.Delhi on Thursday recorded 6,715 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total number recorded till date to 416,653. As many as 371,155 people have recovered from the disease and 6,769 have died of it. The city, on Thursday, also recorded a positivity rate of 12.84% -- up from an average of 5.3% recorded for the week ending October 8.The chief minister also highlighted the air pollution problem in Delhi during the winters and the role of crop stubble burning in neighbouring states. He said, “All states will now have to adopt decomposer technology like Delhi has done this year and distribute among farmers. If they need help, we are ready to provide them with stubble decomposer capsules.” The air quality in Delhi remained in the “very poor” category on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-doesn-t-discriminate-please-wear-masks-urges-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal/story-Mihm4PXFtvnsljvf8MNELM.html

The ED had summoned Raninder in an ongoing probe into an illegal foreign funds case. Raninder’s lawyer Jaiveer Shergill said: “My client, Raninder Singh, is suffering from high fever, cold and cough. He has given samples for RT-PCR Covid test, the report of which is awaited. A team of doctors led by the Mohali medical officer has advised him 14 days’ quarantine. In view of the safety of everyone, my client has sought adjournment on health grounds.” Shergill is also the national spokesperson of the Congress. On October 26, Raninder Singh failed to appear before the ED, citing his requirement to be present before a parliamentary panel on Olympics in his capacity as the National Rifle Association of India president the same day. In August, the ED had filed three applications in a Ludhiana court for the inspection of new documents filed by the income tax department in the cases against the chief minister and his son. The matter is pending with the district and sessions court in Ludhiana. In July 2016, Raninder had appeared before the ED in the case and said he had nothing to hide. ACTION UNDER FEMA ON I-T DEPT COMPLAINT The central agency initiated action against Raninder under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) after the income tax department filed a complaint in a Ludhiana court, saying he had lied under oath about trusts owned by him in Virgin Islands. In 2016, Raninder was summoned by the ED in connection with a FEMA violation. The I-T department said that Raninder misguided the agency by claiming that he did have documents related to the family’s income and trusts abroad. The I-T department alleged that Raninder was a ‘settler’ of Jacaranda Trust, which the family formed. Other undisclosed trusts include Mulwala Holdings Limited and Allworth Venture Holding Limited. Capt Amarinder Singh and Raninder also allegedly carried out ‘undisclosed’ financial transactions through a bank account in HSBC, Geneva, and HSBC Financial Services Limited (Middle East), the department said. The I-T department said the trusts were established in 2005 and most of the deals were routed through Virgin Islands. The agency submitted in the court that it has documents sourced from Virgin Islands that show Captain Amarinder Singh and his son Raninder as owners of Marine Mansions in Dubai and other properties in the United Kingdom. Both Amarinder and Raninder have denied any wrongdoing and termed the charges false.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-s-son-raninder-does-not-appear-before-ed-again-seeks-adjournment-on-health-grounds/story-oCfJ3MUaNno9re4uBJcd7O.html

Banerjee on Thursday said she would write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to control the price of potatoes and onions which have gone through the roof in the festive season. “Prices of potato and onion have shot up alarmingly. I would write a letter to the Prime Minister to either give us the powers to control the prices or the Centre should control them. The new Act has snatched the state’s powers. It is unfortunate and alarming that the neither the Centre is being able to manage the prices nor is it allowing the state to do so,” Banerjee said on Thursday.

On Friday, four teams of the police’s enforcement branch started inspecting markets.While the price of potatoes in the local markets has touched Rs40 per kilo, onion is selling at Rs80 per kilo. The potato prices range from around Rs20-25 per kilo, while the prices of onions vary between Rs 40 and Rs 45 per kilo. “Even though inspection of markets is a round the year process, we have stepped up our vigil to check any kind of hoarding which may lead to price rise,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/vegetable-price-rise-kolkata-police-raid-markets-to-check-hoarding/story-wMtwp7kqwq8qi2ymPdrc8H.html

Mutation of a property is done to change or transfer the title entry in revenue records of a local civic body.In the first phase, the work is likely to start by next week in 17 municipal corporations and 60 Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT)-designated towns in the state, officials said. Gradually, the process would be rolled out across all 707 local bodies in the state, they added. Also read | UP sanctions 30-day ad hoc bonus for employeesPrime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the AMRUT scheme in 2015 in a bid to put in place a mechanism for robust infrastructure, including sewage and water supply networks, in cities covered under the initiative. The online mutation exercise seeks to help the public cut through a maze of bureaucratic red tape and promises a transparent process.Online mutation is also a part of ease of doing business to encourage industries and investments in the state and a government order to this effect has been issued by Deepak Kumar, principal secretary, urban development, UP.At present, the state government charges variable mutation fees. However, plans are afoot to make it uniform. “For instance, in Lucknow, the mutation fee is 1% of the property’s registration cost. In some other local bodies, the fee is slab-based. We plan to make the exercise uniform. A committee has been set up for this purpose,” said an official from the state’s urban development department. Though the implantation of the uniform fee process is likely to take time, online mutation would be done within the next 45 days, he said.“The online mutation process has several benefits such as an increase in the state government’s revenue collection coupled with transparency,” he said“There has been an inordinate delay in the implementation of the online mutual process. However, efforts are in progress to implement it in all 707 local bodies in UP by the end of this year,” he said.“The implementation of online mutation will help connect all 707 local bodies in UP to a common server. This will also help the government to keep a tab on the revenue generated through mutation of properties after the service goes 100% digital,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-to-roll-out-uniform-online-mutation-of-properties-soon/story-s2hFSyQSfuikh39QXEHjpK.html

A 1987-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, Gupta superseded five officers to be named the state police chief on February 7, 2019. IPS officers Mohammad Mustafa and Siddharth Chattopadhyaya challenged Gupta’s appointment, saying they were ignored despite being senior and having an outstanding service record. The other officers superseded were Hardeep Dhillon, Jasminder Singh and Samant Goel. “Our petitions have been allowed by the high court. A detailed order is awaited,” Punjab advocate general, Atul Nanda said. In January, the CAT quashed Gupta’s appointment, observing that the procedure adopted by the empanelment committee and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for preparing the panel violated the Supreme Court judgment in the Prakash Singh case. In high court, the state government had allayed fears of mala fide and defended the criterion adopted by the state and the UPSC. The UPSC submitted that all eligible officers are considered and state governments are mandatorily asked to forward the list of eligible officers and their documents. The UPSC takes into account the range of experience, service record and length of service while making recommendations, it had told court. Mustafa and Chattopadhyaya submitted that detailed information was not available for assessing the panel sent by Punjab on the range of experience and that the number of officers placed in the panel of eligible officers was in violation of department of personnel and training guidelines. Chattopadhyaya had even raised questions over the preparation of assessment sheets of the officers, which were considered by the UPSC before making the recommendation to the state. After hearing all parties, the high court bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice Sant Parkash reserved the order on September 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dinkar-gupta-to-continue-as-punjab-police-chief-hc-sets-aside-cat-order/story-i1ulgKGqTgYg1KSKT77a2M.html

The maximum temperature is expected to be 31 degree Celsius, a little higher than Thursday’s 30.7 degree Celsius.Delhi’s minimum temperature, recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official reading for the city, has been around 10-11 degree Celsius this week.

The AQI in Ghaziabad was 464, Greater Noida 457, Noida 450, Gurugram 443, and Faridabad 436.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that while the weather did play a spoiler for Delhi, local pollution sources also acted up, pushing pollution levels to severe category on Thursday. In a meeting with the CPCB task force, the IMD said that the primary pollutant in Delhi’s air on Thursday was PM10 (coarse particulate matter), which is primarily dust.Stubble fires also contributed to 42% — the highest so far this season — of Delhi’s PM 2.5 load on Thursday, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) under Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.The meteorological conditions also resulted in worsening the situation since Wednesday. “There are two things that are happening together. North-westerly winds are bringing pollutants and wind speed has reduced. On Wednesday night and early morning Thursday, winds were calm so pollutants remained trapped close to the surface. After 9.30am, winds picked up for some time before calming again in the evening. We are not expecting a change in wind direction before November 10, when it may gradually shift to easterly, but during the transition of wind direction, wind speed usually falls, which can lead to further aggravation of air pollution,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-minimum-temperature-dips-marginally-expect-a-foggy-friday/story-08qx6UcZ6yXM0QryHWS1HM.html

Similar conditions persisted on Thursday, but the visibility had improved marginally because of a wind speed of around 8 kilometres per hour (kmph). However, the layer of smog settled back in the evening after the wind speed dipped.

We are not expecting a change in wind direction before November 10, when it may gradually shift to easterly. However, during the transition of wind direction, usually wind speed falls, which may further worsen the air quality in Delhi-NCR and other towns in north-west India,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Other towns in north-west India such as Bahadurgarh, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Kanpur, Moradabad and Lucknow also recorded AQI in the “severe” category.The minimum temperature recorded in Delhi till 6:30 am on Friday was 11.9 degrees Celsius (C), 3 degrees C below normal. The minimum temperature will be updated again at 8:30 am.In Delhi-NCR, the bursting of firecrackers has gone up because of the upcoming festival of Diwali, which will be celebrated on November 14. However, the Delhi government has announced a ban on fire crackers this Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-continues-to-hover-around-severe-category/story-GPrzEONqjy8mMX3i5rRuDP.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana reserves 75% private jobs for state’s residents||The Haryana Assembly on Thursday passed a bill to give 75% reservation in the private sector to job seekers from the state, amid strong objections by Congress and Jannayak Janata Party MLAs. The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020 – moved by deputy chief minister and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala -- aims to provide 75 % of the new employment to local candidates for jobs having salary of less than Rs 50,000 per month in privately-owned companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, partnership firms etc. situated in Haryana.Chautala tweeted that the promise made to the state’s youth now stood fulfilled. “Today our promise to lakhs of youth of Haryana has been fulfilled and now Haryanvi youth will have 75 per cent of jobs in the private sector,” he said.Only 10 per cent of the recruitment by a company needs to be from the district in which it is located – the rest of the quota can be filled from other districts in the state. The quota will initially apply for 10 years, according to the bill which now needs the assent of the state governor to become law.Giving 75 per cent reservation in private sector jobs was a key poll promise made by Chautala’s JJP, which is the Bharatiya Janata Party’s coalition partner in the state.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the bill would go a long way in providing employment to local youth.Opposing the bill, JJP MLA from Narnaund Ram Kumar Gautam said that the proposed law was divisive. “This is a free country and we are one. We do not want divisions. People from Haryana have the freedom to work anywhere in the country and so have the people from Bihar or Maharashtra or any other state. Biharis contribute a lot as far as our farming is concerned. How can we stop them from gaining employment in Haryana? This is a behuda (inane) Bill,” Gautam said. Congress’s Rohtak MLA BB Batra also said that the bill was discriminatory. “The BJP talks of one nation and here is a Bill which is patently discriminatory and divisive. A similar law enacted by Andhra Pradesh has also been challenged in the high court and will be struck down. This Bill is also unconstitutional and will be struck down by the courts,” Batra said. Senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda objected to the option with companies to recruit only 10 per cent of their employees from one district. “The discretion given to the employer to pick a maximum 10% local candidates from a district should be done away with,’’ Hooda said. Another MLA from the Congress, Neeraj Sharma, also called the 10% restriction unfair. “People of Faridabad have given their agricultural land to set up industries and they also bore the harmful effects of industrialization. So why there should be a 10% cap on employing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-reserves-75-private-jobs-for-state-s-residents/story-kqJzqEUnyLR78rCMx1wQwN.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Logjam in Haryana assembly over resolution thanking Centre for farm laws||Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s resolution to thank the BJP-led central government for the “landmark farm laws” brought proceedings in the Haryana assembly to a halt on Friday afternoon with the opposition Congress demanding voting before a discussion on the resolution. Turning down the Congress demand for voting on the resolution, Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said: “How can there be voting before a discussion?” The House was adjourned for half an hour soon after Khattar moved the resolution at 1.30pm, welcoming the three recent farm laws of the Centre but this did not go down well with the Congress. Its members didn’t let the House function or hold a debate. The debate on the resolution was yet to start till 4pm. The Congress, which was demanding voting first on the resolution, forced two adjournments and walked out of the assembly earlier in the morning after Question Hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/logjam-in-haryana-assembly-over-resolution-thanking-centre-for-farm-laws/story-UAM1G2hOkona1XihyFvJoJ.html
06-11-2020||Kolkata||BJP must win 200 seats: Amit Shah sets Bengal target||The Bharatiya Janata Party should win over 200 of the 294 seats in the West Bengal assembly elections due early next year, Union home minister Amit Shah said at a meeting of local leaders in Bankura on Thursday. “The death knell of the Mamata Banerjee government has been sounded,” Shah said at the closed-door meeting attended by leaders from 13 districts. The senior BJP leader is on a two-day visit to the state to devise the party’s strategy for the upcoming elections. Addressing mediapersons after the meeting, the Union minister targeted chief minister Mamata Banerjee for “neglecting the poor, farmers, backward classes” in the state. “The Mamata Banerjee government has neglected the poor, the farmers, the backward classes and the tribal people and have oppressed BJP workers... I am confident that the BJP will come to power with two-third majority,” Shah said. He also urged the people to oust the Banerjee-led state government. “I appeal to the people to overthrow this government and give the BJP an opportunity to serve and build sonar Bangla (a golden Bengal),” Shah said. “You (Mamata Banerjee) are wrong if you think that you can stop the BJP by stopping central welfare schemes in West Bengal. If you let people enjoy the benefits of these schemes, they may at least spare some thoughts for you,” said Shah. Shah accused the state police of not cooperating with the Border Security Force for the rise in crime along the India-Bangladesh border, while skirting questions on the imposition of President’s rule in Bengal as demanded by some BJP leaders. He did not respond to questions on whether the BJP will project a chief ministerial candidate in the elections or not.Following the meeting with the local leaders, the former BJP president travelled to Chaturdihi village with BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national secretary Arvind Menon, national vice-president Mukul Roy and other leaders to have lunch at the home of Bibhishan Hansda, a member of the local tribal community. Shah stressed on the need to ensure that outreach programmes ahead of the elections translate into votes and did not remain a mere public relations exercise, leaders present at the meeting said. Reacting to Shah’s statements, Banerjee said that her party will not tolerate politics of threat. “We will not tolerate the politics of threat. They use central probe agencies to keep people under pressure. Everybody should stay within limits. People of Bengal will not accept outsiders,” Banerjee said at an administrative meeting in Kolkata.Expressing displeasure over the crowd seen at Shah’s meeting, Banerjee said, “A party is spreading the pandemic while common people are following Covid-19 health restrictions.” “Amit Shah’s ambition of winning 200 assembly seats will remain a dream. Let BJP first find an acceptable face of its state leadership before contesting the polls,” TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said in Kolkata. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats and showed its best performance in Bankura district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-must-win-200-seats-amit-shah-sets-bengal-target/story-YuKpSCsZk16yWQ9HIadKBK.html
06-11-2020||Delhi||Plan gone haywire, Delhi may soon be ‘coronavirus capital’: HC||The Delhi high court on Thursday criticised the city government saying it has gone “completely haywire” over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak and that Delhi was on its way to become the “corona capital of the country”, as the third wave of infections in the city continued to create alarm.While new infections in the Capital have been rising at a steep rate, another worrying trend has emerged as deaths and hospitalisations have started rapidly climbing too. According to Thursday’s bulletin, 66 people lost their lives due to the viral infection — the highest single-day deaths in over four months. Delhi last recorded 66 deaths on June 27, at a time when treatment protocols for Covid-19 were still being assessed.“Delhi government has gone completely haywire on the pandemic and is soon going to become the corona capital of the country thanks to the number of cases shooting up. Many claims were made by the Delhi government that they are topping charts in testing, but the number of cases has overshot. The government has many answers to give us,” a bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said on Thursday.Several indicators now reinforce the fact that Delhi is in the grip of its third and worst wave of infections yet. In the past week, there were 5,843 cases on average every day, the highest this number has been since the first case was recorded on March 2. Delhi now has 416,653 total infections and 6,769 deaths.The high court’s comments came during a hearing on a group of pleas relating to the disbursal of salaries to the employees and former employees of the various civic bodies.It said that the Delhi government has taken the health of citizens for a ride, a matter which would be dealt with separately on November 11 when the bench hears a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, who had sought ramping up of tests in the city.Most of the new cases of Covid-19 are being reported from six districts – North, Central, North East, East, North West and South East – where the positivity rate stands between 12% and 14%, said Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan after a review of the situation in Delhi. “This time around, the cases are being reported from middle income neighbourhoods. These are people who stayed at home and remained in isolation during the lockdown,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Delhi’s average seven-day positivity rate currently stands at 11.5%, as against the national average of 4.3%. As on Thursday, there were over 38,000 people with active infections in the city. Of them, 7,231 patients were admitted to hospitals, the data shows. This is the highest hospitalisations at a given time the city has seen. Intensive care unit beds are running full in city hospitals, especially those at private hospitals. Over 73.5% of all the ICU beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 in the city were occupied as on Thursday evening, according to the ‘Delhi Corona’ app.CM Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the government is working on increasing oxygen and ICU beds, and has reached out to the Supreme Court to reserve ICU beds in private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plan-gone-haywire-city-may-soon-be-coronavirus-capital-delhi-hc/story-kyHOlIFGC6m3owcWpN9cHM.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress MPs, railway minister fail to end deadlock over resumption of train service||Railway minister Piyush Goyal and Congress MPs from Punjab on Thursday failed to come to an agreement over the resumption of train services in the state in the wake of the ongoing protests by the farmer unions against the Centre’s agriculture laws. The Congress’ Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs met Goyal in two groups in New Delhi to press for immediate resumption of freight trains, but both sides stuck to their stated positions. Four Lok Sabha MPs – Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Santokh Singh Chaudhary, Ravneet Singh Bittu and Mohammad Sadique –left the meeting midway and later accused the Union minister of blaming the Punjab government for the protests against the farm laws, and ignoring the problems being faced by the state and its people despite the chief minister’s assurance on safety and security of trains and staff. Goyal, however, said the railways was keen on starting train services for the benefit of farmers, industry, general public and passengers. “Request state government to clear entire railway network from blockages so that we can run all trains, to and through Punjab, without interruption and safely (sic),” he tweeted after the meeting. The two sides though agreed to have the top officers of railways and the Punjab government to coordinate the efforts to clear the tracks and resume services at the earliest. The MPs, who had also sought time from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will now meet Union home minister Amit Shah on November 7 over the impact of suspension of trains on supplies of coal, fertilisers and other essential goods, GST compensation and the Centre’s refusal to release rural development fund to the state. LACK OF COORDINATION AMONG CONGRESS MPsThe Congress MPs’ meetings with the railway minister brought out their lack of coordination to the fore. Rajya Sabha MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo, who were the first to meet Goyal, urged him to resume freight operations at the earliest otherwise the safety and security of Punjab as well as the armed forces and civilians living in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh would be negatively impacted. As why he and Dullo went separately, Bajwa said they were not kept in the loop by the Lok Sabha MPs about their plans to meet Goyal. The two MPs have been critical of the CM in the past. Thereafter, the Lok Sabha MPs met the minister. Aujla said they explained the difficulties to Goyal but he was adamant that train services would not be resumed till all tracks were cleared. “The minister kept talking about the opposition in Punjab to farm laws and how there were no protests in other states. We told him that the CM (Amarinder Singh) has given a categorical assurance on his concerns regarding safety and security but he said railway officers will look at it,” the Amritsar MP said. Bittu and Aujla were the first to leave the meeting, and then Chaudhary and Sadique also joined them. The remaining four MPs – Preneet Kaur, Manish Tewari, Dr Amar Singh and Jasbir Singh Gill – continued the talks with the minister. Chaudhary said he told the minister about the losses, particularly finished goods worth Rs 2,400 crore that were lying in his constituency (Jalandhar) due to suspension of trains. “We had sought time from PM who has deputed the home minister to meet us,” he said. Fatehgarh Sahib MP Dr Amar Singh said the minister was informed about the efforts being made to get the farmers to clear the tracks and railway platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-congress-mps-railway-minister-fail-to-end-deadlock-over-resumption-of-train-service/story-yBLv1HDhfTtLtYxVmqfUZK.html

06-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: Truckers extend support to farmers||Extending support to the protesting farmers, the truckers union kept their vehicles off the road for four hours on Thursday and joined in the ‘Chakka jam’ at Transport Nagar and Sherpur Chowk.Long traffic jams were witnessed in the area even as the police created diversions for the movement of traffic. Protesting under the banner of ‘Ludhiana Goods Transport Association’, the truckers raised slogans against the Union government for a “step-motherly attitude with the state and its farmers”.Ludhiana goods transport association president Didar Singh said, “We have always stood by the farmers and will continue to extend support to them till the farm laws are rolled back or amended in favour of farmers. The trucks remained off road from noon till 4pm to mark the protest.”Meanwhile, commuters rued that the protesters should not harass the general public in their fight with the government.Gurpal Singh, a commuter said, “The protesters should not block the roads during protests as it leads to harassment of the public. The police and the administration make tall claims of stopping these kinds of protests in the city but action is taken only in selective cases while the public is left to suffer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-truckers-extend-support-to-farmers/story-G1iV048bHZKyx4ACAOBezM.html
06-11-2020||City||Ludhiana halts for 4 hours as farmers stage chakka jam||With farmers laying siege onto the busy Ladhowal Toll Plaza on National Highway (NH-44), as part of the nationwide call for chakka jam against the newly introduced central farm laws, passengers had a harrowing time for over four hours on Thursday. The protest started around noon and lasted till 4pm. By 2pm, protestors from Phillaur and Nawanshahr came and joined the protesting farmers from Ludhiana, raising slogans against the central government and its new farm laws.Witnessing the massive rush, police started diverting the traffic, heading towards Sutlej Bridge (where the toll plaza is situated). However, many heavy vehicles drivers decided to park their trucks in the middle of the road and wait till the farmer unions lifted their protest.Farmers clear way for ambulances, army convoysThe farmers, however, made sure to not cause any inconvenience to ambulances and army convoys on the route, making way for them through the blockade. Repeated announcements were being made at the protest site to clear way for the emergency vehicles. Vikas, a Phagwara resident, who was on his way to visit his wife and newborn at a city hospital, was allowed easy passage. Harmeet Singh Kadian of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Kadian), who was leading the protest, said, “We are being projected as anti-national, being blamed for stopping train services and not letting toll authorities to collect money from commuters. But no one has paid attention to the fact that though we have been sitting on protest for the past 36 days, there has been no incident of violence and vandalism at any protest site.”Many commuters decided to walkA huge number of commuters, who were either travelling by bus or auto rickshaw, decided to walk to get to the other side of Sutlej Bridge in the hope of catching another mode of public transport from there.Rupinder Kaur from Phagwara, who was seen walking with her children, said, “The auto we were travelling in was not allowed to pass following which we decided to walk.”Masks given a go-byMeanwhile, hardly anyone at the protest site was seen wearing masks or observing social distancing. Many farmer leaders claimed that the government was deliberately projecting a second wave of Covid-19 to curtail farmer protests.PM’s ‘Swachh Bharat’ call finds takers Prime Minister’s (PM’s) slogan of Swachh Bharat was practically realised at the dhara site as hundreds of farmers were seen carefully discarding waste into garbage bins instead of littering. A farmer quipped, “We are judicious in our approach. PM Narendra Modi exhorted the people of the country to maintain hygiene and cleanliness and gave a slogan of Swachh Bharat. We followed his vision for a clean India but we are opposed to his farm laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-halts-for-4-hours-as-farmers-stage-chakka-jam/story-qtNdCwYMieA6HI9nyaTk9L.html
06-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: ‘Agitations to increase tension between industry and farmers’||Ludhiana: Already struggling due to suspension of trains due to the ‘Rail Roko’ agitations, industrialists across Ludhiana said that tensions between industrialists and farmers are set to increase if the protests go on. They rued that over 4,000 consignments are already stuck at the ports due to the rail roko agitation and Thursday’s agitation only added to their woes as they could not carry out inter-district dispatch of goods either.A section of the industry also urged farmers to take the fight to Delhi rather than damaging the economy of Punjab, adding that they will extend their support to the farmers if they do so. All Industries and Trade Forum president Badish Jindal said, “Farmers should understand that their agitation in the state is not affecting the Union government in any way. They are only damaging the economy of the state by becoming a hindrance to the industry’s operations. This will increase tension between the industry and farmers as the industry has been badly affected by these protests.”“The governments have also failed to resolve the issue and are doing petty politics. Lakhs of labourers are out of job as factories are being closed due to the shortage of raw material,” said Jindal, adding, “The farmers should march towards Delhi. We will support them then.”The industrialists said every industry – be it the bicycle industry, hosiery, auto parts, sewing machine or dyeing industry – has been affected by the farmers’ agitation. United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) president DS Chawla said, “We are not against the farmers but they should also understand that we are suffering. Our consignments are stuck but we are not risking transporting the goods on trucks either as we fear damage on the way. We urge the farmers and the governments to resolve the matter at the earliest.”Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation president (FICO) Gurmeet Kular said, “Industrialists are being forced to shut down the factories as there is shortage of raw material. If this crisis continues, the industrialists and labourers will also be forced to take to roads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-agitations-to-increase-tension-between-industry-and-farmers/story-IkF51ZNEEJ2Al9aZsI0IUI.html

06-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi bans firecrackers as air quality is now ‘severe’||The Delhi government on Thursday banned the use of all firecrackers till November 30 as air pollution in the national capital soared to its worst level in a year, with a poisonous blanket of smog signalling how desperate measures taken over recent years to arrest the annual health emergency have failed to offer an effective solution.On Thursday, the average air quality index (AQI) was in the “severe” zone for the first time this season, just over a week before Diwali, a festival during which use of illegal firecrackers in the past has led to the crisis spiralling out of control. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin, the average AQI for the 24-hour period since Wednesday was 450. The day before, it was 343. Air quality is considered “good” when AQI is lower than 50.The decision is likely to be a controversial one -- last year, many people burst crackers, mostly obtained illegally, in defiance of a court order that allowed only green crackers, which weren’t available in time.On Thursday, a day after several incidents of the use of firecrackers was reported, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic was deteriorating in the Capital due to rising air pollution and appealed to people to avoid using them. “If we burst firecrackers this Diwali, we are playing with the lives of our children and families...” he added.“Reviewed corona situation in Del n preparedness wid Chief Secy, Health officials and all DMs. Corona cases hv increased due to festival season n pollution. It was decided to... ban crackers in Del...,” Kejriwal later tweeted. The ban will remain in place from November 7 to November 30.Coincidentally, on November 4, a group of researchers from Harvard published a study showing a direct correlation between air pollution and Covid-19 mortality rates.With the complete ban, 800 open spaces where people were to be permitted to burn “green” firecrackers between 8pm and 10pm on Diwali will also not be allowed. A senior official of the Delhi government said that with the ban, all licenses that have been issued to firecracker traders will be cancelled. As per the Delhi government’s environment ministry, 93 traders across the national capital were granted licenses till November 4. With this announcement, Delhi joined states such as Rajasthan, Odisha and West Bengal in banning the use of firecrackers ahead of Diwali on November 14. Air quality typically worsens with approaching winter every year as farmers burn stubble, adding to toxic fumes from vehicles, dust from neighbouring regions, and unfavourable meteorological conditions in the region.The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution rose to 42% on Thursday, the maximum so far this season, according to the central government’s air quality monitoring agency. Experts said raging farm fires, mostly in Punjab and Haryana, windless conditions and dipping temperature led to an alarming worsening of air quality.The ministry of earth sciences air quality monitor, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), said the farm fire count in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas increased significantly, and stood at 4,135 on Wednesday, the highest this season so far. It said the boundary layer wind direction is north-westerly – favourable for carrying pollutants from farm fires into the national Capital. “The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 42% for Thursday,” SAFAR added.Stubble burning accounted for 5% of Delhi’s pollution on Wednesday, 10% on Tuesday, 16% on Monday and 40% on Sunday. Last year, the contribution from stubble fires to Delhi’s air pollution peaked on October 31, when the figure was 44%, according to CPCB. Diwali was celebrated on October 27 in 2019, leading to an overlap and very high air pollution levels.All 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the “severe” category on Thursday. The AQI in Ghaziabad was 464, Greater Noida 457, Noida 450, Gurugram 443, and Faridabad 436.On Thursday morning, visibility improved marginally from the previous evening as winds picked up to about 8kmph, but by the evening, the layer of toxic smog hung strongly over Delhi.The PM2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) concentration spiked to about 360 micrograms per cubic metres, six times the national safe standard and 36 times the World Health Organization’s safe levels. The PM10 level stood at 561 microgram per cubic meters at 10am – the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 637 µg/m3, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores. “Severe” category air affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.According to leaders of farmers’ groups, stubble fires are likely to continue for one more week. “Harvesting did start four days early this year but it’s not over yet. They (the fires) are extremely high in number and widespread. This is because farmers are extremely agitated with the farm bills. There is high pollution in Punjab also because of farm fires,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, Bharatiya Kisan Union president, Punjab. His reference is to the three farm reform bills that farmers in many states, including Punjab, are protesting. Worried about offending farmers, who are already up in arms, there’s been little action against them for the fires this year. Scientists said very high contribution from farm fires and local emissions contributed to a build-up of PM 2.5 concentrations. “There were about 5,000 stubble fires yesterday. This together with slow wind and subsidence of air led to unexpectedly high levels of air pollution in Delhi. Local emissions from fire crackers and traffic also added to the build-up. Today again we are seeing around 4,000 fire counts,” said Vijay Soni, scientist, India Meteorological Department, air quality division.Punjab has recorded a higher number of stubble fires this year so far compared to last year, according to data available with the ministry of earth sciences. Last year, between September 20 and November 3, there were 33,500 fire points recorded in the state. During the same period, 39,000 fire points have been recorded this year. The meteorological conditions also resulted in the worsening of the situation since Wednesday. “There are two things that are happening together. North-westerly winds are bringing pollutants and wind speed has reduced. On Wednesday night and early morning Thursday, winds were calm so pollutants remained trapped close to the surface. After 9.30am, winds picked up for some time before calming again in the evening. We are not expecting a change in wind direction before November 10, when it may gradually shift to easterly, but during the transition of wind direction, wind speed usually falls, which can lead to further aggravation of air pollution,” explained Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Shrivastava said the maximum temperature in the Capital began falling since Wednesday as the smog-like situation blocked the sun.Pallavi Pant, scientist at the US-based Health Effects Institute, said: “We know that long-term exposure to air pollution can cause many of the health conditions associated with increased vulnerability to Covid-19. Air pollution can also trigger inflammatory response which can make it easier for an individual to catch a respiratory infection. Although there are no analyses from India yet, several early studies are now showing higher risk Covid-19 related infections and deaths in areas with high air pollution. In northern India, as air pollution levels rise during the winter, it will be important to stay alert.”Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary, United Residents of Delhi, an umbrella body of more than 1,800 resident welfare associations (RWA), said: “The air pollution in Delhi is at pathetic levels. So, this (cracker ban) is a good step. However, the government must also crackdown on violations in construction sites, increase the area covered under mechanical sweeping of roads and conduct a fresh review of polluting industries.” Criticising the Delhi government’s decision to ban firecrackers, including green crackers, the Bharatiya Janata Party said the government is looking at temporary solutions.“The decision to ban firecrackers during Diwali and impose a fine of Rs 1 lakh is wrong. You have hurt the religious sentiments of the people of Delhi,” Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-bans-firecrackers-as-air-quality-is-now-severe/story-yzlzGTHZnCBuavYfMlpO4M.html

06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Soon, homestays to come up in Morni||Haryana education and tourism minister Kanwar Pal on Thursday announced that the state government was planning to introduce a ‘home stay’ scheme for the promotion of tourism in the hilly Morni area in Kalka assembly segment. He said the Himachal government had started a ‘home stay’ scheme, under which any private house located in rural areas of the state in good condition and easily accessible will qualify under the scheme. Tourists can stay in units registered under the homestay policy. “After Shimla, Morni hills is the best tourism spot in the region...we are planning to start the home stay scheme in Morni on the lines of Himachal to promote tourism,” Kanwar Pal said in the Vidhan Sabha, responding to a question of Kalka MLA Pardeep Chaoudhary. The MLA wanted to know if there was any proposal to develop Morni as a tourist spot in Kalka constituency. The tourism minister said a proposal for paragliding was also under consideration. Kanwar Pal said a well-developed tourist complex, Mountain Quail, had been developed by the Haryana Tourism Corporation with facilities such as guest rooms, restaurants, lobbies, terraces and conference rooms. The minister added that the Tikkar Taal tourist complex had also been developed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/soon-homestays-to-come-up-in-morni/story-4ap00IWVqtGZp2X5T6Wj5N.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Day after Karva Chauth, broken pots, diyas greet visitors at Sukhna||A day after Karwa Chauth, the Sukhna Lake was found littered with pots and diyas that were used for the rituals on Thursday morning right at the entrance.Yogesh Sharma and Shama Sharma, who regularly come for a walk here, pointed out how the pots could be seen lined up on the stone parapet at the entrance itself: “People should be allowed to celebrate the festival at the lake, however, they need to be responsible and should clean up after themselves rather than littering the lake.”Saying that this had become a yearly occurrence, local area councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu said, “It is up to people to not litter after themselves. The lake in Sector 42 has been specially made for religious ceremonies where people could have gone instead.” He added that a ban on Karwa Chauth festivities on the lake is also not possible as it will be hard for the authorities to monitor people bringing even a single diya to the lake.Part of the lake is looked after by Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation Limited (CITCO) and part of the lake is maintained by the municipal corporation (MC). Chief general Manager (CGM) of CITCO Rakesh Kumar Popli said, “We had asked that the part of the lake in front of Chef Lakeview Hotel be cleaned before opening it in the morning.”MC medical officer of health (MOH) Dr Amritpal Warring added that sweepers had started cleaning the lake in the morning and by the afternoon it was all tidied up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/day-after-karva-chauth-broken-pots-diyas-greet-visitors-at-sukhna/story-kqQt8RKJmeOedzNFT93viJ.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s apni mandis: Tenders floated for sanitation, no call on resumption||The UT Market Committee has floated tenders for allocating sanitation work of the apni mandis/kisan mandis for the current financial year.The apni mandis are held in various sectors, though, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic these have been suspended since March this year.The development comes after the municipal corporation General House passed a resolution on October 29, recommending resumption of the apni mandis.While in line with the central government directions, the lockdown restrictions have been removed and most commercial establishments have been allowed to open, the administration has yet to grant permission to resume apni mandis.MC councillors at the meeting had argued that small farmers and city residents were suffering in the absence of these weekly vegetable markets.They stated that while most of the businesses, including shopping malls, cinema halls and pubs, had been allowed to operate, apni mandis were still closed, making it impossible for small farmers to have access to buyers. Even city residents were being denied cheaper vegetables in the absence of these markets and vendors were continuing to overcharge them, the councillors had further argued.“The recommendation of the MC House has been communicated to the UT administration. The final decision will be taken by the administrator in the Covid-19 review meeting,” said KK Yadav, MC commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-apni-mandis-tenders-floated-for-sanitation-no-call-on-resumption/story-CvskE3o9FaA6moFLpf83oJ.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||After plateauing in September, Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh on the rise again||After a noticeable drop in infections in September, the tricity is once again witnessing a spurt in Covid-19 cases with over 200 cases each being reported on both Wednesday and Thursday.Not only the last week, even the number of cases over the past three weeks has been the highest in Chandigarh among the three cities. Data by the UT health department shows that from the 316 cases between October 16 and 20, the number rose to 444 in the next week (October 23 to 29) and further to 502 in the last seven days since October 30 – a spike of 113%. “This increase in cases can be attributed to the complacency on the part of residents, who are not following safety precautions, and the increased testing as well. On Wednesday, around 1,000 tests were conducted which returned 94 positive reports. The number of tests on Thursday was 1,500 and 96 people tested positive,” said UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta.“With more people thronging public spaces in view of various festivals, chances of the infection rate growing further are high. Hence, lowering our guard at this point is risky. Following precautions, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and keeping hands sanitised, is crucial at this point in time,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, health, Chandigarh. Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of the community medicine department at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said the first wave, which hit the region in September, did not have a widespread impact with respect to the proportion of population.“Most of the population was not exposed to the virus due to the restrictions in place. Now, when every aspect of the economy has opened and the festive season is bringing crowds to public places, the precautions are going for a toss and cases are bound to increase. If around 30% of the population was infected so far, the remaining will also pick the virus in due course of time if precautions are not followed,” Dr Kumar warned.In Panchkula, the cases have climbed from 150 between October 16 and 22 to 236 in the past week, while the number was 156 in the last week of October – a jump of 57% over the past three weeks.“Yes, there is a steady increase in cases. With increasing crowds in the markets, irresponsible behaviour of people towards Covid-19 and the upcoming cold weather, the second surge is inevitable,” said Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula.Similarly, Mohali has also recorded a 53% surge in cases since October 16. From 268 infections between October 16 and October 22, it reported 409 cases in the last seven days and 312 cases in the week preceding these.However, the district’s civil surgeon Dr GB Singh said the cases being reported were scattered and there were no clusters. “Yet, residents should not be complacent with regards to the pandemic, as the threat still looms large. Adopting a careless attitude and not following precautions can be disastrous,” the civil surgeon warned.207 test positive in tricity, two dead A day after recording 203 cases after a considerable gap, the tricity reported another 207 Covid-19 infections on Thursday.Chandigarh led with the most cases at 96, followed by 61 in Mohali and 50 in Panchkula.Mohali and Panchkula also confirmed two Covid deaths, while there was no casualty in Chandigarh.With the fresh cases, Chandigarh’s case tally climbed to 14,794, of which 703 patients are still infected. A total of 60 patients were discharged on Thursday, increasing the number of recoveries to 13,862. As many as 229 people have succumbed to the virus in the city.In Mohali, the death toll rose to 242 with one more person losing the battle to Covid-19. Besides, the 61 new cases took the case tally to 12,659. As many as 49 cases were reported from Mohali urban, eight from Kharar, three from Dhakoli and one from Dera Bassi. Also, 39 patients recovered from the disease, bringing down the number of active patients to 594, while the recoveries increased to 11,823. A 45-year-old man from Devinagar, who also had liver cirrhosis, died in Panchkula, taking the district’s death toll to 117. Panchkula’s case tally stands at 7,314, of which 6,939 patients have been cured, leaving 258 active cases. Among the new cases on Thursday, 38 were reported from Panchkula urban, five from Pinjore, three from Kalka and one each from Hangola, Marranwala, Morni and Nanakpur.Five residential areas sealed in ChandigarhThe Chandigarh administration on Thursday declared five new micro-containment zones in the city. The affected areas are House Number 1185 to 1198 and 3556 to 3561 in Sector 23; House Number 3514 to 3521 in Sector 38-D; House Number 5571 to 5579 in Sector 38 West; House Number 257 to 264 in Sector 41-A and House Number 278 to 283 in 45-A.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-plateauing-in-september-covid-19-cases-in-chandigarh-on-the-rise-again/story-SpQJJ4B8T3GcbQoLDCOBjP.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||2008 UT employees housing scheme: HC seeks status report from Chandigarh admn||The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the Chandigarh administration to submit a report on the progress made in the 2008 housing scheme for UT employees.In March this year, the court had directed the Centre, UT and the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) to convene a meeting and take a decision on the scheme. However, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, it got delayed and was held in August. Now, two weeks have been given to the administration to file the status report.The court acted on a fresh application by the employees, seeking an update on progress in the scheme. The petitioners are demanding that flats be allotted at the same rates as asked for in 2008, within a time-bound frame. Now, the cost estimated by CHB has increased 5-10 fold. The housing scheme for administration employees was launched in February 2008. The draw of lots was also held in November 2010. But 3,930 employees, who were declared successful, have yet to get possession. The 3-BHK and 2-BHK flats are to come up in Sector 52 on 61 acres. The employees have opposed UT’s decision due to which the flats’ cost has gone up from the earlier Rs 34.7 lakh to Rs 1.76 crore in the case of 3-BHK, Rs 1.35 crore from Rs 24.3 lakh in the case of 2-BHK. Also, 1-BHK will cost Rs 99 lakh instead of Rs 13.5 lakh.At the August 19 meeting between MHA and UT officials, it was decided that the calculation of rates be made again for different categories by applying various factors like floor area ratio, collector rate, plotted area etc., in consultation with the representatives of the petitioners. Following this, CHB had planned to offer a 10-storey or seven-storey housing option to reduce the rates of flats, but this could meet with legal hurdles, as high rise buildings are not permissible in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2008-ut-employees-housing-scheme-hc-seeks-status-report-from-chandigarh-admn/story-wiK6pq91A4yrd1wrck8x6K.html

06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana Assembly: Private sector quota Bill passed||The Haryana Assembly on Thursday passed a Bill to provide 75% reservation in private sector jobs to local people amid objections by Congress and JJP MLAs. The Bill that was moved by deputy chief minister and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala was vehemently opposed by his own party’s MLA from Narnaund Ram Kumar Gautam who termed the proposed law as ‘divisive, 100% wrong and inane’. The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, aims to provide 75% of new employment opportunities to local candidates for jobs with a salary below ₹50,000 per month in private companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, and partnership firms, situated in Haryana. However, employers will also have the option of only recruiting 10% employees from a single district. The proposed law also contains an exemption clause in case suitable local candidates are not available for a particular category of industry. Criticising the Bill, JJP MLA Gautam, who has an acrimonious relationship with Dushyant, said: “ This is a free country and we are one. We do not want divisions. People from Haryana have the freedom to work anywhere in the country as do the people from Bihar, Maharashtra or any other state. Biharis contribute a lot as far as farming is concerned. How can we stop them from gaining employment in Haryana? This is a behuda (inane) Bill,” Gautam said. Congress MLA from Rohtak, BB Batra wondered how a chief minister of the BJP could allow such a Bill to be tabled in the Assembly. “The BJP talks of one nation and here is a Bill that is patently discriminatory and divisive. A similar law enacted by Andhra Pradesh has also been challenged in the high court and will be struck down. This Bill is also unconstitutional and will be struck down by the courts,’’ Batra said. Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda supported the private sector job quota but with a rider. “ The discretion given to the employer to pick a maximum 10% local candidates from a district should be done away with,’’ Hooda said. Congress MLA from Faridabad NIT Neeraj Sharma said the 10% recruitment restriction from one district was unfair. “People of Faridabad have given their agricultural land to set up industries. They also bore the harmful effects of industrialisation. So why should there be a 10% cap on employing them,’’ Sharma said. Batra, Sharma and another Congress MLA Dr Raghuvir Singh Kadian also pointed out that the Bill should have been handed over to MLAs five days before being tabled to help them study the provisions. Presidential assent will be required A replica ordinance approved by the cabinet in August was reserved by the governor for consideration of the President. Officials said the Bill passed by the Assembly on Thursday will also be reserved by the governor for the consideration of the President despite the fact that the government has modified Section 23 of the Bill, a provision which gives it an overriding effect over other laws.Section 23 of the ordinance provided the proposed law an overriding effect over any other laws, a broad provision having the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament. However, the same section in the Bill now provides overriding effect on any other state law. Constitutional issues raise question mark on Bill’s fate However, issues raised by the law and legislative secretary during the vetting of the proposed law still hold good, officials said. The clause providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana was also seemingly in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before the law and Article 19 (1)(g) which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-assembly-private-sector-quota-bill-passed/story-8QFHpkXYGo3saMB9PCcaBN.html
06-11-2020||City||Ulhasnagar traders seek dedicated parking space for shoppers||The traders association of Ulhasnagar has approached the civic chief asking to allot dedicate parking space for four wheelers in the markets to avoid congestion on the road this Diwali. The markets in Ulhasnagar including Gajanan market, Japani market, furniture market and electronics market are popular for shopping.Deepak Chhatlani, working president, Ulhasnagar Traders Association, said, “As the festival of Diwali is round the corner, a huge crowd will arrive from Kalyan, Dombivli, Thane, Bhiwandi and Karjat for shopping. Every year, the roads are congested due to lack of parking facility, especially for the four wheelers as people arrive with their families for purchasing. We have asked the civic chief to provide dedicate four-wheeler parking space.”The association, which has 50 small associations attached to it, claimed that last year also it had approached the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) but no arrangement was done. The association has asked for the Sadhu Vaswani Garden, popularly known as Gol Maidan, in Ulhasnagar for 15 days from November 5 to November 20 for parking of four wheelers.“Fifty per cent of the people who come to us for shopping complain of lack of parking space and sometimes they also leave without shopping. This has been affecting the business. Also, due to the lockdown, most of the people have faced a loss already. We want the civic body to support us this time. We are also ready to give security personnel from our side at the parking space,” added Chhatlani.The vehicles are parked on the road side leading to major congestion along the stretch and making it difficult for one to walk or ride.“There is no parking facility in the entire city even though it is popular for shopping. The roads are also narrow in most parts of the city. The civic body should make some permanent arrangements for parking of vehicles,” said Suraj Purswani,30, a resident of Gol maidan , Ulhasnagar.UMC commissioner Raja Dayanidhi said, “We have not taken any decision yet on this.”Meanwhile, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the shopkeepers’ association of Ulhasnagar have decided to make sure customers wore mask. If a customer was found without a mask, it would be provided by the shopkeepers.“For the safety and to ensure there is no spread of the infection, we will make sure people wear mask while they visit the shops. We have asked the shopkeepers to provide use-and-throw masks to the customers if they come without a mask. This will be followed strictly,” said Deepak Chhatlani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ulhasnagar-traders-seek-dedicated-parking-space-for-shoppers/story-kagpGQF3fNFJOsWGwvaX9N.html

We have not forgotten the role of Congress in triggering terrorism in the state. We represent 3 crores Punjabis of the state who support our ideology of development,” said party leader Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal.As per the seat-sharing system, BJP used to field their candidate from Ludhiana West constituency, which has an equal proportion of Hindu and Sikh population. With SAD parting ways with BJP, SAD is now looking forward to field its candidate from the constituency.In the 2017 election, food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had registered a comfortable win in a triangular contest. Ashu had got record 66,627 votes while Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Ahbaab Singh Grewal had got 30,106 votes and, BJP candidate Kamal Chatly could garner merely 22,620 votes.Sources in the party said that the protest was aimed at preparing a pitch for the election.

The 46-year-old “dreaded criminal” had killed the man to rob him of ₹25,000, which the victim had won in a gambling game.On December 29, 2012, police found the body of Ananda Sukale, 55, a Mathadi worker. Sukale was strangled and his body was dumped in a nylon sack near the Turbhe state transport bus depot in Sector 20.At the time, police had barely any leads and after months of investigation, they eventually filed an ‘A’ summary report before a local court notifying the case is undetected. The investigation was closed only to be opened in May 2016.The second time also, police failed to bring any evidence or working leads and again filed the same summary nine months later.An officer from the crime branch said, “The case was reopened the third time and they got lucky. Investigating officers said that while the witnesses were a few in the case, they were afraid to step forward because of the accused person’s criminal history. The demolition of a slum pocket located opposite the bus depot made the investigation tougher. It was finally an auto rickshaw driver whose help proved crucial in landing the accused in our net.”What surprised the police was that the accused, Dashrath Kamble, 46, also a Mathadi worker, was not only known to the victim but also had been staying in the same Sector 20, where he allegedly dumped Sukale’s body.At the time of murder, Sukale had won ₹25,000 in a gambling game. Determined to get the money, Kamble allegedly hatched a plan to kill him. On December 28, the two were in a parking lot in Sector 20 at around 2.30 pm. Taking advantage of the parked vehicles, Kamble allegedly hit him on the head with a wooden rod, said police.Using Sukale’s towel, which was around his neck, Kamble then strangled him and hid the body behind the wall which was covered with thick bushes. He then fled with Sukale’s money. He returned at 4 am the next day and loaded the body in a nylon sack, stole a parked auto rickshaw and moved the body to dump it near the bus depot.“We recently received a tip off about his possible involvement. We have four witnesses. He has at least 10 criminal cases against him and people in the locality were scared of him,” said Giridhar Gore, senior inspector, unit 2, crime branch.At the time of murder, Kamble was externed from the city. He had been externed from the city limits multiple times, police said adding that he has cases of robbery, theft, assault and also for possessing illegal arms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-police-crack-8-year-murder-case-after-two-failed-attempts/story-qh6P7c0kN9XJpI9nv2kW0I.html

The lab was started at Nerul’s Masaheb Meenatai Thackeray Hospital.As on November 2, around 50,363 Covid tests have been done in this lab. After Abhijit Bangar took over as the commissioner of NMMC on July 14, in the very first press conference, he announced the corporation’s plan to start its own RT-PCR lab.Till then, NMMC had to rely on government-appointed labs or private labs for Covid-19 tests.Mahendra Konde, public relations officer of NMMC, said, “The government-appointed lab was burdened with tests of other cities as well, which delayed reports and there was resentment from citizens of Navi Mumbai. In view of this situation, the Rapid Antigen Test, which provided a test report within half-an-hour was launched on July 16.”The lab has a capacity to test 1,000 samples per day and is said to the most up-to-date lab in the entire MMR.Bangar added, “In mission ‘Break the Chain’, the emphasis was on the three principles of ‘trace, test and treat’. In order to increase the number of tests required for this, along with the antigen test, the corporation needed its own RT-PCR. The best and most up-to-date equipment was chosen for the lab.”The lab conducts tests 24 hours, not just for Navi Mumbai but also for neighbouring Panvel and Thane as well, informed Konde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nmmc-s-rt-pcr-lab-touches-50k-test-mark/story-2TWOpkUyr80jhySu4jgLIL.html
06-11-2020||City||Man from Karnataka killed under mysterious circumstances in Kalamboli||A 31-year-old man was killed in a public garden in Kalamboli early on Thursday under mysterious circumstances. Police said the victim had arrived in the city to celebrate Diwali with his sister.Originally from Karnataka, Nagnath Male was staying in Pune while making a living as a daily wage labourer. A few days ago, he had called his sister, who lives in Kalamboli, informing her that he was visiting her to celebrate Diwali. His sister is also a daily wage labourer.Police said they were puzzled with the sequence of events leading up to the murder. The absence of other injuries has also led the police to suspect if the accused rendered Male unconscious before killing him. The police are also clueless about the motive behind the murder.Except for a few abrasions around his neck and strangulation marks, police have not found other injuries on Male. Officials suspected he was strangled with a rope.“We are waiting for the post-mortem report and also a forensic report to find out whether he consumed something before his murder. We have formed three teams, and each of them is chasing different leads,” said Satish Gaikwad, senior inspector at Kalamboli police station.The police are also studying the CCTV footage to make a list of suspects. Officials said Male was killed in the garden and most likely arrived with the accused. Police are investigating the involvement of people known to him.Ruling out robbery, police sources said Male did not have any valuables on him or cash except for a phone, which was not recovered.Male got married in May this year. However, his wife left him as he would often drink and did not have a job. Before moving to Talegaon in Pune, Male was working in Navi Mumbai as a daily wage labourer. Police said they have dispatched a team to Pune to establish if he had any recent dispute with anyone.Meanwhile, the Kalamboli police have registered a case of murder against an unidentified person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-from-karnataka-killed-under-mysterious-circumstances-in-kalamboli/story-OtRuipGb6KCQIIbLFxUljL.html

The two have three children.According to Shanti Nagar police officials, Nasrin left her husband’s house a few months after he lost his job and shifted to her parents’ house. The couple had regular fights over this before they were estranged.An officer from Shanti Nagar police station said, “While the accused was struggling to patch up his marriage, his wife’s boyfriend sent him his private intimate videos with Nasrin on Wednesday. The furious accused couldn’t control his rage and went to Nasrin’s parent’s house in Gaibir Nagar. He confronted her, after which a fight broke out between the two and he stabbed her with a knife several times. Nasrin’s family rushed to her rescue and admitted her to Indira Gandhi Hospital.“Meanwhile, the accused fled the spot but later he surrendered himself to the police along with the knife he used to stab his wife.”Nasrin succumbed to her injures during treatment. The police have booked Khan for murder under sections of IPC 302.As per the police records, this is the fifth case of woman being murdered by her husband in Bhiwandi in the last five months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-surrenders-to-bhiwandi-police-after-murdering-wife-over-extra-marital-affair/story-MMVc6AlVyKrVw9gjxLy4SJ.html

The minute the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) turns its back, the encroachers are back on the footpaths.The KDMC razed several sheds, extensions, handcarts, baskets and other encroachments on different roads in the city in this drive that began on November 1.The drive is being carried out on different roads every other day. However, it has failed to bring a major change in the scenario.Manish Chaudhari, 28, a resident of Tilak Chowk, Kalyan (W), said, “The hawkers clear the footpath when they see the team arriving. However, once they KDMC staff have gone, all the hawkers are back. Even the shopkeepers keep their items outside on the footpaths just to attract the customers to their shops. Not even a single footpath is free to walk in the city.”The hawkers alleged that the civic body did not raze the encroachments by shopkeepers and only focused on the hawkers. The hawkers and vendors claimed that the shopkeepers were allowed to remove the encroachments by themselves during the drive while the hawkers’ goods were forcefully seized.“The shopkeepers who had their sheds and other items placed on the footpaths were asked to remove it on the spot while our baskets of fruits and vegetables were picked up by the civic workers. This eviction was only targeted to trouble hawkers while the shopkeepers enjoyed all the liberty,” said Suhas Gupta, 38, who sells fruit at the Kalyan Station Road.Till the fifth day of the drive, KDMC has removed more than 100 sheds, carts, baskets , extensions from the footpaths across Kalyan-Dombivli.“The vendors and hawkers are obstructing the drive. They get violent at times and consume a lot of time. We try to take away the encroached items so that they don’t come back to the footpaths. Even if we have cleared a particular road, our employees keep visiting the road to ensure the footpaths are clear,” said a ward officer of KDMC who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hawkers-back-despite-kdmc-drive-against-encroachment-on-footpaths/story-6VAH3aUb6v2Q2V65wGeINK.html
06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Congress stages walkout over short duration of Haryana assembly||Congress, the principal opposition party in the Haryana assembly, staged a walkout from the House on the first day of the second part of the monsoon session on Thursday, demanding that the assembly’s sittings be increased. Trouble started after speaker Gian Chand Gupta introduced the business advisory committee (BAC) report that approved wrapping the session in two days. Leader of Opposition and the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda questioned why the session was being concluded in just two sittings and demanded that the duration of the session be increased to discuss hot-button issues concerning farmers. The speaker assured the Congress members, who were on their feet and some of them had trooped into the well of the House, that he will extend the duration of the sitting on Friday until the entire business of the day was over. The speaker Gupta said that if required the Friday’s sitting could be extended till late evening. But Congress MLAs refused to relent and din prevailed in the House. Hooda said there were hosts of issues, including the contentious three farm laws of the Centre, that needed to be debated in the House. Taking a dig at the Congress lawmakers, parliamentary affairs minister Kanwar Pal said the main opposition party was making noise in order to run away from holding a debate. The speaker again assured the Congress, saying: “I will give you as much time as you want for discussion...I will give you enough time...” Refusing to accept the BAC report, Hooda along with other Congress MLAs walked out of the House and the House adopted the BAC report through voice vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/congress-stages-walkout-over-short-duration-of-haryana-assembly/story-UkrWsOksAPEpsRNYthwWyJ.html
06-11-2020||City||Will restore Gaondevi Maidan status once parking project completed: Thane civic body assures High Court||Following a petition filed by a Thane-based activist against the underground parking project at Gaondevi Maidan, the TMC has assured the Bombay High Court that it would restore the historical ground to its previous status after the work is completed. The court had also asked the corporation to implement the Pay and Park policy across the city in the near future.The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) had proposed the first underground parking in the city to be developed below the Gaondevi ground, an open space in the heart of the city, the work for which began few months ago. Hundreds of vehicles, which at present have no space to park near Thane station, can use the facility.However, Thane-based activist, Mahesh Bedekar, had filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) last year against this parking project in the Bombay High Court in April this year. He claimed that while he had no wish to stall the project, the parking would destroy this prominent open space in Thane city.Bedekar said, “The corporation has given an undertaking to the court that it will restore the ground as per its previous status after the parking is constructed. Based on this undertaking, the court has disposed of the petition and asked us to file a fresh appeal in case the corporation did not abide by it. Not abiding by the undertaking will be contempt of court.”The ground is near the station and used by youngsters, children and senior citizens. It also has a historical significance as popular leaders have held rallies here for decades.The underground parking will cater to approximately 250 vehicles, which at present, are parked along the congested station roads, claimed the TMC.A civic official requesting anonymity said, “The ground will be restored after the work is completed. The parking is underground. After construction of parking, the soil will be backfilled over the top slab. It will be levelled with the existing ground level. We have already mentioned the same in the affidavit that we have submitted to the court.”He informed that about 40 per cent of the underground parking work is completed. The entire project will be completed by June 2021.The corporation had initiated a Pay-and-Park facility on 166 roads across the city. However, no agency took up the tender following which the policy was shelved.Bedekar said, “We have appealed to the court that the corporation implements the pay and park policy on the city roads. The court has asked us to follow this up with a fresh affidavit in future if the policy was not implemented.”The civic official added, “The decision regarding the revival of parking policy will have to be taken by the civic commissioner. We have tried several times to call for tenders for Pay-and-Park, however there was no response due to which it was shelved last year.”BOXABOUT THE UNDERGROUND PARKING** The underground parking will be developed on an area of 7,000sqm.** It will have space to park 130 cars and 120 two-wheelers.** This will be a Pay-and-Park parking facility and the first plaza near Thane station by the corporation.** The cost of the project is around ₹26Cr.2nd BOXPARKING WOES NEAR THANE STATION** No authorised four-wheeler parking available near Thane station.** Parking facility available only for two-wheelers which is operated by private player.** The parking rate varies from ₹20 to ₹50 per hour.** Gaondevi ground is reserved as a playground, so parking is strictly prohibited on this ground.** People who visit the station for shopping or catch a train face parking problems in the area.3rd BOXABOUT PARKING POLICY** In 2008, the TMC conducted an integrated traffic survey based on which the parking policy was formulated in 2014. The policy is based on National Urban Transport Policy, whose main aim was to free up roads for vehicles and increase parking charges to encourage the use of public transport.** The policy was supposed to be implemented in 2015. The corporation was supposed to start smart parking on more than 166 roads, wherein commuters will get information on vacant parking on their smart phones.** However, the corporation did not find any agency who was ready to provide smart parking facility in the city. Thus, the pay and park was stalled for years. The corporation is now contemplating to remove the smart parking and float tenders for basic pay and park facilities last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-restore-gaondevi-maidan-status-once-parking-project-completed-thane-civic-body-assures-high-court/story-wEuR7agMByOVqc1vgF5tYP.html

Even after the pre-monsoon repair works on this road, it had large patches of potholes, making it difficult for the commuters to commute.The KDMC had initiated the cement concretisation work of the 450m stretch under the funds provided by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). The cost of the project is estimated as ₹4.35Cr.Sapna Koli, city engineer, KDMC, said, “Eighty per cent of the work is done on this stretch and the remaining 20 per cent will also be completed soon. We plan to start vehicular traffic on this stretch by November end, once the work on the road is completed. The work on adjoining footpath will be carried out simultaneously.”Taking advantage of the closure of this road, the civic body also took the work of mastic asphalting on the 560m-long Anand Dighe Bridge, which is a part of F Cabin Road. The bridge also develops potholes during monsoon.“Two years back, we did mastic asphalting at the Waldhuni Bridge. As a result, it has not developed any potholes till date. Anand Dighe Bridge also needs asphalting. The work is being carried out simultaneously,” added Koli.Commuters claimed that a lot of work on this stretch was still pending, raising doubts over the month-end deadline.“The work should have been completed before Diwali as people would move out in large number and the traffic situation would be worse. Taking the other routes is a nightmare as they are longer and also congested most of the times,” said Sushil Pingle, 32, a commuter who takes the Kalyan Station Road-Patripool stretch to connect to east from west of Kalyan.Even though the road is shut, some two-wheeler riders are found taking this stretch to avoid the long routes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/direct-road-connecting-kalyan-west-and-east-from-month-end-say-kdmc-officials/story-6vjYyG0KfaeKW9tlxHkOpM.html

06-11-2020||Mumbai||‘Class 10 and 12 board exams not possible in Maharashtra before May’||Board exams for classes 10 and 12 are not possible before May, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, also adding that the state is planning on opening schools and colleges for classes 9 to 12 immediately after Diwali.The minister said her department wanted schools and colleges to open for older students immediately after Diwali so that the board exams and next academic year were not delayed. “Our department is planning to open schools immediately after Diwali for classes 9 to 12. The classes will be conducted either in two sessions or on alternate days, so as to maintain social distancing amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The students from these classes will be able to manage the pandemic protocol and there will not be any fear of the spread of coronavirus. We are planning to hold board exams for classes 10 and 12 in May and it is possible only if we start schools immediately after Diwali,” Gaikwad told Hindustan Times.According to officials from the department, field officers have suggested avoiding holding the exams in monsoon owing to difficulties in rural areas. “We can hold board exams either in May or after the monsoon, during September next year. However, pushing the exams to September will result in wasting another academic year, which we don’t want. To complete the syllabus, including practicals before the exams, schools need a couple of months. The preparation for exams, including setting papers, their printing and transportation, need another one-and-a-half months. All this is possible only if we start schools by the end of November,” said an official from the school education department.Gaikwad said schools for classes 1 to 8 would not be opened immediately. “We will begin with older students from class 9 and above in the first phase. For students from lower classes, online classes will continue as usual. The final decision about opening of schools will be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. We do not want to shut down schools again after their opening because of the spread of the virus as it happened in some other states like Andhra Pradesh and Delhi,” she said.The state government is expected to issue an SOP for schools and colleges on the lines of the ones issued for teachers, for whom 50% attendance has been made mandatory. Officials from the department said the decision will be taken for the entire state, although the local authorities will have the powers to differ depending on the Covid-19 situation. “Schools in remote areas with fewer Covid-19 cases were opened in July, but since it was against the Central government protocol of pandemic, we had to shut them down. This time, limited classes are allowed to open, concentrating only on board exams,” another official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/class-10-and-12-board-exams-not-possible-in-maharashtra-before-may/story-eRl567Oqym6386wo1ighAI.html

A woman has been arrested from Dhansoli for being allegedly selling illicit liquor. Sonepat’s toll rises to 34 With seven more people dying after allegedly consuming spurious liquor in Sonepat, the death toll in the tragedy that has been unfolding for the last four days rose to 34, officials said on Thursday.Two fatalities were reported from Sonepat city and five from Gumar village in Ganaur area of the district. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Virender Singh said seven people had died in the past 24 hours in Sonepat city and Gumar village.“The incident came to light on Wednesday after families of 14 people cremated the victims without informing the police on Monday and Tuesday.

06-11-2020||City||Arrests of Arnab Goswami and two others seem illegal, observes court; cops file revision plea||The Alibag police on Thursday filed a revision application in the Alibag sessions court against the magistrate order that sent Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami to judicial custody till November 18, said a senior officer. The revision application was filed after the chief judicial magistrate court late on Wednesday observed that the arrests of Goswami, 47, and two others, for allegedly abetting the suicide of a 53-year-old interior designer, Anvay Naik, and his mother in 2018, appeared illegal, while rejecting the plea of the prosecution for custodial interrogation. The revision application will be heard on November 7. The Alibag police on Wednesday morning had arrested Goswami, Feroz Shaikh, owner of IcastX/Skimedia, and Nitesh Sarda, owner of Smartwork. The prosecution sought their maximum police custody for further investigation. The plea was turned down by chief judicial magistrate (Alibag), Sunayana S Pingale, who noted that the prosecution failed to prima facie establish a link between the deceased and the accused. In her order, the magistrate said, “In view of the objections raised by the defence lawyers and grounds raised by the prosecution to seek police custody, the arrest itself appears illegal. After careful screening of the document, it appears that the connection between the incident and the deaths of two people, the connection between the deceased and the accused should have been determined before seeking police custody. Only if this chain of circumstances is intact, the connection of the incident with the accused can be established to seek police custody of the accused.” The court raised questions on the theory of suicide of Naik’s mother, Kumud. The court questioned that if the prosecution case was believed to be true, there was no reason established for the suicide of Naik’s mother. “Even if it is considered that, the accused had to pay money to Naik and the other contractors were pestering him for payment, he was depressed, the question remains why did his mother, Kumud Naik, decide to die by suicide or if she had died by suicide? The prosecution has no satisfactory answer on this issue. The chain of circumstances, between the death of Kumud and Anvay Naik, the reason behind their deaths and its connection with the accused is not completely established,” read the order in Marathi. The court also raised questions on decision for further investigation. The prosecution has failed to put forth grounds on why the previous investigation is incomplete and what issues remained for further investigation. “There is no prima facie intact chain of circumstances to connect the accused with the incident to send the accused to police custody. Hence, the police had closed the case for want of evidence. The said closure report has not been challenged or set aside by any higher court and is still in existence. In such circumstances, there are no reasonable grounds to remand the accused in police custody,” read the court order. In May 2018, almost a year after Republic TV was launched, Naik and his mother were found dead at their farmhouse in Kavir village of Alibag taluka. Naik’s wife Akshata, 48, had then registered a complaint. A suicide note was found, police said, in which Naik alleged that he and his mother were forced to end their lives because he was not paid dues amounting to ₹5.40 crore by Goswami, Shaikh and Sarda. After the case was closed by the local police last year over “insufficient evidence”, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in May 2020 announced a fresh investigation, saying Naik’s daughter Adnya approached him, alleging that the Alibag police had not properly investigated the case. According to the FIR in the abetment to suicide case, police claimed ARG Outlier Media Private Limited – the parent company of Republic TV – didn’t pay dues of ₹83 lakh to Naik for building Republic TV’s studios, called the Bombay Dyeing Studio Project. Police also alleged that Shaikh didn’t pay Naik ₹4 crore for his project in Andheri in MumbaI, while Sarda didn’t pay ₹55 lakh for his projects at Magarpatta and Baner in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/arrests-of-arnab-goswami-and-two-others-seem-illegal-observes-court-cops-file-revision-plea/story-QGpOXFBWrvTrw7EkMgMsxL.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid tally passes 1.7 million, govt appeals for cracker-free Diwali||As Maharashtra went past 1,700,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the state health department chalked out measures to prevent a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections during winter in Maharashtra. The state government has also appealed to people of Maharashtra to celebrate a cracker-free Diwali, keeping in mind that smoke due to firecrackers could create health issues for people suffering from Covid-19.The issue to ban firecrackers was discussed in the state cabinet on Thursday, however, no decision was taken on the ban. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the government may take a decision on restricting the use of crackers later. Although a discussion over banning firecrackers like done by a few other states, the state cabinet on Thursday stopped short of the decision. A few ministers reportedly suggested promoting environment-friendly crackers, instead of banning them completely. Tope said he was in favour of a firecracker-free Diwali this year, which would reduce air pollution and prevent a rise in coronavirus cases. Large-scale bursting of crackers during Diwali is known to increase pollution levels in the air, which adds to the discomfort of people who suffer from lung ailments. The state-appointed task force and death audit committee had, during its meeting on Thursday, suggested the ban on firecrackers. Following the cabinet meeting on Thursday, Tope said, “We appeal to the people to have a cracker-free Diwali celebration and we are confident that the people will cooperate for overall betterment of people’s health. The smoke due to firecrackers causes discomfort to people. In the backdrop of the coronavirus outbreak, we must have a cracker-free Diwali.”Over the past four weeks, the Covid-19 curve in the state has been on the descending limb. However, with winter approaching, health department officials and experts are unsure how the virus would behave in the season.HT on Wednesday had reported that the state-appointed committee on communicable diseases had submitted an action plan to the state health department. A winter surge is common for respiratory viruses, and many experts believe that the number of Covid-19 cases is likely to rise as temperatures dip.Tope held a meeting with the state-appointed Covid task force and death-audit committee to chalk out measures to prevent a potential second wave in winter like the one in European countries. The measures decided, according to Tope, include increasing testing and surveillance and identifying potential super-spreaders in the society and monitor them.“Key decisions have been taken in the meeting with members of the Covid task force and death audit committees. We will utilise the testing capacity of the laboratories and increase tracing. Surveillance on influenza-like illness (ILI) through fever clinics, especially during winters, will help us identify symptoms. Testing and check-ups of potential super-spreaders, who have a lot of interaction with various groups of people, such as milkman, maids, vegetable vendors, people working in public transport. They have to be monitored closely so that the infection does not spread rapidly,” Tope said, following the meeting.The minister reiterated that the chances of a second wave in Maharashtra are low, but further unlock measures and increased movement of people during the festive season could increase the chance of more cases. “The chances of a second wave are low in the state, but if we do not take precautions in keeping social distancing measures, do not wear masks, keep our hands sanitised, then the possibility of infection cannot be denied. In Diwali there will be a lot of crowding, people will move around more. Another factor will be winter, and virus multiplies faster in a colder environment,” he said.Meanwhile, the BMC has said that citizens should follow all safety precautions while celebrating Diwali owing to Covid-19. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “There is no restriction as such on celebration or bursting of crackers, but normal precautions that we are taking now is expected to be taken by citizens. We will issue standard operating procedures (SOP) in two days, if the state government issues the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-tally-passes-1-7-million-govt-appeals-for-cracker-free-diwali/story-OdF0qXKS0i31Usf08buigL.html

06-11-2020||Chandigarh||Tata Steel PGTI Players Championship 2020: Overnight leader Akshay continues domination on Day 2||After a superb eight-under-64 in the first round at Panchkula, Chandigarh golfer Akshay Sharma capitalised at his home course, Chandigarh Golf Club, on Thursday with a card of six-under-66, a second straight bogey-free round, on Day 2 of the TATA Steel PGTI Players Championship 2020 Presented by Panchkula Golf Club. With a tally of 14-under-130, the 30-year-old caddy–turned pro is on top of the leaderboard. Another Chandigarh golfer, Karandeep Kochhar, who was placed tied-fourth on Wednesday, shot the day’s best overall score of seven-under-65 to finish at tied second with a two-day score of 11-under-133. He was playing at Panchkula course. Bengaluru’s Chikkarangappa, a 13-time winner on the PGTI, was also tied for second as a result of his 67 in Chandigarh. Each half of the field has so far played a round each at the Panchkula Golf Club and the Chandigarh Golf Club. The next two rounds (third and fourth) will be played at the Panchkula Golf Club. The halfway cut came down at four-over-148 with 54 professionals making it to the money rounds. Akshay (64-66), the overnight leader by two shots, lived up to his own expectations of building on his lead in favourable home conditions. Akshay, currently 29th on the PGTI order of merit, went error-free for the second day in succession to extend his lead to three strokes. He came up with the best score on Thursday. Akshay made two long birdie conversions, a 12-footer and a 20-footer, on the ninth and 11th respectively. He also set up tap-in birdies with his exceptional chipping on the 13th and 16th. “The key to today’s round was the momentum earlier on as I started with par and birdie on the first two holes. I was expecting a low score today and I achieved that so it’s quite satisfying and puts me in a strong position. Importantly, I continued to find the greens and hit 15 regulations today following up on my 17 in round one,” Sharma said. “As the final two rounds are in Panchkula, where anyone can shoot a low round if they hit regulation. My focus will be on placement as it was during my first round in Panchkula,” he added. Karandeep Kochhar (68-65) gained two spots to move into tied second as a result of his 65. Kochhar was off to an explosive start with six birdies on the front-nine which featured conversions from 25 feet, 35 feet and three quality up and downs including one from the bunker. He had a brilliant run of four straight birdies from the fifth to the eighth. After a three-putt bogey on the 14th, Karandeep came back strong with birdies on the next three holes where he came up with some immaculate wedge shots including a chip-in on the 17th. The tall and lanky Kochhar closed with a bogey on the last which he attributed to wrong club-selection on the tee. Chikkarangappa (66-67), who was overnight sole second, produced six birdies and a bogey en route his 67 that placed him joint second along with Kochhar. There was daylight between the top-3 and the rest as Chandigarh’s Aadil Bedi (69) and Patna’s Aman Raj (69) were next best in tied fourth at six-under-138.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tata-steel-pgti-players-championship-2020-overnight-leader-akshay-continues-domination-on-day-2/story-kKD7rr99a5LxNrMkEuwMcN.html
06-11-2020||Delhi||Experts, residents agree: Relaxations proving costly in fight against pandemic in Delhi||Even as the Delhi high court cautioned on Thursday that the national capital could soon become the country’s “corona capital”, resident welfare associations (RWAs) and experts are urging the Delhi government to announce measures such as graded restrictions in public places, and roll back several steps taken to ease restrictions on gatherings at a time when the city can ill afford them.On Thursday, the number of daily Covid-19 cases remained high at 6,715 cases, taking the city’s tally to 416,653. What was more worrying was that this was at the back of relatively low tests (52,294) given the recent trend, pushing the positivity rate for the day to an alarming 12.84%.In recent weeks, Delhi has eased restrictions on weddings, public gatherings, interstate buses and cinema halls. Experts said this could be counterproductive given where Delhi stands in the Covid-19 fight -- bang in the middle of the third wave with the seven-day average of cases rising to 5843, higher than the peak of 4,174 it had hit in the second wave on September 17.“Epidemiologically, no expert would recommend such relaxations at this point of time. But, it is mostly political and economical in context,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at ICMR.“What the government should do now is to at least substantially reduce the time of interaction of people. This means timings of malls, markets, restaurants, pubs should be regulated and reduced. Cap on the number of passengers in buses and guests at weddings should be reduced. Besides, the analysis of the spike in Covid-19 cases has to be very focused because that is what will help the government do targeted testing. In markets, covid-19 testing camps should be massively expanded. At present, these camps are visibly inadequate compared to the inflow of visitors and are mostly located in obscure locations. If buses are opened up to more passengers, then at least 70-80% arriving passengers should be tested,” said Kant. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who convened a review meeting on Thursday in view of the increasing cases, said that the government will intensify “targeted tests” by focusing on high-risk individuals, which includes contacts of people diagnosed covid-19 positive, and by scaling up tests through mobile vans deployed in markets and crowded public places.Dr T Jacob John, a retired professor of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said the ideal situation would be to “reduce interaction of people” by putting in some curbs. He said the rising number of cases also implies that Delhi is not testing enough.Meanwhile, Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said that schools must be kept shut (which they are), and non-essential services such as cinema halls and restaurants (which have been reopened), should also be closed or heavily restricted for at least a few weeks.The views of the experts were echoed by RWAs.Mukesh Sinha of the Dwarka residents’ association said the focus should be on restrictions, rather than opening up, starting with restrictions and regulations in the city’s markets.“Today, images from Chandni Chowk were going viral on social media. The market was bustling with people owing to the festive season. Even in local markets people are seen wearing masks, but no social distancing is being practised. Also, there is hardly any presence of enforcement officials,” he said.A number of concerned RWAs have written to the chief minister and lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal requesting for a review of the Covid-related decisions and stricter enforcement of norms. Baijal is the chairperson of the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA).“We suggest a graded approach. The free flow and opening of all economic activity with no checks and balances sends a wrong signal to the populace, making them believe that things are under control, thus becoming careless. The Western world is again going into a lockdown. India cannot afford another economic shutdown. Therefore, necessary restrictions are needed to contain Covid,” read the letter sent by Save Our City campaign -- an association of civil society members, RWAs and experts - on MondayDelhi government spokespersons and the LG’s office did not respond to queries seeking comments.Over the last week, state heath minister Satyendar Jain has repeatedly rejected the idea of bringing back restrictions.“The virus is at the community transmission stage. When a city is in a community transmission stage, it is impossible to wipe out the spread of infection with any form of lockdown. It will probably take 2-3 months more for the Covid-19 vaccine to arrive here. So, till then the mask is the only vaccine and the Delhi government is conducting an intensive awareness campaign. Enforcement agencies have also been asked to intensify the crackdown against violators of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” Jain said last week.Experts are not sure these measures will be enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/experts-residents-agree-relaxations-proving-costly-in-fight-against-pandemic-in-delhi/story-uNC4y4zwmFCTBPqGnnRGUN.html
06-11-2020||Delhi||As pollution rises, CPCB advises offices to reduce vehicle use||As Delhi’s air quality slipped into the ‘severe’ category on Thursday, recording an overall air quality index (AQI) of 450, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) advised government and private offices to reduce the use of vehicles by at least 30% in the coming weeks in an attempt to keep the pollution levels in control. On Thursday, CPCB’s task force held a meeting to implement further action on the winter segment of the Air (Grap) to curb pollution. Directing enforcement agencies in Delhi and states in the national capital region (NCR) region to increase action against polluting sources, the task force advised the government and private employers to reduce vehicular usage by at least 30% in the coming weeks to keep the pollution spike in check. The CPCB advised that offices should encourage employees to work from home, go for car polling, and plan field activities in a way to reduce vehicular usage. Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB, said while these measures were advisory, this could go a long way in reducing rising pollution levels in the national capital. “It is a known fact that vehicular emission is a contributor in Delhi’s pollution levels. Since other sources are being checked by enforcement teams, we have advised that offices encourage their staff to reduce vehicular trips as much as possible. Even for the general public, we advise that as much as possible, avoid using your cars and motorcycles,” Gargava said. While Delhi residents welcomed this suggestion, many believed a plan to reduce vehicular use should have been made mandatory in offices till the pollution levels are controlled. “Advisories are rarely followed. The culture of working from home has been developed here because of Covid-19 and so the pollution control bodies should make it mandatory for offices to allow only 30% of its staff on days when the pollution levels are rising. If we can do it for Covid then why not for pollution; this is also harming us,” Neel Dev Rai, joint secretary of the North Delhi Collective Residents Welfare Association (NDCRA), said. The CPCB had last year too released a similar advisory, asking people to reduce the use of diesel cars as much as possible and urged employers to allow its staff to work from home. Gargava said the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has informed them that air quality will improve from Thursday evening, and the AQI is expected to settle in the ‘very poor’ category on Friday. He said the task force is keeping a close watch on the pollution levels. VK Soni, head of India Meteorological Department’s environment monitoring research centre, who was also a part of the meeting, informed CPCB that the sudden deterioration in the air quality was a result of an unprecedented reduction in wind speed, which could not be captured by the IMD model. “It was apprised that PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers) was the prominent pollutant (on Thursday). It was indicated that air quality is likely to improve from today evening due to increased wind speed and will remain in ‘very poor’ category for the next two days,” the minutes of the meeting read. After a central government ordinance dissolved the Supreme Court-appointed air quality monitoring body, Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca), the task of calling for the implementation of emergency measures listed under Grap will be on the CPCB this time. “Enforcement is in no way getting affected. We used to monitor the air quality and send our recommendations to Epca, and we continue to do it now to the union environment ministry,” Gargava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-pollution-rises-cpcb-advises-offices-to-reduce-vehicle-use/story-WXtYQXB3D53l78bQYGr8hL.html
06-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi air enters ominous ‘severe’ zone; local factors, stubble play crucial role||Local pollutants, weather factors, and a season-high contribution of stubble fire to the city’s air together pushed pollution in the national capital to the ‘severe’ throughout Thursday, with some areas perilously close to the 500-mark — the highest level on the air quality index (AQI) scale. In some areas, the levels of major pollutants exceeded the accepted safe-limit by eight or nine times.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that as Delhi collectively gasped for breath on Thursday, pollution levels in areas such as Anand Vihar, Mundka, Bawana, Narela, Vivek Vihar, Jahangirpuri and Dwarka spiralled out of control. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that while weather did play a spoiler for Delhi, local pollution sources also acted up. In a meeting with the CPCB taskforce the IMD said that the primary pollutant in Delhi’s air on Thursday was PM10 (coarse particulate matter), which is primarily dust. Stubble fires also contributed to 42% — the highest so far this season — of Delhi’s PM 2.5 load on Thursday, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) under Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.At 7am on Thursday, when the city’s hourly average AQI was moving upwards from 450, pollution levels in Anand Vihar and Narela were above 480. Bawana, Vivek Vihar and Dwarka were also quick to join the list with their hourly average AQI reading settling at 492, 488 and 482 respectively. In Anand Vihar, which is surrounded by two major inter-state bus terminals, the levels of PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) started climbing during the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. At midnight on Wednesday, the PM2.5 level in Anand Vihar was 507ug/m3, and though it consistently reduced through the night, it remained above the 300-mark. At 7am on Thursday, the levels were 385ug/m3. In west Delhi’s Mundka, the situation was no better. As winds calmed on Wednesday, the PM 2.5 levels around the area spiked to touch 567ug/m3 at 11pm on Wednesday. Data maintained by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (Dpcc) shows that at 7am on Thursday, the PM 2.5 levels in Mundka were recorded 416ug/m3, as against the acceptable standards of 60ug/m3. Shops owners around Mundka Metro station said the area was covered in a blanket of haze throughout Thursday. Despite the visible deterioration in air quality, industrial activities, private constructions and garbage-burning continued unabated, residents said. “It was like a scene from a Hollywood movie set in a post-apocalyptic world. The government claims that they are conducting high-level meetings to control pollution in Delhi, while all they need to do is fix the basics. The road here is broken, which means that any vehicle crossing from here pushes a cloud of dust all over. There is no check on industrial activities and open burning. Garbage is not picked up roadsides for days together and once or twice a fortnight, someone sets it on fire,” said RP Yadav, a businessman in Mundka. In residential areas such as Dwarka, dust became a primary contributor in Thursday’s pollution. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee’s monitoring station in Dwarka’s Sector 8 recorded a peak PM10 level of 902ug/m3 at 6pm, which dropped marginally, but remained above 800ug/m3 as of 9pm. In India, the acceptable standards for PM10 are 100ug/m3. In south Delhi’s RK Puram, the PM10 level saw a sudden spike after 4pm. Data shows that from 257ug/m3 at 4pm, the levels consistently rose to reach 659ug/m3 at 9pm. While locals in all of these areas complained of insufficient pollution measures by government agencies in these areas, enforcement teams continued to repeat their claims that action was being taken across the city to reduce pollution levels. The latest action taken-report submitted by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation shows that the agency has deployed 134 water sprinklers in their jurisdiction to keep dust levels in check. Jai Prakash, north Delhi mayor said, “Sprinkling was done twice on Thursday, keeping in mind the high pollution levels. Apart from this, 48 vigilance teams were also put into action to check for violations. From October 29 to November 3, we have issued 113 challans amounting to around R17 lakhs.” Experts said since weather conditions become unfavourable during winters, it becomes imperative that enforcement be made effective. “In Delhi, even though we have bent the annual pollution curve, we still have to reduce levels of bad air by 60% to meet the clean air standards for PM2.5. So, if you are still so high above the acceptable mark and you also have the unfavourable winter conditions, action needs to be stepped up,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-air-enters-ominous-severe-zone-local-factors-stubble-play-crucial-role/story-uRsCxc0mkq1OkXoFdn6f8K.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra awards industry status to hospitality sector||The state cabinet on Thursday awarded the hospitality sector the status of an industry. The decision is expected to help revive the hospitality sector, which is now eligible for various benefits including rebates in electricity charges as well as water and property taxes. “Today, the Cabinet has approved “industry status” proposal for hotels in Maharashtra. This is a landmark moment for the hotel industry. After reduction of pre-establishment licenses from 70 to 10, industry status will give much needed support to hotels,” tweeted state tourism and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday.Establishments classified as hotels by the Union ministry of tourism can avail benefits from April 1, 2021. An expert committee will finalise norms for other establishments over the next two months. Valsa Nair, principal secretary, tourism department, said, “There are 110 hotels, ranging between one to five stars, classified by the ministry of tourism. Since classification is not mandatory, many have not applied. To provide benefits to them as well, the committee will suggest norms which will be finalised by the state. Under these norms, they will have to apply online and after a field visit, further decision will be taken by the state.”With the status in place, eligible hotels will be charged at industrial rates for power supply, water supply, taxes and dues instead of the commercial rates that are currently applicable. Also, for additional floor space index (FSI), establishments will be charged at industrial rates.“We look forward to more global hotels coming to Maharashtra, with the state being the easiest to set up business in and the friendliest to run it,” Thackeray tweeted.State industries minister Subhash Desai said power tariffs at industrial rates would be a game changer for the hospitality sector. “It is one of the sectors that has suffered a lot due to Covid-19. The potential for job creation is huge in the services sector, particularly in hospitality. We want to revive the sector. All the facilities and incentives applicable to industries will now be applicable to hospitality sector as well,” said Desai. He also said that the government expects the benefits received by the sector to be passed on to customers, which in turn would attract more tourists. Riyaaz Amlani, CEO, Impresario Entertainment and Hospitality and member of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said the move would be a great boost for the sector. “It is definitely a momentous decision for the hotel industry. We have been fighting for this since over 25 years. Hat’s off to Maharashtra government. First, they reduced the number of licenses and now gave industry status to hotels. As of now, restaurants are excluded from it but we are hopeful that they will also be included soon,” Amlani said.To attract more investors, the state government approved the ease of doing business policy last month, bringing down the number of licences required to start a venture in the hospitality sector to 10 from the previous 70.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-awards-industry-status-to-hospitality-sector/story-Y6Wo4WCgYkRzqs4hEPhUuJ.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||No first day, first show as theatres in Maharashtra were not prepared to reopen||Theatres and multiplexes in the city could not begin the show on the first day, after the state government gave permission to operate theatres from Thursday, for the want of preparedness to adhere to the new standard operating procedure (SOP) in the view of Covid-19 pandemic.According to the theatre and multiplexes operators, the decision was announced on Wednesday, with barely a few hours left in the day and the SOP was issued on Thursday, the day announced for the opening. “There is huge arrangement which needs to be done before actually running the show. It was not possible within a few hours. We will start our Maharashtra operations from Sunday,” said Devang Sampat, CEO, Cinepolis India, which has nine premises across Maharashtra.Rajiv Patni, COO of INOX Leisure Ltd, said “We are completely geared up and prepared for the new normal, which would assign topmost priority to safety and hygiene and begin the operations soon.”Majority of single-screen theatres plan to start their operations from next Friday. “Filmmakers also need time to prepare for their release, and hence, we will open from next Friday,” said Nitin Datar, president of Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India.There are approximately 450 single-screen theatres across Maharashtra. The SOP mandated that the occupancy should not be more than 50% of the total capacity and that the seats that are not to be occupied be marked during booking.It asked multiplexes to ensure that their show timings be staggered so that there is no crowding and also ensure that intervals of different shows do not coincide. It also mandated that all patrons should be wearing face covers/masks and sanitisation needs to be done after every screening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-first-day-first-show-as-theatres-in-maharashtra-were-not-prepared-to-reopen/story-M8k1qZUrVQrpPVlwQqMtVP.html
06-11-2020||Delhi||Residents, experts welcome firecracker ban in Delhi; traders complain||On a day when Delhi’s air quality took a nosedive to reach severe levels, the Delhi government’s announcement to ban firecrackers came as a whiff of fresh air for residents. Environment experts also welcomed the move, saying this was the only way to prevent an impending air emergency ahead of Diwali. Menaka Ray, general secretary of South Delhi Residents’ Welfare Committee, said 53 parents of children below the age of 5 years had sent out a joint petition to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to take action against cracker bursting ahead of Diwali this year. She said the move has come as a relief to all those parents and many others. “My daughter was born with asthma and every year days before Diwali her condition worsens. Many parents like me are thankful for this move,” said Ray. Kejriwal on Thursday said the decision to ban firecrackers was taken after assessing the Covid-19 situation, which was made worse by pollution. Environment experts said while this ban shows intent on the part of the government, successful implementation can only happen with the participation of people. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said: “We need to be much more aggressive to control pollution. When you introduce such a ban, enforcement becomes tricky. People’s participation is of utmost importance now,” she said. TRADERS UPSETBut the news came as a shocker to cracker traders, who had already procured licences and had stocked up on permitted ‘green crackers’. “How can the government announce a blanket ban on all firecrackers with no warning? We had invested lakhs and now we are just left to fend for ourselves?” Tushar Ramdas, a wholesale trader said. Many saw this as a rerun of the 2018 ban by the Supreme Court, which had left hundreds of traders in the lurch. “Many traders sell their wives’ jewellery and take shops on rent. How will these people survive now?” said Hardayal Singh from the Rajouri Garden cracker market association. Senior officials said all 93 licences issued by the department for sale of green crackers are now cancelled. ENFORCEMENTA senior Delhi Pollution Control Committee official said implementation of the ban will begin. Delhi Police said they are awaiting for orders. Last year, police had arrested 261 people for selling or bursting illegal firecrackers on or ahead of Diwali and had registered 433 FIRs. They had seized 9,758 kilos of illegal firecrackers. Most of these FIRs and arrests had happened on Diwali night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-experts-welcome-firecracker-ban-traders-complain/story-mTPW7GVUH4yEsp9fU8x68I.html
06-11-2020||Mumbai||Will focus on better infra for films, says Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||In the view of the announcement of constructing a film city by Uttar Pradesh government, Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with film industry stakeholders and assured them of sops, including allotment of land for a bigger film city, setting up affordable theatres and dedicated theatres for Marathi films. Meanwhile, a day after allowing theatres to open, Maharashtra government has allowed auditoriums for plays to open following guidelines. CM Thackeray, in the inaugural session of a three-day webinar to discuss a policy for the entertainment sector in the state, took a veiled jibe at Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath and said that the state government would focus on providing best film productions facilities in the state. He also added that the state will work on setting up affordable theatres as well as dedicated theatres for Marathi films. “There are talks to take the Mumbai film city to Uttar Pradesh. Let them take it if they have capabilities. We will focus on quality and state-of-the-art production facilities,” Thackeray said.Speaking at the inaugural session of Panorama — a policy discourse webinar, Thackeray asked various stakeholders of the film industry to prepare an action plan for strengthening film infrastructure including post-production facilities. Filmmaker Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra pointed out the need for a bigger film city somewhere along the Mumbai-Pune expressway. He also called for affordable theatres for the common man. Marathi actor Subodh Bhave rues that Marathi films do not get adequate space in theatres.“We are going to make a rule to keep theatres reserved for Marathi films. We will definitely look for a flat piece of land for [film city]. We also need to prioritise our plans in the wake of Covid-19 as to what should be taken up first. My government will do all it can for the progress and growth of the industry, whose foundation stone was laid by Dadasaheb Phalke, in its birthplace,” Thackeray said.After another meeting with stakeholders from Marathi theatre, Thackeray allowed auditoriums for plays to operate at 50% capacity.Thackeray, who held a meeting with operators of theatres for plays and their producers, said producers of plays will have to remain cautious for their actors and audiences when auditoriums reopen as the threat of Covid-19 has not passed yet. The CM reiterated that London and France are seeing a harsher second wave, and the state government intends to prevent a similar scenario in Maharashtra.According to a statement from the chief minister’s office, Thackeray said, “The main difference between film and theatre is that the latter does not have the luxury of retakes. Therefore, there is a need to be extra cautious. Producers must carry out health check-up of actors, [actors should] maintain physical distance on the stage, maintain hygiene and cleanliness. Entry without masks should not be allowed in the theatres. Food stalls outside auditoriums must also ensure cleanliness and hygiene.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-focus-on-better-infra-for-films-says-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-e/story-Q0pgh7ScGNaFRwPHFaSCEN.html
06-11-2020||City||Posing as suitor, man dupes Ludhiana woman of ₹5.5 lakh||A 36-year-old woman was duped by a man, who approached her through a matrimonial website posing as a potential groom, and his accomplices, of Rs 5.50 lakh. According to investigating officer Lakhwinder Masih, the accused have been identified as Dev Kumar and Sunita of Mizoram, Mohd Aseem of Gurugram, Asha from Kanpur, and Mohd Aloudin from New Delhi. The complainant, who works in a private bank and is a resident of Rose Enclave, said that Kumar came in touch with her through a matrimonial website last year. Both of them began chatting. He told the victim that he was born in India and his parents had moved to the United Kingdom (UK) when he was very young. He expressed the wish to settle back in India. The complainant said that on January 2, the accused said that he was sending a parcel from the UK containing 1 lakh pound along with required documents so that she could buy a plot for them to build a house and live in after their wedding. After two days, Kumar’s accomplice Sunita, who was posing as a customs agent, claimed that a parcel had arrived and the victim would have to submit Rs 5.50 lakh to get it released. The complainant deposited the money in the account number shared by Dev. Two days later, Dev called the complainant and said that he had landed in India, and the customs officials were demanding Rs 8 lakh for releasing his valuables. Dev asked the complainant to submit Rs 8 lakh in the bank account immediately. On this, the complaint suspected something fishy. She tracked the previous transaction and learned that accused persons had withdrawn the cash in Gurugram. When the complainant called Dev and asked him the reason for duping her, he switched off his phone. The investigating officer said that a case under various sections of the IPC had been registered against the accused. He added that the police had information about the gang and its modus operandi, and they will be nabbed soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/posing-as-suitor-man-dupes-ludhiana-woman-of-5-5l/story-kKvRpMoWUN5YdbhrAPKGIJ.html

06-11-2020||Pune||Dinkar Kelkar Museum appeals to public for funds||The prestigious Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum, currently in its 100th year of existence, has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Closed for eight months, because of the lockdown, the museum has now appealed to the public to raise funds for its running and upkeep. In a message sent out to Punekars, trustees of the Raja Kelkar Dinkar museum, a heritage and history trove of 21,000 artefacts located on Bajirao road, have said it is currently undergoing its worst financial crisis. The management says it requires Rs 8 lakh a month to pay salaries of staff, and for other expenses. However, due to the lockdown, visitors are not allowed in and its grant from the government has also not arrived. Sudhanva Ranade, museum director, said that since March 17, when it closed its doors, the museum has been managing basic expenses from funds recived from well-wishers and aficionados. “The basic expenses are usually borne by an annual government grant for maintenance and rent and taxes, which amounts to Rs 64 lakh annually. This has been sanctioned duly by the government of Maharashtra, though due to the lockdown, the museum is still awaiting the funds,” said Ranade. He further added, “We need a minimum of Rs 8 lakh per month for basic expenses like salaries, provident fund, professional tax, telephone and electricity bill, and general cleaning. We need Rs 55 lakhs to run the museum per year and there is always a budget cut to the extent of 30 per cent. So the museum receives, on an average, Rs 42 lakh out of the total sanctioned grant. Along with the sales of tickets, the museum is run on the basis of these two revenue streams.” With generous financial support of some people, the museum was able to pay salaries for March, April, May and June, this year. “The museum definitely needs financial help from all walks of life and I request you to donate as much as possible to the museum,” Ranade, the grandson of Dinkar Gangadhar Kelkar, whose 125 birth anniversary is being observed this year, has appealed. The collection from the museum reflects the elegance of Indian craftsmanship as well the vivid imagination of the artists. It houses every day artefacts, which includes lamps, palanquins, carved woodwork, tin ware, combs, bowls, stones, musical instruments and miniature paintings from Peshwa era.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dinkar-kelkar-museum-appeals-to-public-for-funds/story-2b7BDe1H3SvNWBfDE0WbPP.html

Inspector Praveen Khanapure of Shirur police station is investigating the case.The woman has undergone surgery and is stable. The doctors are checking for injuries related to possible sexual assault, according to the police.“I was at home and had just finished dinner. Our granddaughter was with us and my wife took her to her mother, our elder daughter, who is married and lives nearby. On her way back home, after dropping our granddaughter, my wife went to this open ground which is used by people of the area for relieving themselves,” said her 40-year-old husband.The open ground where the woman was found is located near the road that connects the residential area with Nhavare village in Shirur. The woman was found by a young boy who lives in the area where the ground is located. The boy alerted the survivor’s nephew who told her woman’s husband.“I rushed to the spot. It was dark so I used my mobile light to see that she was lying there with blood flowing from her face. She was barely conscious. She said that a man had tried to grab her and she had shoved him away. She said he walked away and she couldn’t see when he came back because she had turned her back towards him.

06-11-2020||Pune||Lockdown effect: Rodents nibble away at wiring of parked vehicles||The Covid-19 lockdown had everyone house-bound, that means parked cars were left for a long period of time in the company of rodents causing massive damage to cables of vehicles.Automobile service stations across city are coming across dozens of cases where rodents - rats, mice - have chewed wires and caused damaged worth lakhs of rupees to the owners.Neeraj Bhide, a resident of Prabhat road, had to spend Rs 1,40,000 to replace wiring and radiator fan of his luxury four-wheeler.“My car was parked at Prabhat road for the three months. In May, when the restrictions were eased while driving, I came to know that the engine temperature of my vehicle is very high as the radiator fan was not working,” said Bhide, a working professional. It was the first time Bhide has come across to such damage to his cars.“If your car is standing for a long period then such damage happens,” explained Bhide.Ashwin Apte, who runs Apte Shri Auto Service, near MIT College Kothrud, said, “Such problem arises only when the car is standing at one place for many days. Generally, rats are found in parking areas and after lockdown, many of our clients are facing similar problems.”The rats have either eaten wires in the engine compartment or have chewed cable of air condition and seat covers were also damaged.“Out of seven cars which we get to repair in a day, four-five cars have a problem of wire damages. Price of every wire varies, but on an average minimum one has to spend Rs10,000 to fix the wire connection,” added Apte.Another resident of Mumbai, who came to Pune, also faced the same problem, though he was lucky enough to drive safely to the city before he came to know that the wires of the car were damaged. Since March 2020 when the first lockdown was announced, his car was stationed at his car-park at Mumbai’s Malad West, located along the suburban railway track.“After coming to Pune, the mechanic detected that there was a short circuit of wiring inside the bonnet which happened due to chewing of wires. The manufacture had stopped the production of this particular model and so I preferred to book a new car for delivery during the upcoming Diwali rather than getting it repaired for a high estimate that the auto-mechanic had offered,” said the resident requesting anonymity.Another auto mechanic from Pimpri-Chinchwad said, though rats are smaller creatures, the damage they cause is immense, particularly when the vehicle is parked unattended for a longer period. “Such cases have increased during the lockdown as vehicles were parked for a longer period. In the past too we have attended similar problems,” said, Mahendra Patil, an auto-mechanic.Rishab Pokarna, a resident of Chakan, who faced a similar problem is still clueless about how much he will have to spend to repair his vehicle.“I was not in Pune during till last month so from around May, my car was parked in the society parking. On Sunday (November 1) when I tried to restart my car, it did not start and I had to tow my car and now how many wires have been damages is still not known,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-effect-rodents-nibble-away-at-wiring-of-parked-vehicles/story-M0YYftJkMK4YFEzvGCLBNK.html

A total of Rs 11.90 lakh has been collected in fines. According to the excise department, the action was taken where hotel and bar owners were found wanting in implementing rules related to social distancing and other norms laid down by the state government. In Pune city, 66 establishments were penalised, while 39 were penalised in rural Pune and 14 were penalised in Pimpri- Chinchwad.Santosh Zagade, superintendent, department of excise, said that the violations related to maintenance of hygiene, non- conformance of social distancing norms, not wearing masks, no checking of temperature and a lack of sanitisers. “Diwali is around the corner and we don’t want to take any chances. We have urged the establishments to take necessary safeguards for protection against Covid-19,” he said. In action taken prior to October 6, the state excise department had imposed Rs 2.30 lakh in fines on 23 hotels for Covid-19 norm violations.Sanjay Singh, a bar operator from Aundh, said, “The excise department is carrying out raids to spread fear amongst the establishment for pecuniary gains. These raids must stop as it will ruin the industry.” The Maharashtra government permitted hotels, beer bars, food malls and restaurants to reopen from October 5. The state government made it mandatory for these establishments to follow public safety norms related to the Covid-19 and accordingly issued guidelines to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection due to unnecessary crowding of citizens during normal business activities. All hotels and other hospitality units have been instructed to take suitable measures to restrict any further transmission of Covid-19 while providing the services. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) aims to minimise all possible physical contact between staff and guests and maintain social distancing and other preventive and safety measures against Covid-19.The District Collectorate issued a fresh set of guidelines on October 7 which emphasise that the establishments have to ensure only 50 per cent customer seating inside the premises, strictly follow social distancing norms, wearing of masks, using sanitisers, hygienic housekeeping practices and temperature screening of all using thermal guns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/119-hotels-fined-for-covid-19-violations-rs-11-90-lakh-in-fines-collected/story-6TanzvOq89ttcsbn9emIWM.html
